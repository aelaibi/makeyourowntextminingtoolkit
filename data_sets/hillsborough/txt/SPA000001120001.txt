WJW/VS
Why has the A uthority decided not to support the officers?

       We considered the facts in detail, and it has been a very difficult
       decision. In the end, we felt that, given the many other competing
       demands on our financial resources, we could not justify making
       funding available on what would have been a substantial scale.


W hat does that mean fo r the officers?

       We recognise that this means that the former officers will be forced
       to seek legal aid in order to defend themselves, and that this will
       mean substantial personal contributions. We regret this, but are
       advised that under the legal aid arrangements they will not suffer in
       terms of the quality of advice available to them.


W i it         any effect on other officers?

       The Chief Constable has said that by not supporting the former
       officers, it may lead to a reduction in morale amongst current
       serving officers. We hope that does not turn out to be the case.
       Everyone must appreciate that in taking this difficult decision,
       members were acutely aware of their responsibility to provide the
       required level of funding for the force’s current needs over the next
       year.                 .. ..................... .......


Does si meen that the original su pp ort is v                  vn?

       No. in view of the undertakings given to the officers last year, it
       would have been unacceptable for the Authority to seek to change
       the offer now.                ......... .

Meeting to be held at South Yorkshire Fire and
  Rescue Service, Brigade Training Centre,
            Handsworth, Sheffield


                Start 4.00 pm



           CHAIRMAN’S AGENDA
1     Public Part of the Meeting


11    Welcome members.


1.2   There is one item of business before the Authority which is the
      provision of Financial Assistance in Legal Proceedings.


      Can I firstly ask does any member wish to declare an interest.


      [Hear declarations]


1.3   Exclusion of the Public and Press


      Bill will advise the Authority that the item is one which has been
      identified as one where the public and press may be excluded and
      explain the grounds.


      After Bill has explained the grounds.


      You should propose the following resolution:


      “In view of the nature of the report before the Authority I propose
      that under Section 100A(4) of the Local Government Act 1972, the
      public be excluded from the meeting for Agenda item 3 on the
      grounds that in view of the nature of the item it is likely that if
      they were present exempt information as defined in paragraphs 5
      and 12 of Part 1 of Schedule 12A of the Local Government Act
      1972 would be disclosed to them”.


      Ask for a seconder
      All in agreement
      Ask the public to leave.
2     Private Part of the Meeting


2.1   Introduce Garretts


      For the new members of the Authority can I firstly introduce the
      legal advisors from Garretts Solicitors who are advising the
      Authority in relation to the funding applications before the
      Authority today.


             Nick Painter
             David Harlock
             Alex Guy


2.2   Before I ask Nick on behalf of Garretts to introduce their report
      can I ask Bill will introduce the item


             Bill introduces the item.


2.3   Garretts


             Outline their report and issues to be considered


             One issue is whether HFSG are to be given the opportunity to
             make oral representations.


      Garretts advice is that HFSG should be heard but the officers are not
      happy about this.


      (Prior to the last meeting in February 1999, in correspondence Garretts
      indicated that HFSG would be invited to attend. The High Court in the
      Judicial Review proceedings questioned the appropriateness of HFSG
      attacking the funding of the officers).
    After the issue of HFSG’s attendance has been debated you will
    need to propose they be invited; this proposition should be
    seconded and vote taken.


    There may be a request for a recorded vote (3 members can require a
    recorded vote)


    Any member can ask for his vote to be recorded after a vote has been
    taken.


3   Representations (Expected at about 5.00 pm)


    Representations are expected to be made by the following:


    Richard Manning from Walker Morris Solicitors acting for Bernard
    Murray


    Simon Eastwood from Winkworth Sherwood Solicitors acting for David
    Duckenfield


    Trevor Hicks for Hillsborough Family Support Group (he may be
    accompanied by Ann Adlington Solicitor to HFSG)


    Either Bill or Garretts will introduce the representatives and indicate
    that they are invited to make oral presentations to the Authority lasting
    not more than 15 minutes. There will be no discussion on their
    presentations while they are present. Following their presentations
    they will be asked to leave.       -       -


    Once the representatives have left the room members will debate the
    issues for consideration.
4   The Recommendations/Matters to decide


    i)     Funding of Leeds Criminal proceedings up to February
           1999. Garretts advice is that if you are satisfied that the officers
           have acted to their detriment in reliance on the representations
           made to them that their reasonable expenses would be met,
           then they have a legitimate expectation that the Police Authority
           will meet their expenses up to 5 February 1999.


    ii)    South Sefton Criminal Proceedings/Potential Judicial
           Review


           The prosecution proceedings were initially commended wrongly
           in the South Sefton Magistrates Court. An order was made for
           the payment of the officers’ costs out of central funds. However,
           the Clerk to the Magistrates is arguing that the officers haven’t
           incurred any costs because the Authority is (or may) provide
           support. The Clerk hasn’t reached a final decision. Therefore
           Garrets recommend consideration of this application is deferred.
           If the Clerk refuses to pay the officers costs out of central funds,
           then the officers advisors consider the decision should be
           challenged by way of Judicial Review. They are seeking funding
           to bring such proceedings. As this is a potential action pending
           the Clerk making final decision Garretts are recommending that
           consideration of this application for funding is deferred.


    iii)   Powers Judicial Review - Against the Authority’s decision 5
           February 1999


           The officers seek the reimbursement of the costs which they
           incurred in these proceeding to the extent that they are not
           recovered against Ann Adlington under a costs order made by
           the Court.
                Garretts recommend that the consideration of this application be
                deferred as they may be recovered from Ann Adlington.


        iv)     DPP Judicial Review


                The officers seat reimbursement of the costs which they
                incurred in connection with these proceedings which challenged
                the decision of the DPP not to intervene to take over the private
                prosecutions.


        v)      Funding of the prosecution proceedings from February
                1999


                The relevant considerations to be taken into account in
                considering the funding applications are set out in Garretts
                report.


                You should take each recommendation separately. A
                decision should be taken on each of the applications in
                turn.

    This matter is being dealt with by:   Bill Wilkinson       Direct Line:   01226 772803

    To: All Members of the South Yorkshire Police Authority

    Dear Member

    SPECIAL MEETING TO CONSIDER REQUESTS                       FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IN
    CONNECTION WITH PRIVATE PROSECUTIONS                       FOLLOWING THE HILLSBOROUGH
    DISASTER

    I enclose papers for the meeting on Friday, 21 May. Can I remind Members that the meeting will
    be at the South Yorkshire Fire Brigade Training Centre, Handsworth, Sheffield. This is
    because the Centre can offer the right combination of accommodation that we will need on
    Friday; the configuration at Regent Street would not have been suitable, and other facilities in
    Barnsley were unavailable or unsuitable. There is plenty of parking space at the Brigade Training
    Centre. It is not a part of the county which will be familiar to many Members, but in fact road
    access is fairly good. I enclose a map showing the location and directions to the Centre. If
    anyone needs further directions, or transport to/from the meeting, please contact the Secretariat.

    The papers are extensive, because of the amount of background detail which is relevant.
    Garretts, our independent legal advisers in this matter, will be attending the meeting.

    Hillsborough Family Support Group

*     promised to consult Garretts on the issue of personal representations at Friday’s meeting.

    In view of the comments made by the Divisional Court with regard to whether it was legitimate for
    a prosecutor (such as the Hillsborough Family Support Group) to attack the funding of defendents
    before a criminal trial, whether in the criminal proceedings themselves or in relation to other
    proceedings, Garretts have asked the solicitor representing the HFSG to supply us with their
    views on why they believe they should be given the opportunity to be heard. The matter will be
    considered further before the Authority’s meeting and (in order to ensure that the process is
    procedurally sound) will need to be formally dealt with at the start of the meeting.

    If there is anything further you require, or if you have any queries, please contact me.

    Yours sincerely

1 DECISION OF DIVISIONAL COURT

The Court decided that a Police Authority has power “. . . but subject to ordinary Law
principles, to provide financial assistance to police officers and former police officers in
respect o f their costs and expenses incurred in relation to private prosecutions brought against
them and judicial review proceedings in which they participate.” The court refused to make
the decision specific to the two defendants. Furthermore, whilst clarifying the power to fund,
the court declined to state when that power should be exercised, that is, whether it should be
exercised at the start o f proceedings, during them or on their conclusion.

The Court also refused to set out matters which the Authority should consider or disregard in
determining whether or not it should provide financial assistance to officers. Indeed, to quote
Lord Justice Laws: “It is important that the declaration should not indicate any view taken by
the court, for the court has none, as to whether the financing should actually be provided.”

2. PREVIOUS SUBMISSIONS BY HFSG

HFSG continues to rely on the written submissions forwarded to the Authority on 22nd
December 1998 and 5th January 1999 with the exception o f those which touch upon the
legality o f the funding. The submissions relating to the fourth charge against Mr Duckenfield,
(attempting to pervert the course o f justice) are also irrelevant at this stage as the DPP has
discontinued that charge.

In particular, if the Authority decides that it has power to grant funding prior to any costs
being incurred, the HSFG relies upon Annex C o f its submissions o f 5th January (copy
appended). Annex C contains a summary o f the evidence on the charges o f manslaughter and
misfeasance.

3 RELEVANT MATTERS TO BE TAKEN TNTO CONSIDERATION

i)     As a primary submission HFSG strongly disagree with the Chief Constable’s
       contention that the defendants should have all their costs paid “up front”. Parliament
       could not have intended to provide for a system which is so open to abuse and
       manipulation. The previous conduct o f the defendants and their lawyers gives rise to
       serious concern. In the Judicial Review proceedings the Chief Clerk to South Sefton
       Magistrates provided affidavit evidence. In his affidavit he stated:-

        “The defendants’ solicitors each submitted their claims for costs in September 1998. I
        was extremely surprised at the level o f costs which were being claimed, particularly in
        view o f the fact that neither o f the defendants or their solicitors had actually appeared
        before the court in relation to this matter”.

        Any decision to pay costs “up front” would offend against public policy.
ii)    Availability o f legal aid or alternative sources o f funding

       The question o f the extent and scale o f the supply o f money from the public revenue
       for legal proceedings is a public and controversial issue. Detailed and highly regulated
       provision is made by the Legal Aid Act. A proposal to give police officers a more
       expensive and privileged facility at public expense than is available to others would be
       deeply contentious and socially divisive.

       The legal aid scheme is available to a defendant but not to a prosecutor. Section 1 o f
       the Legal Aid Act 1988 declares that its purpose is to establish a framework for the
       provision o f advice, assistance, and representation which is publicly funded with a view
       to helping persons who might otherwise be unable to obtain the same on account o f
       their means. According to Judicial Statistics for 1998, almost everyone who applies
       for legal aid for criminal proceedings is awarded it. If a defendant is ordered to make a
       contribution, the Court can remit such an order or order that any contribution should
       be repaid where there has been an acquittal.

       In addition, if press reports are correct, it would appear that the Superintendents’
       Association are prepared to consider funding the defendants if approached. The
       Association certainly contributed to their legal costs in the recent Judicial Review
       proceedings.

iii)   Whether the applicant for financial support has yet been found guilty or acquitted. A
       police authority’s funds should not be paid to an officer who is said to be criminally
       liable in his personal capacity. An officer who is later acquitted should receive his
       costs from central funds or from the private prosecutor. An officer who is later
       convicted should not be funded by the Police Authority.

iv)    The extent to which financial support from the Authority, during the course o f
       proceedings might preclude an award o f costs in those proceedings in favour o f the
       individual so supported. (It is clear from the assistance presently sought by the
       defendants that the Clerk to South Sefton Justices has not yet decided whether the
       defendants costs can be met from central funds.)

v)     The extent o f financial support previously granted to the defendants. During the
       Judicial Review proceedings, HFSG became aware for the first time that both
       defendants had their legal costs paid by the Authority throughout the 80 day inquest.
       Both had separate legal representation. The costs o f this must have been quite
       staggering, Families paid £3,500 each for block representation at the inquest. Further,
       the amount expended to date in the criminal proceedings must be quite considerable.
       It is clear that open ended funding encourages delaying tactics and costmongering.

vi)    responsibility to serving officers in South Yorkshire Police not to deplete the already
       overstretched resources o f the Police Authority.

vii)   South Yorkshire Police, presumably with the support o f the Authority has always
       accepted that the deaths o f the 96 victims were caused by negligence.

                                           Page 2 o f 3
viii)   South Yorkshire Police have accepted, or at least have never challenged, the findings
        o f Lord Taylor that the negligence o f which the defendants are accused was “a blunder
        o f the first magnitude” and an immediate cause o f death.

ix)     The negligence o f which the defendants are accused cannot on any view o f the facts be
        attributed to a “split-second decision”.

x)      The PC A directed in July 1991 that the defendants should face disciplinary charges o f
        neglect o f duty. Mr Duckenfield also faced a charge o f discreditable conduct. (At that
        time, Mr Duckenfield had been suspended from duty for two years.) Two weeks after
        the PCA direction, Mr Duckenfield, though suspended, went on “sick leave”. The
        Chief Constable retired him from the force on “medical grounds” in November 1991.
        The charge against him, therefore, lapsed In January 1992 it was then considered
        unfair to proceed against Mr Murray. Next year, Mr Murray, too retired from the
        force on “health grounds”.

xi)     The interests o f the defendants and the Chief Constable may be different in this case.
        It is in the interests o f justice that the defendants are represented by lawyers who are
        not paid for by a police authority whose Chief Constable has a powerful interest in
        maintaining exclusive control over so many documents o f relevance to the criminal
        case. Justice must be seen to be done.

xii)    The DPP has decided that there is a case to answer. The Divisional Court has refused
        to overturn that decision. This surely is an indication o f the strength o f the case
        against the defendants and undermines previous decisions not to prosecute.

4 FUTURE CONDUCT OF PROCEEDINGS

The Defendants are, o f course, entitled to legal representation and HFSG has no wish to deny
them access to proper legal representation. If the Authority does decide to fund them, then
strict conditions should be attached to the funding to ensure value for money. Checks and
balances have to be imposed. Regular reviews should be undertaken by the members o f the
Authority themselves.

                        M anslaughter and Misfeasance


David Duckenfield and Bernard Murray, then respectively a Chief Superintendent and
a Superintendent in the South Yorkshire Police Force, were on duty in the control box
at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, on 15Ih April 1989, when a semi-final of the F.A.
cup was to be played between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest football clubs.
Attached are chapters 1 to 5, 9 to 11, and 16 of the Taylor Report. The facts set out
therein form the basis of the allegations against the two potential defendants. These
extracts from the Taylor report are attached as A nnex D.

Other sections o f the Taylor report make other criticisms o f the police in general, and
o f other bodies.

Lord Taylor said at paragraph 265 o f his report;

       “The immediate cause o f the gross overcrowding and hence the disaster was
       the failure, when Gate C was opened, to cut off access to the central pens
       which were already overfull.”

The evidence o f forensic pathologists called at the mini inquests in 1990 was that in
almost all cases death resulted rapidly from unconsciousness that was caused by the
crushing that followed the inrush o f spectators, in full view o f the two men, following
the order to open the gates, and a failure to divert the incoming spectators from pens 3
and 4.

Mr Duckenfield was in overall charge, and primarily responsible for the decisions and
lack o f decisions which led to the crushing. Mr Murray shares in this responsibility. He
knew the ground better. He had been in an important position o f responsibility at the
identical semi-final the year before, when the Liverpool supporters were also at the
Leppings Lane end o f the ground. A similar concentration of supporters in the pens 3
and 4 had occurred but crushing had been avoided by the simple expedient o f diverting
the incoming supporters from the tunnel which led to those overcrowded pens.

In 1989, M r Duckenfield was entitled to call on Mr Murray’s experience. M r Murray,
like Mr Duckenfield failed, in breach o f his duty, to take, demand or recommend the
obvious steps to avoid the obvious dangers.

The decision to open the gates without taking steps to divert the oncoming spectators
was, in the words o f Lord Taylor, a “blunder o f the first magnitude” and was an
immediate (and therefore substantial) cause o f death. The decision was taken by
Duckenfield, with the agreement or acquiescence of Murray.
8     The witness statements already provided to the defence provide cogent evidential
      support for the manslaughter and misfeasance allegations, combined with admissions
      of fact made by each defendant in his various statements, and evidence to the Inquest
      and the Taylor Inquiry. Many exhibits such as videos, photographs, plans etc,
      gathered and prepared for the purposes o f the Taylor Inquiry by the West Midlands
      Police, are not to hand because the South Yorkshire police have so far refused to hand
      them over.

Some features o f the prosecution evidence already sensed.

9     In the course of, and after, the “ Scrutiny”, many statements became available to the
       HFSG which it had never seen before, because the South Yorkshire police controlled
       the entire archive o f statements and exhibits. The statements o f 35 witnesses have
       been served now on the defence, and show as follows. In 1988 police officers diverted
       spectators away from the tunnel leading to those pens, (eg Hilton). The unedited
       statements of the officers White and Lang prove the same, and suggest that it had been
       the practice of senior officers to ensure that the tunnel was closed when the pens were
       full, something that could be seen easily by Inspector White from the steps near the
       Control Box. This police evidence was suppressed until 1998. (The question of
       editing statements is discussed below.) In 1989, when the gate was opened, a rush of
       people carried spectators straight into the tunnel, and it was impossible to turn back
       (Cook).

10    There was no obvious alternative to the tunnel (Harvey, Murray, Fellowes, Southern. )
      There was no diversion away from this tunnel (Odger, Murphy, Langley). Spectators
      had to go with the crowd, for fear of falling underfoot. (Edwards). Spectators were
      carried by the surge o f people into the tunnel when Gate C was opened. (Anderson,
      Burns, Campbell.) The central pens in the terraces were packed at 2.50 pm (Blayney,
      Mullee). PC Guest said that at 2.40 it was not going to be possible to accommodate
      the crowd outside the Leppings Lane entrance in those pens. P.C. Walpole says the
      overcrowding was obvious at 2.55pm. P.C Brooks says the central pens were too full
      at 2.50pm.

The position o f the defendants

11    Duckenfield and Murray were in the Control Box. They could see the central pens.
      Closed circuit television gave them an even better view o f the pens. Five minutes after
      Superintendent Marshall had asked for help to relieve possibly life-threatening pressure
      at the turnstiles in Leppings Lane, Duckenfield, with the acquiescence and tacit
      support o f Murray, finally ordered the gate to be opened without closing off access to
      the already crowded pens. Thousands surged in: the deaths o f 96 people were the
      immediate and direct consequence. Murray had been on duty at the semi-final in 1988
      in the Control Box. He culpably failed in 1989 to give the proper and obvious advice.
      Duckenfield, in Lord Taylor’s words, “froze”. Both defendants admit their presence in
      the Control Box, and Duckenfield admits that he lied about matters shortly afterwards,
      saying the Liverpool supporters broke open the gate. It is a travesty o f the case to
      suggest that it concerns a ‘■‘'split-second decision.”
12    The CCTV film, and footage taken by the BBC, photographs and other videos of the
      circumstances, disclose full pens before the gate was opened, and a horrifying and
      obvious overcrowding after the gates opened. The BBC has provided the HFSG with
      good quality footage o f the disaster and surrounding circumstances.

Admissions made hy Duckenfield

13    Duckenfield does not dispute that he looked round the ground on I 5' April 1989
      (Taylor Inquiry, 24/5 p 116) in preparation for the match. He does not dispute that he
      appreciated the problems of tunnel and pens. He was aware of the central tunnel, (p
       118)

14    He accepted that fans were likely to gravitate towards the central tunnel, if they liked
      to watch the game from the back of the goal (24/5/89, p 119), and that the obvious
      way to the terracing was through the tunnel; anyone coming in would gravitate
      towards the tunnel, whether or not he wanted to go directly behind the goal. .

15    Duckenfield’s defence, at first, was that crowd management and filling of pens was not
      a police responsibility but that o f the club (120), but later he said he did appreciate the
      importance o f ensuring that there was no overcrowding in the pens. ( 124B). He said
      that officers at the back, that is, in the concourse behind the tunnel, should know the
      problems. Inspector White knew the location (127). Duckenfield’s own document
      emphasised that “our job is to ensure the safety of spectators” (137)

16    Duckenfield noticed by 2.30 that there was a concentration in pens 3 and 4 and asked
      the spectators to move forward and spread along the terraces. (25/5 page 1213). In
      performing his duties, he was acting on the “advice” o f Superintendent Murray (28 A).
      About 2.44 pm it was becoming clear that they were not going to get all the crowd in
      by 3 pm (33A-B). Duckenfield appreciated that opening gates was “likely to cause
      potential problems inside” (page 39).

17    Duckenfield conceded that when the second request came to open the gates, that was
      the time when he thought about where they would go. (4 IB). There was of course
      five minute between the first request and the command to open the gates. He knew
      that it was pretty crowded in central sections; and that the tunnel gave on to those the
      central sections; that they would want to get to positions as quickly as possible; and
      that they would take the obvious, easiest route to terraces. (25thMay, p 43G-H). He
      did not then think o f the tunnel. He might then have given instructions to close the
      tunnel, but he did not because he did not think o f the risk.

18    Duckenfield then conceded, however, that he had said in his statement “I watched the
      Leppings Lane terraces intently for any developments as a result o f the gates opening ”
      (47D-E) “I was concerned to see what the effects o f opening the gates and allowing
      people into the ground would have.” (47E-F.) “There was a possibility o f
      overcrowding everywhere.” (52G)

19    Duckenfield accepted that “I made a mistake but in fact other officers should have
      remedied that mistake by using their initiative.” (92B). He would have expected that
      an inspector or individual officers would have raced to the tunnel and taken action.
      (93B). (O f course, only those in the Control Box had sight o f all relevant parts of that
      end of the ground and the area behind the turnstiles).

20    On 26"' May 1989, Duckenfield accepted that it was important to warn police officers
      and stewards inside the ground that the gates were to be opened. Supt Murray took on
      the responsibility o f trying to contact Lock o f Sheffield Wednesday, (page 10-11). He
      also told Lord Taylor that he knew when Gate A opened that a serial o f officers
      formed a funnel to divert them from seeking to enter the stands, where entry was by
      special ticket. There were no such arrangements for the tunnel. This important
      evidence shows forethought about the consequences of opening the gates, and made
      the possibility o f crushing even more obvious.

21    The prosecution will invite a court to conclude that these admissions show gross
      negligence, causative o f death; and furthermore, they will submit that they disclose a
      wanton and perhaps angry disregard for the safety o f people in the pens, when other
      people, whom Duckenfield regarded as of the same ilk, were causing him a serious
      problem outside the ground.

22    If, alternatively, these facts suggest incompetence, and a very bad or crass attempt to
       avoid an already dangerous situation, attention is drawn to R v. Bateman (1925) 10
       Cr. App. R. 8, approved by the House o f Lords in R v. Adomako , in which
       incompetence in a person exercising specialised or expert functions was held capable
       of amounting to gross negligence (in that case the defendant was a doctor)


Evidence against Murray on Manslaughter and Misfeasance

23    It is submitted that the responsibility of Murray for manslaughter and misfeasance is if
       anything greater than Duckenfield’s. The following extracts from his evidence to the
       Taylor Inquiry and Inquest are relied on for the purposes o f the present review, as
       evidence o f these two offences.

24    Murray had occupied the same role in 1988 and 1989 and had written a report on the
      match afterwards, in May 1988. He had taken a leading part in policing a Hillsborough
      game between Sheffield Wednesday and Liverpool in January 1989. (Taylor Inquiry,
      31/5, p 63). ( His involvement was well summarised in cross-examination at Is' June
       1989, page 1, by M r Woodward: he had been involved in the 1988 semi-final; the
      review o f the 1988 semi-final; and the planning and preparation for the 1989 semi­
      final. A copy o f his review in May 1988 o f the 1988 game was read out at to him at the
      Inquest (Day 67, page 140)).

25    The pens were often filled up in accordance with directions from the Control Box.
      Officers would direct fans down the tunnel. This did not apply to the semi-final,
      however. No officers were briefed to keep a specific eye on the filling o f pens 3 and 4
      15/4. (31/5, p 67). Neither Duckenfield nor Murray gave instructions at oral briefing.

                                               4
Murray’s role was overall charge of the Control Room and adviser to Duckenfield.

Murray said his role was as “adviser” to Duckenfield. (68D-E). The policy was to let
the fans “find their own level” (75B). At about 2.30 pm, “I did not consider whether
there was room in any particular pen. I vyas looking at the terrace as a whole and the
North Stand and the West Stand.” Murray thought there were gates which supporters
used to move between pens.

Murray conceded that no instruction was given to close off the tunnel to any police
officers or stewards, and that there may have been four requests to open the gates.
(31/5/89, p 92). The request was to open the gates “in the plural” .

It is submitted that M urray’s account at page 93 G is in effect an admission to criminal
recklessness. He admitted at E, “When I saw the gates opened I was obviously
looking in that [pens 3 and 4] direction” . It was put to him that “the obvious place to'
for them to go was down the tunnel:

        “It is now that I know. I know the ground. I know where the tunnel is. I
       know where C gate is. I had never drawn any sort of realisation that people
       coming through C gate would go towards the tunnel, or whatever, I have never
       envisaged C gate as an entry gate of course, but the two things did nol register,
       did not tie up. It seemed so obvious after the event but certainly I gave it no
       thought and no realisation before.”

In cross-examination, Murray emphasised that he thought that fans could move from
pen to pen. However, he conceded that pens 3 and 4 filled up first because they were
popular; and they tended to fill up to the back ( 1 18D-F)

It is submitted that this fact makes his assertions that supporters could walk through
the gates between the pens meaningless and irrelevant, when thousands were pouring
through gates that had been opened to relieve a terrible and constantly intensifying
caish. Murray conceded to Mr Woodward, for South Yorkshire police, that at 2.46,
according to photographs’, the terraces looked “pretty full” . (1/6/89, page 3)

In answer to questions from Lord Taylor, Murray seemed to acknowledge that it had
been an option for the police to fill up the pens in series at the match (17)

At the Inquest, Murray accepted that he had full authority to take steps to avoid the
risk to occupants o f the ground as a result o f opening the gates, had he recognised
such a risk. (Day 67, page 3 1B-C). He would not have been dependent on
Duckenfield’s authorisation for any such steps.

Murray accepted at page 43D that the police “had a role to play as regards the
distribution o f spectators across the Leppings Lane terraces.” See also 45A. At page
48C, he accepted that the police had a duty to monitor the build-up and filling of the
terraces before kick-up. At page 56B-D, he accepted that “there may well have come a
time when it was necessary “ for him to divert supporters from the central pens. (It is
         the prosecution case that he should have put in hand this diversion in any event,
t        because the outer pens were sparely occupied).

    34   He accepted that if it had been brought to his attention that the central pens were full,
         and there was space in the side pens, he would have taken some action. 58D-E. It is
         the prosecution case that that fact was abundantly clear to anyone who looked.

    35   Murray accepted that he could have got manpower to block the tunnel in the five
         minutes that Duckenfield was considering the request that the gates be opened. (77D
         and 78A). He knew that the tunnel was in that part o f the concourse, (page 86C-87E)

    36   It is submitted that once it is shown by photographs, video recordings and television
         film that the pens were effectively full, or even nearly full, at the time the gates were
         open, the cases against both Murray and Duckenfield becomes very powerful. The
         state o f the pens was clearly visible from the Control Box and on the cameras,
         equipped with “zoom” facilities, in that Box.

         The nature o f the relationship between Murray and Duckenfield is not manifest from
         the evidence, but it may be inferred that there was at least coolness between them.
         Duckenfield was entitled to look to Murray for advice and support. Duckenfield had
         been promoted to a higher rank than Murray very recently. Murray was three years
         older, and more experienced at policing of this kind. The question by Murray, “Are
         you going to open the Gates, Mr Duckenfield?” does not show a warm or co­
         operative relationship.

    38   It is submitted that the Police Complaint Authority rightly recognised that the charge
         of neglect was “joint” . The reckless or grossly negligent decision to open the gates
         without closing off the pens was the responsibility of both defendants.

    39   The evidence becoming available, and previously concealed, about practices in 1988,
         adds to the weight o f the evidence. It suggests that other evidence exists, proving
         further the element o f foreseeability. However, even without that new 1988 evidence,
         and irrespective o f the belief that the South Yorkshire Police is guarding much more
         evidence showing gross negligence, it is submitted that there is powerful'evidence
         against both defendants.

    40   It is not proposed to set out further evidence, given by other police officers, about the
         conduct of the two defendants. The prosecution may call some o f them as witnesses,
         as they think appropriate after a review o f the Sheffield archive, once it becomes
         available.

    41   All these facts, drawn from the Taylor report and the available evidence, are to be
         contrasted with M r Daines’ inappropriate suggestion that funding by the SYPA was
         necessary to maintain morale among officers who had to make “split second
         decisions.”

Joint report o f the Clerk and Treasurer and the Chief Constable


FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

1     Purpose o f the Report

To give further consideration to applications for funding by two former police
officers in connection with private prosecutions and judicial review hearings, in
the light of the Divisional Court’s judgment of 31 March 1999,


      2       Recommendations

              Members are asked to consider the recommendations in
              Section 2 of the report attached prepared by Garretts, the
              Authority’s legal advisers in this matter.


3     Background

3.1   In 1998 two former police officers applied for financial assistance from this
       Authority to pay their legal costs in defending themselves against private
       prosecutions. This was granted,

3.2   The private prosecutions are brought by the Hillsborough Family Support
       Group (HFSG) for alleged offences arising out of the Hillsborough
       Stadium Disaster of 1989.

3.3   After taking legal advice, the Authority resolved on 5 February 1999 that
       its decision to provide financial assistance was null and void because of
       doubt about whether it was lawful to meet the officers’ costs.

3.4   The Chief Constable and the Authority co-operated in High Court
       proceedings at a Judicial Review to seek clarification of the law. On 31
       March 1999 the Divisional Court ruled that Police Authorities do have the
       power to pay officers’ and former officers’ costs in legal proceedings,

3.5   In the light of the judgment it is necessary now for the Authority:

       (a)    to revisit the decision of 5 February 1999;
      (b)    to consider afresh the applications of the former police officers for
             financial assistance to meet their legal costs and expenses in the
             private prosecutions;

      (c)    to consider their applications for financial assistance to meet their
              legal costs and expenses in recent judicial review proceedings
              involving decisions of the Director of Public Prosecutions;

      (d)    to consider their applications for financial assistance to meet any
              legal expenses incurred in recent judicial review proceedings
              involving decisions of the Authority to the extent that these are not
              reimbursed under the costs order made against Ms Adlington,
              Solicitor to the HFSG;

      (e)    to consider their applications for financial assistance to meet their
             legal costs and expenses in potential judicial review proceedings
             involving a decision of the Clerk to the South Sefton Magistrates
             Court,

3.6   The Process

      The Divisional Court judgment has clarified the Authority’s powers to
      provide financial assistance to police officers in respect of their costs and
      expenses incurred in relation to private prosecutions brought against
      them and judicial review proceedings in which they participate. This was
      the issue on which discussion at the 5 February meeting focussed.
      However, in giving the judgment, the Divisional Court pointed out that it
      was not indicating any view on the merits of whether financial assistance
      should be provided to the two former police officers as this was a matter
      for the Police Authority to decide subject to ordinary public law principles.
      The Divisional Court indicated that it thought that the Authority would
      revisit its decision of 5 February 1999 following the Divisional Court’s
      judgment.

3.7   Garretts were appointed to advise the Authority in January 1999 and have
      been retained to advise on the next stages. Accompanying this report is a
      detailed supporting paper, which outlines the history and background
      which has led to the applications for funding and identifies the relevant
      considerations which the Authority must take into account in coming to
      decisions on the various applications. Garretts report also considers the
      implications for the Authority and the former police officers of providing
      support in different ways.

3.8   Garretts have advised that the legal effect of the assurances given to the
      former police officers in 1998 that their reasonable legal costs in
      connection with the private prosecution proceedings would be met by the
      Authority is likely to be that the Authority is obliged to meet those costs up
      to February 1999, when the decision was reversed (subject to the
      considerations set out in Section 7 paragraph 7.6 of Garretts report).
3.9   With regard to the application for funding of the private prosecution
      proceedings after the 5 February 1999, Garretts report lays down a
      structured procedure which the Authority is advised to follow in coming to
      its decision, to ensure that relevant considerations are taken into account,
      at the appropriate stage in the decision process. In outline the procedure
      is as follows:-

      do the powers exist? (This has been confirmed by the Divisional
      Court).

      whether the Authority is satisfied that the former police officers acted
      in good faith in directing the police operations on the day of the
      disaster;

      whether the former police officers exercised their judgment
      reasonably, in the light of the circumstances they faced, and if not,
      whether other relevant factors outweigh this consideration;

      whether it is appropriate to require the former police officers to look
      to alternative sources of finance to pay their legal costs, such as legal
      aid, the Police Superintendent's Association or their own resources,
      given the likely adverse financial effects for them of seeking legal aid;

      the seriousness of the charges and whether it is appropriate to agree
      to provide funding, before a verdict is reached on them;

      the Authority's view on the merits of the charges;

      the impact on the Authority's resources of funding the former police
      officers costs and the “knock on” effect on policing in South
      Yorkshire {the Chief Constable will be present to advise on this at the
      meeting); and;

      the impact of a refusal to provide financial support on police morale
      and on the confidence of officers to exercise their judgment in
      difficult circumstances;

      (ifsupport is agreed) on what terms should that support be offered?

4     Financial implications

4.1   The Authority set aside £500,000 in reserves in August 1997 for potential
      expenditure in connection with the Scrutiny carried out by Lord Justice
      Stuart-Smith into reports that fresh evidence had been found relating to
      the Hillsborough disaster which had not been previously available. This
      earmarked reserve was subsequently allocated towards funding support
      costs to the officers and the legal costs of the Authority and the Chief
Constable in connection with the Judicial Review. The position regarding
the officers’ claims to date is covered in detail in Garretts’ report. In
summary the position is as follows:-

                                                                  £. (excluding VAT)



Chief Constable’s costs in connection with the Scrutiny           20,000

Estimated costs of the former police officers’ claims
to 5 February 1999                                               230,000

Chief Constable’s costs to conclusion of Judicial Review          74,000

Police Authority:     costs to 5 February                         42,000
                       costs to conclusion of Judicial Review     64,000
                       costs to 21 May                            30,000

Costs incurred to date                                           460,000
(subject to possible independent review of the claims)

Estimated additional costs of funding the former police
officers to the conclusion of the committal hearing               300,000

                                                                £ 760,000


Notes:

(i)      It is proposed that the officers’ claims be subject to independent
         review as to their "reasonableness”.

(ii)     Certain costs already incurred in connection with previous hearings
         may be recoverable from central funds and/or Ms Adlington.
         Conversely, the costs of the prosecution or other parties to legal
         actions involving the officers may, if the Authority provides support
         for those proceedings, be awarded against the Authority.

Subject to confirmation, therefore, the Authority would need to find a
further £260,000 to cover financing of the former police officers’ costs for
the committal hearing (with additional amounts for the former police
officers’ costs in the DPP judicial review, the powers judicial review, and
the South Sefton judicial review should the Authority choose to fund
these). It is recommended that a decision on whether to fund the criminal
proceedings to trial be taken only when the committal hearing has taken
place, so that the Authority can take its decision in the light of the results
from the committal.

At the time that the 1999/2000 budget was fixed, it was forecast that, at 31
March 1999, the Authority would hold unallocated reserves of £3.2m,
      equivalent to 1.85% of the budget. In addition it was forecast to hold
      approximately £5.7m in various Earmarked’’ reserves, set aside for
      specific purposes including Hillsborough related costs as noted above.
      These forecasts are subject to adjustment when the final outturn figures
      for 1998/99 are completed. There are no specific guidelines as to
      proper” levels of reserves, although unofficially many Authorities work on
      the basis that an acceptable level is between 2% and 5% of the revenue
      budget. In terms of unallocated general reserves therefore, the Authority
      is marginally below the lower end of this range, if the earmarked reserves
      are included the position is considerably more comfortable and equates to
      the upper end of the range.

4.4   The 1999/2000 budget guidelines were extremely tight, and necessitated
      the Chief Constable implementing a programme of budgetary reductions
      in order to keep the Council Tax increase to the Authority’s target of 4.5%.
      These reductions were in addition to the Home Secretary’s required 2%
      programme of efficiency gains, approximately one-third of which were in
      cash terms.

4.5   Making additional provision available, therefore, would have a direct
      impact on policing resources at some stage, either as a result of
      reductions needing to be implemented in the current year’s budget, or
      longer term reductions needed in order to restore reserves to their current
      levels if the additional costs were initially funded from reserves.

5     Chief Constable’s Comments - Operational Considerations

      The Hillsborough Stadium disaster of 10 years ago was the single most
      traumatic event in the history of South Yorkshire Police. Lord Justice
      Taylor’s interim report, 4 August 1989, attributed blame to individuals,
      groups of individuals and organisations. The Chief Constable at the time,
      Mr Peter Wright, accepted that share of the blame which Lord Justice
      Taylor apportioned to South Yorkshire Police. He apologised for the
      force’s errors and that apology was repeated frequently by his successor
      Mr Richard Wells. I do not hesitate to accept Lord Justice Taylor’s
      findings. The collective failure of the Force on 15 April 1989 was a
      significant cause of the tragic deaths of 96 people.

      Successive Directors of Public Prosecutions have examined all the
      evidence and have decided not to prosecute any person for any alleged
      offence arising out of the disaster. The Coroner’s Jury in Sheffield
      returned verdicts of Accidental Death upon the 95 victims who died on the
      day of the disaster. The 96th victim lived until 1993, after his death the
      West Yorkshire Coroner returned a verdict of Accidental Death. Lord
      Justice Stuart-Smith, a Senior Appeal Court Judge, conducted a scrutiny
      in 1997 into claims that fresh evidence had been uncovered. His report,
      published in February 1998, clearly stated that he had found no new
      relevant evidence. Following the report’s publication a private individual
      commenced prosecutions against Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray. Thus 9
      years after the disaster, and after many previous enquiries, two iong
      retired officers find themselves prosecuted for very serious offences.

      On the day of the disaster these officers were performing their duties for
      the benefit of the public of South Yorkshire. I believe they acted in good
      faith (the alternative is to say that they acted in bad faith) and I must
      consider the impact upon the conduct of the force if the Police Authority
      do not offer financial assistance to the officers to defend themselves.
      Police work involves the making of split second decisions which can affect
      a persons liberty and even their lives. If officers fear that they will have to
      pay their own costs in defending themselves against prosecutions, they
      may feel less confident in making difficult decisions, often in difficult
      circumstances. This particular case is an acute example because of the
      long passage of time between the incident and the prosecution, and
      because of the outcome of the previous enquires.

      I am aware of the impact upon the Authority’s funds that will be caused by
      paying the officers’ legal expenses. (Your Solicitors are putting forward
      sensible proposals to scrutinise these expenses should you agree to pay
      them). I would prefer that those funds were available to provide policing
      services in South Yorkshire today. However, the private prosecution of
      these two retired officers is relevant to today’s policing problems. A
      decision not to pay the officers’ legal expenses will have an impact upon
      the conduct of the force and, to that extent, will affect today’s policing
      services in South Yorkshire. In these circumstances I support the
      applications, subject to proper controls.

  Dear Bili

  FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR LEGAL COSTS;
  DAViO OUCKgNFfELD AND TREVOR BICHARD

  I refer to my letter of 3 March 19S8 and my telephone conversation with Miss Maureen
  Oades on 4 March 1588. I will try to provide the initia! information to which Miss Cades
  referred.

  Chief Superintendent David OucRenfield (retired) made mistakes on the day of ths
  Hillsborough Disaster. 15 Apnl 1SSS. He was cfearty called to account for these mistakes
  by Lord Justice Taylor's judicial enquiry. His errors were based on not recognising tha
  distress of football supporters on the terraces and allowing tha over-crowding tc continue.
  Others also contributed to the disaster but similarly failed to recognise overcrowding.

   in 1920 the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) directed that there be no prosecutions.
   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's Scrutiny Repcrt finds no fault in the process by which the OP?
   made his decision and says that no new relevant evidence has been adduced since 1930.

   In the eight years since the DPP's decision, mere has bsen no attempt to initiate a private
   prosecution! Some people's disappointment at me Scrutiny Report causes them tc talk of
   starting a private prosecution. I suggest that ycu agree with roe that David DucKenftad.
   acted in good faith.                                               '“ " ■

   You will also have an application from Sergeant Trevor Bichard. Ke operated the police.
   CCTV system on the day of the disaster. Some people allege that he lied about tha
   malfunction of the system in order to cover up police mistakes. These allegations are
   relatively recent. Lord Justice Stuart-Smlth considered them and rejected them. I suggest
   that you accept that Sergeant Bichard acted in good faith.

2     Chair to ask Bill to introduce Garretts


      For the new members of the Authority can I firstly introduce the
      legal advisors from Garretts Solicitors who are advising the
      Authority in relation to the funding applications before the
      Authority today.


               Nick Painter
               Alex Guy


2.2   We met to discuss the powers of a Police Authority to provide
      financial assistance to police officers in legal proceedings in
      February of this year. That issue has now been resolved by the
      Divisional Court. The purpose of today’s meeting is to consider
      the funding applications made by the two former officers and
      Garretts will take you through these applications in detail. The
      covering report from myself and the Chief Constable summarises
      the process. It includes provisional estimates of costs. Garretts
      have more up to date information on costs which they will
      address in their presentation. Your attention is also drawn to the
      comments of the Chief Constable and he will address you on
      these.


2.3   Garretts


               Outline their report and issues to be considered.


               One issue is whether HFSG are to be given the opportunity to
               make oral representations.


      Garretts advice is that HFSG should be heard but the officers are not
      happy about this.
    On the 8 January this year the Authority agreed to allow Trevor Hicks
    the opportunity to make an oral presentation to the Authority on the
    applications for financial assistance made by David Duckenfield and
    Bernard Murray. This has been confirmed in correspondence. Prior to
    the meeting on the 5 February Trevor Hicks was advised that if the
    Police Authority had the powers to provide financial assistance he
    would be given the opportunity to make representations on the merits
    of the applications for financial assistance.


    After the issue of HFSG’s attendance has been debated you will
    need to propose they be invited; this proposition should be
    seconded and vote taken.


    There may be a request for a recorded vote (3 members can require a
    recorded vote)


    Any member can ask for his vote to be recorded after a vote has been
    taken.


3   Representations (Expected at about 5.00 pm)


    Representations are expected to be made by the foflowing:


    Richard Manning from Walker Morris Solicitors acting for Bernard
    Murray


    Simon Eastwood from Winkworth Sherwood Solicitors acting for David
    Duckenfield


    Trevor Hicks for Hillsborough Family Support Group (he may be
    accompanied by Ann Adlington Solicitor to HFSG)


    Garretts will introduce the representatives and indicate that they are
    invited to make oral presentations to the Authority lasting not more
    than 15 minutes. There will be no discussion on their presentations
    while they are present. Following their presentations they will be asked
    to leave.


    Once the representatives have left the room members will debate the
    issues for consideration.




4   The Recommendations/Matters to decide


    i)     Funding o f Leads Crim inal proceedings up to February
           1999. Garretts advice is that if you are satisfied that the officers
           have acted to their detriment in reliance on the representations
           made to them that their reasonable expenses would be met,
           then they have a legitimate expectation that the Police Authority
           will meet their expenses up to 5 February 1999.


    ii)    South Sefton Crim inal Proceedings/Potential Judicial
           Review


           The prosecution proceedings were initially commended wrongly
           in the South Sefton Magistrates Court. An order was made for
           the payment of the officers’ costs out of central funds. However,
           the Clerk to the Magistrates is arguing that the officers haven’t
           incurred any costs because the Authority is (or may) provide
           support. The Clerk hasn’t reached a final decision. Therefore
           Garrets recommend consideration of this application is deferred.
           If the Clerk refuses to pay the officers costs out of central funds,
           then the officers advisors consider the decision should be
           challenged by way of Judicial Review. They are seeking funding
           to bring such proceedings. As this is a potential action pending
           the Clerk making final decision Garretts are recommending that
           consideration of this application for funding is deferred.


    iii)   Powers Judicial Review - A gainst the A u tho rity’s decision 5
           February 1999
The officers seek the reimbursement of the costs which they
incurred in these proceeding to the extent that they are not
recovered against Ann Adiington under a costs order made by
the Court.


Garretts recommend that the consideration of this application be
deferred as they may be recovered from Ann Adiington.


DPP Judicial Review


The officers seat reimbursement of the costs which they
incurred in connection with these proceedings which challenged
the decision of the DPP not to intervene to take over the private
prosecutions.


Funding o f the prosecution proceedings from February
1999


The relevant considerations to be taken into account in
considering the funding applications are set out in Garretts
report.


You should take each recom m endation separately. A
decision should be taken on each o f the applications in

1      PURPOSE OF THIS REPORT

The purpose of this report is to consider:

1.1   the judgment of the High Court on 31 March 1999, in response to the Chief
       Constable's application for judicial review of the Authority's decisions taken
       on 5 February 1999 ("The Powers Judicial Review"), that the Authority does
       have legal power to provide financial assistance to current and former police
       officers, so long as that power is exercised on normal public law principles;

1.2    the legal effect of decisions taken by the Authority in 1998 to provide financial
       assistance to Mr David Duckenfield (who was the Divisional Commander,
       then holding the rank of Chief Superintendent in charge of the police
       operations on the day of the Hillsborough Stadium disaster) and Mr Bernard
       Murray (who was the Sub-Divisional Commander, then holding the rank of
       Superintendent, who was also on duty at the match) in relation to private
       prosecutions alleging manslaughter, wilful neglect of a public duty and
       (against Mr Duckenfield) intentionally perverting the course of justice (the
       "Leeds Criminal Proceedings" and the "South Sefton Criminal Proceedings")
       brought by Ms Ann Adiington, Solicitor, on behalf of the Hillsborough
       Family Support Group ("HFSG");

1.3   the legal effect of the decisions taken by the Authority on 5 February 1999 to
       reverse the earlier decisions to award funding for the criminal proceedings to
       Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray;

1.4    new applications for financial assistance from Mr Duckenfield and Mr
       Murray to meet their respective legal costs and disbursements in the
       following proceedings:

       1.4.1     the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings, which were discontinued on
                jurisdictional grounds;

       1.4.2    the Leeds Criminal Proceedings which are continuing;

       1.4.3    the judicial review (the "DPP Judicial Review"), judgment in respect
                 of which was given on 31 March 1999, of the decision of the Director
                 of Public Prosecutions not to intervene to take over the conduct of
                 the private prosecutions referred to in paragraph 1.2 above which
                 resulted in the charge of wilfully perverting the course of justice
                 against Mr Duckenfield being withdrawn but no intervention in the
                 other criminal proceedings against the former officers;

       1.4.4    the Powers Judicial Review, in which an award of the former officers'
                legal costs was made against Ms Adiington (so that only the balance
                of their legal costs, after Ms Adlington's contribution, would be
                payable by the Authority if it grants the former officers' application);
                and

       1.4.5    a potential judicial review ("the South Sefton Judicial Review7") of an
                adverse ruling by the Clerk to the South Sefton Justices (should one
                be made) in respect of claims made for the payment of Mr
                Duckenfield's and Mr Murray's costs from central funds (which to
                the extent that the Authority is legally bound to provide assistance in
                relation to the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings would effectively
                be for the benefit of the Authority).


2     RECOMMENDATIONS

The Authority is recommended to consider this report, the appendices to it and all
other relevant material put to it and:

2.1   subject to being satisfied on the issues referred to in paragraph 7.6.7 below, to
       resolve to pay Mr Duckenfield's and Mr Murray's reasonable and proper
       legal expenses incurred up to 5 February 1999 in relation to the Leeds
       Criminal Proceedings and to request a legal costs draftsman to review the
       expenses claimed and/or apply to the court for an assessment of the costs
       under section 71 Solicitors Act 1974 so as to have those reasonable and proper
       costs determined;

2.2   defer a decision in relation to the costs of the South Sefton Criminal
       Proceedings and the South Sefton Judicial Review until the Court Clerk's
       decision in relation to the payment of Mr Duckenfield's and Mr Murray's
       costs from central funds is known;

2.3   defer a decision on the application for financial assistance in respect of the
       Powers Judicial Review, pending assessment and payment of Ms Adlington's
       contribution to those costs; and
2.4   consider the options set out in paragraph 9 of this report in relation to the
      applications for financial assistance for costs incurred in the DPP Judicial
      Review and, since 5 February 1999, in the Leeds Criminal Proceedings and if
      the Authority decides to approve financial assistance for those costs to do so
      on terms which limit the Authority's financial exposure.


3     THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER - KEY EVENTS FROM 15
      APRIL 1989

3.1   15 April 1999:    FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool Football Club and
      Nottingham Forest Football Club at Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield
      Wednesday's ground. Only six minutes into the game, play was stopped
      when it was realised that spectators on the terraces behind the Liverpool goal
      had been severely crushed. As a result, 96 people died and over 400 received
      hospital treatment.

3.2   17 April 1989: Lord Justice Taylor was appointed

      "to carry out an inquiry into the events at Sheffield Wednesday Football
      Ground of 15 April 1989 and to make recommendations about the needs of
      crowd control and safety at sports events".

3.3   17 April 1989: Geoffrey Dear QPM, Chief Constable of West Midlands Police,
      appointed to carry out independent investigation of the disaster and gather
      evidence.

3.4   19 April 1989: West Midlands Police assumed responsibility for the inquiry.

3.5   HM Coroner opened and adjourned inquests on 95 deaths that had already
      occurred as a result of the disaster (the death of the last victim to die, Mr Tony
      Bland, occurring at a later date).

3.6   4 August 1989:      Having head the oral testimony of over 170 witnesses
      between 15 May and 19 June 1989, Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report was
      made public. He found that the immediate cause of the gross over-crowding
      which had taken place, and thus of the disaster, had been the failure to cut off
      access to the central pens behind the goal (which were already over full)
      when gate C was opened. He found also a number of contributing factors
      including the Club's "confused and inadequate signs and ticketing", police
      planning, police operations on the day, "the presence of an unruly minority




                                           3
       who had drunk too much" and interaction of parties responsible for safety
       issues. In respect of police operations on the day, Lord Justice Taylor in his
       Interim Report, said (at paragraph 278)

       "although there were other causes, the main reason for the disaster was the
       failure of police control".

       The then Chief Constable, Peter Wright, referred the questions of
       manslaughter, by criminal negligence, to the Director of Public Prosecutions
       for a decision as to criminal liability.

3.7    15 August 1989:      Director of Public Prosecutions recommended that the
       matter should be subject of a criminal investigation. Mr Dear, Chief Constable
       of West Midlands Police, was invited to undertake this investigation. He was
       also asked that if he discovered any matters against the Police (Discipline)
       Regulations, he should enquire into them on behalf of South Yorkshire Police.

3.8    30 November 1989: Peter Wright, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police,
       offered in conjunction with insurers to open negotiations with representatives
       of the bereaved to resolve all bona fide civil claims for compensation without
       having to await the outcome of legal hearings.

3.9    15 December 1989: Agreement reached with representatives of the bereaved
       for settlement of civil actions without a decision as to liability.

3.10   December 1989: Full criminal and disciplinary investigation formally
       commenced.

3.11   18 January 1990: Lord Justice Taylor's Final Report was published.

3.12   31 March 1990:       Mr Dear's report was submitted to Director of Public
       Prosecutions.

3.13   6 August 1990: Two leading Counsel provide a joint opinion to the DPP
       advising that there was insufficient evidence to warrant prosecutions.

3.14   30 August 1990: Director of Public Prosecutions Allan Green QC, concluded
       that there was insufficient evidence upon which a prosecution for
       manslaughter, or any other criminal offence, could be brought against any
       officer in the South Yorkshire Police, or any other person.




                                             4
3.15   19 November 1990 to 28 March 1991: HM Coroner resumed inquests on 95
       deaths in the Hillsborough Disaster. Jury returned a verdict of accidental
       death.

3.16   7 December 1990: South Yorkshire Police Authority approved financial
       assistance for 6 officers including Mr David Duckenfield and Mr Bernard
       Murray in connection with legal proceedings relating to the inquest.

3.17   7 May 1991:     The Police Complaints Authority recommended discipline
       charges to be brought against Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and
       Superintendent Murray.

3.18   11 Tulv 1991:     The Police Complaints Authority directed that Chief
       Superintendent Duckenfield should face four disciplinary charges of Neglect
       of Duty and one of Discreditable Conduct.        In addition, Superintendent
       Murray should face one charge of Neglect of Duty.

3.19   November 1991:        Chief Superintendent Duckenfield retired on medical
       grounds, having been on sick leave for some time.

3.20   13 January 1992: Police Complaints Authority gave leave not to proceed with
       the discipline charge against Superintendent Murray, as it would be
       inappropriate and unjust to pursue the charge against him alone, in the
       absence of his superior officer. Sometime thereafter, Superintendent Murray
       went on sick leave.

3.21   26 August 1992: Superintendent Murray retired on medical grounds.

3.22   6 April 1993: The relatives of six deceased were granted leave for judicial
       review into the inquest verdicts. They sought certiorari to quash the jury's
       verdict.

3.23   5 November 1993: The judicial review concluded that the inquest verdicts
       should not be overturned.

3.24   December 1993: Inquest held by HM Coroner for West Yorkshire into the
       death of Tony Bland (the 96th victim of Hillsborough). A verdict of accidental
       death was returned.

3.25   5 December 1996: The drama "Hillsborough" written by Jimmy McGovern on
       behalf of Granada Television was broadcast to the ITV Network. Following
       this programme further material was submitted to the Home Office on behalf
       of the HFSG. That material related in particular to video evidence of the
       disaster and medical evidence about the time of death of the victims.

3.26   30 Tune 1997: The Home Secretary made an oral statement to the House of
       Commons during the course of which he stated:

                      "Madam Speaker, my Department, the office of the Attorney
                      General and the Crown Prosecution Service have considered
                      very carefully all the evidence which has been put forward in
                      recent months.

                      The Director of Public Prosecutions has taken the view that the
                      material so far presented to her would not justify fresh
                      criminal investigations. The then Attorney General also took
                      the view, again on the material presented to him, that any
                      application to the High Court for a new inquest would not
                      have any realistic prospect of succeeding.

                      Nonetheless, I am acutely conscious that the families of those
                                   '           j


                      who died at Hillsborough and many others including Hon
                      Members of this House are very concerned that unresolved
                      issues remain. I am determined to go as far as I can to ensure
                      that no matter of significance is overlooked and that we do not
                      reach a final conclusion without a full and independent
                      examination of the evidence.

                      I can therefore tell the House today that the Attorney General,
                      the Director of Public Prosecutions and I have agreed that it is
                      in the public interest that there should be an independent
                      scrutiny to ascertain whether there now exists any new
                      evidence relating to the disaster which was not previously
                      available. We are appointing Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a
                      senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal, for that purpose".

3.27   18 February 1998: Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's Scrutiny Report was presented
       to the House of Commons. He concluded:

       3.27.1   None of the evidence he was asked to consider added anything
                significant to the evidence which was available to Lord Justice
                Taylor's inquiry or to the inquests;




                                           6
       3.27.2   There was no basis upon which there should be a further judicial
                inquiry or a reopening of Lord Taylor's inquiry;

       3.27.3   There was no basis for a renewed application to the Divisional Court
                or for the Attorney General to exercise his powers under the
                Coroners Act 1988; and

       3.27.4   There was no material which should be put before the Director of
                Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints Authority which might
                cause them to reconsider the decisions they had already taken.

3.28   18 February 1998: The Home Secretary announced in the House that he, the
       Attorney General and the DPP had very carefully considered Lord Justice
       Stuart-Smith's report, and said "we have no reason to doubt his conclusions".
       Following publications of the Scrutiny Report, Trevor Hicks, the Chairman of
       the HFSG announced that he was disappointed with the Scrutiny's
       conclusions and that the HFSG were considering private prosecutions.

3.29   27 February 1998:     The Authority resolved to authorise the Clerk and
       Treasurer to consider applications for financial assistance from serving and
       retired officers in respect of possible criminal proceedings arising from the
       Hillsborough Stadium disaster.

3.30   5 March 1998: Application made by Mr Duckenfield for financial assistance
       with the Criminal Proceedings was approved.

3.31   24 Tune 1998: Informations laid in South Sefton Magistrates Court by Ms Ann
       Adiington that (i) Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray had each committed two
       offences of manslaughter and one of wilful neglect to perform a public duty
       and (ii) Mr Duckenfield had committed an act tending to pervert the course
       of justice (this charge was later discontinued by the DPP after being directed
       by the High Court to reconsider it in the DPP Judicial Review).

3.32   10 Tulv 1998:    The South Sefton Criminal Proceedings were withdrawn
       following a challenge to the jurisdiction of the court. The court ordered the
       costs of Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray to be assessed and paid from Central
       Funds under Section 16, Prosecution of Offences Act 1985.

3.33   13 lulv 1998: The Leeds Criminal Proceedings, alleging the same offences,

       3.36.1   To challenge the DPFs decision not to take over and discontinue the
                Leeds Criminal Proceedings;

       3.36.2   To challenge the decision of the Chief Clerk, South Sefton
                Magistrates' Court not to pay costs out of central funds should he
                decide not to do so (as he had indicated he was considering); and

       3.36.3   To make an application to strike out the Leeds Criminal Proceedings
                on the grounds that they were an abuse of process.

3.37   22 December 1998: Ms Adiington wrote to the Authority challenging the
       provision of financial assistance to Messrs Duckenfield and Murray.

3.38   5 Tanuarv 1999: Ms Adiington wrote to the members of the Authority to make
       further points on the alleged impropriety of the financial assistance to
       Messrs Duckenfield and Murray. Following receipt of the letter, the Authority
       appointed Garretts, solicitors, to advise it in relation to Ms Adlington's
       challenge.

3.39   13 Tanuary 1999: Following legal advice, the Clerk and Treasurer wrote to the
       solicitors for Messrs Duckenfield and Murray informing them that the issue
       of financial assistance was being reviewed.

3.40   1 February 1999: The DPP wrote to the solicitors for Messrs Duckenfield and

       provide financial assistance to Messrs Duckenfield and Murray, on the basis
       of advice from leading Counsel.

3.42   10 February 1999:

       3.42.1      Garretts, solicitors for the Authority, wrote to the solicitors for
                   Messrs Duckenfield and Murray setting out the Authority's reasons
                for its decision of 5 February 1999.

       3.42.2      The Chief Constable for South Yorkshire Police sought a ruling from
                   the court on the power of the Authority to provide financial
                   assistance.

3.43   11 February 1999: The Chief Clerk, South Sefton Magistrates Court, wrote to
       Messrs Duckenfield and Murray stating his provisional conclusion that, in
       view of the Authority's decisions (in 1998) to provide financial assistance, it
       was not appropriate for payments to be made out of central funds to meet the
       costs ordered on 10 July 1998.

       to challenge a decision of the Authority to withdraw the funding for the

                                            9
Meeting of the Police Authority on 1st August 1997

At this meeting, the Clerk and Treasurer and the Chief Constable submitted a
joint report informing members of the appointment of Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith to conduct a scrutiny into aspects of the Hillsborough disaster. The
Authority made the following resolutions:

" 2 - That approval be given to the provision of up to £500,000from reserves for
expenditure likely to be incurred in respect of the scrutiny.


2 - That approval be given to a commitment to provide financial assistance for legal
representation for officers (serving and retired) in connection xoith Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith's scrutiny in accordance xoith the principles set out in the Home Office
Circular 77/87 Financial Assistance to Police Officers in Legal Proceedings.

3 - That the Clerk and Treasurer be authorised to determine individual applications
for financial assistance in consultation xoith the Chief Constable".

Meeting of the Police Authority on 27 February 1998

Shortly after the presentation of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's scrutiny report to
the House of Commons, the members of the Authority agreed to consider an
item relating to Hillsborough. Assistant Chief Constable Daines gave an oral
report to the Authority on the findings of the scrutiny and advised members
that private prosecutions had been threatened against three of those who
were officers on duty at the time of the disaster. The general issue of the
provision of financial assistance to those concerned was addressed. It was
recognised that actual decisions about financial support could be made only
on individual application. Members were accordingly invited to delegate the
determination of individual applications to the Clerk and Treasurer.
Members resolved as follows:

"1 - That in the light of the findings of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's inquiry and his
comments on the outcome, members do not believe there is any nexo evidence to cause
them to reconsider the Authority's previous viexv, and remain of the opinion that the
officers acted in good faith.
2 - Tnat the Authority agrees to authorise the Clerk and Treasurer to consider
applications for financial assistance from officers (sewing and retired) in accordance
xvith the provisions of Home Office Circular 77/87, Financial Assistance to Police
Officers in Legal Proceedings".

Application of 28 February 1998 from Mr David Duckenfield

On 28 February 1998, Mr Duckenfield applied to Assistant Chief Constable
Daines for financial assistance from the Authority for legal representation.
On 2 March 1998, Assistant Chief Constable Daines wrote to the Clerk and
Treasurer asking him to approve Mr Duckenfield's request. At the request of
the Authority's solicitor, Ms Maureen Oades, Assistant Chief Constable
Daines provided supporting information on 5 March 1998 to the Clerk and
Treasurer. These letters are attached at appendix 1. Following receipt of this
letter, the Clerk and Treasurer approved Mr Duckenfield's application for
financial assistance towards the costs of legal representation in the event of a
private prosecution being brought against him in connection with the
Hillsborough disaster.


Meeting of the Police Authority on 24 April 1998

On 24 April, the Chief Constable and Clerk and Treasurer submitted a joint
report to members requesting that members note the expenditure of £11,900
on the Chief Constable's costs in connection with the Scrutinv from the
earmarked reserve and requesting members to agree that the earmarked
reserve continue to be held for purposes related to the Hillsborough disaster.
The Authority resolved as follows:


"2 - That the use of the funds to date be noted.

2 - That the Authority agree, for the time being, to maintain the earmarked reserve
for future costs associated xvith the Hillsborough Stadium disaster, subject to periodic
reports on expenditure from the resewe".

Application of 28 June 1998 from Mr Murray

By letter dated 28 June 1998, Mr Murray informed the Chief Constable that
his wife had accepted a summons on his behalf arising from the events of the
Hillsborough disaster and requested that the Police Authority reimburse any
legal expenses that he may incur in defending himself. The next day,
Assistant Chief Constable Daines wrote to the Clerk and Treasurer setting out
the reasons for his support of Mr Murray's application and the application
was approved by the Clerk and Treasurer that day. (Copies of these letters
are attached at appendix 2 to this report.)


The Clerk and Treasurer's decisions

In approving both of these applications, the Clerk and Treasurer consulted
the Authority's legal advisor and took into account a number of
considerations which were detailed in the Garretts' report which the
Authority considered at its meeting on 5 February 1999. (Appendix 3).

Challenge by Ms Adiington

On 22 December 1998, following a report by the BBC that the Authority had
agreed to pay the legal costs of Messrs Duckenfield and Murray, Ms
Adiington wrote, on behalf of the HFSG, to the Clerk and Treasurer to the
Authority (appendix 4) challenging the Authority's power to provide such
assistance on a number of grounds, including the following:


•       that there was no legal power under statute for the Authority to pay
        the legal costs of a police officer (serving or former) in relation to
        criminal proceedings against him /her (a view dismissed by the Court
        in the subsequent Powers Judicial Review); and

•       that even if such power existed, it had been exercised improperly in
        this case as the Authority had taken into account a number of
        irrelevant considerations, ignored a number of relevant considerations
        and delegated powers, which it should itself have exercised, to the
        Clerk and Treasurer.

Legal advice received by the Authority

4.9.1    On 5 January 1999, the solicitor to the Authority sought preliminary
         advice from barrister, Mr Bernard Phillips. He confirmed that the
         general principle of whether to afford assistance at all was a matter
         for the discretion of the Authority. In the light of the representations
         received from Ms Adiington, however, he believed that the decision
         should be reconsidered by the Authority.
4.9.2   On 5 January 1999 Ms Adlington wrote a further letter to all the
        members of the Authority (in appendix 5) making additional points
        about the propriety of the decision to make financial assistance
        available to the officers. She subsequently supplemented that letter
        with a fax to Garretts, the solicitors instructed by the Authority,
        dated 29 January 1999 (appendix 6).

4.9.3   On 12 January 1999 the solicitor to the Authority' took legal advice on
        the two letters received from Ms Adlington from Leading Counsel,
        Richard Mawrey QC.

4.9.4   His advice was that there was a power to provide financial assistance
        to police officers in legal proceedings. However, this could only be
        exercised in appropriate circumstances and only to cover "out of
        pocket" expenses (but not expenditure which would otherwise be
        paid from central funds or by the Legal Aid Board). He added that
        the HFSG might seek to challenge the procedure by which such
        powers had been exercised because it covered more than "out of
        pocket" expenditure, with some prospect of success and that
        accordingly the Authority should be asked to reconsider its original
        decision in order to ensure it took take account of all relevant
        considerations, including those Ms Adlington alleges might have
        been overlooked earlier.

4.9.5   On 15 January 1999, the Authority instructed Garretts, solicitors, to
        advise the Authority in reconsidering its decision to make financial
        assistance available to the officers for the criminal proceedings and
        considering the new applications for financial support for judicial
        review proceedings. Garretts, whose advice is also referred to below
        in more detail, expressed its own concern about the statutory power
        to give financial support to officers in these circumstances and
        recommended that a second opinion be sought from Miss Presiley
        Baxendale QC and Mr Mark Shaw.

        Counsel advised that whilst they had initially been attracted by the
        argument that the Authority had power to pay "out of pocket" legal
        costs and expenses of officers in all types of proceedings, where they
        had acted in good faith and it was otherwise appropriate, there were
        powerful arguments against this interpretation, particularly in the
        light of the relevant case law in respect of public authorities'



                                   13
                  ancillary powers to incur expenditure to facilitate the discharge of
                  their principal functions.

       4.9.7      Counsel stressed that they had both found this issue difficult and
                  that there was no guarantee which way a Court would decide.
                 There were certainly strong policy reasons why the Authority should
                 have power to support its officers (current and former) in this way.

       4.9.8     Accordingly, their recommendation was that the Authority should
                 resolve that it has no power to provide the financial assistance which
                 had been sought. It should then co-operate with the Chief Constable
                 in bringing the matter before a court for an early decision on whether
                 that view of their legal powers was correct.

4.10   Decision of the Police Authority on 5 February 1999

       4.10.1    On 5 February, in addition to the legal advice received, the Authority
                 considered a report from the Chief Constable and submissions and
                 presentations from:

       •        Mr T Hicks and Ms A Adlington on behalf of the Hillsborough Family
                Support Group;


       •        Mr S Eastwood of Winckworth Sherwood, Solicitors on behalf of Mr
                Duckenfield; and


       •        Mr R Manning of Walker Morris, Solicitors on behalf of Mr Murray.


       4.10.2    Following consideration of the reports and representations made to
                 it, the Authority resolved as follows:

                 "1 - In the light of legal advice, including advice from leading Counsel, that
                 on balance, the Authority has no legal power to provide financial assistance
                 to Mr D Duckenfield or Mr B Murray of South Yorkshire Police in relation
                 to their costs and expenses of defending the private prosecutions brought
                 against them by the Hillsborough Family Support Group, by Information
                 dated 10 July 1998 and accordingly to determine that any previous decision
                 of the Authority or any officer acting under its Authority, to make such
                 assistance available is null and void.




                                               14
                2 - In the light of legal advice, including advice from lending Counsel, tint,
                011   balance, the Authority has no legal power to provide financial assistance
                to Mr D Duckenfield or Mr B Murray in relation to the costs of any judicial
                review proceedings brought by either of them whether relating to the
                decision of the Crozon Prosecutions Service, not to take over the conduct of
                the private prosecutions and discontinue such prosecutions, of to any
                decision of the Clerk to the Sefton Magistrates' Court to challenge the
                payment of the officers' costs of proceedings before that court from central
                funds, or to any other decision of any court, authority or body arising from
                such prosecutions; and, accordingly, that the applications of Mr
                Duckenfield and Mr Murray for financial assistance in relation to such
                proceedings be rejected.

                3 - In recognition of the fact that legal advice provided to the Authority is
                that it remains arguable that power exists to provide the assistance referred
                to in 1 and 2 above, to take such action as the Clerk and Treasurer, in
                consultation with the Chief Constable, the Authority's legal adinsors and
                the Chairman of the Authority may decide as appropriate to have the
                decisions referred to in 1 and 2 reviewed by the High Court and to expedite
                such a review with a view to clarifying the Authority's powers in this
                regard.

                4 - To defer consideration of the procedural issues raised by Ms Adlington,
                in her letters of 22 December 1998 to the Clerk and Treasurer and 5 January
                1999 to the members of the Authority, until the legal power of the Authority
                to provide financial assistance referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 has been
                resolved to the satisfaction of the Authority''.

       4.10.3   The solicitors for Messrs Duckenfield and Murray were informed of
                the decision following the meeting on 5 February 1999.                  On 10
                February 1999, Garretts, the solicitors instructed by the Authority,
                wrote to the solicitors for Messrs Duckenfield and Murray setting out
                the Authority's reasons for its decision. Copies of these letters are in
                appendix 7. Similar letters were written to Ms Adlington and the
                solicitors for the Chief Constable.

4.11   The Chief Constable's Application

       The Chief Constable applied on 10 February 1999 to the High Court for a
       judicial review of resolutions 1 and 2 above. However, Ms Adlington was




                                              15
       given leave to be joined as a party to the proceedings and challenged the legal
       standing of the Chief Constable to make such an application. As a result, Mr
       Duckenfield and Mr Murray also applied to be joined as parties to the
       litigation as there was no doubt that they had legal standing to challenge the
       Authority's decision. On 31 March 1999, the Court gave its judgment at the
       same time as it gave judgment in respect of the DPP judicial review.

4.12   The Divisional Court's decision

       4.12.1   The Court declared as follows:

                "A -police authority lias the statutory power, but subject to ordinary public
                law principles, to provide financial assistance to police officers and former
                police officers in respect of their costs and expenses incurred in relation to
                private prosecutions brought against them and judicial review proceedings
                in which they participate".

       4.12.2   It is significant that the Court did not quash the resolutions of 5
                February 1999, although the Court did observe, in the proceedings
                following delivery of the judgment, that the Authority is to revisit
                the decision. Therefore, the resolutions of 5 February 1999 which
                declare the previous decisions to provide financial assistance null
                and void remain in force.

       4.12.3   The Chief Constable's application to the Court also sought guidance
                on how the Authority should exercise its power to grant financial
                assistance if the Court held that such power existed, and in particular
                whether the availability of legal aid was relevant to the decision on
                funding to be taken by the Authority. The Court declined to give
                any guidance on how the Authority should exercise its power to
                provide financial assistance to current or former officers in legal
                proceedings arising from the conduct of their duties, other than by
                confirming that general public law principles applied. During the
                proceedings immediately following judgment, however, Lord Justice
                Laws observed that:-

                "... I think it is very important, in truth in the interests of everyone
                concerned in this matter, that the Court should not attempt to steer public
                authorities such as [the Authority] into any particular course of action on
                the merits".




                                              16
                  and:

                   " the parties know from the judgment that has been delivered that the vires
                  [power] exists in principle and it anil then be for the [Authority] to decide,
                  subject to ordinary public law ndes ... when and hoio they may use that
                  power".

          This makes it clear that although the Authority does have the basic power to
          support officers and former officers costs in legal proceedings arising from
          the performance of their duties, how this power is to be exercised is a matter
          for them.



    o     THE LITIGATION FOR WHICH FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IS SOUGHT

    5.1   The South Sefton Criminal Proceedings and the proposed South Sefton
          Judicial Review

          5.1.1   On 24 June 1998, informations were laid before the South Sefton
                  Magistrates Court by Ms Adlington, the Solicitor representing the
                  HFSG, alleging:

                  (a)       against both Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray offences of
                            manslaughter of two of those who died as a result of the
                            Hillsborough disaster, John Anderson and James Aspinall
                            and an offence of wilful neglect to perform a public duty; and

#
                  (b)       against Mr Duckenfield alone, a further offence of perverting
                            the course of justice, said to consist in his having lied about
                            the circumstances in which gate C of the football ground
                            became open.

          5.1.2   Following representations from the parties, the Clerk to the Justices
                  took the view that the South Sefton court had jurisdiction to deal
                  with the offences, but that there was an argument that the
                  summonses were ineffective unless the defendants submitted to the
                  jurisdiction of the court. It was agreed that the proceedings would
                  be brought forward to 10 July 1998 and that Ms Adlington would
                  apply for them to be withdrawn.




                                               17
5.1.3   On 10 July 1998, in the absence of all parties, the South Sefton
        Criminal Proceedings were withdrawn and the court made an order
        for Mr Duckenfield's and Mr Murray's costs to be assessed and paid
        from central funds in accordance with Section 16 of the Prosecution
        of Offences Act 1985.

5.1.4   In September 1998, the solicitors for Messrs Duckenfield and Murray
        (being Winckworth Sherwood and Walker Morris respectively) each
        submitted their claims for costs.

5.1.5   On 11 February 1999, the Clerk wrote to the solicitors for Messrs
        Duckenfield and Murray.           He stated that, as the Authority had
        agreed to pay Messrs Duckenfield and Murray's costs in relation to
        the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings, they had not themselves
        incurred any costs and were not entitled to be reimbursed from
        central funds. He based this view on the decision in             R - v - M iller

        (Raym ond) a n d A n o th e r (1993) 3 A ll ER 186 ("Miller").


5.1.6   He drew attention to the fact that he was aware of the pending
        judicial review in relation to the Police Authority's decision of 5
        February and advised that he would await the outcome of that
        hearing before he made a final decision. A final decision is expected
        from the Clerk shortly.

5.1.7   Both Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray have stated their intention to
        seek a judicial review of the Clerk's decision should it be
        unfavourable to them and have sought financial assistance from the
        Authority so to do - see further paragraph 6.2.1 below To the extent
        that the Authority is legally bound to provide assistance in relation
        to the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings (an issue on which Garretts
        advise in paragraph 7.6 below), the South Sefton Judicial Review
        would effectively be for the benefit of the Authority in reducing the
        costs it is liable to pay.

The Leeds Criminal Proceedings

5.2.1   On 13 July 1998 and 10 July 1998, fresh informations, alleging the
        same offences as the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings were laid by
        Ms Adlington before the Leeds Petty Sessional Division and
        summonses in respect of these offences were issued by the
        stipendiary magistrate against Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray.
        Copies of the summonses are in appendix 8.

5.2.2   Following the discontinuance on 12 April 1999 of the charge of
        perverting the course of justice against Mr Duckenfield, the
        remaining charges against both officers are of manslaughter and
        wilful neglect to perform a public duty.

5.2.3   The legal elements of these alleged offences are basically as follows:-

        (a)    Manslaughter

               Manslaughter may be classified as voluntary or involuntary.
               Involuntary manslaughter may be committed as follows:-


               (i)    A person upon whom the law imposes a duty or who
                       has taken upon himself any duty, tending to the
                       preservation of life, and who, regardless of the life,
                       safety, welfare and health of others, neglects to
                       perform that duty or performs it negligently and
                       thereby causes the death of another person may be
                       guilty7of manslaughter.

               (ii)   Similarly, a person who acts recklessly in such a
                       manner as to create an obvious and serious risk of
                       causing physical injury to some other person and who
                       thereby causes the death of any person may also be
                       guilty of manslaughter.

              It is important to note that a higher degree of negligence is
              necessary to render a person guilty of manslaughter than to
              establish civil liability against him and mere carelessness is not
              enough. The number of persons affected by a single act of
              negligence does not affect the degree of negligence. This
              offence is punishable by imprisonment for life or any shorter
              term at the discretion of the court.




                                  19
(b)    Wilful neglect to perform a public duty

       A public officer who wilfully and without reasonable excuse
       or justification neglects to perform a duty imposed on him
       either by common law or by statute may be guilty of this
       offence. The penalty for the offence is a fine and
       imprisonment at the discretion of the court and loss of office.

Leading Counsel for Messrs Duckenfield and Murray have provided
to the Authority a joint opinion on the merits of the prosecution
dated 26 April 1999. In a letter dated 30 April 1999 from Walker
Morris to Garretts a copy of Mr Murray's representations to the DPP
was enclosed (appendix 9).

Committal proceedings are due to commence on 5 July 1999. It is
understood that they have been given an estimate of 3 weeks. A
number of hearings on ancillary matters, such as a witness summons
requiring the Chief Constable to produce various statements and
documents, were heard on 10 Mav.      j




At the committal hearing, Counsel for Messrs Duckenfield and
Murray will argue:

(a)    There is no prima facie case of manslaughter or wilful neglect
       to perform a public duty; and

(b)    That the prosecutions are oppressive and an abuse of the
       right of private prosecutions.

If either submission succeeds, the Leeds Criminal Proceedings will
come to an end and an order for payment of the officer's costs out of
central funds is likely to be made.

If both submissions fail, the Leeds Criminal Proceedings will
continue to a Crown Court trial. There is currently no estimate of the
length of the trial. If Messrs Duckenfield and Murray are acquitted,
an order for payment out of central funds is likely to be made unless
the presiding judge were to decide that Messrs Duckenfield and
Murray:
        (a)   brought the prosecutions upon themselves for example by
               suspicious behaviour; or

        (b)   were acquitted on a technicality; or

        (c)   had not incurred any costs (for example because the
               Authority paid their costs - see further paragraph 5.2.8
               below).

5.2.8   Messrs Duckenfield and Murray have requested financial assistance
        for the Leeds Criminal Proceedings.          If the Authority provides
        financial assistance, there is a risk that the Chief Clerk of the Leeds
        Crown Court might conclude that, on the basis of        M iller,   they had
        not incurred costs and are not entitled to be re-imbursed out of
        central funds, although so long as the arrangements between the
        former officers, their lawyers and the Authority are properly
        structured, this risk can be reduced if not entirely eliminated. (See
        further paragraph 8.11.3 below).

The DPP Judicial Review

5.5.1   In July 1998, Both Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray made
        representations to the Director of Public Prosecutions that he should
        exercise his power under Section 6(2) of the Prosecution of Offences
        Act 1985 to take over the conduct of the Leeds Criminal Proceedings
        and then discontinue all charges under Section 23(3).

5.3.2   Following representations from Mr Duckenfield, Mr Murray and the
        HFSG, the DPP communicated his decision not to intervene by letter
        of 18 December 1998. It stated:

        "We have considered the evidence, the representations made by the
        parties and all the relevant circumstances of the case. We have
        concluded that we should not intervene to take over any of the
        charges".

5.3.3   The respective solicitors of Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray asked for
        reasons to be given. There followed a letter of 1 February 1999 from
        the CPS Case Work Director, Mr Newell, to Mr Murray's solicitor (a
        copy of which is included at appendix 10).
Kir Duckenfield and Mr Murray applied in March 1999 for a judicial
review of the DPP's decision. The DPP opposed the application. Ms
Adlington was given leave to intervene to support the DPP's
decision. Mr Newell made an affidavit expanding on the reasons
given in his letter of 1 February 1999. A copy of the affidavit is in
appendix 11.

On 31 March 1999 the Divisional Court delivered its decision on this
application. A copy of the judgment is in appendix 12.

The Divisional Court dealt with the application in two stages:

(a)   The charges against Messrs Duckenfield and Murray of
       manslaughter and wilful neglect; and

(b)   The charge against Mr Duckenfield of perverting the course
       of justice.

Manslaughter and wilful neglect

(a)   The DPP concluded that there was no reasonable prospect of
       conviction on these charges.      This is consistent with his
       previous conclusions and the outcome of the scrutiny.

(b)   However, the DPP stated that he

      "could not say there was clearly no case to answer. It was not
      right therefore, for [him] to take over the proceedings with a
      view to terminating them"

(c)   The Divisional Court decided there was no reason for it to
       interfere with the DPFs decision. Lord Justice Laws (with
       whom the other judges agreed) concluded

       "the DPP might, in my judgment, lawfully have decided to
       discontinue. The tragic events of Hillsborough have been the
       subject of repeated, detailed and thorough enquiries. Nearly
       10 years have passed. But, the judgment was for the DPP to
       make. If we acceded to [Counsel for Messrs Duckenfield and
       Murray's] submissions, we would I think usurp the role of
       the primary decision maker".
                 (See the judgment in appendix 12 at page 16)

5.3.8    Perverting the course of justice

         On this charge, the DPP concluded

         "that there was clearly no case to answer..."

         But he decided not to intervene for 3 reasons:

         (a)     He did not think partial intervention was appropriate or
                 desirable;

         (b)     Mr Duckenfield could invite the magistrate to dismiss the
                 charge (at committal) on the grounds that there was no case
                 to answer; and

         (c)     The charge arose out of the same events which gave rise to
                 the other charges which would be scrutinised in any event.

         The Divisional Court rejected this approach. It held that Mr
         Duckenfield was entitled to expect that the DPP would consider
         whether intervention was appropriate on each charge individually.
         Therefore, the DPFs decision on this charge alone was quashed and
         the DPP invited to reconsider it.

         On 12 April 1999, the DPP decided to take over and discontinue this
         charge (See the letter from Mr Newell to Winckworth Sherwood
         Solicitors in appendix 13).

5.3.9    Costs

        Mr Murray was ordered to pay the DPFs costs. Mr Duckenfield was
        ordered to pay 80% of the DPFs costs of the DPP Judicial Review.
        This reflects the fact that he enjoyed partial success in his application
        in having the charge of perverting the course of justice referred back
        to the DPP (who subsequently intervened to quash the charge). As it
        is not usually appropriate to award costs in favour of a party which
        has intervened to support the decision under review, Ms Adlington
        did not seek costs against Messrs Duckenfield and Murray. She did
        seek costs from central funds but these were refused.




                                    23
5.3.10   Messrs Duckenfield and Murray have applied for financial assistance
         from the Authority to meet both their own legal costs of their
         application to challenge the D PP's decision of 18 December 1998 and
         the costs of the DPP's legal advice which were awarded against them
         (see paragraph 6.2.3 below).

The Powers Judicial Review

5.4.1    The events leading up to the Powers Judicial Review and the
         judgment of the Court in relation to that review are summarised in
         paragraph 4 above.

5.4.2    Despite succeeding with their legal arguments in the Powers Judicial
         Review, neither the Chief Constable nor Messrs Duckenfield and
         Murray sought an order for costs against the Authority.        Messrs
         Duckenfield and Murray did, however,        seek an order for costs
         against Ms Adlington, which she opposed.       The basis of the costs
         application against Ms Adlington was that Messrs Duckenfield and
         Murray would not have commenced their own application for
         judicial review against the Authority's decision if Ms Adlington had
         not contended in her affidavit and skeleton argument that the Chief
         Constable did not have legal standing to challenge the Authority's
         decision.   In the light of this submission, the court ordered Ms
         Adlington to pay Messrs Duckenfield and Murray's costs.

5.4.3    Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray have applied to the Authority for
         financial assistance in respect of their costs in these proceedings to
         the extent not met by the costs awarded against Ms Adlington.

5.4.4    It should also be noted that Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray were
         offered support in relation to the Powers Judicial Review from the
         Police Superintendents Association. The terms of that support are
         summarised in a letter from the Police Superintendent's Association
         of England and Wales to Winckworth Sherwood Solicitors dated 5
         March 1999 (appendix 14).


PRESENT APPLICATIONS FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

Following the judgment in the Powers Judicial Review, the Authority's
solicitors, Garretts, sought clarification from Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray
      ot their application for financial assistance by letters dated 7 April 1999 and 30
      April 1999. Copies of the responses from Mr Duckenfield dated 16 April 1999
      and Mr Murray dated 22 April 1999 to the Authority, together with responses
      from Walker Morris (solicitors to Mr Murray) to Garretts dated 7 May 1999
      and Winckworth Sherwood (solicitors to Mr Duckenfield) dated 13 May 1999
      are at Appendix 15.

6.2   Their applications are for financial assistance to meet their legal costs and
      disbursements in the following proceedings:

      6.2.1    The South Sefton Judicial Review

               (a)    As noted above in paragraph 5,1.7 both Mr Duckenfield and
                      Mr Murray have stated their intention to seek a judicial
                      review of the decision of the Clerk to the South Sefton Justices
                      should he refuse to allow their costs to be paid from central
                      funds.    The solicitors representing Mr Duckenfield have
                      provided a cost estimate of £5,000 to £7,000 (excluding VAT
                      and disbursements) for such judicial review. The risk of die
                      Respondent's costs being awarded against Mr Duckenfield
                      and Mr Murray if the Clerk's view on costs is vindicated
                      should, however, be bom e in mind.

              (b)     To the extent that the Authority is legally bound to provide
                      assistance   in   relation   to   the South    Sefton   Criminal
                      Proceedings, (as to which see paragraph 7.6 below) the South
                      Sefton Judicial Review would effectively be for the benefit of
                      the Authority. However, the Authority is recommended to
                      defer its decision in respect of this part o f the applications
                      until the decision of the Clerk to the Justices and reasons for
                      that decision are known. Any decision of the Authority to
                      grant financial assistance before then could be open to
                      potential challenge on the ground of irrationality, as it is not
                      possible to properly consider the merits of the case until the
                      Clerk's decision and reasons are known.

6.2.2   The South Sefton Criminal Proceedings and the Leeds Criminal
        Proceedings

        Both Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray have applied for financial
        assistance in respect of costs and disbursements incurred in the
        conduct of their respective defences in the criminal proceedings
        referred to in paragraphs 5.1 and 5.2 above. As noted at paragraphs
        4.4 and    4.6 above, Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray were each
        informed in writing in 1998 that their reasonable expenses in respect
        of the criminal proceedings (that is, both the South Sefton Criminal
        Proceedings and the Leeds Criminal Proceedings) would be met by
        the Authority.

        The legal costs and disbursements incurred by Mr Duckenfield in         #



        respect of the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings amount to
        £8,716.63 (including VAT). Legal costs and disbursements incurred
        by Mr Murray in respect of the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings
        amount to £5,874.40 (including VAT). It is not yet known how much
        (if any) of these costs and disbursements the Clerk to the South
        Sefton justices will allow to be paid from central funds and it is
        recommended that the Authority defer any decision in relation to the
        funding of the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings until this is
        known.

        The Authority has not paid any sums pursuant to the 1998 decisions
        to provide financial assistance to Messrs Duckenfield and Murray.
        An invoice for £34,492.16 (including VAT) for work up to 18
        September 1998 has been submitted by Mr Duckenfield's solicitors.

        incurred or is expected to incur in the criminal proceedings, DPP

6.2.3    The DPP Judicial Review

         Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray have both applied for financial
         assistance in respect of their legal expenses incurred and those costs
         awarded against them in the judicial review (referred to at paragraph
         5.3 above) of the DPP's decision not to take over and discontinue the
         prosecutions.

         Mr Murray was ordered to pay the DPPs costs. As Mr Duckenfield's
         application to the court was partially successful, in that the decision
         not to take over and discontinue the charge of perverting the cause of
         justice was quashed, he has been ordered to pay 80% of the DPFs
         costs. The DPP has not yet provided an account of his costs.

6.2.4    The Powers Judicial Review

         Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray have also both applied for financial
         assistance in respect of any legal expenses incurred in the judicial
         review of the Authority's decisions that it had no power to provide
         the financial assistance sought by the former officers, but only to the
         extent not reimbursed under the costs award made against Ms
         Adlington.

         Both officers applied to be joined as parties to these proceedings after
         Ms Adlington disputed the Chief Constable's legal standing to bring
         the application. Ms Adlington has been ordered to pay their costs of
         the application.

         It is recommended that the Authority defer its decision on this part
         of the applications pending assessment and payment of Ms
         Adlington's costs liability to Messrs Duckenfield and Murray.


LEGAL FEES INCURRED IN THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS UP TO 5
FEBRUARY 1999

As noted above at paragraphs 4.4 and 4.6 the Authority originally agreed in
1998 to meet the reasonable expenses of Messrs Duckenfield and Murray in
the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings and Leeds Criminal Proceedings. (See
the letters in appendices 1 and 2)
On 13 January 1999 the Clerk and Treasurer wrote to Messrs Duckenfield and
Murray's solicitors stating that the Authority would be reviewing the issue of
financial assistance and that the Qerk and Treasurer was not in a position to
authorise payments in respect of the private prosecutions. In response to a
query from Mr Murray's solicitors, Walker Morris, the Clerk and Treasurer
wrote to Walker Morris on 14 January 1999 stating

"you should not incur further costs pending the meeting of the Authority and
that, if you do so, it will be at your own risk".

Copies of the Clerk and Treasurer's letters are attached at appendix 16. On 5
February 1999, the Authority resolved that it had no legal power to provide
funding and, accordingly, that its previous decisions to provide funding were
null and void.     Whilst the High Court held on 31 March 1999 that the
Authority did in fact have a statutory power to provide funding, the decisions
of the Authority on 5 February 1999 were not quashed by the High Court.
Therefore, the resolutions remain in force in effect although the court expects
the Authority to revisit the resolutions. It is the opinion of Garretts that Mr
Duckenfield and Mr Murray both have a strong case that they have a legally
enforceable right to recover from the Authority their costs in the Leeds
Criminal Proceedings and the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings incurred up
to 5 February 1999 (to the extent that those costs are reasonable).

In relation to the costs incurred by Messrs Duckenfield and Murray in the
Leeds Criminal Proceedings since 5 February 1999 and in the DPP Judicial
Review, Garretts' opinion is that the Authority may decide to offer assistance
to Messrs Duckenfield and Murray on the same or different terms as
previously given, or it may decide not to provide assistance. This report deals
further with these questions in paragraphs 8 and 9 below.

The remainder of this paragraph 7 explains why Mr Duckenfield and Mr
Murray may have a strong claim for the costs of the criminal proceedings up
to 5 February 1999, but not after, and the principles on which the strength of
that claim should be judged.

Legitimate expectation

7.6.1    Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray may allege that they have a
         "legitimate expectation" in respect of the costs they have incurred in
         the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings and the Leeds Criminal
        Proceedings up to 5 February 1999.         The concept of "legitimate
        expectation" has developed through a number of cases and has
        emerged as an enforceable right which may arise when a public
        authority seeks to withdraw from an assurance previously given by
        it concerning the way in which it will exercise its powers.

7.6.2   While "legitimate expectation" is now capable of giving rise to
        substantive rights, the concept of a legitimate expectation was
        initially formulated to ensure that a person would not have a right or
        interest which had been granted by a public body withdrawn or
        varied without an opportunity to make representations. Therefore, it
        was appropriate that the Authority heard from Messrs Duckenfield
        and Murray when it met on 5 February 1999 and did not withdraw
        funding of the criminal proceedings from them until that date.

7.6.3   While the boundaries of legitimate expectation are still developing,
        the elements needed to be established in this case are:

        (a)   a clear and unambiguous representation to Messrs
               Duckenfield and Murray that they would receive funding;
               and

        (b)   that they acted in reliance on the representation to their
               detriment (there is some question as to whether reliance to
               detriment is a necessary ingredient. However, recent cases
               indicate that it is necessary).

7.6.4   The concept is always subject to the right of public bodies to
        withdraw from a position in appropriate circumstances.          This is
        consistent with a principle that there cannot be a fettering of a public
        authority's discretion by a fixed policy. But if a public body wishes to
        withdraw from a position it has taken, it may be required to honour
        undertakings or assurances it has given on which someone has relied
        up to that date, unless there is an overriding public interest
        consideration against so doing.

7.6.5   The concept is also subject to a public body acting within its power.
        A public authority cannot be required, nor is it entitled, to do
        something outside its basic statutory powers, even if it has given an
        assurance so to do. If the public body has the basic statutory power,




                                   30
however, but exercised it irregularly in giving the relevant assurance,
then it may still be bound by that assurance. The decision of the
Divisional Court on the Powers Judicial Review has confirmed that
the Authority has the basic statutory power to meet current and
former police officer's legal expenses in appropriate circumstances.
Therefore, an enforceable legitimate expectation may well have
arisen in favour of Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray that their legal
expenses of the criminal proceedings up to 5 February 1999 (when
the original decision to meet those expenses was reversed) would be
met by the Authority, even if there were procedural irregularities in
the original decision.

It is important to note that Messrs Duckenfield and Murray's
application should be considered separately and in particular
whether they relied on the assurances given to their detriment. It is
conceivable that one might establish an enforceable legitimate
expectation whereas the other might not.

What the Authority needs to decide, therefore, is whether the officers
case for funding up to the 5 February 1999 satisfies the following
conditions:-

(a)   Clear and unambiguous representation

       There seems little room to doubt that the letters of 5 March
       and 29 June to Messrs Duckenfield and Murray constitute a
       clear and unambiguous representation that their legal costs of
       the criminal proceedings would be met.

(b)   Reliance to detriment

      It will be for each of the former officers to establish whether
      they have acted in reliance to their detriment on the letters
      from the Authority. It is likely that they did so, however, by
      instructing solicitors to represent them, without applying for
      legal aid. While it is not too late to seek legal aid, it will not be
      granted retrospectively (i.e. will not cover costs they have
      already incurred with their solicitors) but, if granted, will only
      meet future costs and then subject to the former officers
      making substantial contributions from their own resources.
(c)    Are there any public interest factors which should override
       a decision to meet such expenses?

       The Authority should consider whether any circumstances
       such as public policy or other overriding factors in the public
       interest exist which would mitigate against meeting the
       former officer's costs up to 5 February 1999. Garretts have
       not, however, identified any such circumstances.

If Messrs Duckenfield and Murray establish the three elements for
legitimate expectation, which it appears likely that they will, it is
difficult to see that the Authority has any real alternative but to meet
their reasonable expenses of the Leeds Criminal Proceedings up to
the time the Authority effectively reversed its previous decisions on
financial assistance for the Leeds Criminal Proceedings.        Having
regard to the requirements of reasonable notice and their right to be
heard, it is submitted that the date the Authority effectively reversed
its decision and to which therefore reasonable expenses of the
criminal proceedings should be met, is 5 February 1999. This was the
first opportunity that representatives of Messrs Duckenfield and
Murray had to be heard on the issue of whether funding was to be
withdrawn and an unambiguous decision was taken by the
Authority to withdraw funding for the Leeds Criminal Proceedings.

It is submitted that the Authority was entitled, as from 5 February
1999 to withdraw the assurances given to the former officers about
funding their legal costs of the Criminal Proceedings, on the basis of
the legal principle that in areas of ongoing public expenditure, a
public body must not fetter its discretion. Therefore, it is entitled to
revoke, vary or suspend an expenditure commitment after proper
notice and an opportunity to challenge that decision has been given
to those affected by the change of policy. The Clerk and Treasurer's
letters of 13 and 14 January 1999 (referred to in paragraph 7.2 above).
and the opportunity afforded to Messrs Duckenfield and Murray to
be heard on 5 February 1999 would appear to meet the requirements
of notice and opportunity to be heard.
Recommendations w ith regard to costs of the Criminal Proceedings up to 5
February 1999

       A.       If the Authority are satisfied following presentations made by
                or on behalf of Mr Duckenfield, Mr Murray and Ms
                Adlington at their meeting that:-

                (i)      a clear and unambiguous assurance of funding for the
                         Criminal Proceedings was given by or on behalf of the
                         Authority;

                (ii)     the former officers relied on that assurance to their
                         detriment (for example by not seeking funding from
                         other sources such as legal aid); and

                (iii)    that no overriding public interest factors exist which
                         means it would be inappropriate to confirm such
                         funding

                Garretts' recommend that the Authorityj should meet Mr
                Duckenfield's and Mr Murray's reasonable legal expenses for
                the Leeds Criminal Proceedings up to 5 February 1999. A
                decision on the South Sefton expenses should be deferred
                pending the decision of the Clerk to the Justices of the South
                Sefton Magistrates Court as to whether Messrs Duckenfield
                and Murray are entitled to be reimbursed out of central
                funds.

      B.        In order to assess the reasonableness of the legal expenses
                claimed, the costs incurred should be reviewed by a legal
                costs draftsman specialising in criminal costs. If his or her
                advice be that the costs claimed are not reasonable, the
                Authority should apply to the Court to have the costs
                assessed under Section 71 Solicitors Act 1974 (assessment of
                costs on application of third parties liable to pay costs) unless
                the costs to be paid can be agreed. However, it should be
                noted that the Court is not bound to grant an application by
                the Authority for such assessment.
8     THE MERITS OF THE APPLICATIONS FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

8.1   It will be recalled that:

      8.1.1       On 22 December 1998 and 5 January 1999, Ms Adlington wrote
                  letters challenging the Authority's decisions on 2 grounds namely:

                  (a)      There was no power for the Authority to pay die legal costs in
                            relation to criminal proceedings against officers; and

                  (b)      Even if such power existed, it had been exercised improperly
                            in this case. (See paragraph 4.8 and 4.9.2).

      8.1.2       On 5 February 1999 the Authority resolved, amongst other things

                  "4 -   To defer consideration o f the procedural issues raised b y M s A dlin gton ,

                  in her letters o f 22 D ecem ber 1998 to the Clerk an d Treasurer an d 5 January

                  1999     to the m em bers o f the A u th o rity , u n til the legal pow er o f the A u th o r ity

                  to provide financial assistance referred to in paragraphs 1 a n d 2 has been

                  resolved to the satisfaction o f the A u th o rity" .


      8.1.3       The Divisional Court has recognised that the Authority has
                  committed itself to revisiting its decision to grant (and revoke)
                  financial assistance in the light of the finding of power.                                The
                  application for financial assistance for the                            Leeds      Criminal
                  Proceedings (after 5 February 1999 only) and the DPP Judicial
                  Review should now be considered afresh by the Authority.

8.2   In making the decision whether to exercise its discretion to grant such
      financial assistance to Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray, the Authority must
      bear in mind that, whilst the court has confirmed that it has the power to
      grant such financial assistance, it by no means follows that the Authority
      should grant such financial assistance.

8.3   In deciding whether to meet the legal costs of Mr Duckenfield and Mr
      Murray, (whether in relation to the criminal proceedings or any of the other
      proceedings referred to above) the Authority is subject to the public law
      principles of decision making. Briefly, these are that it must (amongst other
      things):

      •          act within whatever statutory powers conferred upon it by Act of
                 Parliament;



                                                     34
•       act with procedural fairness (including by giving a hearing to directly
        interested parties);

•       take all relevant considerations into account;

•       ignore all irrelevant considerations;

•       not act irrationally;

•       not fetter its discretion; and

•       not unlawfully delegate the decision making function.

Failure to comply with any of these principles will expose the decision to
challenge by judicial review. The Authority must individually consider each
of Mr Duckenfield’s and Mr Murray's applications in respect of each separate
set of proceedings (and, in the case of the criminal proceedings, each charge)
separately.     All relevant considerations should be taken into account and
weighed against each other. Garretts consider that the major considerations
include:-

8.4.1    whether the Authority is satisfied that the former officers acted in
            good faith in directing the police operations on the day of the
            disaster;

8.4.2    whether the former officers exercised their judgment reasonably, in
            the light of the circumstances they faced, and if not, whether other
            relevant factors outweigh this consideration;

8.4.3    whether it is appropriate to require Mr Duckenfield or Mr Murray to
            look to alternative sources of finance to pay their legal costs, such as
            legal aid, the Police Superintendent's Association or their own
            resources, given the likely adverse financial effects for them of
            seeking legal aid;

8.4.4    the seriousness of the charges and whether it is appropriate to agree
            to provide funding, before a verdict is reached on them;

8.4.5    the Authority's view on the merits of the charges;

8.4.6    The impact on the Authority's resources of funding the former
            officer's costs and the "knock on" effect on policing in South
          Yorkshire (the Chief Constable will be present to advise on this at the
          meeting); and

8.4.7     the impact of a refusal to provide financial support on police morale
          and on the confidence of officers to exercise their judgment in
          difficult circumstances.

Factors which may assist in reaching a decision include:-

•       Guidance in Home Office Circulars;


•       The circumstances of the Hillsborough Stadium tragedy as recorded,
        inter alia, in:

        (a)       The interim report of Lord Justice Taylor into the
                  Hillsborough Stadium disaster; and

        (b)       The Scrutiny of Lord Justice Stuart Smith into the
                  Hillsborough Stadium disaster.


•       The decision of the DPP in 1990 that there was insufficient evidence
        upon which prosecution for manslaughter or any other criminal
        offence could be brought against any officer in the South Yorkshire
        Police or any other person.


•       The decision of the Director of the Public Prosecutions in 1997 that the
        material so far presented would not justify fresh investigations.


•       The decision of the Director of Public Prosecution in 1999 that in
        respect of the charges of manslaughter and wilful neglect to perform a
        public duty, the Director of Public Prosecutions was not satisfied that
        there was clearly no case to answer and decided not to take over and
        discontinue the prosecutions.


•       The fact that the DPP7s decision in 1999 not to take over and
        discontinue the prosecution of Mr Duckenfield for perverting the
        course of justice was quashed by the High Court on judicial review
                  and remitted to the DPP for reconsideration, and that the DPP has
                  now taken over and discontinued this charge.


          •       The inquest findings of accidental death.


          •       The fact that disciplinary charges of neglect of duty were directed by
                  the Police Complaints Authority against Mr Duckenfield and Mr
                  Murray but were never determined due to the retirement of Mr
                  Duckenfield.


          •       The fact that after several years of service to the police force, each of
                  Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray retired with clean disciplinary
                  records.


          •       The likely costs of the financial assistance.


          •       The financial resources of Messrs Duckenfield and Murray.


          •       Relevant representations put to the Authority by the Chief Constable,
                   Mr Duckenfield, Mr Murray and the HFSG.


    8.6   Guidance on a number of these matters was given in the Divisional Court
          decision of R     - v - D erbyshire Police A u th o r ity ex parte W ilson & D alton (1989).



•   87
          Home Office Circulars

          In W ilson   and D alton,   the court considered the relevance of the Home Office
          circular then in effect in relation to the funding of police officers' costs, HOC
          77/87. A copy of HOC 77/87 and the replacement circular, HOC 4/1998 are
          in appendix 17. The following principles emerged on the relevance of Home
          Office guidance:

          8.7.1     Circulars do not have statutory force but are a good indication of the
                       matters to be taken into account.
8.7.2   Lord Justice Gibson further commented

         "that is n ot to say that in considering an application fo r reim bursem ent o f

         costs b y an officer, a Police A u th o r ity is necessarily lim ited to factors in the
         circular ."


8.7.3    The central principle in HOC 4/1998 is

        "it is im p o rta n t that police officers should be able to carry o u t their duties in

         the confidence that their Police A u th o r ity w ill su p p o rt them, i f they act in

         good faith and exercise their ju d g m e n t reasonably".



Good Faith and Reasonableness of Conduct

8.8.1   In drawing any conclusions as to good faith and reasonable exercise
         of judgment, the Authority must consider all relevant evidence
         including the findings of the various investigations and reports. It is
         also important that the Authority does not limit itself to
         consideration of good faith but also considers whether Mr
         Duckenfield or Mr Murray exercised their duties reasonably. If the
         Authority decides either or both of them acted unreasonably,
         however, it may still decide that other factors pointing to supporting
         the relevant former officers outweigh this consideration (whilst it is
         difficult to envisage circumstances justifying supporting an officer
         who the Authority considers acted in bad faith).

8.8.2   On the relevance of the conduct of theofficers in                  W ilson and D alton

         and more specifically on "good faith" and "reasonable exercise of
        judgment", Lord Justice Ralph Gibson commented



         "if therefore, there was, on the pa rt o f the officer, negligence, i.e. failu re to

        exercise such care as w as reasonably to be required in the circum stances o f

        an officer o f his rank and experience, doing his jo b in the force, then in m y

        view , the Police A u th o rity is e n title d to have regard to i t i f such negligence

        w as connected to the subject m atter o f the legal proceedings, or to the

        causing o f the legal proceedings to be taken, that it can fa irly be regarded as

        a substantial cause o f the in cu rrin g o f the costs. I have no doubt that a

        Police A u th o rity, i f satisfied o f good faith on the pa rt o f the officer, w ou ld
        n orm a lly act, an d be pleased to act, on the central principle stated in the

        circular [i.e go od faith]; b u t the discretion is g iv en to the A u th o r ity and it is

        impossible, in m y view , to hold that, once go od faith is established, a Police

        A u th o r ity m u st disregard clear evidence o f negligence or a failure to

         "exercise ju d g m e n t reasonably". So to hold w o id d mean that a Police

        A u th o r ity w o u ld be required to disregard acts o f substantial negligence,

        such that it could f a ir ly be said that, although acqu itted on bad faith, the

        officer had "brought the proceedings upon h im s e lf .




8.8.3   The decision whether the evidence of such negligence in a particular
        case justifies withholding reimbursement, wholly or in part, is,
        therefore, entrusted to the Police Authority.

8.8.4   While the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police has admitted
        negligence in certain civil actions which have been brought, it must
         also be remembered that:

         (a)     the admissions were in respect of civil, not criminal liability;

         (b)     the other parties who were held responsible contributed to
                 the damages paid to the victims; and

         (c)     there was no finding that Messrs Duckenfield and Murray
                 were themselves individually negligent and responsible for
                 the disaster.

8.8.5   Whilst all the relevant factors must be considered as a whole, it is
        worth drawing attention to the following from Lord Justice Taylor's
        interim report and Lord Justice Stuart Smith's Scrutiny as relevant to
        an assessment of Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray's behaviour:

(i)     From Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report (appendix 18) -
        "Postponement of kick off"

"226 - At various stages in his evidence, Mr Duckenfield gave three accounts
of why he thought it was too late to postpone kick off. Once it was that one of
the teams had already come onto the pitch. Then it was that a group of
photographers at the tunnel had wrongly led him to think that the teams
were coming out. Finally, he did not know why he thought the teams were
       coming out. They did not in fact come on to the pitch until 2.54pm, two
       minutes after gate C was opened. Police Constable Buxton had asked for a
       postponement of kick off before gate C was opened. It should not, however,
       have needed a police constable in the thick of the crowd (and there were
       others of like mind) to think of postponing the kick off. The need should have
       been clear in the control room.

       227 - The truth was that Mr Duckenfield applied inflexibly the policy he had
       discussed with Mr Murray. Kick off would not be postponed unless there
       was some major cause for delayed arrivals e.g. a jam on the motorway or fog.
       I accept that the thinking behind this policy was not callous or punitive. If
       kick-off is postponed whenever a proportion of fans choose to leave the
       public houses late, the practice may grow and kick off times would become
       meaningless. But, a commander must deal with the problem of the day.
       Faced with a situation which was becoming dangerous, crowd safety should
       have been his paramount consideration. Kick off should have been delayed.

Summary

       228 - The layout of the turnstiles and the number they were required to serve
       left no margin of safety against an uneven flow of fans. Because police
       strategy in advance and on the day did not cater for it, the arrival of a large
       number of supporters between 2.30pm and 2.40pm created an unmanageable
       crush. The presence of a substantial minority of fans who had drunk too
       much aggravated that problem. Having lost control and rejected the option
       of postponing kick off, the police were faced with the serious danger of
       deaths or injuries. They were left therefore with no alternative but to open
       the gates. Superintendent Marshall was right at that stage to ask for it and Mr
       Duckenfield was right to agree. But the possible effects of so dramatic a step
       required other action.

The blunder on opening the gates

       229 - The decision to order the opening of the gates was not accompanied or
       followed by any other order to deal with the consequences. When gate C
       was opened, a steady stream of about 2000 fans poured through it over some
      five minutes. Clearly they were going to go into the ground somewhere and
      unless they were diverted their likeliest route was through the tunnel for
      reasons already given. No warning was issued from the control room that the
      gate was to be opened. Serials on the concourse were not alerted. Neither the
      Club control room, nor the Chief Steward at the Leppings Lane end was
      warned. Not even Mr Greenwood, the Ground Commander, was informed.
      From 2.47pm when Mr Marshall made his first request until 2.52pm when Mr
      Duckenfield acceded to it, there were five minutes in which orders could have
      been given as to how the influx was to be absorbed. It was not done. In
      evidence, Mr Duckenfield began by saying that no officer made any wrong
      decision but he later conceded he had erred in this regard. He said he did not
      consider where the people would go when the gate opened. Even after it
      opened, when he could see the influx on the television screen, no order was
      given to steer the fans to the wing pens. Mr Duckenfield said it did not cross
      his mind to detail officers on the concourse to shut off the tunnel. Those
      officers could not have known from their position how full pens 3 and 4 were.
      That was a matter for the control room to monitor from its own observations
      and using intelligence from around the ground."

      "231...it should have been clear in the control room where there was a view of
      the pens and of the crowd at the turnstiles that the tunnel had to be closed. If
      orders had been given to that effect when gate C was opened, the fans could
      have been directed to the empty areas of the wings and this disaster could
      still have been avoided. Failure to give that order was a blunder of the first
      magnitude".

"The Officers in Command

      250 - Even when realisation of the problem came to officers on the track, it
      was some minutes before it reached the control room. When spectators first
      appeared on the track, the immediate assumption in the control room was
      that a pitch invasion was threatened. This was unlikely at the beginning of a
      match. It became still less likely when those on the track made no move
      towards the pitch. Mr Motson, the BBC commentator, recognised and said
      well before the match was stopped, that the trouble seemed to be
      overcrowding and not misbehaviour. Still, the assumption to the contrary
      persisted in the control room. Until Mr Murray radioed for a fleet of
      ambulances, about 3.06pm, Mr Duckenfield continued to treat the incident as
      a threat to the pitch and to public order."

      "281 - Mr Duckenfield leant heavily on Mr Murray's experience. Between
      them they misjudged the build up at the turnstiles and did little about it until
      the received Mr Marshall's request to open the gate.            They did not, for
      example, check the turnstile figures available from Club control or check with
      Tango units as to the numbers still to come.             They did not alert Mr
      Greenwood to the situation at the fringe of his area of command. They gave
      no instructions as to the management of the crowd at Leppings Lane.
      Inflexibly, they declined to postpone kick off.

      282 - When Mr Marshall's request came, Mr Duckenfield's capacity to take
      decisions and give orders seemed to collapse. Having sanctioned, at last, the
      opening of the gates, he failed to give necessary consequential orders or to
      exert any control when the disaster occurred. He misinterpreted the
      emergence of fans from pens 3 and 4. When he was unsure of the problem, he
      sent down others to "assess the situation" rather than descend to see for
      himself. He gave no information to the crowd."


      (ii)             From Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's Scrutiny Report (appendix 19)

Chapter 1

      "25. The Director of Public Prosecutions had the responsibility of deciding
      whether criminal proceedings, in practice charges of manslaughter, should be
      brought against any corporate body or individual. In their submissions to me
      Counsel for the Family Support Group have only invited me to make a
      recommendation to the DPP in the case of Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray...

      26. the DPP, accepting the advice of two very experienced Queen's Counsel,
      concluded in 1990 that there was not sufficient evidence to justify such
      charges against either of these officers. The fresh evidence, therefore, would
      have to be of sufficient significance that there is, in my view, a real possibility
      that in considering it the DPP might change her mind and institute
proceedings for manslaughter, or any other offence, against one or both of
these officers".

"52. I have read the joint opinion of Counsel dated 6 August 1990 which gave
advice to the Director of Public Prosecutions on the possible criminal
proceedings against Mr Murray and Mr Duckenfield, amongst others.
Although the material available to Counsel was more extensive than that
which was placed before Lord Taylor, because by that time the criminal
investigation carried out by the West Midlands Police had been completed,
Counsel stated that
"the crim inal investigation, fo r all his thoroughness, has not sign ifican tly added to or

con tradicted Lord Justice T aylor's fin d in g s. In our ju d g m e n t, therefore, the Taylor

C rim inal Liability"


53. Counsel then set out a full, detailed and careful resume of the facts based
on the evidence then available. I have not found any error or omission in this
resume, nor in my view is any particular aspect understated or exaggerated. I
have also considered the statement of the law set out in the opinion. Counsel
considered both the offences of manslaughter and culpable misfeasance in
public office. They were plainly correct to consider that the latter offence
would be no easier to establish than manslaughter in the circumstances of the
case.

54. In order to recommend that the DPP reconsider the decision not to
prosecute, therefore, I must be satisfied that any fresh evidence establishes, or
may establish, facts not previously considered by Counsel or the significance
of which was not appreciated, which makes it more likely that charges of
manslaughter could be established. Essentially this relates to Mr
Duckenfield's and Mr Murray's knowledge and appreciation of the risk of
injury in doing what they did or omitted to do....

55. From my meetings with the bereaved families and their representatives, I
am left in no doubt that there was widespread disappointment at the DPP's
decision not to prosecute. They find it difficult to understand in the light of
Lord Taylor's trenchant criticisms of the South Yorkshire Police and the fact
that the force have been paying compensation.

56. What the Director of Public Prosecutions had to bear in mind, however, is
the significantly different and greater degree of culpability which is involved
in manslaughter, or culpable misfeasance in public office, as against the
degree of negligence which gives rise to liability, and compensation
payments, under civil law. Any prosecution of an individual police officer
would have to establish his individual responsibility. It would not be enough
simply to prove the composite failure of the police operation.

57. The causes of the disaster were many and complex. So far as these two
officers wTere concerned, the prosecution would have to prove to the high
standard required for a criminal conviction [i,e. beyond reasonable doubt]
that the failure to give the order to close off the tunnel when gate C was
opened amounted to the serious degree of recklessness necessary to constitute
manslaughter".

Chapter 7

"5....I have come to the clear conclusion that there is no basis upon which
there should be a further Judicial Injury or a reopening of Lord Taylor's
Inquiry. There is no basis for a renewed application to the Divisional Court
or for the Attorney General to exercise his powers under the Coroners Act
1988. I do not consider that there is any material which should be put before
the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints Authority which
might cause them to reconsider the decisions they have already taken..."

"6...None of the evidence I was asked to consider added anything significant
to the evidence which was available to Lord Taylor's Inquiry or to the
Inquests".


The nature of the charges against the former officers and the merits of the
charges

8.9.1     Each of Messrs Duckenfield and Murray face two charges of
          manslaughter and one charge of wilful neglect to perform a public
                    duty. Paragraphs 5.2.3 (a) and (b) above set out the elements of these
                    offences.

           8.9.2    The Authority has requested Leading Counsel for each of the former
                    officers, namely William Clegg QC for Mr Duckenfield and Michael
                    Harrison QC for Mr Murray, to provide an opinion on these matters.

           8.9.3    In appendix 9 is a copy of their joint opinion and a copy of Mr
                    Murray's representations to the DPP.

    8.10   The likely costs to the Authority of providing financial assistance sought
           for the Leeds Criminal Proceedings

           These are referred to in paragraph 6.

    8.11   Availability7of alternative sources of funding

           8.11.1   In   W ilson a n d D alton,   the court considered whether the fact that Mr
                    Wilson and Mr Dalton's costs had been met by the Police Federation
                    was a relevant consideration which could be properly taken into
                    account in considering whether to reimburse those costs to Mr
                    Wilson and Mr Dalton. The report of the Police Authority's decision
                    in that case stated "any reimbursement of costs would in effect be a
                    reimbursement to the Police Federation of its costs". The court held
                    that the fact that an officer has been provided with legal
                    representation by the Federation was an irrelevant consideration.
                    Lord Justice Ralph Gibson said
#                   "Mr Underhill [Counsel for Mr Wilson and Mr Dalton] submitted
                    that this was wholly irrelevant; the fact that these two officers had
                    been supported by the.- Federation did not affect in any relevant way
                    the merits of their applications, and, if their applications were good,
                    so that they were entitled to reimbursement in whole or in part, they
                    should be allowed. It is, of course, a commonplace of the exercise of
                    discretion as to costs in our courts that in general, no attention is paid
                    to the fact that a plaintiff or defendant is entitled, in right of his
                    membership of a trade union, to legal representation. His right to an
                    order for costs depends in the ordinary case, upon the merits of his
                    claim thereto. The fact that his union supports him is as irrelevant as
                    the fact, if it should be the case, that he borrowed the money for his



                                                     45
         costs from his parents on terms that he would not be expected to
         repay it.... for my part I have no doubt that Mr Underhill's primary
         submission is correct and that, having regard to the terms of the
         circular, the mere fact that an officer has been provided with legal
         representation by the Federation is irrelevant to the question whether
         an application for reimbursement should be granted... .that
         conclusion does not mean that a Police Authority could in no case
         whatever have regard as to w'hether the Federation had provided the
         legal representation or whether it had been paid for by the officer
         personally. An application might be very finely balanced, having
         regard to the various factors to be weighed. If, in a particular case, a
         Police Authority was minded to take into account, in support of a
         plea based on severe financial hardship, that an officer was
         personally liable for the costs, I consider the Authority would be
         entitled to have such regard to it as it would think proper in the
         circumstances".

8.11.2   In Garretts' opinion, the availability or otherwise of Legal Aid should
         be considered in light of the following:

         (a)    The fact that Legal Aid is not available to Mr Duckenfield and
                Mr Murray in the judicial review proceedings and that a
                significant personal contribution may be required in respect
                of the Leeds Criminal Proceedings and the South Sefton
                Criminal Proceedings may add weight to any plea from the
                former officers of severe financial hardship in support of their
                applications;

         (b)    It is arguable that both   R v Gloucestershire C o u n ty Council and

                another, ex parte B arry [1997] 2 A L L E.R. 1       and   R v C hief

                Constable o f Sussex, ex parte International T rader's Ferry L td

                [1997] 2 A L L E.R. 65   indicate that the availability of funding
                sources other than the Authority's own resources would be
                relevant. Both cases emphasise the fact that the legal duties
                of an authority are qualified by the resources available to that
                authority. It is acknowledged that where an authority has a
                limited budget to satisfy various demands which it has a duty




                                    46
                     to fulfil, it is entitled to decide how to best allocate that
                     budget to the maximum advantage of the maximum number
                     of persons who are entitled to its services, and must weigh up
                     the needs of one such person against another;

             (c)     Given the acknowledgement in these cases of the need for
                     police or other relevant authorities to spread limited
                     resources between a number of different obligations, and to
                     weigh up the needs of one potential beneficiary against
                     another, it would seem inappropriate to exclude from
                     consideration the fact that the officers, in this case, might
                     receive financial support from the legal aid fund to mitigate
                     their costs, whilst paying the costs might deprive the force of
                     the funds required for other police purposes;

             (d)    Any assistance provided by the Authority in respect of future
                     legal costs will be added to Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray's
                     capital resources in assessing their eligibility for legal aid. In
                     effect this means that any funding by the Authority will
                     correspondingly reduce any contribution which the Legal Aid
                     Fund would otherwise make to their costs; and

             (e)    It is unlikely that Legal Aid will be awarded retrospectively
                     and accordingly the former officers costs after 5 February
                     1999 may be recoverable from no-one, if the Authority are
                     unwilling to meet these costs.
#

             We have asked the Solicitors for Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray to
             provide details of their clients eligibility for legal aid, but this is still
             awaited.

    8.11.3   Criminal Costs - Central Funds

             If Messrs Duckenfield and Murray were tried but acquitted, or the
             charges against them were dismissed at committal, or otherwise did
             not proceed to trial in the Crown Court, an order for costs in their
             favour to be paid out of central funds will be made unless there are
             positive reasons for not doing so. Examples of such reasons include:




                                          47
•        circumstances where their conduct has brought suspicion on
         themselves and has mislead the prosecution into thinking that
         the case against them is stronger than it is; and

•        circumstances where there is ample evidence to support a
         conviction but they are acquitted on a technicality which has
         no merit.

It will be recalled that such an order for costs was made in the South
Sefton Criminal Proceedings but that the Q erk to the Justices of the
South Sefton Magistrates' Court is considering whether Messrs
Duckenfield and Murray should have their costs reimbursed. The
Clerk to the Justices has based his reasoning on the decision in M iller.

In   M iller,   the Defendant was acquitted of causing an affray
whereupon an order was made in his favour for payment of his costs
out of central funds. When the costs were submitted for assessment
by the court, the court declined to assess the costs on the grounds that
the Defendant had not "incurred" costs as these had been met by his
employer.

On appeal to the High Court, it was held that a Defendant has
incurred costs if he is responsible for their payment, even though his
employers would have met the costs. In order to show that costs were
not incurred by the Defendant, it was necessary to establish that there
was an agreement binding on the solicitors that they would in no
circumstances seek to recover costs from the Defendant.

The Clerk to the Justices contends that, in the light of       M iller,   the
assistance evidenced by the Authorities letters of 5 March 1998 to Mr
Duckenfield and 29 June 1998 to Mr Murray establishes that they have
not incurred legal costs. The solicitors for Messrs Duckenfield and
Murray have challenged this view, and Garretts opinion is firmly that
their challenge is correct (unless of course they have entered into
agreements with their respective clients to the effect that they will not
seek to recover costs from them).

Therefore, if the Authority were to re-instate the financial assistance
granted in 1998 in respect of both past and future costs, Messrs
Duckenfield and Murray should not be denied payment of their costs
       out of central funds on the principle enunciated in     M iller.   However,
       as the South Sefton Case shows, it is not uncommon for a court to
       deny a successful party its costs if another party is meeting these costs.
       There is therefore a risk that, even if Messrs Duckenfield and Murray
       are acquitted, the Authority will not be reimbursed the costs it has
       funded, even though M ille r indicates this is wrong.

       Whilst the former officers could challenge such a refusal, there is also
       a danger that, wrere a further challenge to the High Court to be made,
       it might be held that    M ille r   was wrongly decided and that Messrs
        Duckenfield and Murray should not have their costs paid out of
       central funds. Further, even if such a challenge were made and failed,
       this will entail further applications to the court which the Authority
       would need to support as the Authority would be directly affected by
       the outcome.

       It should also be observed that were Messrs Duckenfield and Murray
       to be convicted, orders for the prosecution costs may be made against
       them where a court is satisfied that the convicted person has the
       means and ability to meet the costs. A court may be more inclined to
       find that Messrs Duckenfield and Murray had the means to meet the
       prosecution costs if it were aware that the costs of their Defence were
       being met by the Authority.

       In the light of these matters, we recommend that, if the Authority
       wishes to grant financial assistance in respect of the Leeds (and South
       Sefton) proceedings, Garretts be instructed to draw up an agreement
       with each of Messrs Duckenfield and Murray. This agreement should
       try to minimise the likelihood of the court declining reimbursement
       on grounds that Messrs Duckenfield and Murray had not incurred
       costs.


OPTIONS OPEN TO THE AUTHORITY

South Sefton Criminal Proceedings

As noted above, it is likely that Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray have a strong
case that the Authority is legally bound to pay their reasonable costs incurred
in the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings. However, in view7of the fact that
the Clerk to the South Sefton Justices has yet to make a decision as to
payment of the costs from central funds, the Authority is recommended to
defer its decision on the costs of these proceedings until the Clerk's decision is
known.

South Sefton Judicial Review

The Authority is recommended to defer consideration of whether to provide
assistance in the proposed judicial review of the decision of the Clerk to the
South Sefton Justices whether to pay the former officers' costs from central
funds until it is known what his decision is.

The Leeds Criminal Proceedings

9.3.1    As noted above, Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray have a strong case
         that the        Authority is legally bound to pay their reasonable costs
         incurred in the Leeds Criminal Proceedings up until 5 February 1999.
         The Authority is therefore recommended to pay these costs and to
         ask a legal costs draftsman to review the expenses claimed and/or
         apply to the Court for an assessment of the costs under Section 71
         Solicitors Act 1974.

9.3.2    In relation to costs incurred since 5 February 1999, the options open
         to the Authority include:-

         A.         Rejection

         B.         Deferring consideration of the costs of the charge against
                    Mr Duckenfield of tending to pervert the course of
                    justice to await the outcome of his application to central
                    funds for costs

         C.         Deferring consideration on the other charges until after
                    the conclusion of the proceedings or the conclusion of
                    the committal proceedings on the grounds that only then
                    can the Authority know the circumstances of the
                    prosecution cases against Messrs Duckenfield and Murray,
                    and the likely cost of granting financial assistance.

         D.         Approving    the    application   subject   to   terms   and
                    conditions, e.g:-
that an agreed overall budget for the defendant's maximum
costs should be fixed and other conditions for meeting the
legal costs imposed including:-

       (i) that the number of solicitors working on the case
           should not exceed a specified number, nor should
           there be more than a specified number of partners;

       (ii) the hourly rates payable for each level of fee earner is
           fixed;

       (iii) rules on attendance of solicitors at hearings, meetings
           and interviews are set;

       (iv) the circumstances in which Counsel and Leading
           Counsel may be used, and the hourly or daily rates
           payable for Counsel is agreed;

 (v)      that the costs of any other party which are awarded
           against Mr Duckenfield or Mr Murray will not be met
           by the Authority;

 (vi)     that the costs be monitored on a regular basis;

 (vii)    that the Authority’s contribution to Mr Duckenfield or
           Mr Murray's legal costs may be withdrawn and/or
           clawed back if they have misled the Authority about
           their case, failed to provide adequate evidence of the
           costs they have incurred or otherwise conducted their
           case unreasonably;

(viii)    that the Authority reserve the right to have the former
           officer's costs up to Committal reviewed by a legal
           costs draughtsman appointed by the Authority and to
           pay such costs only to the extent that the Authority
           advise these have been reasonably and properly
           incurred.

 The Authority- approves funding, at this stage, only up to the
 conclusion of the committal hearing, when the prosecutions
 may in any case come to an end, further relevant
         circumstances come to light and the costs of funding to a full
         trial become easier to predict by the Authority.

E.      That the Authority will meet a specific proportion of the
        costs only.




F.      That financial assistance is approved in principle, subject to
        the outcome of the proceedings. For example, it might be
        provided that costs be met upon acquittal of the officers and
        equally, costs could be conditional on conviction because,
        arguably, Messrs Duckenfield and Murray would not require
        financial assistance if they were acquitted because their costs
        will be met out of central funds. However, it would appear
        unreasonable or irrational to provide assistance conditional
        on conviction, and would increase the likelihood of a costs
        order being made against Messrs Duckenfield and Murray if
        it were known that their costs on conviction were being met
        by the Authority7.

G.      to provide financial assistance by way of loan on the basis
        that if Messrs Duckenfield and Murray are acquitted, they
        should have the funding to repay the authority from the costs
        award made from central funds.

Taking no decision, pending any decision by the Legal Aid
Authorities as to whether, and if so on w7hat terms, to make legal aid
available to Messrs Duckenfield and Murray would appear not to be
an option, as we are told by their solicitors that the legal aid
authorities are not willing to decide on any application from them
for funding, unless and until the Authority itself rejects funding
them.

It is recommended that, if financial assistance is to be provided, it
should be provided:-

(a)     until the end of committal only at which time any further
        applications should be considered afresh;
                  (b)    under an agreement with Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray
                         which makes the Authority's obligation to reimburse their
                         costs subject to specific limits and conditions such as these set
                         out at paragraph 9.3.2 D above; and

                  (c)    within a structure designed to fall within M ille r so that, as far
                         as possible, an order for costs from central funds is not
                         precluded in the event of an acquittal.

    9.4   The DPP Judicial Review

          9.4.1   The options for the Authority are to

                  (a)    reject the applications; or

                  (b)    grant the applications subject to assessment of the costs by a
                         legal costs draftsm an; or

                  (c)    award a proportion of the costs, for example by refusing to
                         pay the costs awarded against Messrs Duckenfield and
                         Murrayj in favour of the DPP.

          9.4.2   The application should, however, be deferred pending details of the
                  costs claimed by the DPP against Messrs Duckenfield and Murray.

    9.5   The Powers Tudicial Review

          It is recommended that the application for Messrs Duckenfield and Murray’s
m
          costs for these proceedings be deferred to await assessment and payment of
          the costs order obtained against Ms Adlington.

    Dear Mr Duckenfield

    Lecal A s s is ta n c e

    This letter is addressed in identical terms to David Duckenfieid and Trevor 3ichard.

    Home Office Circular 77/87 provides for Police Authorities to provide financial assistance
    for legal representation for police officers (serving, or retired).

    re:',owing me puoiscaJon, on 1o peo fua iy i ^^o, or u.crw ju stice S;uart*Smitn 3 Scrutiny
    report cn the Hillsborough Disaster leading —embers of the Hillsborough Family Support
    Group have spoken openly of prosecuting people for alleged offences in connection with
    that disaster.

    They refer to prosecuting;

    a)      David Duckenfield for manslaughter

    b)      Trevor Bichard for perjury.

    W e cannot be sure whether they will follow through into action nor can we be sure of when
    they may act.

    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny report reviews the process by which the Director of
j   Public Prosecutions (DPP) decided, in 1990, not to prosecute for manslaughter. Sir Murray
k   Stuart-Smith finds no fault in the decision making process and says that no new evidence
    has come to light since that decision was made.
                                                                           i
    The allegation of perjury is more recent and revolves around the assertion by some
    members of the Hillsborough Family Support Group that Trevor Bichard lied on oath about
    the functionality of the CCTV system. Sir Murray dismisses any suggestion that Trevor
    Told lies.

The members of the Police Authority have resolved to make the offer of financial
assistance for legal representation to officers who may be in jeopardy from Hillsborough
Disaster related prosecutions. If you wish to use this facility you must apply.

The members have agreed to allow the Chairman, the Clerk and I to decide on such
applications on their behalf. For simplicity, I suggest that you endorse this letter with words
to the effect of, “I wish to apply for financial-assistance for legal representation as outlined
in this letter"', sign and date. As soon as I receive your reply the Clerk and I can consider
your application.

The Chief Constable has used Winckworth Pemberton Solicitors, 35 Great Peter Street,
W estminster, London, SW1P 3LP (Telephone 0171 5935000) in connection with Sir
Murray's Scrutiny. They came well recommended and have been of great assistance. Nick
Owston, Ailsa Lawrence and Simon Eastwood have mastered the complexities of the
disaster and subsequent enquiries. I suggest that you use their services.

if ycur appiication for financial assistance is approved and you are happy to use
W inckw crth Pemberton their bills will come direct to us.

I have already asked Simon and Ailsa to research the procedures by which a private
prosecution is initiated; who does what, where, vyhen and how. If you are content to use
their sepyices, Simon suggested a meeting at an early opportunity, it would help me to be
at that meeting and perhaps the three of us could attend together.

if I can be of any assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me. This must be a vyorrying
time for you. I am cn leave 2-S March 1998 but we are not going away and my secretary,
Nina K azlshursi will phene me daily with any news.

Yours sincerely                                          .'   "   '

The South Yorkshire Police Authority recently resolved to provide, financial assistance for
legal representation of serving and retired police officers who face private prosecutions
arising cut of the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster of 15 April 193S. The members of the
Authority delegated to you the pow er to deal with specific requests.

Chief Superintendent (retired) David Duckenfield and Sergeant Trevor Bichard applied for
financial assistance for legal -.representation., and it.w=.s„ granted. -I attach an appiication
from Superintendent (retired) Bernard MURRAY. He was second in command t o Mr
Duckenfield at Hillsborough Stadium. Mr MURRAY has received summonses to appear
before Bootle Magistrates on 17 July 1SS8 to answer criminal charges arising out of the
disaster. Mr Murray received the summonses on 27 June 1SS8.

In 1SS0 the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) ruled that there should be no
prosecutions arising from the disaster. In February 1SS8 Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, an
Appeal C ourt Judge, found no reason to recommend that the DPP reconsider his ruling.

M r Murray acted in good faith in his policing of the football match that became the
Hillsborough Disaster. Nine years after the tragedy he faces a prosecution for unlawful
killing which can carry a prison sentence. He will contest the charges. It would be
damaging to the morale of the Force if Mr Murray were left to meet his legal costs without
assistance.

On 15th April 1989 I w as a superintendent o f the South Yorkshire Police,
stationed at Hammerton R oad Police Station and was on duty in charge o f
the control room at the F.A. cup semi-final at Hillsborough football
stadium, before and during the terrible events that occurred on that day. I
have always maintained that I acted in good faith and to the best o f my
ability. I gave evidence at the public enquiry' that followed the tragedy,
and gave evidence at the subsequent Inquest, which resulted in a verdict of
accidental death on those who lost their lives. At the Inquest I was legally
represented by M r Richard Manning of Walker Morris, solicitors o f        ' ~
Leeds. After representation, the legal costs incurred were met by South
Yorkshire Police Authority.

As a result o f the trauma o f the events of 15L1 April, 1989, and the
subsequent pressures, South Yorkshire Police retired me on ill health
grounds in August 1992.

On 26th June 1998, my wife accepted a summons on my behalf, a copy of
which is attached. I deny all the allegations and it is my intention to
contact M r. Manning and seek his advice, but in order to seek proper
representation I would request that the Police Authority is approached,
with a view to reimbursing me any legal expenses that I m ay incur in
defending myself.

i)               the decisions taken in principle on 27th February 1998 to provide financial
                   assistance to Mr David Duckenfield and Mr Bernard Murray in relation to

ii)              further applications for financial assistance from Mr David Duckenfield and
                   Mr Bernard Murray to meet their respective legal costs and disbursements in
                   proposed proceedings for judicial review of:

                   a.               the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service not to intervene to take
                                      over the conduct of the private prosecutions brought against them by
                                      Ms Ann Adlington, Solicitor, on behalf of the Hillsborough Family
                                      Support Group ("HFSG");

                   b.               an adverse ruling by the Clerk to the South Sefton Justices on claims
                                      made for the payment of costs from central funds;

                   to the Authority;

RESOLUTIONS OF THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY ON
FRIDAY, 5 FEBRUARY 1999

1.              In the light of legal advice, including advice from leading Counsel, members
               are recommended to resolve that, on balance, the Authority has no legal power
               to provide financial assistance to Mr David Duckenfield or Mr Bernard Murray
               in relation to their costs and expenses of defending the private prosecutions
              brought against them by the HFSG, by Information dated 10 July 1998, and


j \ g a r r e t t \ s o u t h y o r k s h i r e p o l i c e / f x - o o o ii .d o c         1
           accordingly to determine that any previous decision of the Authority, or any
           officer acting under its authority, to make such assistance available is null and
           void.

2.         In the light of legal advice, including advice from leading Counsel, members
           are recommended to resolve that, on balance, the Authority has no legal power
           to provide financial assistance to Mr David Duckenfield or Mr Bernard Murray
           in relation to the costs of any judicial review proceedings brought by either of
           them; whether relating to the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service not to
           take over the conduct of the private prosecutions and discontinue such
           prosecutions, or to any decision of the Clerk to the Sefton Magistrates' Court to
           challenge the payment of the officers' costs of proceedings before that court
           from central funds, or to any other decision of any court, authority or body
           arising from such prosecutions; and, accordingly, to reject the applications of
           Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murrav for financial assistance in relation to such
           proceedings.

3.         In recognition of the fact that the legal advice provided to the Authority is that
           it remains arguable that power exists to provide the assistance referred to in 1
           and 2 above, to take such action as the Clerk and Treasurer, in consultation
           with the Chief Constable, the Authority's legal advisers and the Chairman of
           the Authority7, may decide as appropriate to have the decisions referred to in 1
           and 2 reviewed by the High Court and to expedite such review with a view to
           clarifying the Authority's powers in this regard.

4.         To defer consideration of the procedural issues raised by Ms Adlington, in her
           letters of 22 December 1998 to the Clerk and Treasurer and 5 January 1999 to
           the members of the Authority7, until the legal power of the Authority to provide
           the financial assistance referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 has been resolved to
            the satisfaction of the Authority.

               criminal liability.

6.             15 August 1989: Director of Public Prosecutions recommended that the matter
               should be subject of a full criminal investigation. Mr Dear, Chief Constable of
               West Midlands Police, invited to undertake this investigation. Also asked that
               if he discovers any matters against the Police (Discipline) Regulations, he
               enquires into them on behalf of South Yorkshire Police.

        having to await the outcome of legal hearings.

8.     15 December 1989: Agreement reached with representatives of the bereaved for
        settlement of civil actions without a decision as to liability.

9.     Full criminal and disciplinary investigation formally commenced.

10. 18 January 1990: Lord Justice Taylor's Final Report is published.

11. 31 March 1990 Mr Dear's report is submitted to Director of Public Prosecutions.

12. 30 August 1990 Director of Public Prosecutions, Allan Green QC, concludes
        that there is insufficient evidence upon which a prosecution for manslaughter,
        or any other criminal offence, could be brought against any officer in the South
        Yorkshire Police, or any other person.

        Murray.

16. 11 July 1991 the Police Complaints Authority direct that Chief Superintendent
        Duckenfield should face four discipline charges of Neglect of Duty and one of
        Discreditable Conduct. In addition, Superintendent Murray should face one
        charge of Neglect of Duty.

17. November 1991 Chief Superintendent Duckenfield retires on medical grounds.

18. 13 January 1992 Police Complaints Authority gives leave not to proceed with
        the discipline charge against Superintendent Murray, as it would be
        inappropriate and unjust to pursue the charge against him alone, in the absence
        of his superior officer.

20.         The relatives of six deceased are granted an application for judicial review into
             the inquest verdicts. They sought certiorari to quash the jury's verdict.

21.         The judicial review concludes that the inquest verdicts were correct.

22.         Inquest held by HM Coroner for West Yorkshire into the death of Anthony
             Bland (the 96th victim of Hillsborough). A verdict of accidental death was
             returned.

23.          5 December 1996 the drama "Hillsborough" written by Jimmy McGovern on
             behalf of Granada Television, is broadcast on the ITV Network. Following this
             programme further material is submitted to the Home Office. Those
             representations related in particular to video evidence of the disaster and
             medical evidence about the time of death of the victims.

24.          30 June 1997 the Home Secretary made an oral statement to the House of
             Commons during the course of which he stated:



                           "Madam Speaker, my Department, the office of the Attorney General and
                           the Crown Prosecution Service have considered very carefully all the
                           evidence which has been put forward in recent months.


                           The Director of Public Prosecutions has taken the view that the material
                          so far presented to. her would not justify fresh criminal investigations.
                          The then Attorney General also took the view, again on the material
                          presented to him, that any application to the High Court for a new
                          inquest would not have any realistic prospect of succeeding.


                          Nonetheless, I am acutely conscious that the families of those who died at
                           Hillsborough and many others including Hon Members of this House are
                          very concerned that unresolved issues remain. I am determined to go as
                          far as I can to ensure that no matter of significance is overlooked and that
                          we do not reach a final conclusion without a full and independent
                          examination of the evidence.


                          I can therefore tell the House today that the Attorney General, the
                          Director of Public Prosecutions and I have agreed that it is in the public

             interest that there should be an independent scrutiny to ascertain
             whether there now exists any new evidence relating to the disaster which
             was not previously available. We are appointing Lord Justice Stuart-
             Smith, a senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal, for that purpose".

25.    18 February 1998, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's Scrutiny Report is presented to
       the House of Commons. He concluded that:

       25.1 there was no basis upon which there should be a further judicial inquiry
              or a reopening of Lord Taylor's Inquiry;

       25.2. there was no basis for a renewed application to the Divisional Court or
              for the Attorney General to exercise his powers under the Coroners Act
              1988;

       25.3 he did not consider there was any material which should be put before
              the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints Authority
              which might cause them to reconsider decisions they had already taken.

B     APPLICATIONS FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE


1     INTRODUCTION

1.1 Applications have been submitted to the Authority by Mr David Duckenfield
        and Mr Bernard Murray, formerly a Chief Superintendent and Superintendent
        respectively in the South Yorkshire Police Force, for financial assistance to meet
        the costs of their legal representation in three different sets of legal proceedings
        which will be referred to as "the Criminal Proceedings", "the CPS proceedings",
        and "the Sefton proceedings" in this report. The Criminal Proceedings take the
        form of private prosecutions by the HFSG relating to actions which the officers
        took whilst on duty at Hillsborough Stadium, on 15th April 1989. The HFSG
        alleges that those actions led to the deaths of certain fans attending a match
        between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest football clubs.            The other two
        proceedings would, if launched, arise out of the criminal proceedings.


2     THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS

2.1 The criminal prosecutions brought by Ms Adlington, the solicitor representing
        the HFSG, charge Messrs Duckenfield and Murray with the manslaughter of
        John Alfred Anderson and James Gary Aspinall, two of the deceased from the


J GARRET 7   rY O K K Si :iKE PO LIC E/FN -00011.DOC   6
             Hillsborough disaster and also with wilful neglect to perform a public duty. In
             addition, Mr Duckenfield faces a charge of intentionally perverting the course
             of justice in lying about the circumstances in which Gate C at Hillsborough
             Stadium became open.

2.2          The essence of the manslaughter and wilful neglect charges appear to be that,
             being in a position of responsibility for ground safety, both officers allegedly
             acted with recklessness or gross negligence in failing to take, demand or
             recommend obvious steps to avoid the overcrowding which led to the
             Hillsborough disaster and in taking steps which added to the danger.

2.3          The essence of the charge of perverting the course of justice is that Mr
             Duckenfield allegedly misled Mr Graham Kelly and Mr Glen Kirton of the
             Football Association and Mr Graham Mackrell of Sheffield Wednesday Football
             Club about the reasons for the disaster by claiming that Gate C had been forced
             by supporters, knowing this not to be the case, and with intent to disguise the
             real cause of the Hillsborough disaster from any ensuing investigations or
             judicial proceedings.

2.4          All charges, if proven, are potentially punishable with imprisonment, at the
             discretion of the courts, and the charges of wilful neglect to perform a public
             duty and intentionally perverting the course of justice are, if proven, also
             potentially punishable by any fine the court considers appropriate.

2.5          The committal proceedings, at which Leeds Magistrates' Court will decide
             whether there is sufficient evidence against the two officers to justify a full
             criminal trial, is scheduled for early April 1999.

2.6          Copies of relevant correspondence relating to the applications submitted by Mr
             Duck^nfield and Mr Murray, which were supported by the Chief Constable, arc
             attached at Appendices B1 and B2. As previously reported, the Clerk and
             Treasurer acting on behalf of the Authority (and on the basis of advice from the
             Assistant Clerk and Solicitor) approved the provision of financial assistance to
             meet such reasonable expenses as the officers might incur in defending the
             criminal proceedings.

2.7          The Authority has already paid £11,824 costs of the criminal proceedings
             (inclusive of VAT) to the solicitors representing Mr Duckenfield. A further
             invoice for £34,492.16 (inclusive of VAT) for work up to 18th September 1998 has

          been submitted by Mr Duckenfield's solicitors but not paid by the Authority.
           No invoices have, to date, been submitted by Mr Murray's solicitor,


3       THE CPS PROCEEDINGS

3.1 The Director of Public Prosecutions under the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985,
           has a discretion, but not a duty, to take over the conduct of private
           prosecutions. Having taken over such proceedings he may under Section 23 of
           the 1985 Act discontinue proceedings if the evidence is insufficient or if the
           proceedings would be contrary to the public interests or to avoid duplication or
          for any other good reason,

3.2 In July 1998, the solicitors acting for Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray wrote to
           the Crown Prosecution Service asking it to take over the criminal proceedings
          brought against their respective clients by Ms Adlington on behalf of the HFSG,

3.3 On the 18 November 1998, the Crown Prosecution Service notified the solicitors
           that, having considered the evidence, the representations made by the parties
          and all the surrounding circumstances, it had decided not to intervene to take
           over any of the charges.                              The Crown Prosecution Service has still, as at 1
           February 1999, not provided the reasons for this decision, despite an
           undertaking to do so "in January 1999".

4       THE SEFTON PROCEEDINGS

4.1       The Criminal Proceedings above were initially commenced in the South Sefton
           Magistrates' Court.                      However, as the alleged offences were not committed
           within that area and neither defendant resides within that Court's area, the
           officers' solicitors objected to the prosecution being undertaken at that Court.
           Those objections were upheld by the Court and an order was made for the
           payment of the defendants' costs from central funds. The Clerk to the Justices
           has now questioned the claims which have been submitted for the officers'
           costs because the Authority7 has agreed to fund their legal representation (but
           the Clerk has not yet made a final ruling). The applications made for funding
           to pursue a challenge to an adverse decision are included within the papers
           which are attached as Appendices B3 and B4.

c           DECISION MAKING PROCESS TO PATE


1          MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED BY THE AUTHORITY

1.1         In deciding whether to meet the legal costs of former Chief Superintendent
            David Duckenfield and former Superintendent Bernard Murray, (whether in
            relation to the criminal proceedings or any of the other potential proceedings
            referred to above) the Authority is subject to the public law principles of
            decision making. Briefly, these are that it must (amongst other things):

              •       act within whatever statutory powers are conferred upon it by Act of
                      Parliament;

              •       act with procedural fairness;

              •       take all relevant considerations into account;

              •       ignore all irrelevant considerations;

              •       not act irrationallv;

              •       not fetter its discretion;

              •       not unlawfully delegate the decision making function.

1.2         Failure to comply with any of these principles will expose the decision to
            challenge by judicial review.

1.3         The decision making process to date in respect of financial assistance to Mr
            Duckenfield and Mr Murray has been as follows:


2          MEETING OF THE POLICE AUTHORITY ON 1st AUGUST 1997

2.1         At this meeting, the Clerk and Treasurer and the Chief Constable submitted a
            joint report informing members of the appointment of Lord Justice Stuart-
            Smith to conduct a scrutiny into aspects of the Hillsborough disaster.

2.2         At that meeting, the Authority made the following resolutions:

                         "1 - That approval be given to the provision of up to £500,000 from
                         reserves for expenditure likely to be incurred in respect of the scrutiny.



J \G A R R E T T \5 0 L T H Y 0 R K 5 H IR E P 0 L 1 C E / FX-OOOll.DOC   10
                      2 - That approval be given to a commitment to provide financial
                      assistance for legal representation for officers (serving and retired) in
                      connection with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's scrutiny in accordance with
                       the principles set out in the Home Office Circular 77/87 Financial
                       Assistance to Police Officers in Legal Proceedings.

                      3 - That the Clerk and Treasurer be authorised to determine individual
                       applications for financial assistance in consultation with the Chief
                       Constable".


3          MEETING OF THE POLICE AUTHORITY O N 27™ FEBRUARY 1998

3.1        Shortly after the presentation of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's scrutiny report to
           the House of Commons, the members of the Authority agreed to consider an
           item relating to Hillsborough. Assistant Chief Constable Daines gave an oral
           report to the Authority on the findings of the Scrutiny and advised members
           that private prosecutions                               had been threatened against three officers.   The
           general issue of the provision of financial assistance to the officers concerned
           was addressed.                       It was             recognised that   actual decisions about financial
           support could be made only on individual application.                                      Members were
           accordingly invited to delegate the determination of individual applications to
           the Clerk and Treasurer. Members resolved as follows:

                       "1 - That in the light of the findings of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's inquiry
                       and his comments on the outcome, members do not believe there is anv
                                                                               '                                   j



                       new evidence to cause them to reconsider the Authority's previous view,
                       and remain of the opinion that the officers acted in good faith.

                       2 - That the Authority agrees to authorise the Clerk and Treasurer to
                       consider applications for financial assistance from officers (serving and
                       retired) in accordance with the provisions of Home Office Circular 77/87,
                       Financial Assistance to Police Officers in Legal Proceedings".

3.2           On 28 February 1998, Mr Duckenfield applied to Assistant Chief Constable
           Daines Daines for financial assistance from the Authority for legal
           representation. On 2nd March 1998, Assistant Chief Constable Daines wrote to
           the Clerk and Treasurer asking them to approve Mr Duckenfield's request. At
           the request of the Authority's solicitor, Ms Maureen Oades, Assistant Chief
           Constable Daines provided supporting information on 5th March 1998 to the
           Clerk and Treasurer. These letters are attached at Appendix Bl. Following


J\G A R R ETT \SO U TH Y O R K SH IR EPO LIC E/FN -O O O n.D O C          11
         receipt of this letter, the Clerk and Treasurer approved Mr Duckenfield's
         application towards the costs of legal representation in the event of a private
         prosecution being brought against him in connection with the Hillsborough
         disaster.


4       MEETING OF THE POLICE AUTHORITY ON 24™ APRIL 1998

         On 24th April, the Chief Constable and Clerk and Treasurer submitted a joint
         report to members requesting that members note the expenditure of £11,900 on
         the Chief Constable's costs in connection with the Scrutiny from the earmarked
         reserve and requesting members to agree that the earmarked reserve continue
         to be held for purposes related to the Hillsborough disaster. The Authority
         resolved as follows:

                   "1 - That the use of the funds to date be noted.

                   2 - That the Authority agree, for the time being, to maintain the
                   earmarked reserve for future costs associated with the Hillsborough
                   Stadium disaster, subject to periodic reports and expenditure from the
                   reserve".


5       APPLICATION OF 28™ JUNE 1998 FROM MR BERNARD MURRAY

         By letter dated 28thJune 1998, Mr Murray informed the Chief Constable that his
         wife had accepted a summons on his behalf arising from the events of the
         Hillsborough disaster and requesting that the Police Authority reimburse any
         legal expenses that he may incur in defending himself. The next day, Assistant
         Chief Constable Daines wrote to the Clerk and Treasurer setting out the
         reasons for his support of Mr Murray's application and the application was
         approved by the Clerk and Treasurer that day.


6       THE CLERK AND TREASURER'S DECISIONS

         In approving both of these applications, the Clerk and Treasurer consulted the
         Authority's legal adviser and took into account a number of considerations.
         These included:

6.1     The terms of the Home Office Circular 4/1998 relating to financial assistance to
         police officers in legal proceedings.

D           POTENTIAL CHALLENGE


1        Ms Adlington, on behalf of the HFSG, has raised a number of questions about
         the decision making process to date and has indicated that she is considering
         commencing judicial review proceedings against the Authority.


2        On 22nd December 1998, following a report by the BBC that the Authority had
         agreed to pay the legal costs of Messrs Duckenfield and Murray, Ms Adlington
         wrote to the Clerk and Treasurer to the Authority (Appendix Dl) challenging
         the Authority's power to provide such assistance on a number of grounds,
         including the following:

         2.1       that there was no legal authority under statute for the Authority to pay
                   the legal costs of a police officer (serving or former) in relation to criminal
                   proceedings against him/her;

         2.2       that even if such an authority existed, it had been exercised improperly in
                   this case as the Authority had taken into account a number of irrelevant
                   considerations, ignored a number of relevant considerations and
                   delegated powers, which it should itself have exercised, to the Clerk and
                   Treasurer.


3        On 5th January 1999, the solicitor to the Authority sought preliminary advice
         from barrister, Mr Bernard Phillips. He confirmed that the general principle of
         whether to afford assistance at all was a matter for the discretion of the
          Authority. In the light of the representations received from Mrs Adlington,
         however, he believed that the decision should be reconsidered by the
          Authority.


4         On 5th January 1999 Ms Adlington wrote a further letter to all the members of
          the Authority (which members have already received) making additional
          points about the propriety of the decision to make financial assistance available
          to the officers. She has subsequently supplemented that letter with a fax to
          Garretts, the solicitors instructed by the Authority, dated 29 January 1999
          (Appendix D2).




J \G A R R E T T \ SO UTH YORKSHIREPOLICE/FN’*00011. DO C   14
5         On 12th January 1999 the solicitor to the Authority took legal advice on the two
          letters received from Ms Adlington from Leading Counsel, Richard Mawrey
          QC. His advice, which is referred to in more detail in Sections E and F below,
          was that there was a power to provide financial assistance to police officers in
          legal proceedings.                      However, this could only be exercised in appropriate
          circumstances and only to cover "out of pocket" expenses, (but not expenditure
          which would otherwise be paid from central funds or by the Legal Aid Board).
          He added that the HFSG might seek to challenge the procedure by which such
          powers had been exercised because it covered more than "out of pocket"
          expenditure, with some prospect of success and that accordingly the Authority
          should be asked to reconsider its original decision in order to ensure it took
          take account of all relevant considerations, including those Mr Adlington
          alleges might have been overlooked earlier.


6          On 15th January 1999, the Authority7instructed Garretts, solicitors, to advise the
           Authority in reconsidering its decision to make financial assistance available to
           the officers for the criminal proceedings and considering the new applications
           for financial support for judicial review proceedings. Garretts, whose advice is
           also referred to below in more detail, expressed its own concern about the
           statutory power to give financial support to officers in these circumstances and
           recommended that a second opinion be sought from Presiley Baxendale QC
           and Mark Shaw . Their advice was then taken and, for the reasons set out
           below, they reinforced Garretts' concern about the existence of such a power.

E                  STATUTORY POWERS


1           HOME OFFICE GUIDANCE

1.1 Home Office Circular 77/87 - (Financial Assistance to Police Officers in Legal
               Proceedings) (attached as Appendix El) specifically stated, in the context of
              private prosecutions that where a member of the public brings a prosecution
              against an officer, in circumstances where he has acted in good faith and
              exercised his judgement reasonably, the Authority should provide or fund legal
               advice an d /o r representation. The Circular stated that an Authority had a
               discretion "to meet expenditure incurred by officers in all kinds of legal
              proceedings where the officers have acted in good faith in pursuance of their
              duties, or where the interests of the force as a whole are involved".

1.2 Circular 4/1998 (attached as Appendix E2) issued on 17 February 1998,
              replaced circular 77/87 with immediate effect. This circular, in common with
              circular 77/87 with immediate effect, also stated that it is important that police
              officers should be able to carry out their duties in the confidence that their
              Authority will support them if they act in good faith and exercise their
              judgement reasonably. However, it deals with the issue of an Authority's power
              to provide such assistance much less categorically than its predecessor. In
              particular, it states:

                             5. "Section 88(4) [of the Police Act 1996, which allows Police Authorities
                                      to pay the costs of police officers who are sued for damages for loss or
                                      damage caused to others by their alleged negligence or other torts]
                                      does not apply to criminal proceedings, but police authorities may
                                      wish to consult their legal advisers as to whether they have any other
                                      power to provide such assistance (whether in respect of private
                                      prosecutions or prosecutions brought by the CPS). In this context,
                                      they may wish to note that section 111(1) of the Local Government Act
                                      1972 enables police authorities to do anything "which is calculated to
                                      facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the discharge of any of their
                                      functions"                                  It could be argued that to allow payment to be made
                                      to officers (either former or serving) involved in criminal proceedings
                                      would in some way facilitate or be conducive to a policy authority's
                                      broad functions. For example, failure to provide financial assistance
                                      could adversely affect the morale of the force if officers had to meet
                                      their own costs after an acquittal.

              6. It is for individual police authorities to decide in the particular
                     circumstances of a case, and on the basis of legal advice, whether to
                     make              financial                 assistance    available      to   officers     in    criminal
                     proceedings."

It will be noted that the latest Home Office Circular specifically invites Police
Authorities to take legal advice whether the power to provide such assistance
exists, rather than asserting with certainty that it does in particular (non tort)
cases. Nevertheless, like its predecessor, the latest Circular does appear to
contemplate that the Authority7 is capable of giving the assistance in the right
case.


ADVICE OF RICHARD MAWREY QC

Richard Mawrey expressed the view that a power to provide financial
assistance to officers and former officers in legal proceedings of all types was
within the scope of section 6(1) of the Police Act 1996 read with section 111(1) of
 the Local Government Act 1972.

Section 6 of the Police Act 1996 gives the Police Authority its basic duty to
 secure "the maintenance of an efficient and effective police force for its area".

Section 111(1) of the Local Government Act 1972, which applies to police
authorities as it applies to local authorities, states:

              "Without prejudice to any powers exercisable apart from this section but
              subject to the provisions of this Act and any other enactment passed
              before or after this Act, a local authority shall have power to do anything
              (whether or not involving the expenditure, borrowing or lending of
              money or the acquisition or disposal of any property or rights) which is
              calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the discharge of
              any of their functions."

In this regard, Mr Mawrey relied upon                                         R - v - D erbyshire Police A u th o r ity ex parte

W ilson a n d D a lto n (1989)                             in which two police officers challenged a decision of
the Derbyshire Police Authority not to pay part of the legal expenses they
incurred in being represented at an auditor's enquiry into illegal expenditure.
In that case, Lord Justice Ralph Gibson overturned the decision of a panel of
the police authority not to award reimbursement of costs on the grounds that
the decision had been improperly taken by five members of the authority,


:T \S O L T H 1O R K S H IR E P O L IC E /F N -0 00 1 1.tX D C           17
   rather than the whole authority.                                         But he rejected a further contention that
   because the officers had acted in good faith, the authority should automatically
   have granted them financial assistance with their costs. Richard Mawrey QC
   thought that this indicated that the judge had implicitly accepted that a police
   authority could provide assistance with legal costs, (even in non tort cases
  which were outside the powers granted by section 88 of the Police Act 1996).


   GARRETTS’ ADVICE

   As already stated, Garretts were instructed to advise the Authority of the
   relevant factors to be taken into account in reconsidering the officers'
   applications for financial assistance with the criminal proceedings and the
   applications for support with the CPS proceedings and Sefton proceedings.

  After they were instructed, however, they raised fresh doubts about the basic
  power of the Authority to meet the officers' costs of the criminal proceedings
  and related judicial review proceedings. In particular, they were concerned
  that legal cases, following the                                     W ilson a n d D alton   case, on section 111(1) of the
  Local Government Act 1972, had considerably weakened the argument that the
  Authority had power under Section 6(1) of the Police Act 1996 and section
  111(1) of the Local Government Act 1972 to grant financial assistance to police
  officers in proceedings other than tort proceedings. In particular, they felt that
  the existence of section 88(4) of the Police Act 1996 (specifically allowing police
  authorities to pay such costs in tort cases) made it strongly arguable that such
  costs could not be paid in other types of proceedings.

  Given these concerns, Garretts recommended that a second opinion be sought
  from Presiley Baxendale QC and Mark Shaw.


  ADVICE OF PRESILEY BAXENDALE QC AND MR MARK SHAW

  Counsel advised that they had initially been attracted by the argument that the
  Authority had power to pay "out of pocket" legal costs and expenses of officers
  in all types of proceedings, where they had acted in good faith and it was
  otherwise appropriate. The wide duty conferred on the Authority by section 6
  of the Police Act 1996 to maintain an effective and efficient police force, in
  conjunction with Section 111(1) of the Local Government Act 1972, appeared to
  give a very broad discretion to the Authority to preserve the morale of the
  police force without which, an effective and efficient police force could not be


, : r r .tO L T H ^ G K K S H IR E P O L lC E /F N ^ O O ll.D C X :        IS
                maintained.                          Accordingly, if it was, in the Authority's view, genuinely and
                reasonably necessary, in order to maintain police morale, to meet the out of
                pocket costs and expenses of police officers, incurred in defending themselves
                against criminal or civil proceedings, it was arguably within Section 6 of the
                Police Act 1996, coupled with Section 111(1) of the Local Government Act 1972,
                to pay such costs.

 4.2            Counsel also considered, however, that there were powerful arguments against
                this interpretation including the following:

                4.2.1              If there were a general power under section 6 of the Police Act 1996 to
                                   indemnify officers against the costs of legal proceedings arising from
                                   the performance of their duties, there would be no reason for section
                                   88(4) of the Police Act 1996 specifically to allow the recovery of such
                                   costs in tort proceedings. Section 88(4) would simply be unnecessary.

                4.2.2             The issue turns on the proper construction of the Police Act 1996. In
                                   London Borough o f S u tton - v - M o rg a n Grenfell & Co L im ited (1996)                            the
                                   Court of Appeal stated that where Parliament had enacted specific
                                   provisions setting out how a local authority was intended to perform its
                                   functions, there was no room to imply other means of carrying out
                                   those functions under section 111(1) of the Local Government Act 1972.
                                   In particular, where a local authority was intended to have power to
                                  incur financial obligations that power must specifically be identified by
                                  statute. This was an example of a well established general principle of
                                  statutory interpretation: where Parliament specifies one particular
                                  matter, it impliedly excludes any other allied matters.                                    In addition,
                                  section 6 of the Police Act 1996 is so wide in its language that counsel
                                  doubt that recourse to section 111(1) of the Local Government Act 1972
                                  could usefully expand it. The real question is the relationship between
                                  section 6 and section 88.

               4.2.3              In the            W ilson a n d D alton              case, both parties had accepted that the basic
                                  power to meet the officers' costs existed, and accordingly this did not
                                  fall to be decided by the judge. The power to pay costs was therefore
                                  assumed not decided. Similarly, a Circular is only guidance. It does not
                                  define or modify the law and should not be assumed to be correct.

               4.2.4              Mr Justice Denning stated in A s k e y                        - v - Golden W in e Co L im ited (1948)   the
                                  public policy that the punishment inflicted by a criminal court is


j \ g a r r e t t \ s o l t h y o r k s h i r e p o u c e / f : - - vu r ; i . d o c      19
                             personal to the offender and that such an offender is not entitled to
                             recover from a third party an indemnity against the consequences of the
                              criminal proceedings whether that be a fine, an award against him of
                              the other party's costs or the accused's own legal costs. This public
                             policy helps to explain why section 88(4) of the Police Act 1996 does not
                              cover criminal proceedings.

            4.2.5             A judge would not necessarily consider it desirable for the Authority to
                             have such a power. Counsel considered that, in the light of                            A skey - v -

                              Golden W in e Co L im ited,                     it was doubtful if a police authority was
                             intended to have power to indemnify officers against costs of a case in
                             which they were found guilty. An acquitted defendant would, in any
                              event, normally receive an award that his/her reasonably incurred non
                             legally-aided costs be paid in full out of central funds, unless the
                              accused was at fault in bringing suspicion on himself or was found not
                              guilty on a technicality see                    Practice Direction (Crime: Costs) (1991) 1 W L R
                             498.         Accordingly, in the normal run, an acquitted police officer should
                             have no (or few) costs to pay himself/herself, which a police authority
                              would need to meet.

4.3          Counsel stressed that they had both found this issue difficult and that there
             was no guarantee which way a Court would decide.                                          There were certainly
            strong policy reasons why the Authority should have power to support its
             officers (current and former) in this way. Given the points summarised in
             paragraphs 4.2.1 to 4.2.5 above, however, they had considerable doubts about
             the power of the Authority to support the costs either of the criminal
             proceedings or the judicial review proceedings (neither being covered by
             Section 88(4) of the Police Act 1996), particularly before any judgement had
             been given in those proceedings.

4.4          Counsel are also mindful of the terms of the latest Home Office Circular. They
             do not lightly advise that it is wrong but it is much more hesitant that its
             predecessor. Counsel sense, therefore, that the Home Office may have its own
             doubts about the existence of this power.

4.5          Accordingly, whilst they wished to review the matter further in the light of any
             representations made on behalf of the officers, the Chief Constable or the
             HFSG, their current recommendation was that the Authority should resolve to
             reverse its earlier decision and decide that it has no power to provide the
             financial assistance which had been sought. It should then co-operate with


J\G A R R E T T \S O L T H Y O R K S H IR E P O U C E /F N -0 0 , 1 n o c ;    20
            those parties in bringing the matter before a court for an early decision on
            whether that view of their legal powers was correct. The Authority's solicitors,
            Garretts, agree with that recommendation and will be available at the next
            meeting of the Authority to discuss it with members.

F           PROCEDURAL CONSIDERATIONS

1.          Members will note from the correspondence from Ms Adlington that the
            decision to provide financial assistance to Messrs Duckenfield and Murray for
            their legal costs and expenses of the criminal proceedings is also challenged on
            procedural grounds. Representations are also made that it would not be
            appropriate to provide such assistance in relation to any challenge to the
             decision of the Crown Prosecution Service not to take over and discontinue the
            criminal proceedings or any other challenge to decisions taken in the course of
            the criminal proceedings, given the circumstances of these cases.

2.          Given the doubts about the underlying legal power of the Authority to provide
            such assistance at all, it is recommended that the Authority defers considering
             consequential procedural matters until the Authority has secured an
             authoritative (judicial) determination of the existence and extent of its
             underlying statutory power to provide the officers with financial assistance for
             criminal or judicial review proceedings.

3.           If the Authority7accepts the recommendations set out in this report, it is hoped
            that all concerned will co-operate in an urgent judicial review application. If
             the existence of the power is then established, the Authority will need to
            proceed immediately to decide how it should be exercised. It is hoped that a
            hearing can be secured before the Court in late February or early March to
            enable all concerned to know where they stand before the committal hearing in
            the Leeds Magistrates' Court in April. It should be in everyone's interests to
            clarify the legal position as soon as possible. This can be done definitely only
            by the Court.

prosecutions. It is clear that the criminal proceedings are now likely to be protracted,
complex and very expensive.




The prosecutions are straightforward. We enclose for your guidance a copy of the
informations presented to the Leeds Magistrates Court last July on the basis of which
the summonses were issued. You will see that the allegations are based upon the
findings of the Taylor Enquiry in I9S9, supported by evidence that has come to the
Family Support Group in 1997-9S. Negligence has been admitted again and again by
the Chief Constable in court proceedings. It has never been disputed that the acts
alleged against the defendants were the acts of negligence that caused the deaths of the
96 people.

Before the decision o f the Crown Prosecution Service was announced on 18"'
December, the solicitor for Mr Murray Indicated that it was highly likely that an
adverse decision o f the CPS would be challenged by judicial review proceedings. At
the hearing of the case before the Leeds Magistrates Court on 21s' December, it was
made clear by leading and junior counsel for Mr Murray, in the presence of his
solicitor, Mr Manning, and by junior counsel for Mr Duckenfield, that a decision had
already been made to seek judicial review~o’f the CPS decision. The magistrate was
told this by counsel for the defendants when he was dealing with the questions of
timetable and voluntary disclosure of documents.

However, it was also made clear, although a concluded decision had been made to
apply for judicial review, that the defendants had asked the CPS for their "reasons”;
alternatively. their “policy” behind the decision,and that those reasons‘or policy might
be received by 2'!"' December.

No legally-aided lawyers could proceed in this way. Professional obligations exist
uhich require that a lawyer must assess the prospects of success before committing
hard-pressed public funds to an expensive application for judicial review. I am advised
by leading counsel that-the prospects of quashing the CPS decision in such proceedings
are small on the following, among other, grounds. The CPS nave told us all what
criteria they vvs:e.appjylnu; the defendants argued;that the.CP S. we re in a good
position to assess the public interest InvolvedTn"the prosecution; the CPS, Police
Complaints Authority and Coroner were aii misled by a cover-up by the South
Yorkshire police, the magnitude of which has become apparent only after the Home
Office ordered the.release of documents.this year; and the defendants have alternative
remedies in the Magistrates’ court.

The fact that the court was assured that applications for judicial review would be made
suggests that the South Yorkshire Police~Authority-has already agreed, before the-CPS
decision, to fund these applications, irrespective-of their merits. Counsel would not
have told the court that the applications would be made, if funding was not in place.
Neither would they have told counsel for South Yorkshire Police of their decision to
apply to the High Court; they knew that the fact of impending applications was

                                        -5-
        material to decisions that the South Yorkshire police and the CPS were making that
        day about voluntary disclosure to the prosecution of documents in their possession. It
        is clear that both those bodies decided to defer any decision on voluntary disclosure
        because of the assurance from counsel that judicial review applications would be
        lodged (“in the first two weeks of January") on behalf of both defendants.


       Ti'.e prosecution and the Court have also been told that both defendants have estimated
       that four weeks at least will be needed at committal proceedings. The court has set
       aside four weeks beginning 19!h April 1999, and the time was chose to accord with the
       convenience of leading counsel for the defence. The court has been told that two
       leading counsel will appear, one for each defendant. No doubt two juniors will also
       appear, and two solicitors. Leading counsel for Mr Murray has indicated that there
       will also be an abuse o f process application to the magistrate to stay the proceedings.
       He intends to argue that this should be heard on a different occasion from the
       committal, and before it. I suspect that the defendants will seek leave to move for
       judicial review o f any adverse decision upon this issue. This is hardly surprising as
       your Authority does not appear to have placed any restriction as to the amount or
       duration of the financial assistance to the defendants.

        1 am advised by leading counsel that the prosecution has £~5trcng prima facie case on
        the charges alleged; and that an abuse of process application is likely to fail. We have
        a mass of evidence in our possession wiiic’n has come to us in the last year, indicating
        that the South Yorkshire Police force has_coyered up facts which are embarrassing ?.s
        to the nature and extent of its admitted negligence, and that the CPS, Coroner and
        Police Complaints Authority, inter alia, were misled when they were pursuing their
        various enquiries between 19S9 and 1992. I shall willingly help you further about this
        on request.

        Of course, the trial o f this matter could take many months. From ail these facts, you
        will see that the exposure of the South Yorkshire taxpayer (in relation to its own costs,
        let alone ours) is o f the order o f millions of pounds. I should make it clear that neither
        I nor the Hiilsborough Family Support Group, on whose behalf I act, wish in any way
        to deprive either defendant of the means to conduct a proper defence to these charges.
        They should surely apply, like anyone else, for legal aid if they are unable to fund the
        costs of the defence themselves. In that event: th ^ ; would/be subject to the usual
        restraints and disciplines of the legal aid system. I believe that the defence, with access
        to pubiic funds'from your authority, are seeking at present to inflict unnecessary
        expenses upon us by recourse to every' possible type of legal hearing, in the knowledge
        that we do not have such access, and are instead dependent on private donations and
        fund-raising events. Neither defendant lives in South Yorkshire, but the South
        Yorkshire Police has a strong interest of its own in the discharge or acquittal of these
        defendants.

Dear M e m b e r,


Adlintzton v M u r r a y A d l i n u t o n v D u c k e n f i e l d



1         I am the prosecutor in this case, and the solicitor to the Hillsborough Family Support
          Group (“HFSG”), an association whose members are families o f the victims o f the
          Hillsborough disaster o f April 1989. The prosecutions were commenced in the Leeds
          Magistrates Court in July 1998. I am writing to you about the decision taken pursuant
          to the Resolution o f your authority of February 1998 to fund the defence of these two
          former senior officers in these criminal proceedings. Much o f the contents of thjs
          letter is based upon submissions and facts that have been supplied by the HFSG to tne
          Crown Prosecution Sep/ice on the advice of leading counsel, who has also advised on
          the present funding issue. I understand that the subject matter o f last February’s
           Resolution, and other discussions and decisions later in the year, are to be considered
           at your meeting o f 8!h January 1999. Attached to this letter is a bundle of documents
           to which I shall refer in this letter.    ______ ____

           A nnex A is a copy o f a letter that I sent to Mr W. J. Wilkinson, Clerk and Treasurer,
           on 22nd December, setting out objections in law to the grant o f the funding, and to the
           way in which dedsioas.were.taken. That letter may conveniently be read first. At
           A nnex B are copies o f earlier correspondence between Miss Oades and myself and the
           two circulars from the Home Office in relation to these issues, to which reference was
           made in Annex A.

            You will appreciate that my argument is that decisions to grant funding pursuant to the
            Resolution last February were unlawful, irrational and procedurally improper, and that
            a further such decision would now be unlawful in any event.




                                                                     1

Tie facts o f the case; M anslaughter arid Misfeasance

4     It is necessary to set these cut, because the South Yorkshire Police Authority
       (“SYPA”) is recorded as having resolved on 28* February 1993, less than two weeks
       after publication o f the report o f the “Scrutiny” conducted by Lord Justice Stuart-
       Smith,

              “That in the light o f the findings o f Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s inquiry and his
              comments on the outcome, members do not believe that there is any evidence
              to cause them to reconsider the Authority’s previous view, and remain of the
              opinion that the officers acted in good faith”.

5     Lord Justice Stuart-Smith reinforced the findings o f Lord Taylor, whose original
      interim report was published in August 19S9. Home Office guidance requires, o f
       course, that you have regard to the particular circumstances o f the case, although, this
      does not seem to have been recognised by the Resolution o f last February', when
      decisions were made in principle, before it was known who if anyone was going to be
      prosecuted, and, more importantly, for what offences.

6     It is clear from the minutes o f the SYPA. meeting o f last February, part o f Annex B,
       that Mr Dames made a presentation to the meeting, and on that factual basis the
       Authority made its decision. Members o f the SYPA. ought therefore to be aware o f the
       attitude o f the South Yorkshire police, as expressed to the Leeds District Magistrates
       Court on 21st December 199S in connection with an application by the prosecution that
       the South Yorkshire force should disclose documents in its possession. Counsel Ms
       Louise Varty, instructed by Hammond Suddards said;

              “South Yorkshire Police are not privy to the nature o f this prosecution and the
              issues within it and therefore are not able to say or agree what is or is not
              relevant.”

7      So that the Authority can inform itself o f the issues with greater confidence, and from
       an informed source, t attach for guidance a summary o f the evidence on the charges of
       manslaughter and misfeasance charges as A n n ex C, and a copy o f the relevant parts of
       the Taylor Report as A n n e x D. The charges are soundly based in law and fact.

Tie altitude o f the South Yorkshire Police to the allegation c f negligence

8      In an offence in this class o f involuntary manslaughter, according to the 1995 House of
       Lords decision in R v Adomako. the prosecution must prove: (a) a duty o f care; (b) £
       breach o f that duty; (c) that that breach was a substantial cause o f death; (c) “The
       essence o f the matter which is supremely a jury question, is whether having regard to
       the risk o f death involved the conduct o f the defendant was so bad in all the
        circumstances as to amount in their judgment to a criminal act or omission.” per Lord
       MackayLC [1995] 1 A.C. 187E.

                                              IS that he lied to a n u m t e o f PeoPk , either him self or Srouah
       others, in the hour after the disaster, in a careful and calculating way, as the bodies
       were being carried away from the field and terraces. He did so to influence falsely the
       persons or courts who would Investigate the circumstances o f the disaster. He alleged
       that the supporters had burst the gates opened, whereas he had himself, after
       consideration, ordered that they be opened. He failed to correct this lie after the event,
       and continued, together with many senior oSeers o f the South Yorkshire police, to
       allow the lie to have effect for several weeks. The evidence in support o f this charse is
       summarised at Annex E .

V°.e decision o f the Craven Prosecution Service

13    At the beginning o f July 1993 the solicitors for the defendants asked the Crown
      Prosecution Sen/ice to take over the prosecutions and discontinue them. The CPS is
      entitled in law to take over any prosecution begun by a private individual, and it will
      discontinue any prosecution o f which it has the conduct (including those which it has
      taken over) if there is clearty no evidence, or if there are public interest factors such as
      ill-health, unacceptable delay, or if the prosecution is likely to damage the Interests of
      justice.

14    The CPS conducted a most painstaking and professional review over a period o f nearly
      six months, before deciding on 18* December 1998 that they would not take over and
       discontinue the case. The ability o f the CPS to make an informed and balanced
      decision was recognised by Winkworth Sherwood for Mr Duckenfield, when they
      wrote to the CPS on 9* October 1998 in these terms;

               “It is submitted on behalf o f Mr Duckenfield that the power o f the Director is
               far wider than a mere assessment o f the evidence, and embraces a consideration
               o f the wider public interest. The Director is well placed to assess where the
               public interest lies having had involvement in the case over a period o f nine
               years and having seen the Taylor report, the Stuart-Smith report, the coroner’s
               verdict, the judgement o f the Divisional Court and the review o f evidence, and
               the advice o f leading counsel obtained when the Director made the decision to
               prosecute.”        -                 '~

15     The representations put forward by the prosecution included the above assertions
       about the strength o f the evidence. Contrary arguments were put forward by the
       defendants, but were obviously rejected. It is very doubtful that the facts were set out
       in detail before the SYPA last February, or indeed thereafter. Mr Daines wrote in a
       published article last spring that “It is hard to imagine a private prosecution getting
       past the first hurdle.” Presumably he ventured a similar opinion to the SYPA in
       February 1998, but was not aware o f the full facts about the prosecution, nor the
       public interest factors set out below, the existence o f which has allowed the
       prosecution to clear the first hurdle and face the next hurdles with confidence.

Wider public interest considerations.

16     The SYPA will no doubt wish, in accordance with paragraph 6 o f the Circular

          ask them to deal with the matters I have set cut in detail, and for which evidential
          references have been given. A good test o f the strength o f the arguments I have
          presented is whether the police will be-able to answer them. Since millions o f pounds
          are potentially at stake a proper and informed public debate can be expected even if
          you have to postpone your hearing on 8* January. Members o f the HFSG will wish to
          attend that meeting, whenever it occurs and Xrequest that we be kept informed of
          relevant dates. I shall be oleased to deal with, any queries in advance that any member
           of the SYPA          have, or supph7copies o f any documents to which I have referred.
          I shall myself send a copy o f these representations to the defendants’ solicitors, so that
tha: they can m a k e their o r a submissions.

2.        Lord Jt^tice Stuan-Smith recapped the process by which. officers Involved ir.
the disaster wejc asked to prcvice full "ccHectiozs of it, 2nd these were then sent on,
after ‘vetting' to the West }*Sldlznds police who ■were collecting evidence for the
Taylcr LT.quiry. The ‘vetting* consisted of removal of expressions of opinion, and
intemperate language. Mostly this was quite proper but there "was a tendency to
remove opinion and intemperate language sbcut senior police crncers bur leivc in
sirri lar material about misbehaviour by Livtrpc-cl fens.               '

3.     This plainly cid net affect Lore Taylcr, because he made serious criticisms c:
senior officers. 3 tit it was o f concern that there scented to be a paocrn of changing
this material in this way, LJS-S noted that Sheffield "Vednesday FC also tc-ck
statements from their people and could cut out what they wanted so long as the
authors were prepared to sign them.

4-.   U S -S had good cooperation *xcm the South Yorkshire police. He wasn't
swsre o f any indication that the police were dragging their fe ii ov*r requests for
information from him or from the Hillsborough families.

5.        RW said the force were committed to openness. There was an element in. the
Family Support Group which seemed to be trying to stake them stumble and appear
jvs :.r they were Uulefr.; up release of information - for Instance * recent request for
sheaves o f ‘body files’ had i slijht feeling of rad herrings being drawn anross the crail-
But the foree would still t t s p cad as ^uiekly as it could.

6.     LJ5-5 said h wonki help bira to be *b3e to show that the pclice ha2 actrd
promptly ort requests fircm die StnsiKes - the Support Croup might well say he bad cut
        his scrutiny short before they had been able to assemble: their material. RW would
        let U 5-S have a schedule of what the fcrce bad supplied the families wdth and when.


        £ d lL D jd £ lm fl& liL

        7.      U S-S said that one person he had met had said That RW had icid them that Mr
        Duck eni: eld would be prosecuted, and that it was snncunced very soon afterwards
        that he wouldn’t be.

        8.     RW was sure h i had net iuaraateed that anybody would be prosecuted. That
        was not in his gift. He might have said that one or two oiSesrs might face discipline
        - 2nd two did. though in the even: wither wem before a tribunal.


        Lishillfv end expresrfcns of reprti

        9.      LJS-S had had no clear answer as to whether South Yorkshire Police had
        admitted liability or simply accepted it - albeit that this was, In b^al terms, a
        distinction without a difference- RW recalled that be was continually going or. public
        piatfcrrcs to express the force’s regret. An example was of bis TV interview on the
        day of the inquest verdimx. Ke give LJS-S £ v-^»o:2pe of this.

        10.    RW acknowledged dial Scud-. Yorkshire police had ciadc four n s b errors at
        Hillsborough. These were

                              net bresHng out of the assumption that there had to be a 3 o'clock
                              klck-cff

                              not foreseeing where the fans would go after Mr Marshall had (rightly)
                              had Gale C opened (this was the critical error)

                              rot noticing or taking full account of the building up of pressure
                              in the pens behind the gcaJ

                              not being able to distinguish between distress and disorder.

        11.     LJS-S noted that these were the things which Lord Taylcr had criticised. The
        police disputed why they had lest control of the crowd outside the Leppings Lane
        gatesL

        12.     RW recalled that Lofd Taylcr had drawn a distinction between junior and
        senior police ar.d between those s e s l e : police who realised what was geinj on and did
        something about it and those who did not. His aims in dealing with the issue over the
        years had been to be as open as possible, to express sorrow, both personal tad
        profession*!, over what had gene wrong and to make sure that the forte stayed
        capable c f doing what it should be doing.

No.       I think one has to look at the whole statement                                rathe
tha n just the suggested alterations to cat the v/hole
c o n t e x t of the suggested a m e n d m e n t v
H e r e is ano th e r one.             This is dated 23rc May,                a letter
fro m H a m m o n d s Sucdards,           and under Edmondson,               there is a
r e f e r e n c e to CN?
That, is r e m o v i n g ambiguity, yes.                  That is the meaning of
that p a r t i c u l a r term, yes.             A s u g ge s te d misprint.            I am
n ot too sure w h a t he means there.                      O ne w o u l d have to see
it, w o u l d n ' t one?
I m a y have to look                at some of these.
I t h i n k one has to              look at the thing in the                context of th
w h o l e state m en t really.
T h e r e a p p e a r to be suggestions from H a m m o n d s Suddards
r a t h e r t h a n actual striking things out or amendments.                                  It
seems       to be left to you to decide what                       is to be taker, out
and wha t not?
Y o u m e a n the actual wording of what goes in.
Yes.        A p a r t i c u l a r example hers is from Chief Inspector
W a r i n g , , isn't it.           His perceptions of the c r o w d position
at p a g e     5 do seem at odds with most ot h e r officers,                            but
o b v i o u s l y this would not be altered if it is his clear
recollection.               I wondered what other o f fi c e r s he saw cr.
his w a l k d own Leppings Lane and p e r h ap s details, could be
i n c l u d e d if he is wanting a little bit of expansion,                               if i
is p o s s i b l e to do so there. .
H o w d i d the alterations come to be made?                            Did you cross
cut w hat y o u thought should r.ot be in a nd t he n invite the
officers         to sign them?
It w a s v e r y muc h a joint affair^                    T his was a huge task
b e c a u s e there were upwards of a t h o u s a n d statements.                           The
w e r e b e i n g p r oc e ss ed at quite a c o n s i d e r a b l e rate daily,
a n d w e w e r e u r g e d to treat it in a t i m e l y fashion in orde
not     to d e l a y the Taylor Inquiry.                  At the time that these
w er e a s k e d for,        as I remember,          there was a team working                     1

Police        Headquarters actually               t r a n s c r i b i n g these v e r s i o n s
     of events on to a computer system,                the Homes Computer
     System.        That team was supplemented by other officers,
    Ws forme d our ow n Inquiry team.               I didn't;      o t h e r people
     did,   and I was aware that it was there.               The things that               .
     came b a c k from Mr. Metcalfe,            in a w o r d , ’ went to that team
    w h o s u g g es t ed amendment and who then went cut,              people from
     the tea m went out and saw the individual people,                       and
     s howed them,        o r discussed with them- their revis i on s to the
    statement,          and came back with their signed s tatement and
     that was sent to the West Midlands Police.
Q   Y o u w e r e in charge of this Inquiry team?
A   I suppose,      yes,    one must say that.         I was r e a l l y     in charge
    of the tr an s m i s s i o n of information to and from Mr.
    Metcalfe,       but I couldn't obviously deal wi t h it.                   I saw
    e v e r y t h i n g that came b ac k from him,      and it went        to the
    team,    and it m a y well have been,           c e r ta in l y on one or two
    occasions,          that the statements he was talk i ng about were
    in fact re v ie w ed and discussed between m y se lf and members
    of the team.           There were two Chief Inspectors at that
    p a r t i c u l a r time.   Detective Chief Inspectors who were
    l o c k i n g after this revision cf statements:               one Foster and
    one P h i li p Jones.        I may well have d is c u s s e d Mr.      M e t c a l f e ’s
    c o m m e n t s w i t h either of those,      and we m a y have discussed
    h o w his comments might best have b e e n a c h i e v e d in terms or
    wording,      but it was actually drafted b y those people - by
    that t e a m of p eople - and finalised b y the o f f i c e r himself
    w h o ma d e the statement,         in his presence anyway.
Q   D i d y o u have any cases where officers re fu se d to sign tne
    s ta te m en t s?
A   I do u n d e r s t a n d that there were one or two of f ic er s who
    w e r e a little bit upset that their st a tements h a d been
    altered.        I a m not too sure that I can r e m e m b e r anyone who
    r e f u s e d to sign,      to be honest.      I imagine that that mignt
    w ell h av e be e n the case although I can't b r i n g one to
    mind.        There weren't many,           if there were.

            b e c a u s e there is an explanation sent round w h i c h was
            a p p r o v e d by the solicitors.
            Oh,    an e xplanation went round as to.what the p u r p o s e of i
            was,     yes.      That was because of concern that t hey didn't
            k n o w what was happening.                 They had left and b e e n asked t
            e x p r e s s themselves and suddenly,              of course,             these things
            w e r e b e i n g turned into something which was r a t he r
            different.        'They knew that there was an Inquiry,                            and they

 Dear Sirs

 South Yorkshire Police Authority

 We refer to the meeting on 5 February 1999 of the South Yorkshire Police Authority. You will
 recall that the meeting considered whether the Authority had power to provide financial
 assistance to Mr David Duckenfield and Mr Bernard Murray in relation to their costs and expenses
 on the private prosecutions and various applications for judicial review.

 The matter was considered in private meeting by the Authority, although submissions were heard
 from or on behalf of HFSG, Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray. After giving careful consideration to
 these submissions, the views of the Chief Constable and our advice, the Authority resolved that it
 did not have power to provide the financial assistance. This resolution was in accordance with our
 advice.

 Our advice, -which incorporated; the views of Ms Presiley Baxendale QC and Mr Mark Shaw of
 Counsel, was to the following effect:

 1                  Section 6 Police Act 1996, which confers on the Authority a wide duty to maintain an
                    effective and efficient police force, in conjunction with Section 111(1) Local Government Act
                    1972, appeared to give a very broad discretion to the Authority to preserve the morale of the
                    police force without which, an effective and efficient police force could not be maintained.
                    Accordingly, if it was, in the Authority's view, genuinely and reasonably necessary, in order
                    to maintain police morale, to meet the out of pocket costs and expenses of police officers,
                    incurred in defending themselves against criminal or civil proceedings, it was arguably
                    within Section 6 of the Police Act 1996, coupled with Section 111(1) of the Local Government
                    Act 1972, to pay such costs.
2                  However, that there were powerful arguments against this interpretation including the
                   following:

               a                       If there were a general power under section 6 Police Act 1996 to indemnify officers
                                       against the costs of legal proceedings arising from the performance of their duties,

                                                                  2                          10 February 1999




                         there would be no reason for section 88(4) Police Act 1996 specifically to allow the
                         recovery of such costs in tort proceedings. Section 88(4) would simply be unnecessary.

       b                 The issue turns on the proper construction of the Police Act 1996. In London Borough o f
                         S u tto n - v - M o rg a n G renfell & Co L im ited (1996) the Court of Appeal stated that where
                         Parliament had enacted specific provisions setting out how a local authority was
                         intended to perform its functions, there was no room to imply other means of carrving
                         out those functions under section 111(1) Local Government Act 1972. In particular,
                         ■where a local authority was intended to have power to incur financial obligations that
                         power must specifically be identified by statute. This was an example of a well-
                         established general principle of statutory interpretation: where Parliament specifies
                         one particular matter, it impliedly excludes any other allied matters. In addition,
                         section 6 of the Police Act 1996 is so wide in its language that it was doubtful that
                         recourse to section 111(1) Local Government Act 1972 could usefully expand it. The
                         real question is the relationship between section 6 and section 88 Police Act 1996.

       c               In R v D erbyshire Police A u th o r ity ex parte W ilson an d D alton (1989), both parties had
                        accepted that the basic power to meet the officers' costs existed, and accordingly this
                        did not fall to be decided by the court The power to pay costs was therefore assumed
                        not decided. Similarly, a Home Office Circular is only guidance. It does not define or
                        modify the law and should not be assumed to be correct.

       d               Mr Justice Denning stated in A s k e y - v - Golden W ine Co L im ited (1948) the public policy
                       that the punishment inflicted by a criminal court is personal to the offender and that
                       such an offender is not entitled to recover from a third party an indemnity against the
                       consequences of the criminal proceedings whether that be a fine, an award against him
                       of the other party's costs or the accused's own legal costs. This public policy helps to
                       explain why section 88(4) Police Act 1996 does not cover criminal proceedings.

       e               A judge would not necessarily consider it desirable for the Authority to have such a
                       power. In the light of A s k e y - v - G olden-W ine Co L im ited, it was doubtful if a police
                       authority was intended to have power to indemnify officers against costs of a case in
                       which they were found guilty. An acquitted defendant would, in any event, normally
                       receive an award that h is/her reasonably incurred non legally-aided costs be paid in
                       full out of central funds, unless the accused was at fault in bringing suspicion on
                       himself or was found not guilty on a technicality see Practice D irection (Crime: Costs)
                       (1991) 1 W L R 4 9 8 . Accordingly, in the normal ran, an acquitted police officer should
                       have no (or few) costs to pay himself/herself, which a police authority would need to
                       meet.
           The issues raised were difficult and that there was no guarantee wrhich way a Court would
           decide. There were certainly strong policy reasons why the Authority should have power to
           support its officers (current and former) in this way. Given the points summarised in
           paragraphs 2 (a) to 2 (e) above, however, there were considerable doubts about the power of
           the Authority to support the costs either of the criminal proceedings or the judicial review

     proceedings (neither being covered by Section 88(4) Police Act 1996), particularly before anv
     judgm ent had been given in those proceedings.
4    It was also necessary to be mindful of the terms of the latest Home Office Circular. One
     would not lightly advise that it is wrong but it is much more hesitant that its predecessor.
     Therefore, it was sensed that the Home Office may have its own doubts about the existence
     of this power.

     representations made on behalf of the officers, the Chief Constable or the HFSG, the current

     should then co-operate with those parties in bringing the matter before a court for an early
     decision on whether that view of their legal powers was correct.

 Dear Sirs

 South Yorkshire Police Authority

Wre refer to the meeting on 5 February 1999 of the South Yorkshire Police Authority. You will
recall that the meeting considered whether the Authority had power to provide financial
assistance to Mr David Duckenfield and Mr Bernard Murray in relation to their costs and expenses
on the private prosecutions and various applications for judicial review.

The matter was considered in private meeting by the Authority, although submissions were heard
from or on behalf of HFSG, Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray. After giving careful consideration to
these submissions, the views of the Chief Constable and our advice, the Authority resolved that it
did not have power to provide the financial assistance. This resolution was in accordance with our
advice.

Our advice, which incorporated ..the views of Ms Presiley Baxendale QC and Mr Mark Shaw of
Counsel, was to the following effect:

1                  Section 6 Police Act 1996, which confers on the Authority' a wide duty to maintain an
                   effective and efficient police force, in conjunction with Section 111(1) Local Go\Temment Act
                   1972, appeared to give a very broad discretion to the Authority to preserve the morale of the
                   police force without which, an effective and efficient police force could not be maintained.
                   Accordingly, if it was, in the Authority's view, genuinely and reasonably necessary, in order
                   to maintain police morale, to meet the o u t of pocket costs and expenses of police officers,
                   incurred in defending themselves against criminal or civil proceedings, it was arguably
                   within Section 6 of the Police Act 1996, coupled with Section 111(1) of the Local Government
                   Act 1972, to pay such costs.
2                  However, that there were powerful arguments against this interpretation including the
                   following:

              a                       If there were a general power under section 6 Police Act 1996 to indemnify officers
                                      against the costs of legal proceedings arising from the performance of their duties,




j : \ g a r r e t t \ s o u t h y o r k s h i r * p o lic < f \l« f -0 0 0 2 1 .d o c \s b
                                                                                       -2-          10 February 1999




                                there would be no reason for section 88(4) Police Act 1996 specifically to allow the
                                recovery of such costs in tort proceedings. Section 88(4) would simply be unnecessary.

       b                       The issue turns on the proper construction of the Police Act 1996. In London Borough o f
                               S u tto n - v - M o r g a n G renfell & Co L im ited (1996) the Court of Appeal stated that where
                               Parliament had enacted specific provisions setting out how a local authority was
                               intended to perform its functions, there wras no room to imply other means of carrying
                               out those functions under section 111(1) Local Government Act 1972. In particular,
                               where a local authority was intended to have power to incur financial obligations that
                               power must specifically be identified by statute. This was an example of a well-
                               established general principle of statutory interpretation: where Parliament specifies
                               one particular matter, it impliedly excludes any other allied matters. In addition,
                               section 6 of the Police Act 1996 is so wide in its language that it was doubtful that
                               recourse to section 111(1) Local Government Act 1972 could usefully expand it. The
                               real question is the relationship between section 6 and section 88 Police Act 1996.

       c                     In R v D erbysh ire Police A u th o r ity ex parte W l s o n a n d D alton (1989), both parties had
                              accepted that the basic power to meet the officers' costs existed, and accordingly this
                              did not fall to be decided by the court. The power to pay costs was therefore assumed
                              not decided. Similarly, a Home Office Circular is only guidance. It does not define or
                              modify the law and should not be assumed to be correct.

        d                    Mr Justice Denning stated in A s k e y - v - Golden W in e Co L im ited (1948) the public policy
                             that the punishment inflicted by a criminal court is personal to the offender and that
                             such an offender is not entitled to recover from a third party an indemnity against the
                             consequences of the criminal proceedings whether that be a fine, an award against him
                             of the other party's costs or the accused's own legal costs. This public policy helps to
                             explain why section 88(4) Police Act 1996 does not cover criminal proceedings.

        e                    A judge w’ould not necessarily consider it desirable for the Authority to have such a
                             power. In the light of A s k e y - v - Golden W in e Co L im ited, it was doubtful if a police
                             authority was intended to have power to indemnify officers against costs of a case in
                             which they were found guilty. An acquitted defendant would, in any event, normally
                             receive an award that his/her reasonably incurred non legally-aided costs be paid in
                              full out of central funds, unless the accused was at fault in bringing suspicion on
                              himself or was found not guilty on a technicality see Practice D irection (Crime: Costs)
                              (1991) 1 W L R 49 8 . Accordingly, in the normal run, an acquitted police officer should
                             have no (or few) costs to pay himself/herself, which a police authority would need to
                             meet.
            The issues raised were difficult and that there was no guarantee which way a Court would
            decide. There were certainly strong policy reasons why the Authority should have power to
            support its officers (current and former) in this way. Given the points summarised in
            paragraphs 2 (a) to 2 (e) above, however, there were considerable doubts about the power of
            the Authority to support the costs either of the criminal proceedings or the judicial review

                    proceedings (neither being covered by Section 88(4) Police Act 1996), particularly before anv
                    judgm ent had been given in those proceedings.
4                  It was also necessary to be mindful of the terms of the latest Home Office Circular. One
                   would not lightly advise that it is wrong but it is much more hesitant that its predecessor.
                   Therefore, it was sensed that the Home Office may have its own doubts about the existence
                    of this power.
5                  Accordingly, whilst it was wished to review the matter further in the light of any
                   representations made on behalf of the officers, the Chief Constable or the HFSG, the current
                   recommendation was that the Authority should resolve to reverse its earlier decision and
                   decide that it has no power to provide the financial assistance which had been sought. It
                   should then co-operate with those parties in bringing the matter before a court for an early

                                               OPINION




1.     We are asked for a written Opinion on whether it is appropriate for Mr Murray and Mr
Duckenfield to continue defending the charges of manslaughter and misfeasance in public office. It
is understood that the Opinion will be considered by the South Yorkshire Police Authority,


2.     We have no doubts. Mr Murray and Mr Duckenfield must continue to defend the charges. The
alternative, namely pleading guilty to the charges, is in our judgment unthinkable.


3.     It is perhaps a sufficient indication of the merits of the defences to state the consistent view
of the D.P.P, over the past ten years. In 1990, having received the Opinion from two leading counsel,
the Director announced that there was not a reasonable prospect of conviction in respect of any
potential criminal charges arising out of the Hillsborough tragedy. This view was re-stated by the
Director in 1997, following pressure from HFSG to re-considerthe decision not to prosecute. In 1991,
the Inquest juries returned verdicts of accidental death, (and thus rejected verdicts of unlawful killing).
In February 1998, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny concluded that there was no material to be put
before the D.P.P. which might cause reconsideration of the decisions not to prosecute; and further
concluded that there was no basis for re-opening the Inquests. On 18 February 1998, the Home
Secretary, the Attorney-General and the D.P.P. publicly stated that they had considered Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith's Report very carefully, and that they had no reason to doubt his conclusions.


4.     It is important that the HFSG justification for these private prosecutions has been a claim to
have found "new? evidence, such as to undermine the earlier decisions not to prosecute. In 1998, Lord
Justice Start-Smith’s Scrutiny concluded that there was no basis for these claims. There is no
genuinely significant ‘new’ evidence, merely substantially the same evidence from different witnesses.


5.      Against that background, we are confident in our own assessment of the case. We, too, believe
that there is no reasonable prospect of conviction. Indeed, it is our judgment that there is a strong
argument that there is no prima facie case of manslaughter anc. misfeasance. We intend to make
submissions to that effect to the stipendiary magistrate at the committal proceedings. For that reason,
we are satisfied that it is a proper course to contest the committal. Further, at the same hearing, we
shall argue that private prosecution is oppressive and an abuse of the right of private prosecution. If
the magistrate agrees with either submission, the effect will be to bring the proceedings to an end.
without the necessity for a Crown Court hearing.


6.       It was a considerable disappointment that the Divisional Court did not quash the D.P.P.’s
decision not to intervene and withdraw the manslaughter and misfeasance charges, (although our
challenge to his failure to withdraw the charges of perjury against Mr Duckenfield was successful).
It is important that the Court’s decision is not misinterpreted. In view of the representations which
HFSG made to the Police Authority (claiming that we were profligate with public funds by making
a judicial review challenge against the Director), we think it right to record that Lord Justice Laws
expressly commented to Mr Jones Q.C. that the submissions made to the Court on behalf of the
defendants had been ‘highly arguable’. The fact that the Court ultimately rejected our submissions that
the Directors policy and decision were both unlawful is not an indication that our decision to take the
proceedings was wrong or unjustified. We are satisfied that, had it not been for the decision of the
Court to allow the Director, on the second day of the hearing, to produce affidavit evidence giving
some reason for his decision, we would have succeeded in all our challenges. Our sole purpose in
taking those proceedings was to bring these unjustified prosecutions to an end by the most speedy and
economical means open to us.


7.        In view7of the tone of the representations HFSG has made to the Police Authority, we wish
to give our unreserved assurances that the advice we have given to these defendants throughout has
been precisely the same as we would have given to the defendants had they been privately paying
clients or defendants with a legal aid certificate. We consider it to be professionally improper to do
otherwise.

          REPRESENTATIO NS TO THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS

                              ON BEHALF OF M R. BERNARD MURRAY




    1.1     In 1996-7, the HFSG pretext for re-opening the investigation was a claim that ‘new evidence’
    existed to undermine the previous findings and decisions. That claim was emphatically rejected by Lord
    Justice Stuant-Smith’s Scrutiny. I: was inevitable that any post-Scrutiny attempt to justify a prosecution
    would include another claim that further fresh evidence had come to light.

    1.2     We are now able to respond to the ‘new evidence’ claim, as well as to the variety of other claims
    in the prosecutor’s representations.

    1.3     Tr.ere are also important points to be made about the declared CPS/DPP policy on the provisions
    of the Prosecution of Offences Act 19S5.

    CPS/DPP Policy - evidence
    2.1     Tne CPS letters to HFSG on 27 July and 4 August 199S set out Policy. They refer to evidence,
    public interest and the interests of justice. The latter is one specific aspect of public interest. Tnis is not
    the moment for detailed argument about policy, but we indicate our concerns.

    2.2      The evidence criterion for intervention is wrong. (We do not accept that the private prosecutor
    can make out a case to answer. What follows is addressing the principle'behind the policy.) It cannot be
    right to restrict the Director’s scope for intervening on evidence grounds to cases where there is ‘clearly
    no case to answer’.

    2.3     First, it has the effect that the Director will only intervene in cases where the Court w'ould be
    bound to stop the proceedings in any event, either by refusing to issue summonses, or by refusing to
    commit for trial. To that extent, intervention on evidential grounds would never serve to achieve more
    than an acceleration of the inevitable.

    2.4      Second, in rare cases such as the present, it has a potential for undermining the public’s
    perception of the authority of the Director, as well as that of the Attorney-General. For more than eight
    years, the Director has publicly asserted that there is no realistic prospect of conviction o f any person on
    the charges now levelled against the two defendants. This after the most detailed, thorough, responsible
    and high-level assessment of the position it is possible to imagine, carried out more than once, and
    coupled with the clear conclusions of the Scrutiny of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, which have ir. turn been
    publicly accepted by the Director, the Attorney-General and the Home Secretaxy. The policy
    contemplates that the Director may conclude that because it is not clearly demonstrated that there is no


                                                                                  Mr Murray’s representations -1/5


                                                                                                             000064
case to answer, all that has gone before must count for nothing, and that the publicly appointed bodv
responsible for criminal prosecutions must stand aside and leave it to a private prosecutor. Tnat such an
outcome is theoretically possible suggests that the underlying policy is flawed. Particularly in the unique
circumstances of this case, where an independent Scrutiny Inquiry under a Lord Justice of Appeal has
been set up by Ministers of the Crown to examine whether there is any basis for reviewing the decision
not to prosecute.

2.5     We mention the position of the Attorney-General at this stage because there is a need to
coordinate the roles of the principal officers responsible for the criminal process. Were there to be a
committal for trial to the Crown Court, the Attorney’s power to enter a nolle prosequi would be called
upon by the defence. Ex hypothesi, such intervention only arises after it has been found that there is a
case to answer. It cannot be right that the Director is unable to intervene on evidential grounds if there
may be a case to answer, when it is plain that the Attorney can do so in a case where there undoubtedly
is a case to answer. W'e note section 3(1) of the 1985 Act. In any case where the Attorney would enter
a nolle prosequi, notwithstanding that there is or might be a case to answer, there is nothing in law or
principle to preclude the Director from intervening to the same effect at an earlier stage, acting either
independently or under the Attorney’s superintendence.

CPS/DPP Policy - public interest
3.1    The public interest factors to be taken into account when considering whether to take over and
discontinue a private prosecution will not be different from or less than those factors which the Code for
Crown Prosecutors requires to be taken into account when deciding whether to prosecute.

3.2     Without repeating 2.4 above, the public pronouncements from the office of the Director, from
the Law Officers and Ministers of the Crown have created a legitimate expectation in the defendant that
there will be no prosecution. It is unthinkable that this should effectively be overridden bv the
commencement of a private prosecution. It would set at nought the assurance contained in § 10.1 of the
Code. There is no basis for invoking the exceptions in §10.2.

3.3    Materia! public interest factors against prosecution as identified in §6.5 of the Code are:
        (d) long delay, and
        (0 significant ill-health of the prospective defendant.
Both apply here. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith found significant instances of altered recollections in
witnesses upon whom the prosecutor would rely.

3.4     Assessment of culpability. We do not propose to argue issues of substantive law at this stage. For
present purposes it is sufficient to refer to the quotation which Lord Taylor chose to cite prominentlv,
with obvious approval, in his Interim Report, PART II - WHY DID IT HAPPEN? [p.20]:
        “Events of the magnitude of Hillsborough don’t usually happen just for one single reason, nor
        is it possible to pin the blame on one single scapegoat... Disasters happen because a whole series
        of mistakes, misjudgments and mischances happen to come together in deadly combination."
        (The Archbishop of York.)
Lord T aylor’s Report, read as a w h o le , found the disaster w as caused by a series o f factors: ultimately
a failure o f sy ste m s as w e ll as o f sin g le individuals, involving the Police as a Force, Sheffield
W ednesday as a Club, their consulting engineers, the Health & Safety Executive, the L o ca l Authority and
the Football A ssociation.

3.5        Regrettably, H F SG has b e co m e a cam paigning pressure group for what is now a relentless pursuit
o f these e x-p olice officers. Their liv es have been and w ill continue to be seriously afflicted by their
k n o w led g e that they w er e in volved at the epicentre o f the disaster. A fair and dispassionate assessm ent
o f the position o f the tw o proposed defendants w ould se e them as having been seriously affected by their
in vo lvem en t in the tragedy. B ut there is no prospect o f this private prosecution b e in g carried on and


                                                                               Mr Murray’s representations - 2/5

                                                                                                            00006; i
 conducted with any regard to the broader concepts of fairness and balance of public interest factors which
 a n y defendant in a criminal trial in this country is entitled to expect.



 CPS/DPP Policy - the private prosecutor.
 4.1     Even if there were to be a defensible evidential basis for continuing the proposed prosecution
 it would be wholly wrong for the public prosecuting authority to abandon responsibility for the conduct
 of what undoubtedly would be a serious, complicated and important ‘high-profile’ case. Section
 3(2)(b)(i) of the 1985 Act imposes a duty on the Director to institute and have the conduct o f proceedings
 where it appears that:
         “the importance or difficulty of the case makes it appropriate that proceedings should
          be instituted by him...”.
 Although this duty is distinct from the duty to “take over” the conduct of proceedings, it is not a dutv
 which the Director can ignore. Parliament did not envisage that important or difficult cases (this would
 be both) should be left to private prosecution. The scope for intervention by a private prosecutor in such
 cases must clearly be confined to situations where inertia, partiality or improper action on the part of the
 public prosecutor can be demonstrated.

  4.2      Although section 6(1) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 expressly preserved the right of
- private prosecution, it is clearly not an unfettered right. The purpose .in preserving private access to the
  criminal courts was stated by Lord Wilberforce in Gouriet-v- Union o f Post Office Workers [1978] A.C.
  435 at 477:
           “This historica! r i g h t t h o u g h rarely exercised in relation to indictable offences, and
           thou ah ultimately liable to be controlled by the Attorney-General (by taking over the
           prosecution and, if he thinks fit, entering a nolle prosequi) remains a valuable
           constitutional safeguard against inertia or partiality on the part of authority.”
  See also: Report of the Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure (Cmnd 8092 (1981)): it provides a
  useful and effective safeguard against “improper action” by the prosecuting authority: cited by Lloyd L.J.
  in R -v- Bow Street Stipendiary Magistrate and Another, (1993) 96 Cr.App.R. 405.

 4.3     The lengthy history of public investigations into the circumstances of the Hillsborough tragedy,
 carried out at all stages under the auspices of the Home Secretary and the Law Officers, clearly
 demonstrates that this is not an appropriate case for private prosecution.


 HFSG - 1998 Representations to D.P.P.
 5.1      Fundamentally, the HFSG representations amount to claims that, by reason of fraudulent
 interference with and /or concealment of evidence by the South Yorkshire Police and/or the West
 Midlands Police, the Taylor Inquiry, the D.P.P., the Police Complaints Authority, the Inquests, and Lord
 Justice Stuart-Smith were all in their turn deceived about the culpability of the South Yorkshire Police
 Force in relation to the tragedy of Hillsborough. These claims are presumed to be true, then translated
 simplistically into a justification for prosecuting the two proposed defendants.

 5.2     To overcome the objection that these were the very claims expressly considered and rejected by
 the Scrutiny, HFSG contends that it is only post-Scrutiny that material has been released for their
 consideration which now enables them to demonstrate the truth of their assertions. It is necessary to
 examine this material with close attention to detail, for the claims based upon it are wholly spurious.

 5.3     When viewed in conjunction with the serious allegations which were made to Lord Justice
 Stuart-Smith. the present claims are seen as the continuation of a series of unfounded allegations made
 in support of the long-standing conspiracy theory which has become entrenched in the thinking of the


                                                                             Mr Murray’s representations - 3/5
HFSG, and which now dominates the presentation of all their arguments. A summary of certain
allegations together with the findings of the Lord Justice is set out in the following table.

        Midlands). p'lO, §33.2                            Allegation that police hid videotape evidence is
                                                          completely unfounded. There was no suppression
                                                          or disappearance o f footage from the vital tapes ...

5.4       The prosecutor continues to assert that the South Yorkshire Police and/or W e st Midlands
carefully w ithheld important material from the Director and the Coroner, such that the 1990 decision not
to prosecute and the Inquest verdicts were reached on an incom plete assessm ent o f material evidence.

     AD LING T ON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

     You wrote to the Crown Prosecution Service on 18 December 1998, following the receipt of a
     letter from the CPS, also dated 18 December 1998, informing you of the Service’s decision
     not to exercise its power under Section 6(2) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 to take
     over the criminal proceedings against your client with a view to discontinuing them.

     Y'ou ask for farther information: first, as to the factual matters on which the CPS relied,
     identifying which parts of the evidence is “new” since the Crown last considered the case; and
     secondly, as to the way in which the Service applied the”Code for Crown Prosecutors in
     deciding whether to intervene.

     These questions indicate that you misunderstand the factors that the CPS considers when
     deciding whether to take over a private prosecution at the request of a defendant, with a view
     to discontinuance. It may help if I indicate again in broad terms the approach that the Service
     adopts to these decisions.

     As you know, the Code for Crown Prosecutors sets out the general principles applied by the
     Service when (inter alia) deciding whether to continue a prosecution it has taken over; or
     whether to institute proceedings, or to advise the police whether to do so. It is correct that the
     CPS decided in 1997 that the evidenca available at that time was not sufficient, in its view, to
     provide a realistic prospect of the conviction of either your client or Mr Duckenfield for any
     offence. However, it does not follow that, when considering the evidence and the
     representations submitted by the private prosecutor, and by yourselves on behalf of your
     client, the CPS should seek merely to identify whether there is now any new evidence
     sufficient to provide a realistic prospect of a conviction. The decision whether to intervene in




                            Crown Prosecution Service   •   Working in the interests of justice
a private prosecution with a view to teiminating it calls for different considerations to be
applied. It is quite possible for a private prosecution to continue, notwithstanding that the
CPS is not satisfied, on the basis of its own assessment of the strength o f the evidence that
the evidence would pass the evidential sufficiency test in the Code (that there should'be a
“realistic prospect o f a conviction”).

In broad terms, the reason for this is that Section 6(1) of the Prosecution of Offences Act
1985, the Act which established the Service’s powers and duties, specifically preserved the
right o f private individuals and prosecuting authorities or bodies other than the CPS to brin<*
criminal proceedings. This right is subject (among other limitations) to the limitation in
Section 6(2) that the CPS may nevertheless take over the proceedings with a view either to
conducting or to terminating those proceedings.

Private prosecutors are not bound to apply the Code for Crown Prosecutors when deciding
whether to institute proceedings, nor do the courts apply the evidential sufficiency test in the
Code when deciding whether there is a case to answer. The Service therefore recognises that
it is not appropriate to intervene to terminate a private prosecution without good reason. That
general principle has recently been endorsed by the Law Commission in its Consultation
Paper No. 149 “Consents to Prosecution” (see paragraphs 6.3 and 6.4).

The Service’s policy is that it will not take over a private prosecution with a view to
terminating it unless one or more of the following applies:

 (i)    there is clearly no case to answer. A private prosecution started in these circumstances
        would be unfounded and ought not to be permitted to continue; or

(ii)    the public interest factors tending against prosecution clearly outweigh those in favour
        (examples might be where the prosecution is malicious, or vexatious; or the offence is
        one for which the defendant should clearly have been cautioned; or where, although
        the offence may be serious, the defendant is terminally ill); or

(iii)   the prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests of justice.

 In this case, I took the decision not to intervene. After careful consideration, I concluded in
 respect of the charges of manslaughter and wilful neglect to perform a public duty (which, for
 the avoidance of doubt, were each considered against each individual separately) that I could
 not say that there is clearly no case to answer. It was not right, therefore, for the Service to
 take over the proceedings with a view to terminating them.

 I should add that, against that background and after specifically considering the appropriate
 course to take in these circumstances, I concluded further-that it would not be right to
 intervene in respect of the one remaining charge against Mr Duckenfield, of attempting to
 pervert the course o f justice, albeit I had formed the view that there was clearly no case to
 answer on that charge alone. The charge of attempting to pervert the course o f justice is a
 serious one, particularly when levelled against someone who was, at the relevant time, a
 serving, senior police officer. Nevertheless, in the context of the case as a whole that charge
 is not'the gravamen o f the criminality alleged against Mr Duckenfield and I concluded that
 my approach to that charge should be led by my conclusions on the charges of manslaughter
 and wilful neglect to perform a public duty.
I also considered whether, nevertheless, there were overriding public interest factors that
should lead to the Service intervening with a view to discontinuance, but I came to th-
conclusion that any public interest factors tending against prosecution did not clearly
outweigh those in favour; nor did I consider that the prosecution is clearly likely to dama®**
the interests of justice.

The Crown Prosecution Service is not obliged in law to provide detailed reasons for its
decisions, let alone any analysis of the evidence. However, in the circumstances of this
particular case I consider it appropriate to explain the factors taken into account in more detail
than was contained in the Service’s letter dated 18 December 1998.

I have written in similar terms to those representing Mr Duckenfield and enclose a copy of
that letter, for your information. I have sent copies of both letters to Ms Adlington.

Yours faithfully

           PUBLIC INTEREST FACTORS

           2.    As I now recall, the public interest factors tending against prosecution which I

                 considered were as follows.

                 (1)    Previous reviews of the case, in particular those carried out by the DPP when

                         considering the question whether criminal proceedings should be taken against

                        Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray and the more recent report o f Lord Justice

                        Stuart-Smith.

                 (2)    The fact that the Applicants had been told on previous occasions that the DPP

                         did not intend to prosecute.

                 (3)    The delay which had occurred between the commission o f the alleged offences

                        and the commencement o f this prosecution and its likely effect on the

                        Applicants’ although I took the view that delay may be offset by the seriousness

                        o f the alleged offences (as is reflected in paragraph 6.5(d) o f the Code for

                        Crown Prosecutors) (“the Code”).

                 (4)    The effect of the delay on the evidence, for example in terms o f the potential

                        impairment o f the recollections of witnesses.

                 (5)    The assertion made on behalf of Mr Murray of ill-health, although I noted that

                        no medical evidence had been put forward in support of this assertion and that,

                         as again reflected in the Code (at paragraph 6.5(e)), ill-health may be offset by



                                                           2
                                                                                                                              1^00

                                            the seriousness of the offence.
                     UJ




                                 As against these factors tending against prosecution, there was in my view one

                                 extremely important factor in favour of prosecution, namely the very serious nature of

                                 the alleged offences, in particular, the alleged offences of manslaughter.          In my

                                 opinion, the allegation that two senior police officers were responsible for the deaths

                                 o f a number of people as a result of criminal negligence was a very grave allegation.




                      4.         Paragraph 6.2 of the Code reflects the considerable weight attached by the CPS to the -

                                 seriousness of the alleged offence when seeking to strike the right balance as to the

                                 factors for and against prosecution. (I refer also to the opening words of paragraph

                                 6.4).      Having carefully considered the factors tending against prosecution and this

                                 extremely important factor in favour of it, I came to the firm conclusion that the factors

                                 tending against prosecution did not clearly outweigh what I considered-to be the very

                                 strong public interest factor in favour of prosecution.

                                concluded that partial intervention (i.e. intervening in order to take over one charge but

                                 not intervening in relation to the other charges) was in law open to the CPS and I

                                proceeded on that assumption. However, the existing policy did not cover the situation

                                 which arose in this case, namely where the conclusion was reached that there was

                                 clearly a case to answer in relation to some of the charges but not in relation to others.



                                                                              3

                (I can say that with some confidence, since I had overall responsibility for formulating

                the policy). I had therefore to consider the question which arose in relation to this

                additional charge without the benefit of any specific or settled policy. Having carefully

                considered the question. I concluded that it was in fact inappropriate to intervene only

                to take over (with a view to discontinuing) this additional charge.




                First, partial intervention was not, in my view, either appropriate or desirable. It

                seemed to me that the DPP should either intervene so as to take over the proceedings

                in their entirety or not at all. To have intervened partially would still have left criminal

                proceedings in place in relation to the other charges wnich included the even more

                serious charge of manslaughter.            Secondly, I took into account the fact that Mr

                Duckenneld would not be left without any remedy in relation to this additional charge.

                On the contrary, he would be entitled to invite the Magistrates’ Court to dismiss it on

                the basis that there was no case to answer. Tnirdiy, the charge arose, out of essentially

                the same events as the events which gave rise to the other charges and thus those events

                would be scrutinised in any event.                    -

     LORD JUSTICE LAWS

15                    These are linked applications for judicial review which require the court
      to revisit the terrible disaster which took place at the Hillsborough Football Ground at
      Sheffield on -15 April 1989. In what I will call the first case the applicants Mr
18   Duckenfield and Mr Murray (to whom I will refer as “D” and “M”), who are retired
      police officers, seek leave to move for judicial review of the decision of the Director
      of Public Prosecutions (“the DPP”) to refuse to take over and discontinue private
21    prosecutions which have been instituted against them by Ann Adlington (“AA”) o n :
      behalf of the Hillsborough Family Support Group (“the HFSG”). The decision was
      communicated by letter of 18 December 1998. On 15 March 1999 Latham J adjourned '
24    the leave application to 22 March 1999 and directed that the parties should then be
      ready to proceed with the substantive application if leave were granted. On 22 March
      this court granted leave and proceeded at once to hear the inte r p a rte s application. In
27   the second case the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire (“the CCSY”) seeks to
      challenge a decision of the South Yorkshire Police Authority (“the SYPA”) made on 5
      February 1999 to the effect that it lacked the legal power to fund the defences of D
30    and M to the private prosecutions brought by AA, or to fund their prospective judicial
      review applications against the DPP. On 12 February 1999 Latham J granted leave to
      the CCSY, joined AA as second respondent, abridged time and ordered expedition. On
33    24 March 1999 this court (having reserved judgment in the first case the previous day)
      granted leave to D and M to challenge the same decision and, again, proceeded at once
      to hear the in te r partes application. We now deliver our judgments in both cases.
36
                    I will first set out the facts material to the first case, which also form the
     necessary background to the second. I will later describe the further facts which are
39   specifically relevant to the second case.

                  The football match at Hillsborough on Saturday 15 April 1989 was the
42   FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool Football Club and Nottingham Forest Football
     Club. In the events which happened 96 people lost their lives. The Divisional
     Commander in charge of police operations at the match was D, then holding the rank
45   of Chief Superintendent in the South Yorkshire Police Force. The second applicant,

          then Superintendent Murray, held the position of Sub-Divisional Commander and was
          also on duty at the match.

                         On 17 April 1989 Taylor LJ, as he then was, was appointed by the
           government to conduct a public inquiry into the disaster. He heard the oral testimony
     6    of 174 witnesses between 15 May and 29 June 1989, and presented an interim report
           on 4 August 1989. He found that the immediate cause of the gross overcrowding
           which had taken place, and thus of the disaster, had been the failure to cut off access
     9    to the central pens behind the goal (which were already overfull) when Gate C was
           opened. He found also a number of contributing factors including the condition of the
           ground, police planning, police operations on the day, and the interaction o f parties
    12     responsible for safety issues. Lord Taylor’s final report was delivered on 18 January
           1990 and included a number o f recommendations relating to crowd control and safety
           at sporting events.

                         Meanwhile, immediately after the disaster, the West Midlands Police
          had been appointed to conduct a review of the policing operations o f the South
    18    Yorkshire Police. In March 1990 the.West Midlands Police reported to the DPP. After
           taking the opinion of two experienced leading counsel the DPP announced on 30
           August 1990 that in his view there was insufficient evidence to justify any prosecution
    21    for a criminal offence, relating to the disaster, against any member o f the South
           Yorkshire Police Force. Then from November 1990 to March 1991 HM Coroner for
           South Yorkshire conducted an inquest into the deaths in the course o f which 230
    24     witnesses gave evidence. On 28 March 1951 the Coroner’s jury returned verdicts of
           accidental death.

    27 Disciplinary proceedings for neglect of duty were instituted against D
          and M by the Police Complaints Authority (“the PCA”). But D retired from the Force
          on 10 November 1991 on medical grounds, and so the proceedings against him fell
A   30 away. On 13 January 1992 the PCA decided not to proceed with the case against M.
          On 27 August 1992 he too retired on medical grounds. Then on 5 November 1993 the
          Divisional Court dismissed an application for judicial review brought by family
    33 members o f those who had died, refusing orders of c e rtio ra ri to quash the inquest
          verdict and to require afresh inquest to be convened.

    36                    On 5 December 1996 a documentary programme called “Hillsborough”
           was broadcast on ITV. The programme suggested that fresh evidence about the
           disaster had come to light. The allegations made in the broadcast were investigated by
    39    the Crown Prosecution Service between March and May 1997. At length on 30 June
           1997          the Home Secretary announced in Parliament that an independent scrutiny would
           be undertaken by Stuart-Smith LJ in order to ascertain in te r a lia whether there was
    42    evidence relating to the disaster which had not been available to Lord Taylor, or to the
           DPP or the Attorney General for the purposes of their discharge o f their statutory
           responsibilities. Stuart-Smith LJ’s report was presented to the House o f Commons on
    45    18 February 1998. Chapter 1 paras 55-57 state:

                                                                   -2-

               “55. From my meetings with the bereaved families and their
               representatives, I am left in no doubt that there was widespread
 3             disappointment at the DPP’s decision not to prosecute. They find it difficult
               to understand in the light of Lord Taylor’s trenchant criticisms of the South
               Yorkshire police and the fact that the force had been paying compensation.
 6
               56. What the Director of Public Prosecutions had to bear in mind, however,
               is the significantly different and greater degree of culpability which is
 9             involved in manslaughter, or culpable misfeasance in public office, as
               against the degree of negligence which gives rise to liability, and
               compensation payments, under civil law. Any prosecution of an individual
12             police officer would have to establish his individual responsibility. It would
               not be enough simply to prove the composite failure of the police operation.

15                 57. The causes of the disaster were many and complex. So far as these two
                   officers [sc D and M] were concerned, the prosecution would have to prove
                   to the high standard required for a criminal conviction that the failure to
18                 give the order to close off the tunnel when Gate C was opened amounted to
                   the serious degree of recklessness necessary to constitute manslaughter.”

21   Para 5 of Chapter 7 (“Summary”) stated:

                   “... I have come to the clear conclusion that there is no basis upon which
24                 there should be a further judicial inquiry or a re-opening of Lord Taylor’s
                   inquiry... I do not consider that there is any material which should be
                   placed before the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints
27                 Authority which might cause them to re-consider the decisions they have
                   already taken.”

30   On the same day, 18 February 1998, the Home Secretary announced in the House that
     he, the Attorney General and the DPP had very carefully considered Stuart-Smith LJ’s
     report, and said: “We have no reason to doubt his conclusions”.
33
                    The HFSG was clearly not satisfied with this result. There was first an
     abortive attempt on 26 June 1998 by AA to institute criminal proceedings against D
36   and M in the South Sefton Petty Sessional Division. That was given its quietus on
     technical or jurisdictional grounds into which it is unnecessary to go. Then on 13 July
     1998 Miss Adlington laid informations against them before the Leeds Petty Sessional
39   Division, and summonses were accordingly issued by the Stipendiary Magistrate. The
     charges accuse D and M of the manslaughter of two of those who died at
     Hillsborough, John Anderson and James Aspinall. They also allege against both an
42   offence o f “wilful neglect to perform a public duty” ; and in the case o f D, a further
     offence o f attempting to pervert the course of justice, said to consist in his having lied
     about the circumstances in which Gate C at the football ground became open.

              Both D and M made representations to the DPP that he should exercise
his power under s.6(2) o f the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 (“the POA”) to take
over the conduct o f the proceedings initiated against them, and then discontinue the
proceedings under s.23(3). In order to appreciate the contrary positions being taken
and the issues in the case, it is convenient to set out the relevant statutory provisions at
this stage.

                    Section 3(2) o f the POA provides so far as relevant:

           "It shall be the duty of the Director -
          (a) to take over the conduct of all criminal proceedings, other than specified
          proceedings, instituted on behalf of a police force (whether by a member of
          that force or by any other person);
          (b) to institute and have the conduct of criminal proceedings in any case
          where it appears to him that -

                    (i) the importance or difficulty of the case makes it appropriate that
                    proceedings should be instituted by him; or

                    (ii) it is otherwise appropriate for proceedings to be instituted by
                    him;

          (c) to take over the conduct of all binding over proceedings instituted on
          behalf of a police force...

          (d) to take over the conduct of all proceedings begun by summons issued
          under s.3 of the Obscene Publications Act 1959...”

S.6 provides so far as relevant:

          "(1) Subject to subsection (2) below, nothing in this Part shall preclude any
          person from instituting any criminal proceedings or conducting any
          criminal proceedings to which the Director's duty to take over the conduct
          of proceedings does not apply.

          (2) W here criminal proceedings are instituted in circumstances in which the
          Director is not under a duty to take over their conduct, he may nevertheless
          do so at any stage."

S. 10 provides so far as relevant:

          “(1) The Director shall issue a Code of Practice for Crown Prosecutors
          giving guidance on general principles to be applied by them -

                    (a) in determining in any case -

                                     (i) whether proceedings for an offence should be instituted or,
                                     where proceedings have been instituted, whether they should
 3                                   be discontinued;...

     S.23 provides so fax as relevant:

               “(1) Where the Director of Public Prosecutions has the conduct of
               proceedings for an offence, this section applies in relation to the
 9             preliminary stages of those proceedings.

               (2) In this section, 'preliminary stage’ in relation to proceedings for an
12             offence does not include -
                           • ••


                           (b) in the case of an indictable offence, any stage of the proceedings

                                   (i) the accused has been committed for trial...

18             (3) W'here, at any time during the preliminary stages of the proceedings,
               the Director gives notice under this section to the clerk of the court that he
               does not want the proceedings to continue, they shall be discontinued with
21             effect from the giving of that notice...”


24                 Representations had first been made to the DPP on behalf of D and M in
     early July 1998, after the commencement of the proceedings in the South Sefton Petty
     Sessional Division which proved abortive. In the course of correspondence the HFSG
27   again contended that it had discovered new evidence, which, it was said, had not been
     before Lord Taylor, the DPP, the Coroner, or Stuart-Smith LJ. At length, after AA’s
     informations had been laid in the Leeds Petty Sessional Division, the considered views
30   of the DPP as to the approach to be taken to a request to take over and discontinue a
     private prosecution were set out in a letter to the HFSG on 27 July 1998. The letter did
     not contain a decision, but it explained the DPP’s policy:
33
               “The policy where proceedings have been commenced by a private
               prosecutor builds on that contained in the Code for Crown Prosecutors.
36             The right to bring a private prosecution is preserved by s.6(l)... subject to
               the power under s.6(2). The CPS will take over a private prosecution where
               there is a particular need for it do so on behalf of the public...
39             In the instant case where we have been asked by the defendants to take over
               the prosecution in order to discontinue it, we would do so if one (or more) of
               the following circumstances applies:
42
                           •       There is clearly no case to answer. A private prosecution
                                  commenced in these circumstances would be unfounded, and
45                                w ould, therefore be an abuse of the right to bring a prosecution.

                                                                        Ex Parte South Yorkshire Police Authority



                     • The public interest factors tending against prosecution clearly
                       outweigh those factors tending in favour.
                     • The prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests o f justice.
                     • The prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests ofjustice.

           The CPS would then regard itself as having to act in accordance with our
           policy.

           If none of the above apply there would be no need for the CPS to become
           involved and we would not interfere with the private prosecution.

           Clearly there is a distinction between the 'realistic prospect of conviction’
           test in the Code [the Code for Crown Prosecutors issued by the DPP under
           s. 10 of the 1985 Act] and the 'clearly no case to answer’ test mentioned
           above. Accordingly we recognise that there will be some cases which do not
           meet the CPS Code tests where nevertheless we will not intervene. It has
           been considered that to apply the Code tests to private prosecutions would
           unfairly limit the right of individuals to bring their own cases.

           Before this decision can properly be made the CPS must be assured that all
           relevant material has been considered...

           Until there has been a. detailed review of the many papers in the case the
           Crown’s position cannot be determined...”


               There followed very substantial representations from D and M and from
the HFSG. At length the DPP communicated his decision not to intervene, as I have
said by letter of 18 December 1998. The letter merely stated:

           “W e have considered the evidence, the representations made by the parties
           and all the relevant circumstances of the case. We have concluded that we
           should not intervene to take over anyw of the charges.”
                                                             9



The respective solicitors for D and M asked for reasons to be given. There followed a
letter o f 1 February 1999 (the “reasons letter”) from the CPS’ Casework Director to
M ’s solicitor from which it is necessary to cite at some length:

           “As you know, the Code for Crown Prosecutors sets out the general
           principles applied by the Service when (inter alia) deciding whether to
           continue a prosecution it has taken over; or whether to institute
           proceedings, or whether to advise the police to do so. It is correct that the
           CPS decided in 1997 that the evidence available at that time was not
           sufficient, in its view, to provide a realistic prospect of the conviction of
           either your client or Mr Duckenfield for any offence. However, it does not
                                                              -6-

                                                                     Ex Parte South Yorkshire Police Authority



               follow that, when considering the evidence and the representations
               submitted by the private prosecutor, and by yourselves on behalf of your
 3             client, the CPS should seek merely to identify whether there is now any new
               evidence sufficient to provide a realistic prospect of a conviction. The
               decision whether to intervene in a private prosecution with a view to
 6             terminating it calls for different considerations to be applied. It is quite
               possible for a private prosecution to continue, notwithstanding that the CPS
               is not satisfied, on the basis of its own assessment of the strength of the
 9             evidence, that the evidence would pass the evidential sufficiency test in the
               Code (that there should be a 'realistic prospect of a conviction’).

12             In broad terms, the reason for this is that s.6(l)... specifically preserved the
               right of private individuals and prosecuting authorities and bodies other
               than the CPS to bring criminal proceedings. This right is subject (among
15             other limitations) to the limitation in s.6(2) that the CPS may nevertheless
               take over the proceedings with a view either to conducting or to
               terminating those proceedings.
18
               Private prosecutors are not bound to apply the Code for Crown Prosecutors
               when deciding whether to institute proceedings, nor do the courts apply the
21             evidential sufficiency test in the Code when deciding whether there is a case
               to answer. The Service therefore recognises that it is not appropriate to
               intervene to terminate a private prosecution without good reason. That
24             general principle has recently been endorsed by the Law Commission in its
               Consultation Paper No. 149 'Consents to Prosecution’ (see paragraphs 6.3
               and 6.4).
27
               [The letter then proceeds to set out the DPP’s policy in the same terms as those
               in which it had earlier been described by the three “bullet-points” in the letter
30             o f 27 July 1998, save that it gives instances of the “public interest factors” test
               as follows:

33              “examples might be where the prosecution is malicious, or vexatious; or the
                offence is one for which the defendant should clearly have been cautioned;
                or where, although the offence may be serious, the defendant is terminally
36              ill.” Then the letter continues as follows]

                In this case, I took the decision not to intervene... I concluded in respect of
39              the charges of manslaughter and wilful neglect .to perform a public duty
                (which, for the avoidance of doubt, were each considered against each
                individual separately) that I could not say that there is clearly no case to
42              answer. It was not right, therefore, for the Service to take over the
                proceedings with a view to terminating them.

                   I should add that, against that background and after specifically
                   considering the appropriate course to take in these circumstances, I
    3             concluded further that it would not be^right to intervene in respect of the
                   one remaining charge against M r Duckenfield, of attempting to pervert the
                   course of justice, albeit I had formed the view that there was clearly no case
    6             to answer on that charge alone. The charge of attempting to pervert the
                   course of justice is a serious one, particularly when levelled against
                   someone who was, at the relevant time, a serving, senior police officer.
    9             Nevertheless, in the context of the case as a whole that charge is not the
                   gravamen of the criminality alleged against Mr Duckenfield and I
                   concluded that my approach to that charge should be led by my conclusions
12                on the charges of manslaughter and wilful neglect to perform a public duty.
                   I also considered whether, nevertheless, there were overriding public
                   interest factors that should lead to the Service intervening with a view to
                   discontinuance, but I came to the conclusion that any public interest factors
                   tending against prosecution did not clearly outweigh those in favour; nor
                   did I consider that the prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests
1 8               of justice...”


21                        The private prosecution o f D and M presently stands adjourned in the
          magistrates’ court. Committal proceedings were due to commence on 19 April 1999.
          But we understand that date has been vacated. There is a directions hearing fixed for
24       hearing later in April. The matter was earlier before the magistrates’ court on 21
          December 1998, an occasion to which I should refer because Mr Jones QC for AA
          contends that the applications in the first case have not been made promptly, as Order
27        53 and the Supreme Court Act 1981 require (Mr Havers QC for the DPP likewise so
          contends but only in relation to the assault which is directed to the legality of the

•
         DPP’s policy; he says, as is plainly the fact, that D and M had notice o f the policy by
:30      the letter o f 27 July 1998). On 21 December it is said by AA that Mr Harrison QC for
          D and M indicated his clients’ intention to seek leave to bring an application for
         judicial review against the DPP’s decision, whatever the reasons for it (the reasons
33       had not, of course, by then been supplied). Mr Jones contends that the application for
         judicial review could and should have been lodged then or very shortly thereafter.
          There is an issue as to the context in which Mr Harrison said what he said to the
    36   magistrate. It is clear from an affidavit sworn by M ’s solicitor Mr Manning that Mr
          Harrison took the view (as, if I may say so, one would expect) that he would have to
          consider the DPP’s written reasons before finally advising as to a judicial review. As
39        at 21 December 1998 a reasons letter was expected before Christmas, and Mr Harrison
          so informed the magistrate. In the event the reasons were not delivered until 1
          February 1999. These applications were lodged in the Crown Office on 1 and 5 March
42       1999.

                       In my judgment there is nothing in the delay point. It would have been
    45   irresponsible to seek judicial review leave before the DPP’s reasons were available.
         And the letter of 27 July 1998 could not have been a proper trigger to seek leave; it

     contained no decision. It is true that a challenge only to the legality o f the policy need
     not strictly have awaited the DPP’s reasons for applying it as he decided to do; but
 3   since D and M, very obviously, were at least as interested in the application of the
     policy as in its legality, overall it was perfectly proper and reasonable to wait for the
     reasons letter before lodging any application for leave.

 9   The First Case: the Decision o f the DPP

                    I               may now turn to the substantive arguments in the first case. The lead
12   skeleton argument is that prepared on behalf o f M, which is adopted by D who adds
     further submissions to challenge the distinct decision of the DPP not to take over and
     discontinue the charge against him o f attempting to pervert the course o f justice. To
15   that I will come in due course.

     S.3(2)(b) o f the A ct o f 1985
18
                   The applicants’ first submission is that the DPP’s decision fails to pay
     any regard to his duty under s.3(2)(b), which I have set out It is put thus at #2.6 of the
21   skeleton argument:

               “The applicant’s point is that the policy and decision process in this case
24             have not recognised that the s.3(2)(b) duty is relevant to the exercise of
               discretion whether to intervene under s.6(2) and apply s.23(3)’\

27   In the course of his oral submissions Mr Harrison expanded this argument. He
     submitted that in deciding whether to take over and discontinue a private prosecution
     where the case is one o f “importance or difficulty”, the DPP should bear in mind that
30   it is ordinarily his duty to institute and conduct such proceedings. Accordingly, as I
     understand it, the suggestion is that the DPP should in some way entertain a
     heightened concern where such a private prosecution is launched, and his policy in
33   relation to the potential discontinuance o f such cases under s.23(3) should reflect this;
     presumably (for otherwise I cannot see how the argument can assist Mr Harrison) by
     leaning more favourably towards discontinuance than in other classes o f case.
36
                     In my judgment this is a bad argument. S.3(2)(b) speaks only of the
     institution o f proceedings by the DPP; contrast s.3(2)(a), (c), and (d), which require
39   him to take over proceedings. Plainly the DPP would not institute proceedings with a
     view to discontinuance. Moreover, as Mr Havers submitted, had it been the
     legislature’s intention to require the DPP to treat “important or difficult” cases in a
42   different way from others for the purposes o f ss.6(2) and 23(3), it could have readily
     so provided and it is to be supposed would have done so. In my judgment the right of
     private prosecution preserved by s.6(1) is in no way qualified by s.3(2)(b), which has
     nothing to do with the discretion to take over such a prosecution under s.6(2) with a
     view to discontinuance under s.23(3). I consider that this conclusion is lent support by

               “It will be noticed that section 3(2)(a)... provide[s] for the Director to take
               over the conduct of certain kinds of proceedings. By contrast, section
 6            3(2)(b) provides for the Director to institute certain other kinds of
               proceedings where it appears to him to be appropriate, having regard to the
               importance and the difficulty of the case. The difference in language is not,
9             in my view, accidental. It becomes of crucial importance when one turns to
               section 6, which deals with private prosecutions... The effect of section 6(1)
               is to preclude a person from bringing a private prosecution in cases covered
12            by section 3(2)(a), (c) and (d) but not in the residuary category of cases
               covered by section 3(2)(b). So far as section 3(2)(b) cases are concerned,
               there is nothing to preclude a private prosecution.” (Lloyd LJ’s emphasis)


    The D P P ’s policy fa ils to have regard to the fundam ental purpose f o r which private
1 8 prosecution is preserved by statute

                    Mr Harrison’s second submission was that the right to maintain a private
21   prosecution essentially operates as a constitutional safeguard in cases where there is
      some suggestion o f ‘inertia, partiality or improper action” by the public prosecutor;
      and the implication is that where nothing o f that kind is present, the DPP should lean
24   towards intervention to stop the prosecution. Mr Harrison relies on statements of their
      Lordships in Gouriet v Union o f Post Office Workers [1978] AC 435. Lord
      Wilberforce said at 477B-C:
27
               “This historical right which goes right back tothe earliest days of our legal
               system, though rarely exercised in relation to indictable offences, and
30             though ultimately liable to be controlled by the Attorney-General (by
               taking over the prosecution and, if he thinks fit, entering a nolle prosequi)
                remains a valuable constitutional safeguard against inertia or partiality on
33             the part of authority.”

      Lord Diplock said this at 498B:
36
                “In English public law every citizen still has the right, as he once had a
                duty (though of imperfect obligation), to invoke the aid of courts of criminal
39             jurisdiction for the enforcement of the criminal law by this procedure. It is
                a right which nowadays seldom needs to be exercised by an ordinary
                member of the public, for since the formation of regular police forces
42             charged with the duty in public law to prevent and detect crime and to
                bring criminals to justice, and the creation in 1879 of the office of Director
                of Public Prosecutions, the need for prosecutions to be undertaken (arid
45             paid for) by private individuals has largely disappeared; but it still exists
                and is a useful constitutional safeguard against capricious, corrupt or
                                  'S                          .10-

               biased failure or refusal of those authorities to prosecute offenders against
               the criminal law.”
 3
     Reliance is also placed on a passage at para 7.50 in the report of the Royal
     Commission on Criminal Procedure 1981, which refers to the retention of the right of
 6   private prosecution “as an effective safeguard against improper inaction by the
     prosecuting authority”, and to a recent recommendation of the Law Commission,
     contained in para 5.26 o f its final report on “Consents to Prosecution” (October 1998),
 9   to the effect that private prosecutions might be made subject to a statutory provision
     requiring the consent of the CPS.

12                 In my judgment this argument is also misconceived. The obiter dicta in
     Gouriet are not reflected in the 1985 statute, which was of course enacted some seven
     years after Gouriet was decided. More particularly, it is simply quixotic to suggest that
15   the DPP should allow a private prosecution to go ahead if there has been “inertia,
     partiality or improper action” by the public prosecutor - namely himself - but not
     otherwise. Is he to be judge and jury on the question whether he has let the public
18   down? Their Lordships’ dicta in Gouriet do not with respect provide anything
     approaching a compulsory template of a lawful policy to be adopted by the DPP for
     the execution of his duty under ss.6(2) and 23(3).
21
     The Code f o r Crown Prosecutors

24                  The argument here, at least as originally put forward in M’s skeleton
     argument, was that because of his view (referred to in the reasons letter) that private
     prosecutors are not bound to apply the Code when deciding whether to institute
27   proceedings, the DPP has erroneously proceeded on the basis that the principles in the
     Code are irrelevant to his discretion under ss.6(2) and 23(3). But the D?P has nowhere
     stated that he regards the Code as systematically or generally irrelevant to his power to
30   discontinue. Indeed, as I shall show, there are some aspects of the Code which are
     reflected in his approach to the question, how his policy should be applied in this case.
     In truth, however, it could not be right for the DPP to apply across the board the same
33   tests, in particular the “reasonable prospect of conviction” test referred to in the
     correspondence, in considering whether to take over and discontinue a private
     prosecution as the Code enjoins Crown Prosecutors to follow in deciding whether to
36   institute or proceed with a prosecution themselves; the consequence would be that the
     DPP would stop a private prosecution merely on the ground that the case is not one
     which he would himself proceed with. But that, in my judgment, would amount to an
39   emasculation of s.6(l) and itself be an unlawful policy; and in fairness Mr Harrison
     (#7 o f M ’s skeleton) made it clear that he did not submit so much. The very premise of
     s.6(l) must be that some cases will go to trial which the DPP himself chooses not to
42   prosecute.

                    As it seems to me the only points remaining in relation to the Code
45    concern the application o f the DPP’s policy to the facts of this case, and I will deal
      with that shortly.

           The “clearly no case to answ er” test
      3
                          The argument here (#7 o f the skeleton) is that such a test is
           impermissibly rigid. It is said that the policy excludes “any assessment of evidential
      6    deficiencies” and so amounts to an unlawful fetter o f the DPP’s discretion; and that it
           “also leads to a distorted evaluation of the public interest factors” . In my judgment
           the test involves no unlawful fetter o f discretion. It is plain from the formulation “there
      9    is clearly no case to answer” (my emphasis) that the DPP only intends to stop private
           prosecutions on this ground where no reasonable decision-maker could conclude that
           there was sufficient evidence for the case to go forward. That seems to me to be a
  12       perfectly proper approach. Such a prosecution could offer no legitimate benefit to
           anyone and would, potentially at least, be an abuse o f the process o f the court. The
           test rightly identifies a class of case which should always be stopped; if the case is not
« 5        within the class, then the decision whether to stop it will, o f course, depend on the
           other two tests which, in my judgment, amply contemplate an exercise o f discretion in
           which all material factors will be considered and whose application accordingly
  18       negates any unlawful fetter of discretion.

                        As regards any “distorted evaluation” of the public interest test, it is
  21       clear that the three aspects of the policy are individually self-standing. Their
           respective application in this case is a another matter, to which as I have said I will
           come. But the applicants have a separate argument about the public interest test.
  24
            The “public interest fa c to rs” test

  27                        Here it is submitted (#8 o f the skeleton) that the public interest
            necessarily involves consideration of the likelihood of conviction, so that the
            evidential test should not be hived off from that relating to the public interest. Mr
^ 30        Harrison also argues that the public interest test as formulated - “the public interest
           factors tending against prosecution clearly outweigh those fa cto rs tending in
           fa v o u r” - gets it the wrong way round; the test should be whether the public interest
  33        factors in favour of the private prosecution outweigh those against.

                           I see no reason why quite aside from the evidential test o f no case to
  36        answer the DPP should not, within his policy as presently formulated, have in mind
            the likelihood or otherwise of conviction when considering where the public interest
            lies. And I see no basis for the suggestion that the law should compel the DPP to
  39        reverse the effect o f the public interest factors .so as to favour discontinuance unless in
            his judgment they clearly point in the other direction. The test as presently formulated
            seems to me designed to allow proper scope for the operation o f the right o f private
  42        prosecution. The private prosecutor is veiy likely to take a different view as to where
            the public interest lies than does the DPP, and s.6(l), I think, implies that he is entitled
            to do so. The approach urged by Mr Harrison would in effect require the private
  45        prosecutor to persuade the DPP that his view of the public interest is plainly right. I
            consider it strongly arguable that that would place an illegitimate constraint upon the
                                                                  •   12-

     right o f private prosecution; but it is enough to hold, as I would, that the present public
     interest policy is perfectly consistent with the objects of the statute and thus well
 3   within the proper discretion of the DPP.

                     Mr Harrison directed similar criticisms to the third limb o f the policy,
 6   but in light o f what I have said about the public interest test they possess no separate
     force.

 g                                                          * * *



                       For all these reasons, the DPP’s policy overall is in my judgment a
12    lawful one. The real question in the case is whether it has been lawfully applied. It is
      clear that (a) the DPP maintains his view that the “reasonable prospect o f conviction”
      test in the Code would not be met in this case, but that (b) the “no evidence” test is not
15   met either (save as regards the charge against D of attempting to pervert the course of
      justice, with which I deal separately below). In those circumstances, the application of
      the public interest test was crucial. In this context it is convenient to deal first with Mr
18   Harrison’s submission that the reasons letter shows that the DPP has given improper
      and perhaps decisive weight to the “no evidence” test. He relies on the sentence which
      follows the-conclusion that that test is not satisfied: “It was not right, therefore, for
21    the Service to take over the proceedings with a view to terminating them”, and.
      submits that it suggests the author of the letter considered that that was the end of the
      matter. However after dealing with the particular issue concerning the charge against .
24   D of attempting to pervert the course of justice, the letter continues: “I also
      considered whether, nevertheless, there were overriding public interest factors
      that should lead to the Service intervening with a view to discontinuance” . I think
27   the letter could have been better expressed, so as to make it clear that the public
       interest test is by no means secondaiy to the “no evidence” test. However I am quite
       satisfied that there was no intention to downgrade or sideline the balance o f public
30   interest factors. It is not really credible to suppose that author of the letter
       misunderstood or failed to apply the very policy which he had just clearly set out.

33   The D P P ’s judgm ent o f thepublic interest

                     Mr Harrison submitted that in light of everything that had gone before,
36   and not least Stuart-Smith LJ’s Scrutiny, there were no public interest factors
      favouring continuation of the prosecutions o f D and M. He said that there is nothing in
      the reasons letter to show that the DPP accepted the suggestion, urged forcefully and
39   at length by the HFSG in the course o f their representations, that further evidence had
      come to light since the Scrutiny. With this latter proposition I agree. But the reasons
      letter clearly implies an acceptance that some factors existed which favoured the
42   prosecutions. It stated: “I came to the conclusion that any public interest factors
      tending against prosecution did not clearly outweigh those in favour” . What were
      those in favour? If in truth there were no factors which a reasonable decision-maker
45   could regard as going in favour of the prosecutions, then the DPP’s decision would be

        vulnerable to a challenge on Wednesbury1 grounds (as indeed Mr Harrison claims it is)
        since there would be nothing in public interest terms to weigh in the scales against
    3   discontinuance. When the case was opened there was no affidavit from the DPP
        dealing with the point, nor did Mr Havers’ skeleton argument articulate any such
        factors. So it was that, effectively at the court’s invitation so that the matter could be
    6   clarified, Mr Newell swore an affidavit for the DPP on 22 March 1999. He is the CPS’
        Director of Casework and the author of the reasons letter. Paras 2 - 4 are as follows:

    9             “2. A s I now recall, the public interest factors tending against prosecution
                  which I considered were as follows:

   12                       (1) Previous reviews of the case, in particular those carried out by
                            the DPP when considering the question whether criminal
                            proceedings should be taken against Mr Duckenfield and Mr

•s                          Murray and the more recent report of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.

                            (2) The fact that the Applicants had been told on previous occasions
   18                       that the DPP did not intend to prosecute.

                            (3) The delay which had occurred between the commission of the
   21                       alleged offences and the commencement of this prosecution and its
                            likely effect on the Applicants, although I took the view that delay
                            may be offset by the seriousness of the alleged offences (as is reflected
   24                       in paragraph 6.5(d) of the Code...).

                            (4) The effect of the delay on the evidence, for example in terms of
   27                       the potential impairment of the recollections of witnesses.

                            (5) The assertion made on behalf of Mr Murray of ill-health,
6 3 0                       although I noted that no medical evidence had been put forward in
                            support of this assertion and that, as again reflected in the Code (at
                            paragraph 6.5(e)), ill-health may be offset by the seriousness of the
   33                       offence.

                  3. As against these factors tending against prosecution, there was in my
   36             view one extremely important factor in favour of prosecution, namely the
                  very serious nature of the alleged offences, in particular, the alleged
                  offences of manslaughter. In my opinion, the allegation that two senior
   39             police officers were responsible for the deaths of a number of people as a
                  result of criminal negligence was a very grave allegation.

   42              4. Paragraph 6.2 of the Code reflects the considerable weight attached by
                   the CPS to the seriousness of the alleged offence when seeking to strike the
                   right balance as to the factors for and against prosecution. (I refer also to

                    One of Mr Harrison’s complaints, advanced before this affidavit was
 9   sworn, was that the policy should have taken account o f para 10.1 of the Code which
     includes this:

12            “Normally, if the Crown Prosecution Service tells a suspect or defendant
              that there will not be a prosecution... that is the end of the matter... But
               occasionally there are special reasons why the Crown Prosecution Service
15            will re-start the prosecution, particularly if the case is serious.”

       This is one of the points relating to the Code which, as it seems to me, bear on the
18   application of the policy rather than the policy itself; and para 2(2) o f Mr Newell’s
      affidavit shows that regard was had to assurances or statements made to D and M that
      for his part the DPP would not prosecute. Clearly it was right to do so, within the
21    public interest balance. But I think there is a qualitative difference between the
      situation where the DPP himself goes back upon a previous assurance not to prosecute
      and one where the DPP does not change his mind but a private prosecutor chooses to
24   instigate proceedings.

                    In reply, having by then seen Mr Newell’s affidavit, Mr Harrison made
27   further submissions. While accepting that there could be a case in which a single
      factor favouring prosecution might not be outweighed by a multiplicity o f factors
      going the other way, he submitted that if the raft of public interest considerations
30   favouring discontinuance in this case was held not to be enough to outweigh the single
      factor of the allegations’ gravity, it was difficult or impossible to imagine what set of
      considerations might do so; and the court should conclude that DPP had fettered his
33   discretion by treating the seriousness of the allegations as overriding everything else,
      so that he had not in truth carried out a proper balancing exercise at all.

36                  I would reject this argument. There is no reason to suppose that the
      factors against prosecution were not properly weighed and considered, and certainly
      no basis for the supposition that once faced with a private prosecution for something
39   as serious as manslaughter the DPP would inevitably decide to allow it to proceed.

                  Mr Harrison submitted next that Mr Newell’s affidavit showed that the
42   DPP had transposed from the Code the “seriousness of the charge” factor as a
     consideration favouring the prosecution without also taking account of his own view
     that the Code test of “realistic prospect of conviction” was not m et I agree that the
45   DPP’s view of the prospects o f conviction is a proper matter for him to consider,
      within the public interest test contained in the policy, when deciding whether io

     discontinue; but, as it seems to me, para 2(1) of Mr N ewell’s affidavit shows that in
     this case he has done so.
3
                    Then Mr Harrison suggested that para 3 of the affidavit demonstrated
     that the DPP’s view o f the gravity of the allegation was informed simply by the fact
 6   that there was a manslaughter charge. He had not properly considered the real degree
      of culpability inherent in the facts alleged; and the gravity of the offence of
     manslaughter can vary very widely. There is nothing in this. Mr Newell made it
 9   perfectly clear that he had regard to the species of manslaughter in question
      (“criminal negligence”) and it cannot sensibly be doubted that he was well aware and
      took account o f the circumstances in which the alleged offences are said to have been
12   committed.

                   Lastly on this part o f the case Mr Harrison submitted that the refusal to
 5   discontinue was simply perverse, given the “enormous weight” o f the public interest
     considerations going the other way.

18                The DPP might, in my judgment, lawfully'have decided to discontinue.
     The tragic events at Hillsborough have been the subject o f repeated, detailed, thorough
     enquiries. Nearly ten years have passed. But the judgment was for the DPP to make. If
21   we acceded to Mr Harrison’s submission, we would I think usurp the role of the
     primary decision-maker.

24                 In my judgment the decision not to discontinue is no more unlawful than
     is the policy which the DPP applied.

30                             .
                    Mr Harrison discretely submits that the decision to let the charge of
     attempting to pervert the course o f justice go ahead was unlawful, because it runs flat
33   counter to the “no case to answer” test in his own policy. It will be recalled that the
     reasons letter said:

36            “I concluded further that it would not be right to intervene in respect of the
               one remaining charge against Mr Duckenfield, of attempting to pervert the
               course of justice, albeit I had formed the view that there was clearly no case
39            to answer on that charge alone... in the context of the case as a whole that
               charge is not the gravamen of the criminality alleged against Mr
               Duckenfield and I concluded that my approach to that charge should be led
42            by my conclusions on the charges of manslaughter and wilful neglect to
               perform a public duty.”

45    Paras 5 and 6 o f Mr N ew ell’s affidavit state as follows:

              “5. I was fully aware of the seriousness of the additional charge. I also
              tentatively concluded that partial intervention... was in law open to the CPS
3             and I proceeded on that assumption. However, the existing policy did not
              cover the situation which arose in this case, namely where the conclusion
              was reached that there was clearly a case to answer in relation to some of
 6            the charges but not in relation to others. (I can say that with some
              confidence, since I had overall responsibility for formulating the policy.) ...
              I concluded that it was in fact inappropriate to intervene only to take over
 9            (with a view to discontinuing) this additional charge.

              6. First, partial intervention was not, in my view, either appropriate or
12            desirable. It seemed to me that the DPP should either intervene so as to
              take over the proceedings in their entirety or not at all. To have intervened
              partially would still have left the criminal proceedings in place in relation to
15            the other charges which included the even more serious charge of
              manslaughter. Secondly, I took into account the fact that Mr Duckenfield
              would not be left without any remedy in relation to this additional charge.
18            On the contrary, he would be entitled to invite the M agistrates’ Court to
              dismiss it on the basis that there was no case to answer. Thirdly, the charge
              arose out of essentially the same events as the events which gave rise to the
21            other charges and thus those events would be scrutinised in any event.”


24                   I of course accept that Mr Newell did not subjectively believe - or intend
     - that the policy covered this situation. But the policy has to be read objectively; there
     can be no doubt that it gave rise to a legitimate expectation on the part of D and M
27   that it would be applied according to its terms. The first question, then, is as to the true
     meaning of the policy on a fair reading of the letter o f 27 July 1998 and the reasons
     letter. It is true that the letters use the singular: “the prosecution” and “a private
30   prosecution”. But it is elementary that in criminal cases each count constitutes a
     separate indictment; it is as if there are separate trials relating to each. And this is no
     mere technicality; for it means, of course, that where there is more than one charge
33   any question whether there is “no case to answer” is, as regards each individual
     charge, wholly discrete. I do not consider that the policy can fairly be read as
     indicating that the DPP would necessarily either take over or discontinue a private
36   prosecution in its entirety. In my view the articulation o f the “no case to answer” test
     would be taken by any informed reader, facing a multiple private prosecution, to imply
     that the DPP would consider whether in his view there was clearly no case to answer
39    on each charge.

                     The DPP concluded that there was clearly no such case in relation to this
      charge against D, and yet decided to allow it to proceed. It follows, in my judgment,
      that there is a breach of D ’s legitimate expectation that the policy would be applied.
      The pragmatic factors spoken to by Mr Newell in para 6 can make no difference. Nor,
      of course, can the vigorous assertion by the HFSG that there is in fact a case to
      answer. What matters for present purposes is the DPP’s conclusion on that issue.

        The Second Case: the Decision o f the SYPA
  12
                        First I should describe the further facts which are specifically relevant to
        the second case. These must be read into the narrative o f events which I have already


•
    5   given in relation to the first case; it seems to me clearer and more convenient to isolate
        here the particular facts which bear on the challenge to the decision o f the SYPA.

   18                  The history shows that at earlier stages the SYPA had been prepared to
         provide financial support for D and M (and other officers) to be legally represented in
         matters arising from the Hillsborough disaster. On 7 December 1990 they resolved to
   21   fund the representation of six police officers, including D and M, at the inquest. They
         had earlier resolved not to do so; the decision of 7 December was taken after
         considering “the most recent legal advice available”. Then on 1 August 1997 the
   24   SYPA resolved to set aside £500,000 for financial assistance for police officers in
         connection with Stuart-Smith LJ’s Scrutiny. In both instances they had considered a
         report from the Chief Constable (or a joint report of the Chief Constable and the Clerk
   27   and Treasurer). The latter decision was said to be taken “in accordance with the
         principles set out in Home Office Circular No 77/87 Financial Assistance to Police
         Officers in Legal Proceedings”, to which I will have to refer.
£ 3 °
                         On 27 February 1998, following publication of the Scrutiny, and
         considering that “there were indications that private prosecutions could be brought
   33   against 3 afficers”, the SYPA resolved in principle to authorise consideration being
         given to applications by officers for financial assistance. On 5 March 1998 D ’s
         application for such assistance was approved by the SYPA, and M ’s was approved on
   36   29 June 1998. It will be recalled that three days earlier, on 26 June, AA had first
          sought to institute criminal proceedings against D and M in the South Sefton Petty
          Sessional Division. On 20 November 1998 M applied for further financial assistance
   39   in relation to the judicial review which was then seen to be in prospect should the DPP
         decide to allow the private prosecutions to continue; and the HFSG had made it clear
         that were the DPP to take over the prosecutions and discontinue, they would seek a
   42   judicial review. On 21 December 1998 counsel for D and M indicated to the
          Stipendiary Magistrate their intention to seek a judicial review of the DPP’s decision; I
         have already referred to this in dealing with Mr Jones’ misconceived argument that the
   45   first case should be dismissed on grounds of delay. The following day, 22 December
          1998, in a letter of over six pages AA made written representations on leading
                                                                 • 18 •

     counsel’s advice to urge the SYPA that the decision to fund the defences of D and M
      was “unlawful, irrational, ultra vires and procedurally improper on various

      to the prospective judicial review proceedings. On 5 January 1999 AA wiote a further
      lengthy letter to the SYPA repeating and expanding her assertions that the funding
 6   decisions were unlawful.

                     Then on 5 February 1999 the SYPA passed the resolutions under
 9    challenge, “that, on balance, the Authority has no legal power to provide financial
      assistance” to D and M in respect either of the private prosecution or a judicial review'
      of the DPP’s decision. On 10 February 1999 the CCSY’s application for judicial
12   review in these proceedings was lodged, and on the same day solicitors for the SYPA
      wTote to the Crown Office to consent to the grant of leave and seek expedition. They
      stated:
15            “SYPA passed these resolutions with great reluctance on the basis of advice
              received from ourselves and Counsel...”

                    The legality or otherwise of the decisions under challenge ultimately
21   turns on the construction and application of s. 6(1) of the Police Act 1996 and s.111(1)
     of the Local Government Act 1972. I shall have to look at other statutory provisions,
     but it is convenient to set these out at once. The cross-heading to s.6 reads “General
24   functions of police authorities”, and ss.(l) provides:

               “Every police authority established under section 3 shall secure the
27             maintenance of an efficient and effective police force for its area.”

      S. 111(1) of the Act of 1972 in its present form provides:
30
              “Without prejudice to any powers exercisable apart from this section but
              subject to the following provisions of this Act, a local authority shall have
33            power to do any thing (whether or not involving expenditure, borrowing or
              lending of money or the acquisition or disposal of any property or rights)
              which is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the
36            discharge of their functions.”


39                   S. 111(1) applies to police authorities (but in light of my conclusions it is
      unnecessary to go into the legislative history relating to that). Now, it might be
      thought - indeed this is the applicants’ case - that by s.6(1), securing “the
42    maintenance of an efficient and effective police force” is plainly made the function
       of a police authority, and that accordingly it is no less plain that s. 111(1) empowers
      the police authority to do such things as fund the legal representation of police officers
45    in proceedings if the authority reasonably concludes that to do so is conducive to that
       function’s discharge. That has been the settled view of the Association of Chief Police

         Officers, the Police Superintendents Association, and (until 1998) the Home Office.
         The decision to provide such finance, in common with any decision taken under
    3   s. 111(1), would of course be subject to well known public law constraints enshrined in
         the Wednesbury and P adfielS principles. There is before the court an affidavit of Mr
         Daines, Assistant Chief Constable o f South Yorkshire, in which he describes what he
    6   regards as the “absolutely vital” requirement “that officers should know that if they
         act in good faith in performing their duties their Police Authority will support
         them in the event that they face litigation” . If as a matter o f vires s. 111(1) allows a
    9   police authority to incur expenditure in furtherance of the general function seemingly
         conferred by s.6(1), then in my judgment the use o f s. 111(1) to finance police officers’
         legal expenses in litigation, including private prosecutions brought against them and
   12   the bringing o f judicial review proceedings, cannot in principle be ruled unlawful on
          Wednesbury or Padfield grounds. The circumstances in which such funding might be
         provided in any particular case is another matter. The policy has in the past been to the
   15   effect that the authority must be satisfied that the officer has acted in good faith in the
         discharge o f his duty; and I can see that, at least where a private prosecution is
         involved, there may be issues for the authority to consider which would involve their
   18    taking a view o f the merits in advance of any trial. But in these proceedings we are not
         concerned with any question whether, when, or to what extent the SYPA might
         provide financial assistance to D or M. We are only to decide whether the power
   21    exists to do so at all.

                       In fact the argument o f the CCS Y was put two ways by Mr Baker QC. It
   24   w'as first said that s.6(1) o f itself, without the aid o f s.. 111(1), enabled the funding
        decision. Alternatively, it was enabled by s. 111(1) read with s.6(1).

   27                 Upon this issue Miss Baxendale QC for the SYPA submits that the
        apparently obvious relation between s.6(1) and s. 111(1) is in fact no relation at all.
        The essence of her argument may be expressed very shortly, as follows.
* 3 0                        _     ..................... ..              .


“                     (a) S.6(1) confers no powers of any kind. All the powers possessed by
        police authorities are conferred elsewhere in the Police Act and by the local
   33   government legislation. S.6(1) does no more than to provide the purpose for which the
        authority’s powers are to be exercised; it states the Act’s “policy and objects”, in the
        language o f the Padfield case, as they apply to police authorities. If this is right, it
   36   would contradict Mr Baker’s first argument, that s.6(1) alone is enough to empower
        the SYPA to fund D and M.

   39                 (b) S. 111(1) cannot be read as: enabling the authority to do anything
        which is not ancillary to a power which is elsewhere conferred upon it. If this is right,
        then taken with (a) it contradicts Mr Baker’s second argument which relies on
   42   s .lll(l).

                    There is no doubt that express powers are conferred on police authorities
     by a raft of statutory provisions. Miss Baxendale says that such provisions support
 3    proposition (a) which I have set out, by application o f the canon o f statutory
      construction expressed by the Latin maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius. Thus,
      she submits, where Parliament has seen fit to confer a range of specific powders on
 6   police authorities, the intention must have been thereby to set the limits on what such
      an authority may do and it cannot be supposed that s.6(1) provides an undefined and
      open-ended power to do anything else which the authority may choose, merely on the
 9   ground that in some way it may be said to support the general aim of “the
      maintenance of an efficient and effective police force” . The high water-mark of this
      submission is found in s.88(4) of the Act of 1996 which confers an express power to
12   fund police officers’ costs in certain circumstances which do not include the defence
      of private (or any) criminal prosecutions or participation in proceedings for judicial
      review.
15
                    I shall have to look in a little more detail at s.88(4). I have concluded,
     however, that the correctness or otherwise of proposition (a) is not in the end at the
18   centre of the case. The reason is that in the particular statutory context proposition (b)
      is in my judgment wrong; so that the SYPA is enabled by s. 111(1) (subject to
      Wednesbury and Padfield). to finance D and M in the criminal and judicial review
21   proceedings even if s.6(1) confers no powers as such.

                    The scheme of the Act of 1996 involves the distribution of
24   responsibilities between three bodies: the Chief Constable, the Secretary of State, and
     the police authority. The Chief Constable’s role is principally given by s. 10:

27            “(1) A police force maintained under section 2 shall be under the direction
              and control of the chief constable appointed under s .ll."

30            (2) In discharging his functions, every chief constable shall have regard to
              the local policing plan issued by the police authority for his area under
              section 8.”
33
      (S .ll provides for the appointment and removal of the Chief Constable, by the police
      authority with the approval of the Secretary of State.) I should notice also ss.22(l) and
36   44(4):
              “22(1) Every chief constable shall, as soon as possible after the end of each
              financial year, submit to the police authority a general report on the
39            policing during that year of the area for which his force is maintained.”

              “44(4) Every chief constable shall, as soon as possible after the end of each
42            financial year, submit to the Secretary of State the like report as is required
              by section 22(1) to be submitted to the police authority.”

45   The role of the Secretary of State is principally given by ss.36 and 37(1):

          as appears to him to be best calculated to promote the efficiency and
          effectiveness of the police.”

           37(1) The Secretary of State may by order determine objectives for the
          policing of the areas of all police authorities established under section 3.”

As regards the Secretary o f State’s position I should notice also these provisions of the
Act o f 1996:
        “38(1) Where an objective has been determined under section 37, the
        Secretary of State may direct police authorities to establish levels of
        performance (performance targets) to be aimed at in seeking to achieve the
        objective.

          39(1) The Secretary of State may issue codes of practice relating to the
          discharge by police authorities established under section 3 of any of their
          functions.”

The role o f the police authority is given first by the subsections o f s.6 which follow
subsection (1):

          “6(2) In discharging its functions, every police authority established under
          section 3 shall have regard to -

          (a) any objectives determined by the Secretary of State under section 37,

          (b) any objectives determined by the authority under section 7,

          (c) any performance targets established by the authority, whether in
          compliance with a direction under section 38 or otherwise, and

          (d) any local policing plan issued by the authority under section 8.

          (3) In discharging any function to which a code of practice issued under
          section 39 relates, a police authority established under section 3 shall have
          regard to the code.

          (4) A police authority shall comply with any direction given to it by the
          Secretary of State under section 38 or 40.”

These provisions, of course, confer duties rather than powers, in relation to the police
authority I should next notice ss.7 - 9:

         objectives determined under section 37 also relate, or to other matters, but
         in any event shall be so framed as to be consistent with the objectives
         determined under that section.

         (3) Before determining objectives under this section, a police authority shall

         (a) consult the chief constable for the area, and

         (b) consider any views obtained by the authority in accordance with
         arrangements made under section 96.

          (2) The local policing plan shall include a statement of the authority's

          (4) Before issuing a local policing plan which differs from the draft

       S. 14 is important:

_1 5            “(1) Each police authority established under section 3 shall keep a fund to

  18            (2) Subject to any regulations under the Police Pensions Act 1976, all

 21
                 (3) Accounts shall be kept by each police authority of payments made into

        Then s.43(l):

  27            “A police authority shall, whenever so required by the Secretary of State,

               constable as to the arrangements that would be appropriate.”
 9

                    Looking at the whole picture displayed by these provisions, it is clear
12   that the Chief Constable is in charge of day-to-day policing (s. 10(1)); the police
     authority has a role in relation to policy, or strategy (ss.7, 8 and other provisions); but
     this is subject to the overall direction of the Secretary o f State (ss.37, 38, 39 and other
15   provisions, taken with s.6((2) - (4)). The police authority holds the purse (s. 14). Those
     provisions specifically concerned with the police authority’s role confer duties rather
     than powers, though in some cases there is clearly a discretion as to how the duty is to
18   be performed (as for example under s.37). Other powers (including those contained in
     s. 111(1)) are conferred on the police authority by the local government legislation, to
     the extent that measures there contained were applied to police authorities by
21   s.l4 6A (l) of the Act of 1972. The powers so conferred are listed in a helpful note
     provided by Miss Baxendale. I do not propose to set them out. They include (apart
     from s. 111(1)) such matters as the disposition and treatment o f staff and the -
24   acquisition and disposal of land.

                    The critical point which in my judgment emerges from a consideration
27   of the interlocking roles of Chief Constable, Secretary of State and police authority is
     that it cannot have been within the contemplation of Parliament in enacting the
     scheme, and in embracing within it s. 111(1), that the police authority should only be
30   empowered to incur expenditure in support of those duties, and ancillary powers,
     which are specifically conferred upon it. The police authority holds the funds from
     which expenses for its local police force will be supplied: s. 14. It is inherent in the
33   system (as Mr Baker submitted in reply) that the Chief Constable will apply to the
     authority for authorisation to incur expenditure; it may be for the use o f resources such
     as helicopters, or the installation of video surveillance systems in city streets, or a host
36   of other things. No doubt the Chief Constable presents a general budget. We were not
     referred to any provision in statute which shows or suggests that the police authority’s
     power to accede to such requests rests in anything other than the combination of s.6(1)
39   and s. 111(1). Given this, it seems to me plain that, in the particular context before us
     in this case, the legitimate scope of the ancillary power provided by s.l 11(1) cannot be
     restricted so as to support only those powers and duties which are expressly conferred
42   on the police authority. Those powers and duties are themselves ancillary; though they
     are very important, they take second place to the Chief Constable’s tactical role, and
     second place also to the Secretary of State’s strategic role. S .ll 1(1) must in context
45   (whatever it does in other cases) allow the police authority to support what its express
     Dowers and duties also support; and this is no less than its general function conferred
                                                              -25 -

      by s.6(1). If that is right, the authority may in principle decide to fond officers’ legal
      representation in proceedings no less than they may fund any other activity which the
 3    Chief Constable might propose as being conducive to “the maintenance of an
      efficient and effective police force for its area”.

 5                    This result is supported, if only ex silentio, by the decision o f this court
       in R v Derbyshire Police Authority ex p. Wilson (8 August 1989, unreported save in
       The Times). The court had to consider a decision of the police authority not to
 9    contribute to the legal expenses o f two police officers in relation to an auditor’s
       enquiry. The court assumed that s.4 of the Police Act 1964 (the predecessor of s.6(1))
      provided the power to grant financial assistance. However the point o f principle was
12    not argued. The applicants also point to other materials. In 1962 the report of the
       Royal Commission on the Police was published. It indicated the then current practice
       in relation to the provision o f financial support to police officers in civil proceedings,
       which included a requirement that “a constable must have acted in good faith in the
       intended execution of his duty” (para 196(a)). Para 197 stated:

18             “In England and Wales a distinction is made between a private prosecution,
               in which the decision as to the support of the constable will be taken on the
               same basis as in the case of a civil action, and a public prosecution brought
21             by the police or the Director of Public Prosecutions.”

      Home Office Circular 77/1987, published on 4 December 1987, stated:
24
                “... acting in pursuance of its general statutory duty to maintain an
                adequate and efficient police force for its area, the police authority has
27             discretion to meet expenditure incurred by officers in all kinds of legal
                proceedings where the officers have acted in good faith in pursuance of
                their duties, or the interests of the force as a whole are involved...
(30            [Then under the heading “Private Prosecutions”]
                A police officer should be able to carry out his duties in the confidence that,
                if he acts in good faith and exercises his judgment reasonably, his police
33             authority will support him. If, in a case where a member of the public
                brings a prosecution against an officer, the authority is satisfied that the
                officer has acted in this way, the authority should provide or fund legal
36             advice and/or representation.”

         On 17 February 1998 Home Office Circular 4/1998 was published. Unlike its
39    predecessor it sits on the fence as regards the power of a police authority to fund
       defences to private prosecutions. It has no persuasive effect one way or the other upon
       the issues in these proceedings. The earlier Circular, though obviously not a source of
42    law, may possibly possess some force as regards the purposes to be fulfilled by
       s.6 (l)’s predecessor in s.4(l) o f the Police Act 1964: see per Scarman LJ as he then
       was in Bristol DC v Clark [1975] 3 AER 976, refenred to in Wilson. But there are
45    great dangers in treating government pronouncements, however helpful, as an aid to
       statutory construction. I would prefer to base my conclusion, that s. 111(1) in principle
                                     '                         -26-

     empowers the SYPA to support D and M’s defence (and their participation in the
     judicial review against the DPP), upon those considerations touching the correct
 3   construction o f the material statutory provisions which I have already set out.

                    If my Lords agree with this conclusion, it is enough to dispose of the
 6   case in the applicants’ favour. However we heard much argument on the question
     whether s.6(1) conferred on the police authority any power, in any circumstances, to
     take action not otherwise expressly authorised. This engages Miss Baxendale’s
 9   proposition (a) as I have described it, and her reliance on the expressio unius est
     exclusio alterius doctrine. It only has relevance if I am wrong to hold, as I have done,
     that s. 111(1) in principle enables the SYPA to fund D and M even if s.6(1) does not
12   itself empower the authority to do anything. In this context I will deal only (and that
     shortly) with s. 8 8(4) of the Act of 1996, which as I have said is the high water-mark of
     this part of Miss Baxendale’s argument.
15
                   S.88 contains a comprehensive scheme as to liability on the part of the
     police for torts. By ss.(l) the chief officer of police for a police area is liable in
18   respect of torts committed by constables under his direction and control in the
     performance or purported performance of their functions. Without this provision there
     would be no such liability because police officers are not servants but office-holders.
21   Ss.(2) provides in part:

                 “There shall be paid out of the police fund -
24
                              (a) any damages or costs awarded against the chief officer of police
                              in any proceedings brought against him by virtue of this section and
27                            any costs incurred by him in any such proceedings so far as not
                              recovered by him in the proceedings...”

30   Ss. (4) provides:-
             “A police authority may, in such cases and to such extent as appear to it to
             be appropriate, pay out of the police fund -
33
                              (a) any damages or costs awarded against a person to whom this
                              subsection applies in proceedings for a tort committed by that
36                            person,

42                            that has or might have given rise to such proceedings.”

     In my judgment this provision offers no support for Miss Baxendale’s reliance on the
45   exclusio alterius rule. S.88 is self-standing. It has no implications for the general reach
     of the police authority’s functions. And once s.88(4) was to allow the police authority

       to cover damages awarded against an officer in a tort action, it is no surprise that it
       covers costs as well. If it did not, there might well be an argument - based on the
   3   exclusio alterius rule - that costs were deliberately excluded.


   5                    In all these circumstances I do not think it necessary to go into the
        legislative history o f s.6(1), or to canvass the arguments which were addressed to us as
        to the construction or effect of its predecessor, s.4(l) o f the Police Act 1964. In the
   9   end there are two possibilities: s.6(1) empowers the police authority to do things, or it
        does not. I have so far proceeded on the assumption asserted by Miss Baxendale that it
        does not; but given that assumption, nevertheless for reasons I have sought to explain
  12    the SYPA possesses in principle the legal power to fund D and M.

                     In fact I think the better view is that s.6(l) enables the police authority to
  15   do things which reasonably support the function which s.6(1) confers. Such a power is
        by no means open-ended. It would not allow the authority to invade the provinces of
        the Chief Constable or the Secretary o f State; and this is an important and
  18    considerable constraint.

                         In the course o f argument some time was spent, in fairness at the
  21   encouragement o f the court, in seeing whether the specific provisions in the Act of
        1996 or the local government legislation, conferring specific powers on the police
        authority, left gaps which only s.6(1) could fill. Points were made about lower ranks’
  24   rights of representation in legal proceedings, which are covered as appropriate by the
        Police Federation; and about the representation of higher ranks in various forms of
        legal proceedings. But the answer to the question we must decide, whether the power
  27   to fund D and M in principle lies in the hands of the SYPA, cannot in my judgment
        depend on a trawl through all the things a police authority is expressly empowered to
        do. The provisions which expressly confer and impose powers and duties on police
^ 30   authorities do not constitute an independent code. The police authority’s functions are,
WS     to use a questionable modernism, symbiotic with those o f the Chief Constable and the
        Secretary o f State. So judged, and for the reasons I have given, they allow the use of
  33   s . l l 1(1) to fund officers in the defence of private prosecutions and in judicial review
        proceedings.

  36                   I would allow this application. It will be appropriate to hear counsel as
        to relief, and costs.

  39   MR JUSTICE CRESSWELL

        I agree.

        MR JUSTICE LATHAM

  45   I also agree.

                                  NOTICE OF DISCONTINUANCE


     Dear Sirs

     RE:     DAVID GODFREY DUCKENFIELD
             LEEDS MAGISTRATES COURT - ADJOURNED HEARING

     I have today written to the Clerk to the Justices at Leeds Magistrates’ Court, informing him,
     first, that I have taken over and secondly, that I am discontinuing under Section 23 of the
     Prosecution of Offences Act, 1985, the following charge against your client: that on the 15th
     day o f April, 1989, at Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield, with intent to pervert the
     course of justice, he did an act which had a tendency to pervert the course of justice in that he
     lied about the circumstances in which gate C at the. Football Stadium became open; contrary to
     Common Law.

     The effect of this notice is that your client no longer needs to attend court in respect of this
     charge and any bail conditions imposed in relation to it cease to apply.

     The decision to discontinue this charge has been taken because there is not enough evidence to
     provide a realistic prospect of conviction.

     This notice does not apply to any other charges against you client. Your client must still attend
     court in respect of these charges and any bail conditions imposed in relation to them continue to
     apply.

     Your client has the right to require the discontinued proceedings to be revived. If you wish to
     exercise this right, you must give written notice to the Clerk to the Justices at the above
     magistrates' court as soon as possible (and in any event within 35 days).

     Should your client wish to apply for any costs incurred in respect of our taking over of this
charge, you may make a written request to the Clerk to the Justices. It is not necessary to apply
for the proceedings to be continued in order to apply for your costs.

CAUTION: this notice only applies to the charge specified in it, and does not have any. effect in
relation to any others that may be pending, or other proceedings against your client.

Yours faithfully

    Dear Simon,

    REQUEST FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
    DA V ID DUCKENFIELD A N D BERNARD MURRAY



•
    I write in reply to your letter of 18th February 1999 and in confirmation of our recent telephone
    conversation.

    The request which you made on behalf of David Duckenfield and Bernard Murray has now been
    considered by the National Executive Committee of the Association. The Committee recognises that
    it is a most unsatisfactory position in which the retired officers now find themselves in respect of
    funding their legal representation in the pending judicial review. The judicial review has
    implications in the service far beyond the Hillsborough case but of course it has major implications
    for the two retired officers. It is for this reason that the Committee believe it to be appropriate that
    they be represented at the hearing.

    The Committee also believes that David Duckenfiejd and Bernard Murray should not put themselves
    financially at risk in order to co-join the action. For this reason the A ssociation is prepared to
    'underwrite' the legal representation of David Duckenfiold and Bernard Murray up to a maximum
    of £20,000.

  Should the issue be returned to the South Yorkshire Police Authority follow in g the judicial review-
  then you may consider it appropriate to draw its members attention to the fact that such financial
  a ssistan ce has not p r e v i o u s l y n provided by the Association to its retired members. Although
  they are no longer members of I           Association the National Executive Com m ittee believes that there

is a strong moral obligation to provide them with the support they deserve and without doubt

Dear Sirs

R - v - South Yorkshire Police Authority Ex Parte Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police

We refer to our letter of 1 April.

The outcome of the consolidated applications for judicial review will be reported to the Authority
this Friday, 9 April 1999. The Authority will then decide howr to proceed with your client's
application for financial assistance.

In the circumstances, in addition to the matters requested in our letter of 1 April, would you kindly
clarify the matters on w'hich financial assistance is being sought from the Authority. Would you
also let us know what other sources of fundingO have been or mightO be made available to «vour
                                                                                           <■
clients. For example, would you clarify the scope of assistance that has been given by The Police
Superintendents Association.

We also feel that the Authority should have the benefit of a legal opinion of the merits on the
charges against your client. In the circumstances, we would invite you to let us have an opinion
from leading Counsel instructed on behalf of your client. We would expect that opinion to detail
the prospects of succeeding at committal, trial, on an application to strikeout or otherwise.

The Authority will meet the costs of that opinion which we would expect to be limited to £1,000
plus VAT.

We look forward to hearing from you.


Yours faithfully

Dear Richard

Request for financial assistance

I refer to our recent exchange of correspondence and telephone conversations. I hope very soon to
be able to let vou have a substantive response to the issues we have raised.

In the meantime, I would like to mention four points:

1             Toint opinion of Counsel for Messrs Duckenfield and Murray

              Thank vou
                    j   for lettingO me have this document.

              However, it is not w hat I had hoped you would provide. It contains no analysis of the
              charges against your client, the evidence in support (and against) those charges or the
              merits of the charges and defences. Indeed, I would query whether it would actually
              qualify as an opinion on the merits of the charges against your client and Mr Duckenfield.
              It does little more than make one or two comments on the proceedings and repeat matters
              which are not in dispute.

              I also feel that a fee of £1,000 plus VAT for each of the teams of Counsel is not reasonable
              for what was provided, even if it were to qualify as an opinion.

              Therefore, I would invite you, and Simon Eastwood, and your respective Counsel to
              reconsider your response to our request of 7 April. I should hope you will let me have
              something more for w hat the Authority is prepared to pay.

        Thank you for your letter of 29 April with details in respect of some of your costs. I note
        that the details do not include amounts in respect of the South Sefton proceedings, nor is
        there an estimate of the future costs.

        I have seen a copy of your client's letter of 22 <A.pril to the Authority. A copy is enclosed in
        case you have not seen it. Would you please confirm that the letter sets out the scope of
        your client's application and that the application may be summarised as follows:

        4.1 For re-instatement of the assistance set out in the letter of 29 June 1998 from the Clerk
            and Treasurer to the Authority;

        4.2 For assistance to seek review of the decision of Chief Clerk,' South Sefton Magistrates
                                                                                           O
            Court, not to meet your client's costs out of central funds were the Clerk so to decide;
            and

        4.3 For assistance to meet your client's costs of the application for judicial review against
            the DPP, and the costs awarded against him.

In the light of paragraph 4.3 above, would you also let me have details of the costs of the judicial
review against the DPP together with the costs sought by the DPP pursuant to the order for costs
made against your client (if available).

I look forward to hearing from you on these matters.

Kind regards


Yours sincerely

H ILLSBO RO U G H D ISA STER - FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR LEGAL COSTS

In February, 1998 I made application to the Police Authority for financial assistance
with legal costs in respect o f the above and this was approved and communicated to
me in a letter dated 5th March. {Copy attached plus a lettei* of thanks to the
authority)                                                       I
                                                                      j
During the early part of this year representations were made to the Police Authority
that they may not have the power to provide financial assistance junder Home Office
Circular 4/98 and legal advice suggested the position was unclear. On the 5th
February, 1999 the Police Authority, with some reluctances decided to seek
clarification and temporarily suspended payment of legal costs pending the outcome
of a Judicial Review. On 31st March the High" Court ruled that the Police A uthority
do have the power to provide financial assistance to police officers facing legal
proceedings.

I therefore request that the financial assistance provided previously be reinstated, with
confirmation of continuing assistance with regard to private prosecution. In addition,
as requested previously by my solicitors, I am seeking reimbursement of my costs in
maintaining the judicial review against the Director of Public Pro secutions which was
partially successful, insofar as the decision by the Director m relation to the
perverting the course o f justice charge was quashed. Further, if necessary, financial
assistance for the judicial review in regard to South Sefton Chief "lerks refusal to tax
the costs of those previous proceedings.

In addition,    an order for costs was made in the judicial review against the DPP
because the     main decision was not overturned and I have been lordered to pay two
thirds of the   D PP’s costs in that regard. On the basis of Counsel’s advice, considering
the previous    decisions of the Director, the inquest verdict, the result of Lord Justice

Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny and the comments of the judge, I understand that it was
appropriate for this challenge to be made.

Indeed this was borne out by the fact that as a result of the High Court decision the
DPP has discontinued the charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice on the
basis that there was no case to answer. This was the only charge! alleging mala fides
against me. The remaining charges concern matters amounting to gross negligence
which will be vigorously defended. The High Court observed that the overall
challenge was highly arguable and had it been successful in all probability the whole
private prosecution with its obvious implications both personally and cost wise would
have been avoided.

I was employed as a police officer for 28 years rising to the rank of Chief
Superintendent until my retirem ent on medical grounds on the lOtth November, 1991.
I had an unblemished disciplinary record and was commended fcjr good police work
on three occasions.




At the time of leaving the Police Service it was indicated I mjay face disciplinary
proceedings for alleged irregularities arising from my conduct at the football stadium
but these allegations would have been vigorously contested. I stiall also contest the
present criminal allegations with the same determination.

pending criminal proceedings and the inevitable concern over funding add to what is
fast becoming an almost intolerable burden.

    22 April 1999

     Dear Mr Wilkinson

     I write as one of the two former South Yorkshire Police Officers facing a private
     prosecution over the 1989 Hillsborough disaster.

     At ail times I have carried out my duties as a Police Officer to the jfcest of my ability.
     I served the Police for 27 years and I have an unblemished record. I Like every Police
     Officer I believe that I am entitled to expect the support of my Chief Constable and
     the Police Authority.

     When it became known that HFSG were going to initiate these private prosecutions,
     I was promised financial support. On 28 June I wrote to the Chief Constable asking
     that the Police Authority be approached with a view to then reimbursing any legal_
     expenses that I may incur in defending myself. By letter of 29 June 1998 the
     Authority referring to my request confirmed that it would meet such reasonable
     expenses as I may incur in defending the proceedings instituted, I have relied upon
     that support. It is a matter or record that:

     a.      with reluctance the Police Authority sought to revoke the decision to grant
             funding;

     b.      that the decision was solely based upon the legal advice tha' the position as to
             the power to grant funding was unclear at law;

     c.      that consequent upon a Judicial Review, the law has been clarified and it has
             been confirmed that the Police Authority does have the power to fund the
             defence for private prosecutions for Police Officers in Judicial Review;

             that HFSG were told that as the prosecution they should not be seeking to
             interfere in the way in which the Defendants costs were beinc: met.

   Shortly before the 1988 FA Cup semi-final I was promoted and appointed
   Superintendent of Hammerton Road Sub-division. I performed duty at the semi-final
   in charge of the Police Control Room and the event was seen as a successful event.
   When the 1989 semi-final between identical teams was arranged!, similar plans and
   preparations were made. Everyone is aware of the terrible events of that day and
   despite my best efforts on the day I am sorry that I personally co uld not do more to
   minimise the deaths and the injuries that occurred.

   I cooperated fully with the public enquiry that followed, the inquest and the criminal
   enquiry. I answered all questions put to me. I accepted responsibility for the officers
   under my command. I accepted the criticism in the Taylor report, the decision of
   accidental death o f the Coroner’s Jury at the inquest and the decisions in 1990 and
   subsequently of the Director of Public Prosecutions that there was tc be no prosecution
   against any person.

   I had upon my promotion to the rank of Superintendent followed the recommendation
   of taking out and paying for a Legal Expenses Insurance Policy. Trjus is recommended
   because Superintendents are not eligible to any assistance through the Police
   Federation. A claim, under this policy, was made to meet my private legal costs for
   representation at the Coroner’s inquest. The inquest lasted much longer than anyone
   had anticipated so that the total legal expenses cover became exhausted. Application
   was made to the South Yorkshire Police Authority who agreed tp indemnify me in
   relation to the remainder of my legal costs.

   A charge was laid against me by the Police Complaints Authority. I was absolutely
   confident that I could successfully defend this. I would refute sny suggestion that
   these charges would have been proved and led to my dismissalj In January 1992
   whilst serving as a Superintendent I was informed that the charge against me had been
   withdrawn. Although I was relieved that there were to be no disciplinary proceedings
   I felt that I was also being denied the opportunity of being ablelto clear my name.
   This was particularly important to me as a Supervisory Office^ who placed great
   importance on maintaining the respect of the Officers under my command. I refute
   any suggestion that I took early retirement simply so as to avoid having to meet the
   disciplinary charges. I was denied the opportunity of clearing my! name because the
   charge was withdrawn.

   Throughout this whole period of time I continued my employment and remained on
   duty. From the day of the disaster and throughout the whole ofj the period of time
   when the various investigations were taking place 1 continued mjy employment and
   remained on duty.




    duty and retired on medical grounds in August 1992. Had it not fyeen for that day, I
    may well still have been a serving Police Officer in the South \ orkshire Police. I
    would have hoped for a further promotion during my career whic l would have been
    both professionally gratifying and would also have enhanced my income during the
                         Vi
South Yorkshire Jt Sec                                     23 fipr ’99       10:19    P. 04




    remainder of my Police service and ultimately my pension package. I am substantially
    worse off financially by virtue of having to take early retirement oil medical grounds.
    I am now 57 years of age and my savings (being principally the balance of the lump
    sum received on retirement) are the only supplement that I have 'to my pension and
    which have to last myself and my wife through the rest of our lifetime.


    I have had further psychiatric help since my retirement. It is considered that only time
    can heal. Time does heal to a certain extent and despite the stress returning every time
    there is a public airing or a “dramatised documentary” and the events never being
    forgotten, I was able to enjoy a reasonable quality of life. However since private
    summonses were served on me in June 1998 life has become particularly difficult, not
    just for me, but for my wife and family. Although I was able to jdo some voluntary
    work I have not otherwise worked since my retirement but 1 have been unable to
    contemplate anything since June 1998.

    I have nothing but sadness and sympathy for the families and friends of people who
    lost their lives on that day particularly as so many were young people loved by those
    2round them and I can understand their anguishw
                                                       and determinationlj I can understand
    their disappointment when the further scrutiny of evidence completed reaffirmed
    previous decisions. It was following the Stuart-Smith scrutiny and the Home
    Secretary’s acceptance that no further enquiry was called for nor any prosecution
    justified that these private prosecutions were commenced. Notwithstanding the decision
    o f the Director o f Public Prosecutions not to take over and discontinue the charges
    against me, it is still the position of the Crown Prosecution Service and Director of
    Public Prosecutions that there is no realistic prospect of a conviction. This confirms
    advices by two eminent QC’s in 1990 and the various other reviews and comes after
    they have reviewed every bit of information and “new evidence which is suggested
    by HFSG.

    From the outset the prosecution has been led by Mr Alun Jones QC, a leading and high
    profile Queen’s-Counsel. He has-been assisted by Junior Counsel. Mr Jones has
    appeared at every hearing and indeed he was the person that prepared the submissions
    to which bundles o f documents were annexed which led to the grant of summonses.
    The Solicitor acting for HFSG is called Ann Adlington. She is a full time paid
    employee of Liverpool City Council. That Council has approved her secondment for
    the duration of the case to HFSG to conduct the proceedings with her wage being met
    by Liverpool City Council. HFSG held a pop concert at Anfield Stadium, Liverpool
    which is said to have raised half a million pounds to fund the prosecution. They
    continue to invite subscriptions and donations, and have annouiced that they are
    embarking on a further fund raising campaign.

    HFSG have suggested that in reliance upon the agreement of tHe South Yorkshire
    Police Authority' to grant me financial support, I have been profligalte with the amount
    of legal costs incurred. That is wholly untrue.

    I do not believe that it is unreasonable to hope to be defended against these serious
    charges with a similar level of legal expertise as the prosecution. Following my
    application in June 1998 for financial support from the Soutlj Yorkshire Police
    Authority and the approval of that support. I contacted the Solicitor who represented

   me at the inquest. He was aware of my own personal feelings, the previous issues and
   the background to the events. He has done everything to bring! matters to a swift
   conclusion, but it now appears that a trial is to go ahead. My Solicitor has dealt with
   many of the issues himself, but equally it became obvious that Counsel were going to
   have to be retained. This was also done in consultation with and the approval of the
   South Yorkshire Police Authority. In pursuance of the attempt to bring the matter to
   a swift conclusion and as advised by Leading Counsel, application was made to the
   Director of Public Prosecutions for him to exercise his power under Section 6 (2) of
   the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 to take over the private prosecution and then to
   discontinue the prosecution under Section 23 (3) of the Prosecution of Offences Act
    1985. My Solicitors and Counsel effectively managed to hold the [Magistrates’ Court
    proceedings in abeyance pending the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions.
    It came as a great disappointment to me and to my legal advisors that the Director of
    Public Prosecutions decided not to intervene and to allow the case to continue. It was
    the strong view of Leading Counsel that this decision of the DPP was unreasonable and
    perverse and he recommended that there should be an application fcjir Judicial Review.
    That decision was not crystallised until reasons had been obtained from the Crown
    Prosecution Service as to the basis of their decision. In simple, every effort was made
    to avoid any unnecessary costs. The result of the Judicial Review was that a charge
    against former Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield of perverting the course of
   justice was quashed. Tne remaining charges, however, were left untouched by the
    Court albeit that they said that it was appropriate for the challenge jto have been made
    and the case was highly arguable. Expressed another way, if the decision of the
    Director of Public Prosecutions had been to intervene and toj have quashed the
    proceedings, the Court would not have interfered with that decision.

    I therefore seek as part o f the financial assistance, an indemnity jfor payment of my
    costs in relation to the application to seek Judicial Review of the decision of the
    Director o f Public Prosecutions and including that part of the Order for Costs made
    against me in favour of the Director of Public Prosecutions because the main decision
    was not overturned. No Order for Costs was made in favour of .HFSG.

    At the very outset o f the attempt by HFSG to prosecute m e. Summonses were issued
    in the South Sefton Magistrates’ Court. Ultimately those summonses were withdrawn
    because they had in the view of my Solicitors been the subject jof an ill conceived
    attempt to bring me before a Magistrates’ Court in Liverpool which did not have
    jurisdiction. An Order for Costs was made for payment of my ikwyer’s fees out of
     Central Funds. The Clerk to the Justices at South Sefton has refused to tax the bill of
    costs submitted. I seek financial assistance in relation to an application for Judicial
     Review of the decision o f the Clerk to the Justices at South Sefto:i. This application
     is absolutely fundamental because if, as I hope, I am acquitted of the charges against
    me an Order could be made for payment of all or part of my defence costs out of
     Central Funds, from which I could then reimburse the Police Authority. If the South
     Sefton decision is left unchallenged it would almost certainly preclude an ability to
     have a bill of costs taxed for payment out of Central Funds in relation to the
     proceedings presently in the Leeds Magistrates’ Court.

     In summary therefore, I request:

     1.     That financial assistance provided previously be reinstated and with
South Yorkshire j t Sec                                     ?3 Ppr ’99      10:20       P. 06




           confirmation of continuing assistance without .interruption from the date of
           initial authorisation in relation to all works in defending the prosecutions, those
           works to include the applications for Judicial Review and my part o f the
           liability for costs made in favour of the Director of Public Prosecutions in th
           Judicial Review proceedings.

    2.     If so advised by Leading Counsel to make an application for Judicial Review
           in relation to a refusal of the Clerk to the Justices of Southi Sefton to tax the
           bill of costs for payment out of Central Funds.

    Although of course this request for financial assistance is made by me personally, I
    feel that Mr Duckenfield and myself have been singled out as easily identifiable
    representatives of South Yorkshire Police, effectively making it the South Yorkshire
    Police that is on trial. The HFSG are using my presence in a Court of Law to raise
    issues such as conspiracy and suppression of evidence against tile South Yorkshire
    Police and they also include the West Midlands Police In this. There is a major public
    relations onslaught continuously mounted through me at the Police. Thus for example,
    in covering the proceedings in the High Court the reporter who interviewed Assistant
    Chief Constable Daines started his report with “the fight for justice goes on". I believe
    that there is a campaign to discredit the Police through me andj to apportion guilt
    before any trial or even any evidence has been heard, ignoring all other factors which
    combined to culminate in this awful tragedy. By their efforts to remove financial
    support for me from the South Yorkshire Police Authority, HFSG continue their tactics
    to try to weaken my defence and in any event failing a conviction being recorded, to
     ruin me financially and to have completely destroyed my health.

    Thoughts of that day at Hillsborough have always been a daily event in my life but in
    recent months it is difficult to think about anything else.




    On that terrible day I was doing my duty'as- an Officer of the South Yorkshire Police
    in good faith and to the best of my ability. I am innocent of the charges levelled
    against me. I would hope and expect to continue to be supported by the South
    Yorkshire Police Authority and in particular by the provision of funding to meet my
    defence costs incurred hitherto and on a continuing basis.

REQUEST FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

We refer to your letter of 30 April. We deal with the matters in the same order.

1.       We are a little surprised at the criticism that you make of the joint Opinion
         of two very eminent Leading Counsel. Perhaps it is that you were not aware
         of the enormous effort that was put into the preparation of submissions to the
         Director of Public Prosecutions. For your assistance therefore we are
         enclosing herewith a copy of the submission made by us which provides an
         almost line by line answer to the allegations made by the prosecution. What
         has been done in preparing this Opinion is as follows.

          1.                    A review of the submissions made to the DPP against the stated
                                allegations.

          2.                   Consideration of “new” evidence.

          3.                   Consideration of further correspondence and documentation from
                               HFSG since the submission to the DPP.

          4.                   Consideration of the further documents which are sought by way of
                               witness summons.

          5.                   Reference to all other papers that we have in our possession.

          As we understand it the reason for the request for an Opinion and the
          preparedness o f the Authority to pay for this Opinion it is so that members
          can satisfy themselves as to the prospects of success of the defence.
          Although we do not believe that this is necessarily the criteria upon which
          they should make their decision hence forth, we do not understand the
          thinking. An Opinion, and indeed we venture to suggest any document does
          not have more substance because of its length. You are aware that


                                                 §                                                                                                                            :

                                                                      Page 2


immediately after the Taylor enquiry two eminent QC’s both advised the
Director of Public Prosecutions that there was no reasonable prospect of a
conviction against our Client.        That decision was in effect reviewed
consequent upon the Coroner’s inquest. It was very definitely reviewed again
by the DPP then consequent upon the scrutiny of Lord Justice Stewart Smith
and only in this last few months has the Director yet again looked at the
matter and confirmed that his view is that there is no reasonable prospect of
a conviction. The two QC’s who give you this Opinion have confirmed their
views that they too see no reasonable prospect of a conviction. They have
additionally confirmed, for the benefit of members, that in their opinion there
is no substance to the allegation that the defence have been profligate and
that work carried out and the advices given would have been no different
whether this case was funded on a private basis of if there had been Legal
Aid.                                                                           "

If there is a particular point which you think has not been covered then we
will try to deal with this but we hope that now with the benefit of the copy
o f the submission to the DPP and the explanation that you will understand
why the Opinion needed only to be short but equally why the fee is entirely
justified and we await the necessary payment.

Funding from the Police Superintendents Association.

This Association have indicated that they indemnify Client if necessary by
making a payment in an amount of £20,000.00 as a contribution towards the
cost of both Mr Murray and Mr Duckenfield in relation to the application for
Judicial Review in relation to funding. We use the word “contribution”
advisedly since when we checked with you at the hearing as to the marking
on Miss Baxendale’s brief, we noted that there was effectively consistency
in that Mr Harrison was marked at £12,500.00 plus VAT with Junior Counsel
at one half. We give you this information although we do not believe as a
matter of lawthat those instructing you are entitled to it or that they should
use this information as a reason to themselves refuse to meet the costs
incurred.

Costs

We have spoken to Leading Counsel and Junior Counsel. They have
estimated that between now and the beginning of the committal hearing they
are going to be involved in 120 hours and preparation each. Whilst we have
not yet been asked to agree a brief fee we would anticipate £15,000.00 plus
VAT for Leading Counsel with one half of that for Junior Counsel. We
would estimate a daily refresher of £1,000.00 for Leading Counsel and Junior
Counsel at one half. Thus if the case at committal takes two weeks, you are

between £55,000.00 to £85,000.00 plus VAT.

What time is going to have to be set aside for our team in this office is more
difficult to gauge. There is clearly a lot of work to do with the documents
which have been served upon us but on which we have not been able to
substantially work due to the uncertainty about funding. We now know that
there are substantial amounts of photographs and plans already ordered to be
produced by the Stipendiary Magistrate. There is also the summons against
the Assistant Chief Constable which seeks a vast amount of further
documentation, some o f which we already know is going to be made
available. A lot of time is going to have to be spent with Client. As a rough
estimate and having regard to the amount of time that Counsel says will have
to be spent by him on considering documents that will have been prepared
by us, we believe that we shall have 200 hours of preparation time before the
committal starts and with two weeks of committal we are looking at a total
figure of £40,000.00 to £50,000.00 plus VAT and disbursements. It may
help you to know what we have in mind for immediate pre-committal days
and time during the committal itself for it in many ways mirrors what
happened in London during the Judicial Review. This office will become the
nerve centre. All papers now immediately needed in Court will be held here.
Both sets of Solicitors and Counsel will meet for Court. We will use the
room for work over the lunch break and for work at the conclusion of the
day in Court.

Wre all hope of course that the committal proceedings will see the conclusion
of the case. We appreciate that if the case is committed then the issue of
costs of trial will have to be addressed. You will immediately understand
that we cannot give you any-sort of estimate just nowt We appreciate that
the members will be looking at the reserve which has been set aside for these
and it is clear that if unhappily the case is committed for trial then the
reserve is not going to be sufficient. However, we are helped by knowing
something of the history of the provision of this reserve. We understand that
at the time of the Stewart Smith enquiry, the only likely persons against
whom a prosecution was indicated were Mr Duckenfield and PC Bichard.
We also understand that the only possible allegation against Mr Bichard was
one of peijury in relation to the TV camera.-This discreet issue would in our
view have probably needed a reserve of no more than £20,000.00 to
£25,000.00 for trial. In essence therefore the whole of the reserve was for
the defence of Mr Duckenfield. Thus to the extent that the two former
officers have to be separately represented and even with the respective
Solicitors and Counsel doing their very best to avoid duplication (which we
certainly have achieved) one really ought to look at the adequacy of the
reserve as if the same amount had been allocated for each of the two
defendants.     Furthermore as you appreciate these costs have been
substantially added to by virtue of the Judicial Review proceedings.

4,      Scope of applications

        We confirm points 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 save that we would ask that in addition
        to 4.3 there be authorised assistance to meet our Client’s costs for the
        application for Judicial Review of the funding application subject to
        reimbursement upon payment of the order for costs made against Ann
        Adlington.

        Our letter of 6 May has provided you with details of all of the costs incurred
        up to 31 March. It is extremely difficult in relation to the Judicial Review
        proceedings to actually separate out those costs which relate to the Judicial
        Review against the DPP and those costs which relate to the funding as for
        some of the time the action in our office were concurrent.

We confirm that the DPP has not given any indication of the level of his costs
pursuant to the order made against our Client and Mr Duckenfield.

Yours faithfully

       REPRESENTATIONS T O T H E DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS

                          O N BEHALF OF MR. BERNARD M U R R A Y




1.1      In 1996-7, ths HFSG pretext for re-opening the investigation was a claim that ‘new evidence’
existed to undermine the previous findings and decisions. That claim was emphatically rejected by Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny. It was inevitable that any post-Scrutiny attempt to justify a prosecution
would include another claim that further fresh evidence had come to light.

1.2     We are now able to respond to the ‘new evidence’ claim, as well as to the variety of other claims
in the prosecutor’s representations.

1.3     Tnere are also important points to be made about the declared CPS/DPP policy on the provisions
of the Prosecution of Offences Act 19S5.

C P S /D P P P o lic y - e v id e n c e
2.1       The CPS letters to HFSG on 27 July and 4 August 199S set out Policy. They refer to evidence,
public interest and the interests of justice. The latter is one specific aspect of public interest. Tnis is not
the moment for detailed argument about policy, but we indicate our concerns.

2.2      The e vid en ce criterio n for intervention is wrong. (We do not accept that the private prosecutor
can make out a case to answer.-What follows is_addressing the principle behind the policy,) It cannot be
right to restrict the Director’s scope for intervening on evidence grounds to cases where there is ‘clearly
no case to answer’.

2.3     First, it has the effect that the Director will only intervene in cases where the Court would be
bound to stop the proceedings in any event, either by refusing to issue summonses, or by refusing to
commit for trial. To that extent, intervention on evidential grounds would never serve to achieve more
than an acceleration of the inevitable.

2 .4     Second, in r a r e cases such as the present, it has a potential for undermining the public’s
perception of the authority of the Director, as well as that of the Attorney-General. For more than eight
years, the Director has publicly asserted that there is no realistic prospect of conviction of any person on
the charges now levelled against the two defendants. This after the most detailed, thorough, responsible
and high-level assessment of the position it is possible to imagine, carried out more than once, and
coupled with the clear conclusions of the Scrutiny of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, which have in turn been
publicly accepted by the Director, the Attorney-General and the Home Secretary. The policy
contemplates that the Director may conclude that because it is not clearly demonstrated that there is no


                                                                              M r Murray’s representations - 1/5
                                                 ,' r . '




case to answer, all that has gone before must count for nothing, and that the publicly appointed body
responsible for criminal prosecutions must stand aside and leave it to a private prosecutor. That such an
outcome is theoretically possible suggests that the underlying policy is flawed. Particularly in the unique
circumstances of this case, where mi independent Scrutiny Inquiry under a Lord Justice of Appeal has
been set up by Ministers of the Crown to examine whether there is any basis for reviewing the decision
not to prosecute.

2.5       We mention the position of the Attorney-General at this stage because there is a need to
coordinate the roles of the principal officers responsible for the criminal process. Were there to be a
committal for trial to the Crown Court, the Attorney’s power to enter a n o lle p r o s e q u i would be called
upon by the defence. E x h yp oth esi, such intervention only arises after it has been found that there is a
case to answer. It cannot be right that the Director is unable to intervene on evidential grounds if there
may be a case to answer, when it is plain that the Attorney can do so in a case where there undoubtedly
is a case to answer. We note section 3(1) of the 1985 Act. In any case where the Attorney would ente"r
a n o lle p r o se q u i, notwithstanding that there is or might be a case to answer, there is nothing in law or
principle to preclude the Director from intervening to the same effect at an earlier stage, actin® either
independently or under the Attorney’s superintendence.

C P S /D P P P o lic y - p u b lic in te re st
3.1     The public interest factors to be taken into account when considering whether to take over and
discontinue a private prosecution will not be different from or less than those factors which the Code for
Crown Prosecutors requires to be taken into account when deciding whether to prosecute.

3.2    Without repeating 2.4 above, the public pronouncements from the office of the Director, from
the Law Officers and Ministers of the Crown have created a legitimate expectation in the defendant that
there will be no prosecution. It is unthinkable that this should effectively be overridden bv the
commencement of a private prosecution. It would set at nought the assurance contained in §10.1 of the
Code. There is no basis for invoking the exceptions in §10.2.

3.3     Materia! public interest factors against prosecution as identified in §6.5 of the Cods are:
        (d) long delay, and
        (f) significant ill-health of the prospective defendant.
Both apply here. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith found significant instances of altered recollections in
witnesses upon whom the prosecutor would rely.

3.4      Assessment of culpability. We do not propose to argue issues of substantive law at this stase. For
present purposes it is sufficient to refer to the quotation w'hich Lord Taylor chose to cite prominently,
with obvious approval, in his Interim Report, PART II - WHY DID IT HAPPEN? [p.20]:
        “Events of the magnitude of Hillsborough don’t usually happen just for one single reason, nor
         is it possible to pin the blame on one single scapegoat... Disasters happen because a whole series
         of mistakes, misjudgments and mischances happen to come together in deadly combination.”
         (The Archbishop of York.)
Lord Taylor’s Report, read as a whole, found the disaster was caused by a series of factors: ultimately
a failure of systems as well as.of single individuals, involving the Police as a Force, Sheffield
Wednesday as a Club, their consulting engineers, the Health & Safety Executive, the Local Authority and
the Football Association.              f

3.5      Regrettably, HFSG has become a campaigning pressure group for what is now a relentless pursuit
of these ex-police officers. Their lives have been and will continue to be seriously afflicted by their
knowledge that they were involved at the epicentre of the disaster. A fair and dispassionate assessment
of the position of the two proposed defendants would see them as having been seriously affected by their
involvement in the tragedy. But there is no prospect of this private prosecution being carried on and

                                                                             Mr Murray's representations - 215

                                                                                                         0 0 0 0 6 ;)
conducted with any regard to the broader concepts of fairness and balance of public interest factors which
any defendant in a criminal trial in this country is entitled to expect.


                   - the p r i v a t e p ro se c u to r.
C P S /D P P P o lic y
4.1      Even if there were to be a defensible evidential basis for continuing the proposed prosecution
it would be wholly wrong for the public prosecuting authority to abandon responsibility for the conduct
o f what undoubtedly would be a serious, complicated and important ‘high-profile’ case. Section
3(2)(b)(i)ofthe 1985 Act imposes a duty on the Director to institute and have the conduct of proceedings
where it appears that:
        “the importance or difficulty of the case makes it appropriate that proceedings should
        be instituted by him...”.
Although this duty is distinct from the duty to “take over” the conduct of proceedings, it is not a dutv
which the Director can ignore. Parliament did not envisage that important or difficult cases (this would
be both) should be left to private prosecution. Tne scope for intervention by a private prosecutor in such
cases must clearly be confined to situations where inertia, partiality or improper action on the pan of the
public prosecutor can be demonstrated.

4.2      Although section 6(1) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 expressly preserved the right of
private prosecution, it is clearly not an unfettered right. The purpose in preserving private access to the
criminal courts was stated by Lord Wilberforce in C o u r ie t -v- Union o f P o s t Office W o rk e rs [ 1978] A.C.
435 at 477:
         “This historical r i g h t t h o u g h rarely exercised in relation to indictable offences, and
         though 'ultimately liable to be controlled by the Attorney-General (by taking over the
         prosecution and, if he thinks fit, entering a nolle p ro se q u i) remains a valuable
         constitutional safeguard against inertia or partiality on the part of authority.”
See also: Report of the Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure (Cmnd 8092 (1981)): it provides a
useful and effective safeguard against “improper action” by the prosecuting authority: cited by Lloyd LJ.
in R -v- B o w S tre e t S tip e n d ia r y M a g istra te a n d A n oth er, (1993) 96 Cr.App.R. 405.

4.3     The lengthy history of public investigations into the circumstances of the Hillsborough tragedy,
carried out at all stages under the auspices of the Home Secretary and the Law Officers, clearly
demonstrates that this is not an appropriate case for private prosecution.


H FSG   - 1998 R e p r e s e n ta tio n s to D .P.P.
5.1      Fundamentally, the HFSG representations amount to claims that, by reason of fraudulent
interference with and /or concealment of evidence by the South Yorkshire Police and/or the West
Midlands Police, the Taylor Inquiry, the D.P.P., the Police Complaints Authority, the Inquests, and Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith were all in their turn deceived about the culpability of the South Yorkshire Police
Force in relation to the tragedy of Hillsborough. These claims are presumed to be true, then translated
simplistically into ajustification for prosecuting the two proposed defendants.

5.2     To overcome the objection that these were the very claims expressly considered and rejected by
the Scrutiny, HFSG contends that it is only post-Scrutiny that material has been released for their
consideration which now enables them to demonstrate the truth of their assertions. It is necessary to
examine this material with close attention to detail, for the claims based upon it are wholly spurious.

5.3     When viewed in conjunction with the serious allegations which were made to Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith. the present claims are seen as the continuation of a series of unfounded allegations made
in support of the long-standing conspiracy theory which has become entrenched in the thinking of the


                                                                                M r Murrav’s representations - 3/5

allegations together with the findings of the Lord Justice is set out in the following table.

5.4     The prosecutor continues to assert that the South Yorkshire Police and/or West Midlands
carefully withheld important material from the Director and the Coroner, such that the 1990 decision not
to prosecute and the Inquest verdicts were reached on an incomplete assessment of material evidence.
These claims are dealt with in detail in Schedule A. An illusion of incomplete consideration is created
by highlighting the fact that not all statements were considered and not all witnesses were called. Of
course they were not. For obvious reasons, many witnesses were repetitive of others, many were unable
to speak about the focal matters under inquiry. Some sifting process to extract representative sample
witnesses on critical issues was essential, otherwise the Hillsborough Inquiry and the Inquests would
have been unmanageable. Evidence now relied on by the prosecutor as being new and previously

                                                                             Mr Murray's representations - 4/5

6.1     To assist the Director to give detailed consideration to the points and counter-points arising out
of the HFSG representations, we have prepared responses in the form of three Schedules:
         A - responses to the 40-page representations of Mr Jones Q.C. (24 September 1998);
         B - an analysis of the claims about ‘new evidence’ as it relates to the witness statements referred
to in the HFSG letter to CPS (24 August 1998); (these statements were withheld from us until late
September when they came with the representations);
         C - an analysis of the claims about ‘new evidence’ as it relates to the 22 statements in Annex D
to the representations.
We respond to the claims made about the 38 statements served in support of the summonses in schedule
A. Most of these are general in nature.

6.2     Our submission is that none of the statements relied on establishes anything of material
significance, that is, which has not been known of or available before from other sources. Tne
prosecutor’s presentation relies on bulk without substance.

6.3     For brevity, we have adopted short-form responses where the same response can be made to
claims about witnesses or points about their evidence, (or deletions or amendments where those
allegations are made). The meaning of the notation we have adopted is as follows;
         NOT NEW - the witness savs nothing which has not been established before by other evidence;
         ENQUIRY, rNQUEST, or SCRUTINY - indicates that the evidence, point or argument was fully
         taken into account by the relevant body, albeit as a result of evidence from other sources;
         AFTERMATH - this indicates that the evidence or argument relates to events after the tragedy
         had occurred, which are net material to the charges against Mr Murray;
         NOT MATERIAL - this indicates that the evidence or argument is not material to the charges
         against Mr Murray.

    Dear Sirs

    R -v - South Yorkshire Police Acthority ex parte Chief Constable of South Yorkshire
    Police

    We refer to previous correspondence regarding the further consideration by the South
    Yorkshire Police Authority o f funding in relation to the private prosecution o f our client Mr
    Duckenfield, and in particular your letters o f 1 April, requesting information, and 30 April
    enclosing correspondence (including a copy letter of that date to Walker Morris raising a
    number o f points following the submission o f the Joint Opinion o f Counsel).

    As you will k n o w , we have worked closely with Walker Morris in this matter both to
    progress the interests o f the two defendants Mr Murray and Mr Duckenfield, and in order to
    minimise, where possible, the duplication of effort and thus keep the costs to the minimum
    given the difficult issues that need to be explored in this matter.

    We have discussed your correspondence at length with Mr Manning of Walker Morris, and
    have the benefit o f seeing his letter to you dealing with the issues that have recently been
    raised, and accordingly have had the opportunity of contributing as a result of those
    discussions to the content o f the letter, and adopt those contents insofar as the matters relate
    generally to both defendants. The Police Authority will be aware that, as a result o f the
    decision o f the DPP to discontinue the charge o f acting with intent to pervert the course of
    justice against Mr Duckenfield, both defendants now face the same criminal charges, v,-hich
    are two charges of unlawful killing, and one of wilful neglect to perform a public duty.

    Accordingly, the following comments are made in addition to those submitted by Messrs
    Walker Morris, following the outline o f your letter o f 30 Apnl 1999.

    Joint Opinion

    We believe the Opinion submitted provides a clear indication o f the strength o f Counsel’s
    conviction that the criminal defences ought to be maintained on behalf o f the Defendant.
    Messrs Walker Morris have forwarded a copy of their detailed submissions to the DPP,
    which deal with the evidence in great detail. Accordingly, to assist the Authority we
    enclose herewith a copy o f the submissions made on behalf o f Kir Duckenfield to the DPP,

will note that we have adopted those submissions for the purpose o f the DPP dialogue. This
reflects the ongoing desire o f both firms of solicitors to maintain complementary assistance
without undue duplication. Whilst our letter o f 9 October 1998 to the DPP (CPS) extends to
m atters other than the pure evidence, when read with the recent Opinion of Counsel w e
believe the Authority has legal advice, in the strongest form, to support a continuing
defence on behalf o f both officers.

In the event that you believe further information is required before the Authority can make a
decision in this matter we would be grateful for your advice by return. We have raised your
concerns about the fullness o f Counsel’s advice -with Leading Counsel, and if further
confirmation is sought, in the light o f this letter and Walker Morris’s recent correspondence,
naturally we would wish to afford Leading Counsel the opportunity o f providing that
clarification so that the Authority is properly informed at the time o f its decision.

Police Superintendents Association

We enclose herewith a copy letter dated 5 March 1999 which clarifies the context and
extent o f the PSA offer of financial assistance in relation to the funding judicial review
alone.

We have discussed the SYPA responsibility for costs with Mr Williams who confirms that
his executive would wish all avenues o f other potential financing o f costs (such as the
Authority, or Ann Adlington pursuant to the Costs Order obtained) be pursued and
exhausted., before any financial contribution is actually paid. Mr Williams is aware of the
proposal for the SYP A to meet on 21 May and would be prepared to attend that meeting if it
would a s s i s t in resolving the issue o f contribution.

In this context, you have already been provided with, a copy transcript o f the judicial review
proceedings for Wednesday 24 March and Thursday 25 March. We suggest it may be
helpful to the Authority members if they were to view those transcripts prior to making any
decision in this matter. The transcripts indicate the circumstances in which Mr Murray and
Mr Duckenfieid were given leave to take part in the funding judicial review proceedings,
and the Court's confirmation that there was an arguable point. The defendants'were in fact
required to take part as applicants because HFSG had raised a technical point about the
standing o f the Chief Constable to make the challenge. In the circumstances, ones the
Court found in favour of the applicants on the funding question, an Order for Costs was
made in favour o f the defendants against Ann Adlington. In the normal course, steps will
be taken to have a Bill o f Costs referable to the application, taxed with a view to recovering
those costs.

It is important for die Authority to bear in mind that Mr Murray and Mr Duckenfield were
placed in a position o f considerable stress as a result of the decision to discontinue funding,
and in light o f the technical arguments raised by HFSG in the judicial review, were required
to take part in that application, which role was upheld and approved by the Court. In the
circumstances o f the case we invite ihe Authority to consider that the costs involved jn that
application (notwithstanding the kind offer of indemnity from the Police Superintendents
Association) ought properly be a matter which the Authority ought to be responsible for.
Quite clearly, the costs would not have been incurred but for the decision taken in January
to discontinue financing the legal assistance of the defendants.

          Costs

          In our letter o f 3 February 1999 we advised our best estimate of legal costs to 12 January
          1999.

          You will have received separately, advice as to further costs incurred to 28 March 1999. It
          is not possible at the present time to provide an itemised account in regard to those costs,
          nor indeed is it possible to separate the particular costs as relating either to the Magistrates
          Court proceedings, the DPP decision, or the funding issue specifically. In due course we
          anticipate it will be necessary, and we will take steps to have our costs draughtsman provide
          the best possible separate costings required, as may be by the Court and other parties.

          We are enclosing herewith a copy o f the Bill o f Costs submitted to the Clerk of the South
          Sefton Magistrates Court which remains contentious. As the Authority will know, to date
          the Clerk refuses to tax this bill, and subject to the decision taken by the Authority, we
          would wish to progress with the challenge of this refusal. We have requested advice from
          the Clerk (copy letter 7 May 1999 enclosed) and to date await a reply.

          In regard to future costs, we adopt the comments made in the Walker Morris letter as to the
          likely degree o f preparation required and manpower up to and including a 2 week
          committal.

          We are liaising very closely with Walker Morris to ensure that cost effective procedures are
          in place, most particularly to deal with the foreshadowed further documentation being
          obtained by the private prosecutor, which we anticipate will be served prior to the
          committal hearing on 5 July 1999. We have no way of knowing exactly how much material
          will be served, and in any event we may wish to consider unused material on behalf o f the
          defendants, and a considerable amount of preparation will obviously be required prior to the
          committal.

          Following on the outline provided by Walker Morris, we would agree that the best estimate
          of costs including Counsel and expenses for Mr Duckenfield (and in this respect we confirm
          that the same hourly costings apply to both defendants) is in the region o f £125,000 -
          £150,000 plus VAT. "

          We have noted Walker Morris's observations in regard to the Police Authority reserve and
          are bound to echo the comments that the private prosecution involves two high ranking
          defendants, each required to answer charges of the utmost seriousness relating to their own
          conduct in April 1989- This case by its very nature is unique, and has not at any time
          followed what might be described as the standard progress o f a criminal prosecution.

          We believe we can speak on behalf o f all legal advisers involved in this case when we say
          that costs implications are at the forefront o f our minds at all times, whilst o f course wishing
          to protect the interests o f the defendants in a proper professional fashion. We entirely
          appreciate that the sums of money being discussed are substantial and urge the Authority to
          accept that they properly reflect professional, cost-effective legal assistance given to
          defendants facing high profile criminal prosecutions in the most unusual of circumstances
          which by their very nature, particularly in regard to the mass o f material that has in the 10
          years since the events in question, will require extremely detailed preparation.

         We would agree with the outline in paragraph 4 o f your letter o f 30 April save that we join
         with Walker Morris in requesting the Authority consider assistance in regard to our client’s
         costs of the judicial review proceeding regarding the funding issue, for the reasons set out
         before. In this regard we do have the benefit of an Order against Ms Ann Adlington
         although at this time we can offer no advice as to the likelihood o f that Order being
         effectively pursued to satisfaction. We confirm, as per the Walker Morris correspondence,
         that we have no details o f the DPP costs to date, and indeed have received no
         correspondence on behalf o f the DPP since the judgment o f the Divisional Court.

         We trust the above matters are o f assistance to you and the Authority in preparing for the
         meeting which we understand will take place on 21 May with the time and place details to
         be confirmed. In the event that it is considered the Authority requires any further input or
         assistance we would be grateful for your advice beforehand so that we can assist where
         possible. We would be grateful prior to the meeting if you could clarify one aspect, relating
         to resolutions o f the Authority made on 5 February 1999. We specifically refer to
         paragraph 4 and the deferred consideration o f the procedural issues raised by Ms Adlington.
         In the event that further submissions and representations are invited prior to the Authority’s
         final decision, we would be grateful for your clarification as to what extent if any those
         procedural issues axe to be considered by the Authority and as such require further comment
         on behalf o f the defendants.

         We await your advice accordingly.

Dear

HILLSBOROUGH: FINANCING OF DEFENCE COSTS

Having yesterday sought the advice of Leading Counsel following receipt of
representations concerning the financing of your client’s defence costs, I will shortly be
asking the Authority to consider the issue of financial assistance, and to review the
decisions taken to date. I will at the same time ask the Authority to give consideration to
your further applications for support.

In these circumstances I have agreed with the Chairman of the Authority that the
presentations by representatives of the defendants and the Hillsborough Family Support
Group, which we had originally planned for Friday 15 January, should now be deferred to
a later date. I apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.

In these circumstances, I must draw three further matters to your attention:

1    I am not at this stage in a position to authorise further payments in respect of legal
costs in relation to your client's defence to the private prosecution.

2    As you are aware, no decision has been taken as to funding any judicial review
proceedings against the Crown Prosecution Service or any proceedings by way of review
or appeal of any future adverse decision as to costs by the Sefton Magistrates Court.
Clearly no costs should be incurred in respect of either of these matters unless your client
has other sources of funding.

3     One of the matters which will fall to be considered by the Authority both in relation to
funding your client’s defenca costs and in relation to funding any potential judicial review
is the extent to which your c'ient is entitled to legal aid. It is essential, therefore, that you
provide me with a full assessment of your client's eligibility for legal aid, your estimate of
any contribution which might be required and an analysis of how such a contribution might
impact on his persona! financial position. This information must be supplied in advance of
any meeting of the Authority at which the future funding of your client is to be considered.
Please, therefore, treat this as a matter of urgency.

I will correspond with you further as matters develop.

Yours sincerely______



Bill Wilkinson

The Clerk to the Police Authority

r.OKZ    OFFICE CIRCULAR N O 7 7 / 8 7

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS


 There is statutory authority in section 4 3 of the Police Act 19 54 for
 payr.ents to be race fron the police fund to neet expenditure incurred
 by police officers in defending proceedings in tort.      Also, acting in
 pursuance o f . it s general statutory duty to nai ntain aH~~zrdecua't'e'^'arTd
'efr~j~clTen't police "force" t o r~ its area,  the police authority' has
 discretion to rest expenditure iRC'irreiT by officers in all kinds of
 legal proceedings where the officers have acted in good faith in
  -ursuance of their duties,-'or the interests of the force -as a whole
  \re involved.     The purpose of this circular is to give guidance to
,-jolice authorities to help then in considering requests on behalf of
‘officers for financial assistance.       This guidance has been discussed
 and agreed with the local authority and with the police staff
 associations.

2.    The central principle which should guide consideration of
individual cases is that, where a police authority considers that an
officer has. acted in good faith in pursuance of his duties or that
the interests of a force as a whole are involved, the officer''should
have the support of the police authority to ensure that he has the
services of* a lawyer and that he should not be out of pocket.             The
following paragraphs provide general guidance1 to • the different
classes of proceedings.  Paynents nade to officers in a c c o r d a n c e with
this guidance will be eligible for police grant.
CRIHINAL PROCEEDINGS

"'“csscuwicn i/v ^hi0 Crcvn prosscviti.cn S r v ^ c s

 3.    An officer vho is “the subject of a public prosecution for an
 ailsged offence committed while carrying cut his duties as a police
 officer is in the same position as any other defendant and must be
 expected to bear the costs of his defence.     If he is acquitted, he
 should,    like   any  other   defendant, look to the      court  fcr
 reir.burser.ent of his expenses.   If the costs are not paid, or not
paid in full from central funds, the police authority are in a
position to decide, on the full facts, whether or not to rake a
payment to the officer or to the Police Federation if they have
provided the funding.      There nay be cases where it is proper tc
'provide legal advice and/or legal representation even where -the
 officer is found guilty.    This ray arise for example in test cases
where the officer has been carrying out a practice ^hitherto
approved of but is found guilty as a result of that practice being
 found unlawful by the court in the light of the circumstances of
that particular case.


?riv* t e Prosecutions

4. -A police officer should be able to carry cut his duties in
confidence that,   if he acts in good faith and exercises
judgement reasonably, his police authority will support him.    T
in a case where a member of the public brings a prosecution against
an officer, the authority is satisfied that the officer has acted
in this V5y, the authority should provide or fund legal advice
and/or representation.

5.   Where a court decides that a prosecution brought against an
officer was not brought in good faith, it may order the prosecutor
to pay the whole or any part of the costs incurred by the defence;
again, if the officer is acquitted on indictment, his costs may be
met from central funds.  In either of these cases, the question of
the police authority providing financial support to the officer may
not arise.   However, where the costs of an acquitted officer are
r.ot awarded by the court or awarded only in part, the police
authority should consider whether to reimburse any costs not
covered, taking into account the reasons, if any, given by the
court for failing to award all costs claimed.


CIVIL PROCEEDINGS

Civil Actions      Acainst    the   Chief   Officer ,,for   Wrongful   Acts   of
Constables

6.  Under section 48(1) of the Police Act 1964, the chief officer
of a f o r c e is liable in respect of torts committed by constables
under his direction and control (which includes special constables
and officers of other forces serving in the police area under
mutual     aid   arrangements)   in   the  perfor ma nc e or purported
performance of their functions.     Under section 48(2) any dam 2 ges or




                                    ©
        varied       against: the chief officer in such proceedings, any
                        h i ms el f, r.d any sum paid in cor.nec :icn vi*

 *3 .s e s t therefore, :he police authority's discretion cxi .encs cnlv to
whether cr not to approve a proposed settlement cf :h e claim


Civil Actions Acainst Individual Police Officers

 7.   Alternatively, the plaintiff say be awarded damages against ar.
 individual police officer, though he cannot recover the damages
 twice over against the chief officer as well.   Section 48(4) cf the
 Police Act 1964 specifically empowers a police authority "to such
 extent as they think fit" to pay out .of the police fund any damages
 cr costs awarded against an officer^ any costs he incurs himself,
 and any suns paid in connection vith the settlement of a claim.
 This   provision  applies  to   actions  against    officers  of the
 authority’s own force, officers of another force serving the police
 area under mutual aid arrangements, and special constables for the
 police area.   In considering whether to.give financial assistance
'the authority will wish to consider in particular whether the
 officer concerned acted in good faith and' exercised his judgement
 reasonably.  Where the court finds for the officer, he nay seek his
 costs frcr. the plaintiff;    should the costs not be awarded cr
 awarded only in part, the police authority should consider whether
 to reimburse any costs net covered,        taking ' into account the
 reasons, if any, given by the court for failing to award all costs
 claimed.

£.   Joint actions r.amir._
police officer nay be brought in some cases. In such cases it is
important that any discussion of the merits and quantum of the
proposed settlement should involve all the parties named in the
claim together vith advisers even if they a re represented by
different advisers.


Civil Actions Under the Pata-Protection Act 1934

9.    Under sections 2 2 and 2 3 of the Data Protection Act 19 =4 an
individual who suffers damage as a. result of the inaccuracy, loss
or   unauthorised   disclosure      of  personal  data  is entitled to
compensation from the data user.       In the absence of any case lav on
these provisions,     it is unclear whether the acts covered bi­
sections 22 and 23 amount to torts, to which the guidance _in
paragraphs 6 and 7 .above applies.      If not, section 48 of the Police
Act IS 64 dees not apply.        Howe ve r, the position is broadly the
same.     Under section 3 8 ( 3 ) (a) of the 1984 Xct constables are
treated as servants of the chief officer for the purposes cf. the
Act.    A chief constable is therefore liable for the acts cf his
officers falling within sections 22 and 23 in the cane way as he is
liable for their torts under section 48(1).         The position of non-
police officers is less clear but it is possible that in seme cases
the chief constable night be regarded as having liability for their
acts.   It follows that it would be proper for the police authority
                                                                             3
to teet all costs, including any award cf compensation, arising
from this liability.  It should be noted that the liability of the
"data user" under the Act is not vicarious but his personal
liability.  Therefore his ovn care in having instituted a system cf
obtaining, checking and recording data which would reasonably guard
against error and loss under section 23(3) cf the Act should neet
his responsibility under section 22(3) and he should not be held
liable if one cf his officers disregards the system established.
rf O 'rj M




 0.    Where compensation is sought from an individual officer, the
 olice authority will wish, in considering whether to neet the
 osts which would otherwise fall on the officer, to take account of
 he same ratters as in exercising their power under section 45(4)
of the Police Act 1964 ( s e e paragraph 7).     Police authorities
should apply the same broad principles and in particular, reet the
costs of any compensation awarded against a chief constable where a
non-police officer is at fault and   the chief constable is found to
have liability for the actions performed.


Police Officers Brincinc Civil Actions for Defamation

11.   There may be occasions when financial assistance is sought
from a police authority to enable an officer to bring or consider
bringing   a civil   action  for  defamation.     An authority has
discretion to give such assistance but it will be eligible     for
police grant only if the following criteria are all ret:-

             (a)   the defamation is serious;

             (b)    it relates to the actions cf an officer acting        cr
             said to be acting in the discharge of his duty;

             (c)   it has attracted public attention;

             (d)   to bring the action           is considered to be in the
             interests of t h e - f o r c e cr   cf the .police service as a
             whole; and                          "    ”.

             (e)   the action stands a reasonable chance of success.

 Criterion (d) is central. . If only the reputation of the individual
 officer is in question, he is in       the tare position asany other
 citizen and rust be expected to        seek his own remedy.     But an
 allegation against a particular officer ray veil reflect on the
 refutation o f the whole force or be an example of wider allegations
 acainst the force or a significant section of it.      In- such- cases
 the police authority/ provided the other criteria are satisfied,
 ray reasonably be expected to help to defend the reputation of the
 force.




                                                                               4
INQUESTS, PUBLIC ENQUIRIES AND T R I B U N A L

Le c s 1 Representation for Ch ie f Off ■>cers

12.  Any interested   arty ray be legally represented at an inquest
but at his own expense since expenses are payable only to witnesses
and jurors.   An interested party will normally be entitled to be
legally represented at a public enquiry or ether public tribunal.
Khere the interest of the force is affected, it will be appropriate
for the police authority to provide at its expense for the chief
officer to be legally represented on behalf of the force.


Lecral Representation for Individual Officers

13.   Separate representation for individual officers whose interest
is involved ray be necessary.   For exarple, there will be occasions
when (a) the chief officer's legal representative cannot reasonably
be expected to represent the separate interests of such officers
and (b) the police authority considers that such interests should
be represented.   In such cases the authority should give financial
assistance   to  the officers.      In considering   (b) above, the
authority vill vish in particular to assess vhether the officers
are at risk of being held to blare for actions in connection vith
the death to which the inq'jest relates and vhether any such finding
r.ight give rise to legal proceedings for the costs of vhich the
police authority vould be liable under section 43(1) of the Police
Act 1554 cr for which financial assistance right be appropriate
within the terr.s of this circular.


APPLICATIONS FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

14.    An officer wishing to seek financial assistance frcr his
police authority should have the opportunity in advance of as veil
as on the conclusion of the proceedings to subrit to the chief
officer an application for financial assistance.   The chief officer
should put this, together vith his own recorrendation to the police
authority for decision, • The officer should norrallv be given the
opportunity by the police authority, to rake representations to ther.
if he wishes to do so.

15.    If it decides to give financial assistance, the authority
should inferr the officer concerned that, if the inforration cn
which they based their decision to grant the assistance is shewn in
subsequent legal proceedings to be inaccurate or incorplete, the
authority vill normally expect to recover the roney unless it is
satisfied that no culpable misrepresentation was involved ana that
to recover the noney vould involve the applicant in substantial
hardship.   On the other hand, if an authority 'refuses financial

          Dear ch ief Officer/Clerk.

           i his circular:

          • provides updated guidance to police authorities on financial assistance to police
            officers in legal proceedings.

          • distinguishes between officers involved in civil proceedings, criminal
            proceedings and other types of legal proceedings.

          • replaces HO Circular 77/1987.
Introduction


1.     I: is important mat police officers should be able to carry out their duties in
the confidence that their police authority will support them, if they act in good faith
and exercise their judgement reasonably. The following guidance, which has been
prepared in consultation with ACPO, the Superintendents Association, the Police
Federation and the Association of Police Authorities, should be read against this
principle.

Civil Proceedings

2.     Under section 88 (l)_of the Police Act .1996 which re-enacts section 48H) of
the Polir? Act 1964 chief officers are liable lor torts committed by officers under
their direction, and control. Section 88(2) provides that any damages or costs
awarded against the chief officer and any costs they incur themselves (which are not
recovered) should be met from police authority funds.

3.     Alternatively, a court may award damages against individual police officers.
Section SS(4) of the Police Act 1S96 empowers a police authority “to such an extent
as appears to it to be appropriate” to pay any damages or costs awarded against
officers (this includes both officers of other forces serving in the police area under
mutual aid arrangements and special constables), any costs incurred by the officers
themselves and any sum paid in connection with the settlement of a claim. It is for
police authorities to decide when to make assistance available, taking account of the
circumstances of a particular case.

4.      Police authorities are reminded that the discretionary powers in sections
SSi'4) and (5> of the/ . cl enabling them to provide financial assistance to officers
involved in legal proceedings, apply to civil proceedings-only. Sections-88(4) and
88(5) may also apply to police officers who were members at the time of the action
which gave rise to the claim but who are no longer members.

Criminal Proceedings'

5.     Section 88(4) does not apply to criminal proceedings, but police authorities
may wish to consult their legal advisers as to. whether they have any other power to
provide such assistance (whether in respect o f private prosecutions or prosecutions
brought by the CPS). In this context, they may wish to note that section 111(1) of
the Local Government Act 1972 enables police authorities to do anything “ which is
calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the discharge of any of their
functions". The provision applies to provincial authorities (but not the Metropolitan
or City of London police) by virtue of Section 146A of the 1972 Act (as inserted
by Schedule 14 to the Local Government Act 1985 and amended by Schedule 4 of
the Police and Magistrates’ Courts Act 1994). It could be argued that to allow
payment to be made to officers (either former or serving) involved in criminal
proceedings would in some way facilitate or be conducive to a police authority's
broad functions. For example, failure to provide financial assistance could
adversely affect the morale o f the force if officers had to meet their own costs after
an acquittal.

6.      It is for individual police authorities to decide in the particular circumstances
of a case, and on the basis o f legal advice, whether to make financial assistance
available to officers in criminal proceedings.      —

Other tvpes of legal proceedings

7.      5^~>ilarlv rherfi is no exD17*"* sfatmory authority for providing financial
assistance in procccuings brougnt against poncc officers ui tribunals otner tnau me
w u iis. It is for police authorities outside London (bearing in mind the
recommendations of chief officers) to decide whether to make financial assistance
available to officers (either former or serving) involved in Public Inquiries and
Tribunals. Police authorities will therefore need to consider whether section 111(1)
of the Local Government Act 1972 provides sufficient scope to enable financial
assistance to be given in any particular case. In this respect tribunals may include
certain industrial tribunals where it is clear that officers have acted in good faith in
pursuance of their duties and the interest of the force as a whole is involved. It is to
be expected that, where appropriate, the service’s grievance procedure
arrangements should be exhausted before there is recourse to legal proceedings.
These arrangements are set out in Home Office Circular 16/93, issued 10 March
1993.

S.      There are specific provisions in the Race Relations Act 1976 and the Sex
Discrimination Act 1975 for compensation, costs and expenses awarded against the
chief officer of police and any sum required for settlement, if approved by the
police authority, to be paid from the police fund.

9.      There is no express statutory authority for providing financial assistance to
an officer wishing to initiate court proceedings. The considerations set out in
paragraphs 5 to 7 above apply to such cases.

                                                    OUTLINE SUBMISSIONS

              1    DECISION OF DIVISIONAL COURT

             The Court decided that a Police Authority has power “....but subject to ordinary’ Law
             principles, to provide financial assistance to police officers and former police officers in
             respect o f their costs and expenses incurred in relation to private prosecutions brought against
             them and judicial review proceedings in which they participate.” The court refused to make
             the decision specific to the two defendants. Furthermore, whilst clarifying the power to fund,
             the court declined to state when that power should be exercised, that is, whether it should be
             exercised at the start o f proceedings, during them or on their conclusion.

             The Court also refused to set out matters which the Authority should consider or disregard in
             determining whether or not it should provide financial assistance to officers. Indeed, to quote


   •
             Lord Justice Laws: “It is important that the declaration should not indicate any view taken by
              the court, for the court has none, as to whether the financing should actually be provided.”

              2   . PREVIOUS SUBMISSIONS BY HFSG

              HFSG continues to rely on the written submissions forwarded to the Authority on 22nd
              December 1998 and 5th January 1999 with the exception o f those which touch upon the
              legality o f the funding. The submissions relating to the fourth charge against Mr Duckenfield,
              (attempting to pervert the course o f justice) are also irrelevant at this stage as the DPP has
              discontinued that charge.

              In particular, if the Authority decides that it has power to grant funding prior to any costs
              being incurred, the HSFG relies upon Annex C o f its submissions of 5th January (copy
              appended). Annex C contains a summary o f the evidence on the charges o f manslaughter and
              misfeasance.

   ^         3 RELEVANT MATTERS TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION

              i)           As a primary submission HFSG strongly disagree with the Chief Constable’s
                           contention that the defendants should have all their costs paid “up front”. Parliament
                           could not have intended to provide for a system which is so open to abuse and
                           manipulation. The previous conduct o f the defendants and their lawyers gives rise to
                           serious concern. In the Judicial Review proceedings the Chief Clerk to South Sefton
                           Magistrates provided affidavit evidence. In his affidavit he stated:-

                           “The defendants’ solicitors each submitted their claims for costs in September 1998. I
                           was extremely surprised at the level o f costs which were being claimed, particularly in
                           view o f the fact that neither o f the defendants or their solicitors had actually appeared
                           before the court in relation to this matter5’.

                           Any decision to pay costs “up front” would offend against public policy.

             ii)           Availability o f legal aid or alternative sources offending

                           The question o f the extent and scale o f the supply o f money from the public revenue
                           for legal proceedings is a public and controversial issue. Detailed and highly regulated
                           provision is made by the Legal Aid Act. A proposal to give police officers a more
                           expensive and privileged facility at public expense than is available to others would be
                           deeply contentious and socially divisive.

                           The legal aid scheme is available to a defendant but not to a prosecutor. Section 1 of
                           the Legal Aid Act 198S declares that its purpose is to establish a framework for the
                           provision o f advice, assistance, and representation which is publicly funded with a view
                           to helping persons who might otherwise be unable to obtain the same on account o f
                           their means. According to Judicial Statistics for 1998, almost everyone who applies
                           for legal aid for criminal proceedings is awarded it. If a defendant is ordered to make a
                           contribution, the Court can remit such an order or order that any contribution should
                           be repaid where there has been an acquittal.

                           In addition, if press reports are correct, it would appear that the Superintendents’
                           Association are prepared to consider funding the defendants if approached. The
                           Association certainly contributed to their legal costs in the recent Judicial Review
                           proceedings.

              iii)         Whether the applicant for financial support has yet been found guilty or acquitted. A
                           police authority’s funds should not be paid to an officer who is said to be criminally
                           liable in his personal capacity. An officer who is later acquitted should receive his
                           costs from central Rinds or from the private prosecutor. An officer who is later
                           convicted should not be funded by the Police Authority.

              iv)      The extent to which financial support from the Authority, during the course o f
                       proceedings might preclude an award o f costs in those proceedings in favour o f the
                       individual so supported. (It is clear from the assistance presently sought by the
                       defendants that the Cleric to South Sefton Justices has not yet decided whether the
                        defendants costs can be met from central funds.)

              v)       The extent o f financial support previously granted to the defendants. During the
                        Judicial Review proceedings, HFSG became aware for the first time that both
                        defendants had their legal costs paid by the Authority throughout the 80 day inquest.
                        Both had separate legal representation. The costs o f this must have been quite
                        staggering, Families paid £3,500 each for block representation at the inquest. Further,
                        the amount expended to date in the criminal proceedings must be quite considerable.
                        It is clear that open ended fending encourages delaying tactics and costmongering.

              vi)      responsibility to serving officers in South Yorkshire Police not to deplete the already
                        overstretched resources of the Police Authority.

              vii)     South Yorkshire Police, presumably with the support o f the Authority has always
                           accepted that the deaths of the 96 victims were caused by negligence.

                                                               Page 2 o f 3

       viii)   South Yorkshire Police have accepted, or at least have never challenged, the findings
               o f Lord Tayior that the negligence o f which the defendants are accused was “ a blunder
               of the first magnitude” and an immediate cause of death.

       ix)     The negligence of which the defendants are accused cannot on any view of the facts be
               attributed to a “ split-second decision”.

       x)      The PC A directed in July 1991 that the defendants should face disciplinary charges of
               neglect o f duty. Mr Duckenfield also faced a charge o f discreditable conduct. (At that
               time, M r Duckenfield had been suspended from duty for two years.) Two weeks after
               the PC A direction, M r Duckenfield, though suspended, went on “sick leave”. The
                Chief Constable retired him from the force on “medical grounds” in November 1991.
                The charge against him, therefore, lapsed. In January 1992 it was then considered
                unfair to proceed against M r Murray. Next year, Mr Murray, too retired from the
                force on “ health grounds” .

        xi)    The interests o f the defendants and the Chief Constable may be different in this case.
                It is in the interests o f justice that the defendants are represented by lawyers who are
                not paid for by a police authority whose Chief Constable has a powerful interest in
                maintaining exclusive control over so many documents of relevance to the criminal
                case. Justice must be seen to be done.

        xii)      The DPP has decided that there is a case to answer. The Divisional Court has refused
                  to overturn that decision. This surely is an indication o f the strength of the case
                  against the defendants and undermines previous decisions not to prosecute.

        4 FI JTI IRE CONDUCT OF PROCEEDINGS

        The Defendants are, o f course, entitled to legal representation and HFSG has no wish to deny
        them access to proper legal representation. If the Authority does decide to fund them, then
        strict conditions should be attached to the funding to ensure value for money. Checks and
        balances have to be imposed. Regular reviews should be undertaken by the members of the
        Authority themselves.

                                            Manslaughter and Misfeasance


                    David Duckenneld and Bernard Murray, then respectively a Chief Superintendent and
                    a Superintendent in the South Yorkshire Police Force, were on duty in the control box
                    at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, on 15!h April 1989. when a semi-final of the FA.
                    cup was to be played between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest football clubs
                    Attached are chapters 1 to 5. 9 to 11, and 16 of the Taylor Report. The facts se: out
                    therein form the basis o f the allegations against the two potential defendants. These
                    extracts from the Taylor report are attached as A nnex D.

                    Other sections o f the Taylor report make other criticisms of the police in general, and
                    o f other bodies.

                    Lord Taylor said at paragraph 265 o f his report:

                           “The immediate cause of the gross overcrowding and hence the disaster was
                           the failure, when Gate C was opened, to cut off access to the central pens
                           which were already overfull.”

                    The evidence of forensic pathologists called at the mini inquests in 1990 was that in
                    almost all cases death resulted rapidly from unconsciousness that was caused by the
                    crushing that followed the inrush o f spectators, in full view o f the two men, following
                    the order to open the gates, and a failure to diver: the incoming spectators from pens 3


                    Mr Duckenfieid was in overall charge, and primarily responsible for the decisions and
                    iack o f decisions which led to the crushing. Mr Murray shares in this responsibility He
                    knew the ground better. He had been in an important position of responsibility a: the
                    identical semi-final the year before, when the Liverpool supporters were also at the
                    Leppings Lane end o f the ground. A similar concentration o f supporters in the pens 3
                    and 4 had occurred but crushing had'been avoided by the simple expedient of diverting
                    the incoming supporters from the tunnel which led to those overcrowded pens.

                    In 1989, Mr Duckenfield was entitled to call on Mr Murray’s experience. Mr Murray,
                    like Mr Duckenfield failed, in breach o f his duty, to take, demand or recommend the
                    obvious steps to avoid the obvious dangers.

                    The decision to open the gates without raking steps "to divert the oncoming spectators
                    was, in the words o f Lord Taylor, a “blunder o f the first magnitude” and was an
                    immediate (and therefore substantial) cause o f death. The decision was taken by
                    Duckenfield. with the agreement or acquiescence o f Murray.

          8       The witness statements already provided to the defence provide cogent evidentia!
                  support for the manslaughter and misfeasance allegations, combined with admissions
                  o f fact made by each defendant in his various statements, and evidence to the Inquest
                  and the Taylor Inquiry. Many exhibits such as videos, photographs, p!ans etc,
                  gathered and prepared for the purposes o f the Taylor Inquiry by the West Midlands
                  Police, are not to hand because the South Yorkshire police have so far refused to hand
                  them over.

          Sonic features o f the prosecution evidence already served.

          9       In the course of, and after, the “ Scrutiny", many statements became available to the
                   HFSG which it had never seen before, because the South Yorkshire police controlled
                   the entire archive of statements and exhibits. The statements of 35 witnesses have
                   been served now on the defence, and show as follows. In 19SS police officers diverted
                   spectators away from the tunne! leading to those pens, (eg Hilton). The unedited
                   statements of the officers White and Lang prove the same, and suggest that it had been
                   the practice of senior officers to ensure that the tunnel was closed when the pens were
                   full, something that could be seen easily by Inspector White from the steps near the
                   Control Box. This police evidence was suppressed until 1998. (The question of
                   editing statements is discussed below.) In 19S9,.when the gate was opened, a rush of
                   people carried spectators straight into the tunnel, and it was impossible to turn back
                   (Cook).

          10      There was r.o obvious alternative to the tunne! (Harvey, Murray. Feliowes, Southern. )
                  There was no diversion away from this tunne! (Odger. Murphy, Langley). Spectators
                  had to go w|:h the crowd, for fear of falling underfoot. (Edwards). Spectators were
                  carried by the surge o f people into the tunne! when Gate C was opened. (Anderson.
                  Burns, Campbell.) The centra! pens in the terraces were packed at 2.50 pm (Blayr.ey,
                  Mullee). PC Guest said that at 2.40 it was not going to be possible to accommodate
                  the crowd outside the Leppings Lane entrance in those pens. P.C. Walpole says the
                  overcrowding was obvious at 2.55pm. P.C Brooks says the centra! pens were too full
                  at 2.50pm.

          The position o f the defendants

          1!      Duckenfield-and Murray were in the Control Box. They could see the centra! pens.
                  Closed circuit television gave them an even better view of the pens. Five minutes after
                  Superintendent Marshall had asked for help to relieve possibly life-threatening pressure
                  at the turnstiles in Leppings Lane, Duckenfield, with the acquiescence and tacit
                  support o f Murray, finally ordered the gate to be opened without closing off access to
                  the already crowded pens. Thousands surged in: the deaths o f 96 people were the
                  immediate and direct consequence. Murray had been on duty at the semi-final in 1933
                  in the Control Box. He culpably failed in 1989 to give the proper and obvious advice.
                  Duckenfield, in Lord Taylor’s words, “froze” . Both defendants admit their presence in
                  the Control Box, and Duckenf:e!d admits that he lied about matters shortly afterwards,
                  saying the Liverpool supporters broke open the gate. It is a travesty o f the case to
                  suggest that it concerns a “split-second decision.”

   !2       The CCTV n!m. and footage taken by the BBC. photographs and other videos cf the
            circumstances, disclose full pens before the gate was opened, and a horrifying and
            obvious overcrowding after the gates opened. The BBC has provided the HFSG with
            good quality footage o f the disaster and surrounding circumstances.

  Admissions made by Duckenfield

   13       Duckenfie’d does not dispute that he looked round the ground on V' April 1939
            (Taylor Inquiry, 24/5 p 116) in preparation for the match. He does not dispute that he
            appreciated the problems o f tunnel and pens. He was aware o f the central tunnel, (p
            iV s)
   14       He accepted that fans were likely to gravitate towards the centra! tunnel, if they liked
            to watch the game from the back of the goal (24/5/89, p 119), and that the obvious
            way to the terracing was through the tunnel; anyone coming in would gravitate
            towards the tunnel, whether or not he wanted to go directly behind the goal. .

   i 5      Duckenfield's defence, at first, was that crowd management and filling of pens wax no:
            a police responsibility but that of the club (120), but later he said he did appreciate the
            importance o f ensuring that there was no overcrowding in the pens. ( I24B). He said
            that officers at the back, that is, in the concourse behind the tunnel, should know the
            problems. Inspector White knew the location (127). Duckenfield’s own document
            emphasised that “our job is to ensure the safety of spectators” (137)

   15       Duckenfield noticed by 2.30 that there was a concentration ir. pens 3 and 4 and asked
            the spectators to move forward and spread along the terraces. (25/5 page 1213). In
            performing his duties, he was acting on the “advice” o f Superintendent Murray (2SA)
            About 2.44 pm it was becoming clear that they were not going to get all the crov-d in
            by 3 pm (33 A-B). Duckenf.eld appreciated that opening gates was “likely to cause
            potential problems inside” (page 39).

   !7       Duckenfield conceded that when the second request came to open the gate's, that was
            the time when he thought about where they would go. (413). There was of course
             five minute between the first request and the command to open the gates. He knew
            Ih.al it was pretty crowded in central sections; and that the tunnel gave on to those the
            central sections: that they would want to get to positions as quickly as possible; and
             that they would take the obvious, easiest route to terraces. (25ih May, p -J3G-H)■ He
            did not then think o f the tunnel. He might then have given instructions to close the
             tunnel, hut he did not because he did not think o f the risk.

    1S      Duckenfield then conceded, however, that he had said in his statement “I watched the
             Leppings Lane terraces intently for any developments as a result o f the gates opening.”
             (47D-E) “ I was concerned to see what the effects o f opening the gates and allowing
             people into the ground would have.” (47E-F.) “There was a possibility o f
             overcrowding everywhere.” (52G)

    19      Duckenfield accepted that “I made a mistake but in fact other officers should have
8/05 '99   .2:30     01512361936                 H F S G               -->01132079001                     Pg. 08




                   remedied that mistake by using their initiative.” (92B). He would have expected that
                   an inspector or individual officers would have raced to the tunnel and taken action.
                   (93 B). (Of course, only those in the Control Box had sight o f all relevant parts of that
                   end c f the ground and the area behind the turnstiles).

                   On 26"' May 1939, Duckenrield accepted that it was important to warn police officers
                   and stewards inside the ground that the gates were to be opened. Supt Murray took on
                   the responsibility o f trying to contact Lock of Sheffield Wednesday, (page 10-11). He
                   also told Lord Taylor that he knew when Gate A opened that a serial of officers
                   formed a funnel to divert them from seeking to enter the stands, where entry was by
                   special ticket. There were no such arrangements for the tunnel. This important
                   evidence shows forethought about the consequences o f opening the gates, and made
                   the possibility o f crushing even more obvious.

                   The prosecution will invite a court to conclude that these admissions show gross
                   negligence, causative o f death; and furthermore, they will submit that they disclose ?.
                   wanton and perhaps angry disregard for the safety of people in the pens, when other
                   people, whom Ducker.field regarded as of the same ilk, were causing him ?. serious
                   problem outside the ground.

                   If, alternatively, these facts suggest incompetence, and a very bad or crass attempt to

                   Cr, App. R. 8, approved by the House o f Lords in R v. Adoniako , in which
                   incompetence in a person exercising specialised or expert functions was held

                     r,gains! Murray on Manslaughter and Misfeasance

                   it is submitted that the responsibility o f Murray for manslaughter and misfeasance is if
                   anything greater than Ducke.nfield's. The following extracts from his evidence to the
                   Taylor Inquiry' and Inquest are relied on for the purposes of the present review, as
                   evidence of these two offences.

           24      Murray had occupied the same role in 19S8 and 1989 and had written a report on the
                   match afterwards, in May 1988. He had taken a leading part in policing a Hillsborough
                   game between Sheffield Wednesday and Liverpool in January 1989. (Taylor Inquiry.
                   31/5, p 63). ( His involvement was well summarised in cross-examination at Is' June
                    1989, page I, by M r Woodward: he had been involved in the 1988 semi-final; the
                   review o f the 1988 semi-final; and the planning and preparation for the 1989 semi- _
                   final. A copy o f his review in May 1988 o f the 1988 game was read out at to him at the
                   Inquest (Day 67. page 140)).

           25      The pens were often filled up in accordance with directions from the Control Box.
                    Officers would direct fans down the tunnel. This did not apply to the semi-final,
                    however. No officers were briefed to keep a specific eye on the filling o f pen?, 3 and 4
                    15/4. (31/5, p 67). Neither Duckenfield nor Murray gave instructions at oral briefing.

                           Murray’s role was overall charge of the Control Room and adviser to Duckenfie »d.

              26       Murray said his role was as “adviser” to Duckanfield. (68D-E). The policy was to let
                       the fans "find their own level” (75B). At about 2.30 pm, “I did not consider whether
                       there was room in any particular pen. I was looking at the terrace as a whole and the
                       North Stand and the West Stand." Murray thought there were gates which supporters
                       used to move between pens.

              27       Murray conceded that no instruction was given to close off the tunnel to any police
                       officers or stewards, and that there may have been four requests to open the gates
                       (3 1/5/89. p 92). The request was to open the gates “in the plural".

              2S       It is submitted that M urray’s account at page 93G is in effect an admission to criminal
                        recklessness. He admitted at E, “When I saw the gates opened I was obviously
                        looking in that [pens 3 and 4] direction” . It was put to Him that "the obvious pi nee to
                        fXr
                         br them to go was down the tunnel:

                                    “It is now that I know. I know the ground. I know where the tunnel is. I
                                   know where C gate is. I had never drawn any son of realisation that pecpie
                                   coming through C gate would go towards the tunnel, or whatever, I have never
                                   envisaged C gate as an entry gate of course, but the two things did r.oi register,
                                   did not tie up. It seemed so obvious after the event but certainly I gave it no
                                   thought and no realisation, before.”

                           in. cross-examination, Murray emphasised that he thought that fans could move from
                           pen to pen. However, he conceded that pens 3 and 4 filled up first because they were
                           popular; and they tended to fill up to the back (I I8D-F)

              30           It is submitted that this fact makes his assertions that supporters could walk through
                            the gates between the pens meaningless and irrelevant, when thousands were pouring
                            through gates that had been opened to relieve a terrible and constantly intensifying
                            crush. Murray conceded to Mr Woodward, for South Yorkshire police, that at 2 -6.
                            according to photographs, the terraces looked “pretty full", (i/6/89, page 3)

              31           In answer to questions from Lord Taylor, Murray seemed to acknowledge that it had
                            been an option for the police to fill up the pens in series at the match (17)

               32          At the Inquest, Murray accepted that he had full authority to take steps to avoid the
                            risk to occupants o f the ground as a result of opening the gates, had he recognised
                            such a risk. (Day 67, page 3 IB-C). He would not have been dependent on
                            Duckenfield’s authorisation for any such steps.

               33          Murray accepted at page 43D that the police “had a role to play as regards the
                           distribution of spectators across the Leppings Lane terraces.” See aJso 4 5A. At page
                           48C, he accepted that the police had a duty to monitor the build-up and filling of the
                           terraces before kick-up. At page 56B-D, he accepted that “ there may well have come a
                           time when it was necessary “ for him to divert supporters from the central pens. (It is

                                                                     5
1)/35   , 2 : 31    0.5U 3«1««                                         ->0.13207900.




                   the prosecution case that he should have put in hand this diversion in any event,
                   because the outer pens were sparely occupied).

        34         He accepted that if it had been brought to his attention that the centra! pens werefull,
                   and there was space in the side pens, he would have taken some action. 5SD-E. I; is
                   the prosecution case that that fact was abundantly clear to anyone who looked.

        35         Murray accepted that he could have got manpower to block the tunnel in the five
                   minutes that Duckenfield was considering the request that the gates be opened. (77D
                   and 78 A). He knew that the tunnel was in that part o f the concourse, (page S6C-S7E)

        jo         It is submitted that once it is shown by photographs, video recordings and television
                   film that the pens were effectively full, or even nearly full, at the time the gates were
                   open, the cases against both Murray and Duckenfield becomcs very powerful. The
                   state o f the pens was clearly visible from the Control Box and on the cameras,
                   equipped with “zoom" facilities, in that Box.

        37         The nature o f the relationship between Murray and Duckenfield is not manifest from
                   the evidence, but it may be inferred that there was at least coolness between them.
                   Duckenfield was entitled to look to Murray for advice and support. Duckenfieid had
                   been promoted to a higher rank than Murray very recently. Murray was three years
                   older, and more experienced at policing of this kind. The question by Murray, "Are
                   you going to open the Gates, Mr Duckenfleld?" does not show a warm or cc-
                   o p er a t ive r el a t io n s h ip.

        5S         i: is submitted that the Police Complaint Authority rightly recognised that the charge
                    of neglect was 'jo in t” . The reckless or grossly negligent decision to open the gates
                   without closing off the pens was the responsibility of both defendants,

        39         The evidence becoming available, and previously concealed, about practices in I9SS,
                   adds to the weight of the evidence. It suggests that other evidence exists, proving
                   further the element o f foreseeability. However, even without that new 1983 evidence,
                   and irrespective o f the belief that the South Yorkshire Police is guarding much more
                   evidence showing gross negligence, it is submitted that there is powerful’evidence
                   against both defendants.

        40         It is not proposed to set out further evidence, given by other police officers, about the
                   conduct o f the two defendants. The prosecution may call some o f them as witnesses,
                   as they think appropriate after a review of the Sheffield archive, once it becomes
                   available.

        41         All these facts, drawn from the Taylor report and the available evidence, are to be
                   contrasted with Mr Dames’ inappropriate suggestion that funding by the SYPA was
                   necessary to maintain morale among officers who had to make “split second
                   decisions,”

 LORD JUSTICE LAWS: Ms Eaxendale,           I am sorry but before vou

      start there is a preliminary matter I want to raise,                        we

      had a fax from Mr Jones which T have temporarily lost

      saying that,        this is right Mr Jones, you nay be rarruired

      to be       in their Lordships   House this afternoon and sc you

      would       wished to be released after lunch today and be

      heard tomorrow morning.          In the ordinary way

      would at once accede to that but I have a deeper

      problem.         At the moment I do not understand what your

      client's legitimate -- and I emphasis that adjective -*

      interest in these proceedings is.

 MR JONES:        My   Lord, would you like me to deal with that?

                  If I deal with the   matter of history in the

      instant matter.        When leave was granted in this case by

      Latham J.        We - - I am talking from recollection -- leave

      was granted on Friday 1 2 t h .February.                 We had sent in a

      note on that day or the day before indicating that we

      wished to be heard in opposition to the application or

however,    did net have in mind that your clients would be

putting forward any arguments which were the arguments

of the Police Authority.      You would simply be there to

deal with any discrete point which may affect, your

client and no one else.      That would be the normal course

 that one would expect of the second respondent.                       So

 I would certainly feel that you ought not to be under

misapprehension when I directed that you be made second

 respondent, because that was afforded to enable you to

 ranee widely in the debate, again in relation to any

 discrete ooint that your clients felt you oughr. to

 raise.

 encourage you to reflect on the position and the role o

 a prosecutor and the importance of the position taken by

 a prosecutor.     It would be most extraordinary in my

 experience if any prosecutor attacked the funding of the

       s. 111(1)) tre conferred cn the policeaiilhority by the local govgxnmcat legislation, to
5      die extent that manures there contained wore tpplied to policc authorities by
       $.145A{1) of the Act of 1972. The powers so conferred *rt fisted in a helpful note
       provide by Miss B«cead*le. I do act propose to set them out They include (apart
3      from s. 111(1)) stieh matters as ihe.;dispositioa and treatment of staff tnd the
       acquisition and disposal of land.


■                    The critical point which in a y judgment emerges from t consideration
       of the interlocking roles o f Chief Constable. Secretcy o f Sate and police authority is
           it wmaot have been within the coattmpliiion of Psriiament in eaactmg the
      scheme, tnd in entering withia it s. 111(1), A it the police authority should only be
      empowered to bear expenditure in support of those dnties, and snciliary powers,
      which sre specifically conferred upon it. The police isthoriy holds the funds from
      which expenses for ta local police force Mil he supplied: s. 14. It is inherent in the
      system (u Mr Baker submitted in reply) that * e O sef Consmble will spply to lie
     authority for cuthorisatiiM to incur expenditure; it any be for the use of resources such
     ss helicopters, or the instslluioa of vjdeo surreiU^ce systems ia city streets, or a host
     o f other things. No doubt the Chief Consable presents a general budget. We were not
     referred to tay provision la statute »iich shows or suggests that the poKce rathority's
    power to accede to such revests rests ia .nything odwr than the combination of s,«(l)

    in this su e, * e leptim ce s « ^ of th* ancillary power provided by s .l 11( 1) cannot be
    restricted so as to suj^jort only those powers t t i dntjea which ire expressly caafeffed

                                         This result is supported, if aafy ex sitemfo, by the decision of this court
                      in R D erbyshire Police Authority tx p. Wilson (8 August 1989, unreponed save in
             9       The Times). The court had. to.:consider a decision of the police authority not to

        ! 2 provided the power to gnmt financial assistance. However the point of principle was
                     not aguci. The applicants also point to other materials. In 1962 the rcpon o f the
                     Royal Commission on the Police was published. It iadicacd

               Mr Harrison discretely sobmiis thst the decision to let the charge of
crtts^dng to pervert the canrse of jw titt go ahe*d was unl*w&l, because it runs flat
counter to the ‘'no cast to *n*wer” test in his own policy. It will be recalled that the

      Dear Sirs

      R -v - South Yorkshire Police Authority ex p a r t e Chief Constable of South Yorkshire
      Police

      We refer to recent correspondence, and Mr Eastwood’s discussion with Mr Harlock in
      regard to the further Opinion from Mr Clegg QC we have provided. We confirm that this is
      to be treated as confidential to your firm and the South \ orkshire Police Authority and not
      to be released further without reference to ourselves or Leading Counsel.

         We are grateful for your fax confirming the venue for Friday’s meeting and will await
         further advice as to the time when we are expected to attend for the oral submissions. In
         this regard, we have of course seen the Skeleton Argument submitted on behalf of Mr
         Murray, and have discussed this at length with Mr Manning of Walker Morris. In the
         interests of cost-effectiveness, and given that much of that Skeleton deals with matters
         relating to both Defendants, we will not be submitting a separate Skeleton Argument but
         naturally will adopt the submissions made by Mr Manning. We will, in an oral submission,
         deal with particular aspects relating to Mr Duckenfield, as^ set out m previous
         correspondence, and one or two other aspects which arise from the history of this matter.

         Naturally if you require any further information or assistance prior to Friday’s meeting
         please let us know.

         Yours faithfully

     For the attention of George R Croston
     Prosecution Team Leader


     Dear Sirs

     H illsborough: Adlington -v- David Duckenfield & M urray

     We refer to previous correspondence in this matter, in the light of the requests made on
     behalf of the Defendants for the Director of Public Prosecutions to take over the conduct
     of proceedings, pursuant to Section 6 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 and to
     discontinue those proceedings pursuant to Section 23. You have kindly provided copies
     of the exchange of correspondence between your office and the Hillsborough Family
     Support Group (HFSG), and we refer specifically to your "policy letter" of 27th July 1998
     outlining the policy to be adopted in cases o f this type, i.e., private prosecutions. We have
     been provided with copies o f the representations made on behalf o f MURRAY by Messrs
     Walker Morris and would adopt those submissions on behalf of Mr Duckenfield insofar
     as they relate to matters of relevance to both defendants.

    Introduction

    The power of the Director to intervene under Section 6 of the Prosecution o f Offences Act
    1985 is unfettered. It is not limited to a consideration of the strength or weight of the
    evidence but embraces a consideration of the wider public interest in whether a trial ought
    to take place.

    All the submissions of the HFSG have concentrated on a perceived evidential basis for the
    summons currently issued. If the existence of a prima facie case were the only basis upon
    which the Director could exercise the power under Section 6 then the effect of the section
    would be largely redundant. If no evidence existed an information could not be properly
    laid and if no prima facie case was made out then the magistrates could not commit for
    trial. Were these the only circumstances in which the power under Section 6 would be
    exercised then there would never be any need to exercise the power. It is submitted on
    behalf of Mr Duckenfield that the power of the Director is far wider than a mere
    assessment of the evidence and embraces a consideration of the wider public interest.

    The Director is well placed to assess where the public interest lies having had involvement
    in the case over a period of nine years and having seen the Taylor Report, the Stuart-Smith
    Scrutiny, the coroner’s verdict, the judgment of the Divisional Court and the review of

evidence and the advice of leading counsel obtained when the Director made the decision not
to prosecute.

We understand and sympathise with the sentiments of the bereaved and injured who feel
understandably that someone must be made to pay for the disaster. We also understand the
disappointment they feel when at every stage the decisions made have been against any
recommendation for prosecution. It must be recorded that the lives of everyone involved in
the disaster have altered as a consequence of these terrible events, including that of Mr
Duckenfield.

On the date of the disaster he had only been in his post of chief superintendent for 21 days
and this was the first operation of this type where he had been in command. While the
impact of the events on him cannot be compared to the impact on those on the terraces they
were nonetheless personally catastrophic.

Until the disaster he had been a highly successful career policeman with 21 years of service
to the community and 3 commendations for good police work. He has never worked since
and has had his actions subjected to analysis and examination for a period of nine years. His
health has been destroyed and the trauma of the disaster and the consequential need to assist
the authorities in the various investigations and inquests has meant that any attempt to start
a new life has been thwarted.

Many factors combined to contribute to the disaster as Hillsborough and these have been the
subject of the most exhaustive investigation by Lord Justice Taylor. One of them,-not
mentioned hitherto in the correspondence to the Director, is the construction of pens on the
terraces with inadequate gates to enable fans to escape in the event of an emergency. No-one
appreciated at the time the danger these structures presented although as a direct consequence
of this disaster they have been removed from every football stadium in the country.

We do not intend in this letter to repeat all the points made forcibly by Lord Justice Taylor
in his report nor analyse in detail the scrutiny of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. The Director is
well able to assess each and decide where the public interest lies in this case. Nonetheless
in view of the assertion by the HFSG that a clear prima facie case exists, a view we find
ourselves compelled to “disagree-with, and in the light-of a number of important factual
inaccuracies in their submissions of 24 September we feel it necessary to set the record
straight at this stage.

The Stuart-Smith Scrutinv-

One of the terms of reference of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith was to ascertain whether any
evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough Stadium which was not available
to the Director or the Attorney General for the purposes of discharging their respective
statutory responsibilities and to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
such significance as to justify their attention to be drawn to it. There was none. As part of
the Scrutiny, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith read the joint opinion of counsel dated 6 August 1990,
he considered the resume of evidence and the statement of law set out therein. The
conclusion reached was:
       "I do not consider that there is any material which should be put before the
       Director of Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints Authority which
       might cause them to reconsider the decisions they have already taken".
                                                                     (Chapter 7 p 103(5))

It would seem that the submission made by HFSG that leading counsel, providing the joint
opinion, would have misapplied the law relating to manslaughter to the facts of the case
is wTong. (HFSG submission 17/8/98 para 14). No such view was formed by Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith and the Director has available the opinion to assess for herself the merits of
this submission advanced by HFSG.

All the evidence alleged to be "new" was available to the Scrutiny, it is inaccurate to
suggest to the contrary.

       "South Yorkshire Police have an extensive archive of material about the
       Hillsborough disaster. There is a substantial storeroom full of investigation
       files, statements, photographs, videotapes and computer records. They have
       given me and my team unrestricted access to their archive for work on this
       scrutiny".
                                                                       (Chapter 5 p89(27))

Further Lord Justice Stuart-Smith considered the editing of statements by Messrs Hammond
Suddards, the fact that the statements had been edited was known by counsel to the Taylor
Inquiry (Andrew Collins QC) and the Treasury Solicitor (Mr Whitehurst). Having
considered the editing exercise Lord Justice Stuart-smith concluded that "for the most part
the suggestions for amendments by the solicitors are not open to criticism”. (Chapter 4
p93(101)) and "I am quite satisfied that the exclusion of these comments could not possibly
have affected the Director". (Chapter 4 p84(105))

It is wrong to allege that "the statements and documents sent to the DPP in 1990 were the
result of a calculated selection, from which many statements of central importance were
excluded and which included edited statements of police officers". (HFSG submission
24/9/98 para 11(d))                             -

The conclusion of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith was to the opposite effect, furthermore he
investigated allegations of improper interference with witnesses made by the HFSG
(Chapter 4 p63) and concluded that the allegations were "not substantiated". (p84)

It is also wrong to allege that any evidence exists disclosing "prima facie such a thorough
manipulation of the evidence to the past benefit of the defendants and South Yorkshire
Police". Lord Justice Stuart-Smith again arrived at the opposite conclusion,.

Much of the submission made by the HFSG involves an attack on the Stuart-Smith
Scrutiny and the conclusions it reached. It is alleged to be "economical with information",
it is suggested that "caution has to be employed in accepting facts set out in the report" and
that "the conclusions about the edited statements are seriously wrong" (HFSG submission
24/9/98 paras 114 and 112). The Director will be able to form an independent view about
the criticism of the Scrutiny. What is clearly exercising the minds of the HFSG is that if
the conclusions of the Scrutiny survive then no new material exists to justify the current
charges.

We do not intend to correct each and every factual inaccuracy in the submission of the
HFSG as it is known that that task is being undertaken by those representing Mr Murray.
We would like to draw the attention of the Director to one false statement relied upon by
the HFSG, namely that Mr Duckenfield met Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, notwithstanding that
the latter did not see fit to refer to it. This allegation is untrue as the two men have never
met. It follows that the criticism of the Scrutiny for not recording the details of the
meeting are unfounded. It is also an example of the willingness on the part of the HFSG
to rely upon conjecture as if it were uncontroverted fact.

.Analysis of new evidence

The HFSG concedes that the findings of the Taylor Inquiry fall short of those needed to
establish a "prima facie" case.

       "The Taylor findings themselves amount almost to a prima facie case".
                                                 (HFSG submission 24/9/9S para 12)

The further evidence rslied upon to support the prosecution is analysed in paragraph 17 and
all was before the Taylor Inquiry including the action of the police in 1988 (Taylor
Chapter 11 para 230). What is of critical importance is that there is no evidence
whatsoever that Mr Duckenfield was ever told about the police action the previous year,
or should have been aware of it.

Reliance is placed upon the editing of statements for which it is asserted "there can be no
honest reason" (HFSG letter 24/8/98). This allegation is wholly inconsistent with the
conclusions of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith and cannot survive even a simple exercise of
analysis.

The editing complained about to the statement of PC Woodcock excludes material that is
clearly hearsay and relates to. a conversation he had with Inspector White at the debrief.
Inspector White makes no mention of "being" given the instruction spoken about and no-
other officer at the debrief apparently heard this conversation. In any event, Woodcock's
reference is not to the diversion of fans moving from the concourse to the tunnel, but to
the general dispersal of fans on the terrace from one pen to another. We note that not one
of the deletions identified relates to any admissible evidence probative of guilt against
either defendant but consist mainly of the. type of deletions described by Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith as "quite trivial and o f no consequence whatsoever" (p82 para 99) and were
of a type which he concluded "were properly excluded".

By reference to HFSG submissions (their letter 24 August 1998, submissions o f counsel
24 September 1998) it is self-evident that the question of the 1988 events are central to the
submissions made by HFSG as they say that these events "prove foreseeability, which is
of course critical to civil and criminal allegations of negligence. They are of the most
obvious relevance to the manslaughter issue in the prosecution".
It is suggested by HFSG that the evidence of police officers concerning 1988 indicates that
senior officers monitored the pens, a diversion from the central pens took place in 1988, and
that there was a failure to take this "known and obvious precaution" in 1989 resulting in the
96 deaths. The HFSG suggest that "the South Yorkshire Police claim that the diversion of
the oncoming supporters from the central pens in 1988 was unknown to senior officers”.
They fail to refer to the findings of Lord Justice Taylor and the Coroner (see HFSG annexure
H - Summary of variances between findings of Lord Justice Taylor and summing up of
coroner Dr Popper - page 5) that the South Yorkshire Police "claim" was correct.

The evidence which HFSG says is so important to the present reconsideration adds nothing
to the foreseeability case against the defendant. When viewed against the findings of both
Lord Justice Taylor and the inquest the evidence referred to by HFSG (the new "unrevised
evidence") cannot assist in any way in establishing that any failure to divert fans from the
central pens simply involved a "known and obvious precaution". In the circumstances we are
bound to submit therefore that much of the submissions made by HFSG, in relation to the
events of 1988, adds no strength to the case against the defendants and if HFSG believe that
this issue is at the "heart of the case", we say that it must patently fail even on the
prosecution’s own assessment.

Evidential Matters

In your policy letter you advise that the Code for Crown Prosecutors (Code), which contains
the principles applicable to CPS review of criminal proceedings instigated by the Police,
provides the basis for the policy applicable to private prosecutions and as to whether-the
Director will intervene.

More specifically, you advise that in regard to the evidential requirement of the Code a less
stringent standard is to be applied to private prosecutions, to the effect that the case will be
taken over and discontinued where there is clearly no case to answer.

By comparison, when applying the Code to criminal proceedings generally, the evidential test
of "a realistic prospect of conviction" is a clearly more onerous standard. The implication is
therefore that in the terms of the evidential requirements of a private prosecution, the Director
may allow those proceedings to continue in circumstances where the evidence would not reach
the Code’s standard for a realistic prospect of conviction.

We note from the policy letter that "it has been considered that to apply the Code test to
private prosecutions would unfairly limit the right of individuals to bring their own cases".
We take issue with this statement of policy, and its applicability in the present circumstances.

We accept o f course that the Director is bound to consider, as part o f the review, whether the
evidence is sufficient w'hen considering intervention pursuant to the Prosecution of Offences
Act. We are also aware that in the past the Director has adopted a less stringent test than the
CPS apply when considering whether to intervene under Section 6. Having considered the
observations made by the Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure ("Phillips Commission")
(CMND 8092) (1981) Para 8:8 and 8:9, and the Law Commission, Criminal Law: Consent
to Prosecution C.P. 149 (Para 6:5-6-17) we are uncertain as to the justification for the policy
as applied in the past and request clarification accordingly.
Criminal Law: Consent to Prosecution C.P. 149 (Para 6:5-6-17) we are uncertain as to the
justification for the policy as applied in the past and request clarification accordingly.

        "The test applied to the Director’s cases (ie , w h e t h e r o r n o t th e r e is a
        r e a s o n a b l e p r o s p e c t o f c o n v ic tio n )
                                            should be extended to all cases and
        applied by all who make the decisions that bring a case to Court".
                                                            (Phillips Commission para 8.9)

In any event applying either test to the relevant material, such as that referred to on page
3 of the policy letter, together with any further material provided by the HFSG, and
additional material made available by the Home Office and any other source, will lead
inescapably to the conclusion that has been previously reached by the Director, to the effect
that there is insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect o f conviction. If that be the case,
pursuant to the Code, the Director will be bound to take over the conduct of proceedings
and discontinue "no matter how important or serious" the case may be.

On the basis that the Director proceeds as indicated in thepolicy letter and therefore
applies a lesser standard, we ask the Director toconsider the two specific questions posed
in the Code as follows:-

1.      Can the evidence be used in Court?

2.     Is the evidence reliable?

We invite the Director to consider those questions in the specific context of the 4 charges
against our client as follows:-

1.     Unlawful Killing

       In the broadest sense it is right to say that the question o f unlawful killing, in the
       context of involuntary manslaughter, requires proof o f the following:-

       -   duty of care^ . ________________                                    '
       -   breach o f duty of care
       -   breach causing injury or damage
       -   breach of sufficient gravity, that is grossly negligent, to amount to. a criminal
offence.

        At the time of making these submissions, we have been served with 3 folders of
        copy statements and transcripts of evidence served in support of the prosecution.


        A bundle of 35 statements, largely comprising the recollections of spectators at the
        game on 15th April 1989 relate in general to the build up of the crowd outside the
        ground, access to the ground, and the crush at the Leppings Lane end terrace. 3
        Statements included by Police Officers do not involve the direct operational
        management within the control box on the day.
We are bound to emphasise that no evidence has been served by the prosecution of
any person other than the Defendants, that will assist a criminal court in considering
the issue of the particular duty of care to be alleged against the Defendants, and as to
whether their conduct amounted to a breach thereof. To be specific, there is no other
evidence, apart from the transcript material, relating to the circumstances and activities
within the control box on 15th April and Mr Duckenfield’s role on that day. HFSG
correspondence has pointed to Lord Justice Taylor’s conclusions in regard to the
involvement and actions of certain individuals on that day. His conclusions were
based upon a mountain of evidence which it would seem is not to be put before the
Court in the context of the present prosecution. The hearings by their very nature will
be completely different and the evidence that can be adduced in support of a private
prosecution for manslaughter will be considerably narrower than that heard by Lord
Justice Taylor.

The HFSG, in their most recent submissions dated 2 October 1998, comment on the
"Evidence against Duckenfield on Manslaughter and Misfeasance" purely by reference
to the 1989 Taylor transcript material, which of course the Director will have
considered previously in the context of the consideration of which charges, if any,
should have been brought.

On the available evidence submitted in support of the prosecution, we therefore urge
the Director to consider that there is a clear paucity of evidence relating to vital issues
that would need to be proved. As L.J. Stuart-Smith pointed out in his Scrutiny report
at para. 56:-

        "Any prosecution of an individual police officer would have to
        establish his individual responsibility. It would not be enough to prove
        the composite failure of the police operation."

Notwithstanding the comments made by HFSG (eg see para 15 Submissions 24.9.98)
any admissions of liability by South Yorkshire police in negligence proceedings can
only relate to those proceedings and South Yorkshire police. They can have no force
in relation tc the specific actions of individual officers and charges brought in separate
criminal proceedings.                  ..............

In terms, of reliability we must take issue with the observation of the HFSG (their
letter 27th July 1998) that all the facts are clear and that no-one will have forgotten.
The events in question were obviously traumatic for all concerned, and the passage of
9 years since those events is a considerable period of time. By definition, the
recollection of any relevant witnesses must be expected to have lessened either because
of the passage of time, or indeed the natural mechanism of avoidance of the memory
o f the horrific events that occurred. In those circumstances, we suggest the Director
treat with great caution the reliability of the evidence that is or may be served in
support of the prosecutions.

No evidence exists of the current ability of witnesses to recall the events and those that
were heard by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith were described by him variously as "vague
and confused" (per Miss Martin), "version changes in various ways over the years"
(per Paul Taylor) and "unable to accept Mr Holdsworth’s recollection of events as now-
being accurate". There is no reason to suspect that the memory of other witnesses is
any more reliable than those seen by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.

Misfeasance in Public Office.

As indicated by the submissions as to issue of summonses, from the HFSG, the same
facts are to be put forward in support of the allegations for this offence as for
unlawful killing. The prosecution have referred to the case of R -v- Dvtham f 1979^
69 Cr.App.R. 387 as indicating the relevant standard. Our only observation in regard
to this case in the present context is that it clearly indicates that for culpability to be
established concerning the misconduct of an officer o f justice, mere misfeasance will
not suffice, but a deliberate failure and wilful neglect will be required. We raise again
the issues as to what reliable evidence the prosecution intends to adduce to satisfy this
onerous test as indicated by the reliance o f HFSG (submissions 2/10/98) on alleged
admissions made by the Defendant in 1989 transcripts which the Director will have
considered previously. From the material we have been served with so far, we believe
the evidential test is not satisfied either on the basis of "a realistic prospect of
conviction" or in the alternative that there would be "clearly no case to answer",
justifying the Director's intervention and discontinuance.

Acting with Intent to Pervert the Course of Justice

According to the HSFG submissions as to issue of Summonses, this relates to the
alleged false and deceitful allegation by Mr Duckenfield that the gates had been
broken by the supporters. It has never been suggested that the words complained of
were ever uttered by Mr Duckenfield to anyone charged with investigating the disaster.

In terms of the evidence so far served, we point out once again that there is no
evidence apart from the transcript of the Defendants’ own evidence, regarding any
such discussion. The HFSG (submissions 2/10/98) have referred to the Taylor
evidence of the Defendant which the Director is aware of. We note that further
evidence will be called but emphasise the prosecution have not served statements from
other witnesses in relation to this charge.     —

The thrust of the recent (2/10/98) submissions appears to concern the "transmission"
of the alleged comment of the Defendant to parties who were not present at the time
the alleged words were spoken. We are bound to point out that no evidence has been
served to support the contentions made to the effect that the Defendant played any role
in the "transmissions" referred to, or in the alleged "limitation" activity (paras 5-22).
The HFSG’s critical reference to the Sharpies statements when subject to realistic
appraisal can not be justified. In the context of this charge, we submit the true import
of his recollection is that between 3 and 5 pm on the day of the event, the question
of "how" and "why" was not at the forefront of the minds of those in the control
room, who were "all deeply shaken" officers endeavouring to carry out their duties.

We think the argument is overwhelming that proper analysis of this charge cannot
satisfy either of the evidential tests that might be applied in this case and accordingly,
the DPP ought to intervene and discontinue without need to refer to public interest
issues.

Public Interest

We have noted the exchanges in correspondence between your office and the HFSG
and for the purpose o f your review would like to point out by reference to the
individual components set out in 6.4 and 6.5 of the Code our views as to the relevance
or otherwise of the public interest factors set out therein. We are o f course mindful
of the fact that this exercise is "not simply a matter of adding up the number of factors
on each side".



Conviction is likelv to result in a significant sentence.

Cases of manslaughter vary enormously and in many cases a non-custodial sentence
will be passed. We believe in all the circumstances of this case, the prospect of a
sentence of immediate imprisonment is remote. The Director will be aware that
prosecutions for involuntary manslaughter, such as in the House of Lords’ leading case
of R -v- Adomako, notwithstanding a conviction, the Court imposed a suspended
custodial sentence, as did the Court in the associated Court of Appeal decision R v
Prentice & Sullman.

A weapon was used or violence w:as threatened.

This is clearly not applicable here.

The offence was committed against a person serving the public.

Once again this is not applicable. It is relevant that the alleged offences occurred
whilst the Defendants were engaged in the conduct of their public duties.

The Defendant was In a position of authority or trust.

This strictly speaking is true, but the import of this factor is, we submit, that authority
or trust has been abused. There is no evidence that we have seen that suggests that
the Defendant in any way consciously acted so as to abuse the authority or trust placed
in him, and rather to the contrary, acted to the best of his ability to discharge his
public duty, in the most difficult of circumstances.

The evidence shows that Defendants was a ringleader or an organiser of the offence.
This clearly cannot apply.

There is evidence the offence was premeditated.

The allegations in this case relate to the actions taken by the Defendant, in a life or
death context, without lengthy time for consideration. Judgment was exercised and
decisions were taken. There can be no element of pre-meditation in the normal sense
relevant to a guilty mind.

There is evidence that the offence was carried out bv a group.

Whilst the Defendants were working together as part of an overall police operation,
we have not seen any evidence to suggest a conspiracy or joint enterprise to carry out
a criminal activity.

The victim of the offence was vulnerable, had been put in considerable fear, or had
suffered personal attack, damage or disturbance.

There can be no doubt that the loss and suffering of the deceased and others involved
in the Hillsborough disaster is a terrible tragedy. We would not wish to diminish that
in any sense but emphasise that there is no evidence that the Defendant intended to
place the victims in this situation. Rather quite the contrary all the actions that were
taken by the Defendant were taken with a view to minimising personal injury and
suffering.

The offence was motivated bv anv form of discrimination against the victims ethnic
or national origin, sex, religious beliefs, political views or sexual preference.

This cannot apply.

There is a marked difference between the actual or mental ages of the Defendants and
the victim or if there is anv element of corruption.

Whilst strictly speaking true, we cannot see that this can have any relevance in the
present circumstances.

The Defendants previous convictions/cautions are relevant to the present offence.

Once again, not applicable.

The Defendant is alleged to have committed the offence whilst under an order of the
Court.

Not applicable.

There are grounds for believing that the offence is likelv to be continued or repeated.,
for example, bv a history of recurring conduct.

The allegations of criminal offences arising out of Hillsborough are o f course in the
most unusual of circumstances. The Defendant has long since retired from
employment as a Police Officer, and there is no real possibility of a recurrence. The
circumstances, as all the subsequent inquiries have revealed, were unique.
The offence, although not serious in itself was widespread in the area where it was
committed.

The alleged offences of unlawful killing, in particular, are serious, but occurred in a
limited context in unique circumstances,. This factor is therefore not applicable.

It will be seen by reference to the foregoing comment, that the only factor tending to
support a prosecution pursuant to 6.4 of the Code is the seriousness of the charges.
It is in that light that we believe the previous enquiries, reviews and the like that have
been conducted into the events of Hillsborough are particularly relevant. Previous
correspondence with you from ourselves and the Solicitors for Mr Murray highlighted
the outcome of those reviews and the consistent conclusion, notwithstanding the real
concerns as to the events of 15th April 1989, that no good will be served by pursuing
criminal proceedings at this time. We emphasise that point in the present context.

Further wre offer the following observations with regard to the common public interest
factors that may tend against a prosecution, set out in the Code.



The Court is likelv to impose a verv small or nominal penalty.

We reiterate the comments made above in regard to 6.4(a). We think the likelihood
is, even in the event of a conviction for unlawful killing that the appropriate sentence
in this case would, effectively, be non-custodial.

The offence was committed as a result of a general mistake or misunderstanding fthese
factors must be balanced against the seriousness of the offence").

Once again we emphasise that the allegations in this case concern decisions made
under the pressure of the moment in the course of employment, at times when serious
injury and death was threatened. To prove gross negligence manslaughter, the
prosecution has an onerous burden to prove to a high standard that any negligence
ought to be considered criminally culpable. The relevant authorities (see R v
Adomako (H/Lords), R v Holloway & Others (Court of Appeal) make it clear that
mitigating circumstances are particularly relevant in this context. Furthermore the
contribution to the disaster of the unexpectedTate arrival of so many fans, the refusal
by them to heed requests to queue for entrance in an orderly manner and the physical
construction of pens on the terraces without sufficient gates to permit escape in the
event of an emergency all contributed in some way to the disaster.

The loss or harm can be described as minor and was a result of a single incident
particularly if it was caused bv misiudgment.

Once again we would not wish to diminish the suffering caused by the victims, or
others involved in the Hillsborough tragedy. We would point out, however, that the
case against the Defendant is in essence one of gross misjudgment on a singular
occasion.
There has been a long delav between the events taking place and the date o f trial.

The   offences are serious.
The   delav has been caused in part bv the Defendants.
The   offence has onlv recently come to light.
The   complexity of the offence has meant that there has been a long investigation.

It is clearly of great concern that a private prosecution is being commenced more than
9 years after 15th April 1989. The material we have been served with in support of
the prosecution in relation to the transcripts has been available since 1991 at the latest.
The 38 statements served by HFSG in our submission, firstly, do not raise any
substantial new matters that could not have been dealt with by evidence available
many years before and secondly, do not go to the heart of the cases, in respect of
unlawful killing, neglect of public duty, and perverting the course of justice as raised
before in the context of evidential issues.

Once again the seriousness of the offence is relevant, but on balance we submit this
factor should not outweigh the significance of the very considerable delay.

As we have noted the HSFG are of the view that the recollections of witnesses will
be accurate notwithstanding the passage of time. It is interesting to note that in the
context o f the Judicial Review of the inquest (which of course was a hearing on oath
before a Jury considering issues of unlawful killing) the Divisional Court, commenting
onwhether an exercise of discretion to order a fresh inquest was appropriate,
observed:

        "I have to take an objective view and I have to consider the
        interests of all concerned, including those of all the witnesses
        who would have to come along 5 years later and try to cast
        their minds back to events that they must have been trying to
        forget. Taking that objective view and considering the interests
        o f all concerned, I would in my discretion conclude that this
        was not a case in which it would be right to order a fresh
        inquest."

         - R v HM Coroner for South Yorkshire Exp Stringer & Ors. 17 BMLR 92 per
         LJ Me Cowan.

We submit similar considerations apply with greater force now that a further 5 years
has elapsed.

A prosecution is likely to have a verv bad effect on the victim’s physical and mental
health alwavs bearing in mind the seriousness of the offence.

Although some families of the deceased clearly are anxious to pursue a criminal trial
against the defendants others we suspect have been anxious to put these terrible events
behind them and will be distressed to find the facts yet again rehearsed in public and
have the memory of the disaster revisited.
(£)    The Defendant is elderlv or is. or was, at the time o f the events suffering from
       significant mental or physical ill health unless the events are serious or there is a real
       possibility that it mav be repeated.

       Crown prosecutors must balance the desirability of diverting a Defendant who is
       suffering from significant mental or physical ill health with the need to safeguard the
       general public.




(g)    The Defendant has out right the loss or harm that was caused fbut the Defendants
       must not avoid prosecution because they can pav compensation).

       This does not apply. It of course was not within the Defendant’s gift to redress the
       loss and injury suffered by the victims.

(h)    Details mav be made public that could harm sources o f information, international
       relations or national security.

       We do not suggest that this factor is applicable.

On an overview basis, therefore, our submission is that the factors contained in 6.5-when
applied to the present case against the Defendant, strongly indicate the prosecution should not
proceed in the public interest.

Further, when paragraphs 6.4 and 6.5 are looked at in conjunction, we believe the public
interest is overwhelmingly shown to be served in this case by proceedings being discontinued,
as the public interest factors tending against prosecution clearly outweigh those factors tending
in favour.

We appreciate that such a decision would cause considerable disquiet with the prosecutors,
but with respect, this is not a relevant consideration. The criminal prosecutions arising out
of Hillsborough are by their very nature unique, relating to specimen charges of manslaughter,
as well as the lesser offences, in circumstances where 96 people died. It seems clear that if
a criminal prosecution were to proceed, such a trial would not take place until more than 10
years after the events in question, and it is relevant to point out that any trial subsequent-to
April 1999 would take place against the background o f the 10 year anniversary of events
having recently passed.

We believe that the case for the Director intervening, and discontinuing proceedings pursuant
to the Prosecution o f Offences Act 1985, is in this case compelling and that the circumstances
are exceptional, and we urge the Director to so conclude prior to the next hearing of the
Magistrates Court proceedings at Leeds on 30th October. If the Director wishes to clarify any
matters arising out o f this or previous correspondence submitted on behalf of the Defendant
we would be grateful of the opportunity of confirming same. We are, of course, aware of the
significance o f this decision, and believe it entirely appropriate for the Director for clarify any
outstanding issues or concerns before a final decision is taken.

In view of the importance of the decision, we are of the view the Director is bound to give
full and detailed reasons for the decision taken addressing the issues raised by all the parties.

Accordingly, we look forward to hearing from you once the review is completed.

Yours faithfully

suggest      that     he    was warned         sbout     any       shortage      of

stewards or police on the inside of Gate C.




2:4 • It waa clearly reasonable for him to rely upon

the    experience       and       advice      of   others.          it    is   not

suggest©^      that he went against any such                        advice     and

aayoce                      in              his    position             suet    inevitably                              delegate

2:5             h e tbo disaster has been the subject of continued

examination, ovftr the last ten years it ia perhaps cot

    surprising                              that tie basic                  facts       have beea                        clearly

    established and are ,                                   as      I understand it, basically

    accepted by tie prosecution.




                    I                           r.ov move to consider tie relevant lav before

    reeving to consider ths application of the law to the

APPXtlCATIOK Off LAW TO THS FACTS

4:1     It      is   this       crucial    exercise        that    determines

whether a priaa facie case exists against Duckenfield-




        First it is clear-that a duty of care exists and

secondly, at least for the purposes o f committal it is

conceded, that the deaths resulted from his decision,

in other words for present purposes elements one and

four     ar e    agreed.           It    is element    two      that     is    tha

crucial factor in this                   case.     The prosecution -would

need     to      prove      th&t    the    decision        to   open    Gate     C

amounted         t-o a breach           of hia duty of          care.      In ny

judgement this essential 'element cannot be proved.




4:2     It is of course applying entirely false logic to

look at the consequences of the _decision and to say

that because 95 deaths resulted there must have been

a breach of M s             duty.       When the S.S. Titanic sunk in

mid-Atlantic the reaaon for the siaXing was steaming

at night in waters irhere icebergs nay be found.                              That

v$s a decision pf the captain but that decision would

not    necessarily          amount       to a breach       of his       duty    of

care.        In the light of             his     knowledge at           thetimo he

may     have     aiada      a   perfectly        reasonable       and    lawful
              d e c i s i o n w h ic h had t r a g i c c o a se < ju e n e e8 .




              4:3          I an cosacio-iB that no analogy is perfect and in

              this               case    analogies     are       particularly        dangerous.

              However I aa anxious to illustrate the fact th«t in

               lev you need, to separate the decision to open the gate

              froaa the consequences.




               4:4          in this        case Duckenfield vas told by officers

               outside the Leppinga !*aae entrance that people would

               die in the crruBh outgide unleee he opened the gate,

               la the agony of the soneat he had to sake a decision

               in       the        light    of the circumstances             as they      existed

               thea.              Judged accinst the evidence in the cess in ray

               opinion              it     cannot    fee   argued     that        that   decision

               amounted to a breach of duty.




               4;5           It ~uat be renenbarad that Duckeafield carrot be

               held vicariously liable for the failings of others.

               It ie not alleged against hiaa, aor could it be, that

               he       failed to arrange adequate policing outside the

               ground to avoid the crush of fanp developing, nor is

               it alleged, nor could it be, that hie reliance on the

                 police plan as used, in earlier raatehea aaonnted to a

                 breach of duty.           I eaphasiee that the prosecution do

                 not     rely     upon    «ither    of    these    aa    evidence       of    any

                 breach o f duty by tmckenfielti.                  They say,      in cerrain

                 circuEetances, ^jsount to a breach of duty by tha force

                 for the purposes of tha civil lax but they cannot fora

#                Dackenfield.



                 4:5      It 1e for this reason that it is possible that

                 r.eclicence could be proved for the purposes                            of the

                 civil courts while no crina could be proved against

                 any individual.             Indeed this has been recognised by

                 Lord Justice Taylor , Lord Justice Stuart-Srsitb,                            the

                 coroner and the past and preaaat D.p.p.




                  5:1     +z    follows from jay analysis of the charges                      and

                 the     evidence        in support of them that                 I an    of   r'ce

                 opinion fchaf puefcenfield has a good defence to the

                  charges.        It is never possible to be certain about any

                  litigation but X consider that an essential element of

prosecution.          Ia    rzy   opinion the nagistrate ought to

diswlsa the charges.




5.2       I have not: addressed the third elaaect that tha

Crown seed, to prove namely that the breach                   a£   duty ia

gross.This question does not                  arise if the prirsary

submission         succeeds-        Hovever   it vould be arguable

that a decision made in “the agony of ths r.onent" in

the circumstances prevailing at the tine could not

sxsoant          to gross     negligence.     Although       nerroally    a

natter       for a jury to decide it is capable of being the

basis of & submission but if this were the only basis

open      to the     defence       X vouid be      less    confident     of

success than 1 $s«




5:3       puckenfield also has open to hira strong arguments

that       the    preelection       amounts   to    an    abuse    of    the

process of tie court, that is because of the delay of

 ten years he cannot have a "fair" trial,                       that pre­

 trial publicity has ao prejudiced the potential jury

 paxrel ’that a fair trial is tot possible and that the

 trial would be oppressive.
5:4   Tb.«»a   submissions       vil'l also        forrt part      'a t    the

arguiaaate presen-ed to the luagistrate-                       The lav is.

o£ -til© submission will d«pand upo-ti rhs application, of

the facts of this esse to the lav.




5:5   Although     this     is     an    order,          to'    stay       the

proceedings, that a nagistrate can reake and in the

paat has wad© experience indicates that: decisions to

s-fcey are "ora frequently sus.de; by the trial judge than

the magistrate.




5:6   I do not consider it profitable to speculate as

to why that io bat I &a satisfied tbst in this case

very difficult to aeeess.




5:7   I h&ve     very vide- experience              in   the     field       of

criminal law and ! find much about the circumstances

of this prosecution abhorrent,                l ea afraid that it

suggests nore of a d«aire for revange than a desire

for   justice.      I     feel    that       the    media       are       being
manipulated     to    present       a. picture       adverse        to        the

last desperate throw of the dice to attempt to see

someone punished for the tragedy.

feelings     of the bereaved the 'act                remains that               no

prina facie evidence of erirae has been found against

anyone or. the day of the disaster.                That view has been

expressed     to     the   Ho-aee     of    Coitrsons     by      the      Hone

Secretary end tha Attorney-General.                  It is a view that

with r*spect I share for the reasons aet out in this

    Meeting of the Authority

    The details are noted.

    The role of the HFSG

    We note the intended course. You will appreciate from our previous correspondence and
    discussions that it has been our view at all times that the role of HFSG in this matter has
    been entirely questionable and we would not agree that it would be appropriate for them to
    attend the meeting.

    South Sefton

    We have provided previous details with our earlier correspondence.

    We enclose herewith a copy of the letter of 11 February, and a copy of our terms of
    engagement. The latter correspondence is provided strictly on a confidential basis. We do
    not believe any other parties, save your client, are entitled to this document, and would be
    grateful if the document could be treated on that basis. If it is intended that this document
    should come into the public domain we would be grateful if you could advise us by return.

    Costs

    We have dealt with this matter as far as we can. You will appreciate that in due course
    detailed bills of costs will be drawn, but this will involve a great deal of time and costs from

let us know, and in addition we would be grateful for your advice about whether the
attendance of Mr Williams at the meeting would be of assistance to your client.

Legitimate expectation

We are surprised that this issue has now been raised, for we fail to see how there can be
doubt that our client has had a legitimate expectation to have his fees paid on the basis of
the letter of 5 March 1998 from the Clerk and the Treasurer. The letter expresses the
position clearly, Mr Duckenfield engaged us on a private basis, and from that time until the
correspondence from the Police Authority early in January, it was understood that, subject
to proper reporting and approval, we would take all necessary steps to provide proper legal
assistance to him as necessary relating to and arising out of the criminal prosecution.

This is the first express suggestion that we have had that the Authority may not wish to
honour the commitment made in the previous correspondence, notwithstanding that the
legal power issue has been resolved in favour of making the payment. We request your
specific advice by return as.to the reason for this change and how it is that you say the
A u tho rity is not committed to making the payment, if that is the present position.

Legal aid

Walker Morris have been in contact with the Clerk to the Magistrates Court and we
understand they are confirming details. We can confirm that on the basis of the
understanding that the question of funding has to be finally resolved with the Authority, Mr
Duckenfield has not at this time made a legal aid application. It is, of course, not open to
him to make an application for retrospective assistance.

Our client's financial resources

We are providing the following information subject to your absolute assurance that this
information will be treated with the utmost confidence, and not be brought into the public
domain nor conveyed to HFSG. We would expect that the detail is not referred to in any
public forum.




                                             2

    We have set out the position previously in regard to the potential legal aid implications. In
    the event that South Yorkshire Police Authority does not resolve to provide financial
    assistance for Mr Duckenfield’s legal costs, the clear implication is that Mr Duckenfield
    will suffer considerable financial hardship, and that his economic resources will be greatly
    depleted without any real prospect of rebuilding them.

    Opinion of Counsel

    In our previous letter we asked for clarification as to what matters required attention from
    Counsel, given that both ourselves and Walker Morris have provided copies of the detailed
    submissions to the DPP which dealt largely with evidentiary matters. In view of your
    comment that you "remain of the view that the material does not meet our requirements”,
    we have referred to Counsel as a matter of urgency, to see if it is possible to provide further
    submissions by the Tuesday deadline.

    In regard to fees, we are bound to raise the question as to the costs involved generally in


•
    regard to these submissions and the attendance at the Authority’s meeting. The solicitors
    for both defendants are being put to a great deal of trouble in satisfying new requirements
    that have been raised by the Police Authority since January 1999 in regard to funding
    matters. In our view it is entirely proper therefore that in the event that the Authority
    resumes financial assistance to Mr Duckenfield, it also agrees to pay the reasonable costs
    associated with dealing with the Authority’s queries and requests since January 1999 on
    funding issues generally up to and including representations made in respect of and
    attendance at the forthcoming meeting.

    You will appreciate from this and previous correspondence that we are doing all that we can
    to satisfy your requests for information. If there are any other potential concerns that you
    have in regard to the funding issues, we naturally request the opportunity to address those in
    good time for the meeting to ensure that the Authority arrives at a fully informed decision,
    whilst maintaining the opportunity for the Defendants to make proper submissions on all
    relevant matters.

    We await your further advice accordingly.

    Yours faithfully

    Dear Mr Duckenfield,

    Re: Hilllsborough Disaster

    This letter is to confirm your instructions to act in regard to uhe Hillsborough matter generally
    and accordingly, I enclose herewith a Memorandum pursuant to the Law Society’s Practice
    Rule 15, and a copy of our terms of engagement. I already have your letter of 27th March
    on file which kindly confirms your wish for the firm to act on your behalf.

    T h e sta n d a r d t e r m s are a m e n d e d a s f o l l o w s :

    2.         B i l l s to b e r e n d e r e d q u a r te r ly .


    You will understand that accordingly, you are our client, notwithstanding previous instructions
    received from S o u t h Yorkshire Police, and notwithstanding the agreement you have with
    S o u t h Yorkshire with regard t o reimbursement of legal costs incurred. If you require any
    clarification on this aspect please do not hesitate to telephone.

    I am enclosing an Authority for you to sign for Eversheds, and will make contact with Paul
    Isaacs' clerk shortly.

    We have of course chatted about the general outline of anticipated events, and will endeavour
    to deal with any eventualities as quickly and as effectively as possible to protect your

    Winckworth & Pemberton is extremely keen to bring together all the best elements o f a team
    effort to protect your interests, although we hope of course that our involvement on major
    scale will not be required.

    Dear Sirs
W
    R -V- SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY

    We acknowledge receipt o f your letter of the 12th May.

    1.      M eeting o f Authority. We note the date and time and await details o f the
            venue. It would be intended that our Mr. Richard Manning will attend to
            make the oral submission and we note the request for a written submission.

    2.      Role o f H.F.S.G. Having regard to the comments made in the Divisional
            Court to Mr. Alan Jones, Q.C. namely “what are you doing here” we are
            surprised that you are even asking H.F.S.G. whether in the circumstances
            they believe it appropriate to question the use of Public Funds for the funding
            o f our Client. We reserve our position as to what action we will take if
            H.F.S.G. indicate a wish to attend and to make representations,'and you
            allow them to do so.

    3.      South Sefton. Attached is a copy of the letter o f the 11th February 1999.
            The Magistrates’ Clerk at South Sefton has not made a final decision because
            it w ill depend upon your decision. If, as we expect, the Police Authority
            confirms the continuation of funding to our Client from the 12th January, and
            ongoing, then we think it very likely that the Clerk at South Sefton will
            confirm the decision he has provisionally reached, and in which event both
            ourselves and Winckworth Sherwood (who are m an identical position) would
            want to jointly mount an application for Judicial Review o f that decision.

    4.      Costs.

             4.1                    The Schedule that we have provided to you post the 12th January is
                                    for the most part work on the two Judicial Review Applications.
                                    You know the date that we made an application in relation to the
                                    funding, which was precipitated by the challenge from H.F.S.G. to
                                    the locus o f the Chief Constable.




           A lis t of:t>< p< irt*rn,' n a n n /; open te i.L fn 'tw r t a t th : u b o v t id d r r tt.    b y T h e L w i See\*ty in th e w n d u c t i f
                                                               Messrs. Garretts
                                                                14 May 1999
                                                                        Page 2



4.2     That necessitated the Application and we had to do a bundle of
         documents because of it. Up to that time the majority o f the work
         had been in relation to the Application for Judicial Review o f the
         D.P.P.’s decision. It is going to be impossible within the timeframe
         to extract detail of what work was done in relation to each o f those
         two Applications. The best guesstimate is that taking things as a
         round, possibly slightly more was done in relation to the
         D.P.P.Application because we had the conduct of it as the Applicant,
         and because it was over a longer period o f time.

4.3     Notwithstanding the fact of the communication o f the 1 2 th January,
         there has obviously been work done in relation to the Magistrates
         Court proceedings and the prosecution, our best estimate is that
         probably about 15% o f the costs would fall into that category. You
         are aware that there have been Magistates Court hearings on the 1st
         March, 2nd March, 26th April and of course last Monday the 10th
        May and we are back on the 24th May, but neither o f those are in
        the schedule.

4.4     If there had not been the intervention by H.F.S.G.so that funding
         had continued uninterrupted then insofar as the Order for costs
         obtained against Ann Adlington is concerned, we would have
         proceeded to tax the bill and reimburse the Authority for that
         portion of the costs that were recoverable against her as against the
         charging rate agreed with the Authority, and that in our view is the
         sensible way to deal with the matter in any event.

4.5     We have heard nothing from the D.P.P. and therefore do not
        propose to make an approach to ask them about the level o f their
        costs just in case they forget about them.

4.6     We will have a look at the disbursements between the bill to the
        Clerk to the Justices at South Sefton and the amounts in the
        enclosures to our letter of the 29th April and try to resolve this, but
        that is not an insurmountable problem between us.

Funding from Police Superintendents’ Association. We do challenge the
relevance of this information. However again we would not want your
Members to feel that this is in any way controversial as between the
Authority and ourselves. Thus although we reserve our position as to whether
there is entitlement, the money from the Superintendents’ Association would
only be provided up to a maximum o f £20,000 if the Police Authority
refused to provide the funding requested, and further insofar as it may be
necessary to meet any shortfall that may arise either in whole or in part in
                                                              Messrs. Garretts
                                                               14 May 1999
                                                                       Page 3


relation to the Order for costs against Adlington. In short therefore it is an
amount that only would become available by way of indemnity if all else
fails.

Legitimate Expectation. We have to fundamentally disagree with you on the
way in which you put this matter. In our view there is a contractual position
between the Authority, our Client and ourselves in relation to costs. Having
regard to that authority given and only stopped on the basis that you were not
certain that your Clients had power to grant that authority, and having now
been told that they did indeed have power, it would be in our view
Wednesbury unreasonable and Padfield perverse for the funding decision not
to be confirmed from the 12th January and not to be met to the 12th January.

Legal Aid. The Clerk to the Justices will not determine a Legal Aid
Application unless the Policy Authority refuse to grant funding. There is no
fresh Application, the original Application is held in abeyance on this basis.
                                                                     Messrs.Garretts
                                                                      14 May 1999
                                                                             Page 4




9.      Opinion of Counsel. We appreciate that the written Opinion was not long, but
        it very powerfully repeated the view of two eminent Q.C.’s that there is not
        any reasonable prospect o f a conviction. We will deal with Counsels’fee
        notes separately with you.

10.     General. It would seem to us that there is no way in which the Authority can
        refuse to meet costs for the period for which they have committed
        themselves, and indeed that goes to the date o f the meeting where they
        actually made the decision. Having now been told that they were empowered
        to grant funding, they should continue that funding on the same basis as
        previously agreed. We would view it as entirely responsible that the
        Authority should want to know of any material change in the view of
        Solicitors and the two Q.G’s. A prudent course would be therefore to grant
        funding up to the date of the conclusion of the committal proceedings. If o f
        course the case is not committed to the Crown Court, then no further decision
        is likely to have to be made by the Authority. If on the other hand the case
        is committed, then the Authority would be justified in asking for further
        advices from Leading Counsel, with an estimate o f the costs that were likely
        to be incurred. For our own part we would have no objection to a quarterly
        review so long as absolute confidentiality could be guaranteed.

Dear Sirs
                                                                               S
                        ADUNGTON -V- DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY


        I refer to our earlier correspondence in this matter and apologise for the delay in
reaching a conclusion. I have once more perused Che decision in R. -v- Miller and although I
accept that the situation is arguable, 1reach the provisional conclusion that the defendants have
not themselves incurred costs.

         However, I have now become aware both through the national news and other media
that the South Yorkshire Police Authority has decided to reverse its earlier decision and has
withdrawn funding for the defendants. I am also aware that this decision is to be challenged
by judicial review, ffthat challenge is unsuccessful, then any argument which I might have that
the Police Authority are responsible for the defendants’costs would fall. Accordingly, Ipropose
to await the outcome of those judicial review proceedings before I make a final decision.



                                        Yours faithfully,




                                    Clerk to the Justices.

Dear Sirs

R -V- SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY EX PARTE CHIEF
CONSTABLE OF SOUTH YORKSHIRE

We have spoken to Counsel at length this morning with, regard to the comments that you
have made about his opinion. He cannot understand why there should be any criticism
o f the joint opinion just because of its length and particularly when you also have the
detailed submissions made to the Director o f Public Prosecutions. Nonetheless if there
arc matters where further clarification is sought, he is prepared to speak to Counsel
instructed by you on the Telephone today to deal with any such matters. If no such
conversation takes place then we will assume that the pcrccivcd problem no longer
exists. We understand that you arc also going to get an additional written opinion from
Mr William Clegg QC.

Yours faithfully

Dear Member

SPECIAL MEETING ON HILLSBOROUGH: FRIDAY, 5 FEBRUARY 1999

Enclosed are papers for discussion. You should already have received formal notice of
the meeting, which will commence at 9.30 am, at the Old Grammar School. Barnsley. A
map is enclosed. This venue has been chosen because of the need to provide separate
facilities for the various parties who may attend, and the unavailability on the day of other
public meeting facilities.

Enclosed is an introductory report from myself, which attaches:-

1            A detailed report prepared by Garretts, the Authority’s independent legal advisers
             on this matter.

2            A report from the Chief Constable.

Questions from the press and public

W e can expect media interest in the run-up to Friday’s meeting, and the matter will be
raised by one of the Liverpool MPs during a Parliamentary debate on police funding on
Thursday. The legal issues on powers are complex, and great care must be taken in
commenting on anything connected with the criminal proceedings. If you are approached
by the media or the public therefore, l would suggest that the response remains as
follows:-

             ‘A number of issues have been raised about the Police Authority’s decision to meet
             the defence costs of former officers in legal proceedings. This is a complex area.
             The Authority has sought legal advice on the issues, and the meeting on Friday will
             be to discuss the outcome of that advice.”
The question of costs may arise, and the extent to which this has affected current policing
resources in South Yorkshire. The suggested response to this is that the costs are being
paid out of the reserves which the Police Authority carries to cover unforeseen
contingencies. In this way it has not directly affected spending levels in 1998/99 or
1999/2000.

District Auditor

I have been keeping the District Auditor fully up to day with what is happening. As
suggested at the last meeting, I have issued an invitation to him to attend on Friday, but
he has not decided whether it is necessary for him to do so.

I hope these notes are helpful. If, on reading the detailed papers, you have any
questions, please contact me and I will do my best to help.

Yours sincerely




Bill Wilkinson
Clerk and Treasurer
EXCLUSION OF PUBLIC AND PRESS

That, under Section 100A(4) of the Local
Government Act 1972, the public be excluded
from the meeting for the following items of
business on the grounds that they involve the
likely disclosure of exempt information as
defined in paragraphs 5 and 12 of Part 1 of
Schedule 12A of the Act.

RE: SPECIAL POLICE AUTHORITY MEETING - BARNSLEY COLLEGE (OLD
GRAMMAR/HIGH STREET SCHOOL SITE)

Enclosed is a location plan of the Old Grammar/High School Site of Barnsley College.
Highlighted in Green is the Town Hall and Regent Street, on which the Joint Secretariat
Offices are located.

The Old Grammar/High School is located on the A635, Huddersfield Road from Barnsley.
When standing at the top of Regent Street, facing the Town Hall, the main road going to
the right is Church Street, and Huddersfield Road is a straightforward continuation of
Church Street.

Follow Huddersfield Road out of Barnsley for approximately 1 mile. The Old
Grammar/High School is located on the right hand side and is marked Barnsley College,
Huddersfield Road Site. When passing through Barnsley Centre, signs indicate “Barnsley
College, All Sites”. Shortly after leaving the Town Centre the signs change to “Barnsley
College, Huddersfield Road Site”.

Please eriter the site at the second entrance. After entering proceed along the roadway
and follow it around to the left following the sign for the student car parking. There should
be adequate spaces available and in this car park permits are not required.

capacity at the Hillsborough Football Stadium from approximately 3.23 pm to
6.30 am the next day. Although the South Yorkshire Ambulance Service was
not called to give evidence to the Taylor Inquiry, Trent Regional Health
Authority volunteered to give evidence. I assisted in co-ordinating the
submissions and also made a personal statement. This statement did not
however form part of the eventual submissions made to the Inquiry. I have
discussed this matter with the Authority’s legal advisors and I do not consider
I have a substantial private or personal interest in the matters now before the
Authority and I therefore propose to take part in today’s discussions.

Report of the Clerk and Treasurer

HILLSBOROUGH : FINANCING OF DEFENCE COSTS OF FORMER
OFFICERS

1     Matter for consideration

To report legal advice received from Independent Solicitors appointed to act
for the Authority on the provision of financial assistance for legal proceedings
against David Duckenfield and Bernard Murray.


       2      Recommendation

       The Authority is asked to give consideration to the advice
       received in the attached report.


3     Background

3.1   Attached to this introductory report are two papers:-

       (i)    A detailed report prepared by Garretts, the Authority’s legal
              advisers in this matter.     (Members will recall that, as the
              potential challenges related to decisions taken in the context of
              the Authority’s own advice, it was felt that in order to avoid the
              risk of further procedural challenges, it would be advantageous
              to appoint independent advice). Garretts will be in attendance
              at the meeting.

       (ii)   A report prepared by the Chief Constable.

3.2   It has become clear over the last two weeks in responding to the
       questions which have been raised, that there are two separate issues:-

      Firstlv. the existence and extent of the powers available to Police
      Authorities to support the legal costs of Police Officers in legal
      proceedings; and

       Secondly, the way in which the powers should be exercised.

      Garrett’s advice is to separate the two issues, and the report to today’s
      meeting focusses primarily on powers. It refers to the advice sought
      from Counsel and Leading Counsel by the Authority prior to Garretts’
      appointment, and further advice from Leading Counsel obtained by
      Garretts.

3.3   Financial implications : Potential legality issues

      The questions raised by the Hillsborough Family Support Group in
      December 1998 and January 1999 introduced issues of potential
      legality. Following advice from Counsel and Leading Counsel on 5
      and 12 January respectively, and acting on the advice of the
      Authority’s legal adviser, I informed the relevant parties on 13 January
      that the Authority would not be in a position to make further payments
      subject to the satisfactory resolution of the matter.

      The District Auditor has been kept fully up to date on the situation, and
      has been given copies of today’s agenda and reports.

          KEEP THIS REPORT SECURE AND DISCUSS ITS CONTENTS WITH NO-ONE

          i)         the decisions taken in principle on 2711' February 1998 to provide financial

                      certain criminal proceedings taken against them and to review and decide
                      whether to reverse or confirm those decisions;

          ii)        further applications for financial assistance from Mr David Duckenfield and
                      Mr Bernard Murray to meet their respective legal costs and disbursements in
                      proposed proceedings for judicial review of:

                      a.         the decision of the Crown Prosecution Scrvice not to intervene to take
                                  over the conduct of the private prosecutions brought against them by
                                  Ms Ann Adlir.gton, Solicitor, on behalf of the Hillsborough Family
                                  Support Group ("HFSG");

                      b          an adverse ruling by the Clerk to the South Sefton Justices on claims
                                  made for the payment of costs from central funds;

          iii)        written representation submitted by Ms Adlington, on behalf of the HFSG,
                      to the Authority;

          RECOMMENDATIONS

          1.      In the light of legal advice, including advice from leading Counsel, members
                   are recommended to resolve that on balance, the Authority has no legal power
                   to provide financial assistance to Mr David Duckenfield or Mr Bernard Murray
                   in relation to their costs and expenses of defending the private prosecutions
                   brought against them by the H1;SG, by Information dated 10 July 1998, and
                   accordingly to determine that any previous decision of the Authority, or any

        officer acting under its authority, to make such assistance available is null and
        void.

2.      In the light of legal advice, including advice from leading Counsel, members
        are recommended to resolve that, on balance, the Authority has no legal power
         to provide financial assistance to Mr David Duckenfield or Mr Bernard Murray
        in relation to the costs of any judicial review proceedings brought by either of
         them; whether relating to the decision of die Crown Prosecution Service not to
         take over the conduct cf the private prosecutions and discontinue such
        prosecutions, or to any decision of the Clerk to the Sefton Magistrates1Court to
        challenge the payment of the officers' costs of proceedings before that court
        from central funds, or to any other decision of any court, authority or body
        arising from such prosecutions; and, accordingly, to reject the applications of
        Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray for financial assistance in relation to such
        proceedings.

3.      In recognition of the fact that the legal advice provided to the Authority is that
        it remains arguable that power exists to provide die assistance referred to in 1
        and 2 above, to take such action as the Clerk and Treasurer, in consultation
        with the Chief Constable, the Authority's legal advisers and the Chairman of
        the Authority, may decide as appropriate to have the decisions referred to in 1
        and 2 reviewed by the High Court and to expedite such review with a view to
        clarifying the Authority's powers in this regard,

4.      To defer consideration of the procedural issues raised by Ms Adlington, in her
        letters of 22 December 1998 to the Clerk and Treasurer and 5 January 1999 to
        the members of the Authority, until the legal power of the Authority to provide
        tlte financial assistance referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 has been resolved to
        the satis faction of the Authority.

                      DECISIONS/EVENTS POST IS APRIL 1989

         1.           17 April 1989; Lord Justice Taylor was appointed "to carry out an inquiry into
                      die events at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground on 15 April 1989 and to
                      make recommendations about the needs of crowd control and safety at sports
                      events”.

         2.           17 April 1989: Geoffrey Dear QPM, Chief Constable of West Midlands Police,
                      appointed to carry out independent investigation of the disaster and gather
                      evidence.

         3.          19 April 1989; West Midlands Police assume responsibility for the inquiry.

         4.          HM Coroner opens and adjourns inquests on 95 deaths that occurred at
                      Hillsborough.

         5;          4 August 1989: Lord Justice Taylor's interim Report made public. The then
                      Chief Constable, Peter Wright, referred the questions of manslaughter, by
                      criminal negligence, to the Director of Public Prosecutions for a decision as to
                      criminal liability.

         6.           15 August 1989: Director of Public Prosecutions recommended that the matter
                     should be subject of a full criminal investigation. Mr Dear, Chief Constable of
                      West Midlands Police, invited to undertake this investigation. Also asked that
                     if he discovers any matters against the Police (Discipline) Regulations, he
                     enquires into them on behalf of South Yorkshire Police.

         7.    30 November 1989: Peter Wright, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police,
                offers in conjunction with insurers to open negotiations with representatives of
                 the bereaved to tesolve all bona fide civil claims for compensation without
                having to await the outcome of legal hearings.

         8.    15 December 1989: Agreement reached with representatives of tine bereaved for
                settlement of civil actions without a decision as to liability.

         9.    Full criminal and disciplinary investigation formally commenced.

         10. 18 January 1990: Lord Justice Taylor's Final Report is published.

         11. 31 March 1990 Mr Dear’s report is submitted to Director of Public Prosecutions,

         12. 30 August 1990 Director of Public Prosecutions, Allan Green QC, concludes
                 that there is insufficient evidence upon which a prosecution for manslaughter,
                 or any other criminal offence, could be brought against any officer in the South
                 Yorkshire Police, or any other person,

         13. 19 November 1990 to 28 March 1991HM Coroner resumes inquests on 95
                 deaths in the Hillsborough Disaster. Jury returns a verdict of accidental death.

         14. 7 December 1990: South Yorkshire Police Authority approves financial
                 assistance for 6 officers including Mr David Duckinfield and Mr Bernard
                 Murray in connection with legal proceedings relating to the inquest.

         15. 7 May 1991 the Police Complaints Authority recommend disciplinary any
                 charges be brought against Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and
                Superintendent Murray.

         16. 11 July 1991 the Police Complaints Authority direct that Chief Superintendent
                 Duckenfield should face four discipline charges of Neglect of Duty and one of
                 Discreditable Conduct. In addition. Superintendent Murray should face one
                charge of Neglect of Duty.

         17. November 1991 Chief Superintendent Duckenfield retires on medical grounds.

         18. 13 January 1992 Police Complaints Authority gives leave not to proceed with
                 the discipline charge against Superintendent Murray, as it would be
                inappropriate and unjust to pursue the charge against him alone, in the absence
                of his superior officer.

        19.   26 August 1992 Superintendent Murray retires on medical grounds.

        20. The relatives of six deceased are granted an application for judicial review into
              tine inquest verdicts. They sought certiorari to quash the jury's verdict.

        21. The judicial review concludes that the inquest verdicts were correct.

        22. Inquest held by HM Coroner for West Yorkshire into the death of Anthony
              Bland (the 96thvictim of Hillsborough). A verdict of accidental death was
              returned.

        23.   5 December 19% the drama "Hillsborough’1written by Jimmy McGovern on
              behalf of Gtanada Television, is broadcast on the 1TV Network. Following this
              programme further material is submitted to the Home Office. Those
               representations related in particular to video evidence of the disaster and
               medical evidence about the time of death of the victims.

        24.   30 June 1997 the Home Secretary made an oral statement to the House of
              Commons during the course of which he stated:



                     "Madam Speaker, my Department, the office of the Attorney General and
                     the Crown Prosecution 5crvfce have considered very carefully all the
                     evidence which has been put forward in recent months.


                     The Director of Public Prosecutions has taken the view that the material
                     so far presented to her would not justify fresh criminal investigations.
                     The then Attorney General also took the view, again on the material
                     presented to him, that any application to the High Court for a new
                     inquest would not have any realistic prospect of succeeding.


                     Nonetheless, I am acutely conscious that the families of those who died at
                     Hillsborough and many others including Hon Members of this House are
                     very concerned that unresolved issues remain. I am determined to go as
                     far as I can to ensure that no matter of significance is overlooked and that
                     we do not reach a final conclusion without a full and independent
                     examination of the evidence.


                     I can therefore tell the House today that the Attorney General, the
                     Director of Public Prosecutions and I have agreed that it is in the public

                         whether there now exists any new evidence relating to the disaster which
                         was not previously available. We are appointing Lord Justice Stuart-
                         Smith, a senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal, for that purpose".

         25.     18 February 1998, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's Scrutiny Report is presented to
                 the House of Commons. He concluded that:

                 251 there was no basis upon which there should be a further judicial inquiry
                         or a reopening of Lord Taylor's Inquiry;

                 25.2. there was no basis for a renewed application to the Divisional Court or
                         for die Attorney General to exercise his powers under the Coroners Act
                         1988;

                 25.3 he did rvot consider there was any material which should be pul before
                         the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints Authority
                         which might cause them to reconsider decisions they had already taken.

         B       APPLICATIONS FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE


         1       INTRODUCTION

         1.1     Applications have been submitted to the Authority by Mr David Duckenfield
                 and Mr Bernard Murray, formerly a Chief Superintendent and Superintendent
                 respectively in the South Yorkshire Police Force, for financial assistance to meet
                 the costs of their legal representation in three different sets of legal proceedings
                 which will be referred to as "the Criminal Proceedings", wthe CPS proceedings",
                 and "the Sefton proceedings" in dtis report. The Criminal Proceedings take the
                 form of private prosecutions by the HFSG relating to actions which the officers
                 took whilst on duty at Hillsborough Stadium, on 15th April 1989. The HFSG
                 alleges that those actions led to the deaths of certain fans attending a match
                 between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest football clubs.            The other two
                 proceedings would, if launched, arise out of the criminal proceedings.


         2     THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS

         2.1     The criminal prosecutions brought by Ms Adlington, the solicitor representing
                 the HF5G, charge Messrs Duckenfleld and Murray with the manslaughter of

                Hillsborough disaster and also with wilful neglect to perform a public duty. In
                addition, Mr Duckenfield faces a charge of intentionally perverting the course
                of justice in lying about the circumstances in which Gate C at Hillsborough
                Stadium became open.

         2.2    The essence of the manslaughter and wilful neglect charges appear to be that,
                being in a position of responsibility for ground safety, both officers allegedly
                acted with recklessness or gross negligence in failing to take, demand or
                recommend obvious steps to avoid the overcrowding which led to the
                Hillsborough disaster and in taking steps which added to the danger.

         2.3    The essence of the charge of perverting the course of justice is that Mr
                 Duckenfield allegedly misled Mr Graham Kelly and Mr Glen Kirton of the
                 Football Association and Mr Graham Mackrell of Sheffield Wednesday Football
                 Club about the reasons for the disaster by claiming that Gate C had been forced
                 by supporters, knowing this not to be the case, and with intent to disguise the
                 real cause of die Hillsborough disaster from any ensuing Investigations on
                 judicial proceedings.

         2.4    All charges, if proven, are potentially punishable with imprisonment, at the
                 discretion of the courts, and the charges of wilful neglect to perform a public
                 duty and intentionally perverting the course of justice are, if proven, also
                 potentially punishable by any fine the court considers appropriate.

         2.5    The committal proceedings, at which Leeds Magistrates' Court will decide
                 whether there is sufficient evidence against the two officers to justify a full
                 criminal trial, is scheduled for early April 1999.

         2.6    Copies of relevant correspondence relating to the applications submitted by Mr
                 Duckenfield and Mr Murray, which were supported by the Chief Constable, are
                 attached at Appendices B1 and B2, As previously reported, the Clerk and
                 Treasurer acting on behalf of the Authority (and on the basis of advice from the
                 Assistant Clerk and Solicitor) approved the provision of financial assistance to
                 meet such reasonable expenses as the officers might incur in defending the
                 criminal proceedings.

         2.7    The Authority has already paid £11,824 costs of the criminal proceedings
                 (inclusive of VAT) to the solicitors representing Mr Duckenfield. A further
                 invoice for £34,492.16 (inclusive of VAT) for work up to 18th September 1998 has

       been submitted by Mr Duckenfield's solicitors but not paid by the Authority.
       No invoices have, to date, been submitted by Mr Murray's solicitor.


3     THE CPS PROCEEDINGS

3.1    The Director of Public Prosecutions under the Prosecution of OHences Act 1985,
       hfis a discretion, but not a duty, to take over the conduct of private
       prosecutions. Having taken over such proceedings he may under Section 23 of
       the 1985 Act discontinue proceedings if the evidence is insufficient or if the
       proceedings would be contrary to the public interests or to avoid duplication or
       for any other good reason.

3.2    In July 1998, the solicitors acting for Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray wrote to
       the Crown Prosecution Service asking it to take over the criminal proceedings
       brought against their respective clients by Ms Adlington on behalf of the HFSG.

3.3    On the 18 November 1998, die Crown Prosecution Service notified the solicitors
       that, having considered the evidence, the representations made by the parties
       and all the surrounding circumstances, it had decided not to intervene to take
       over any of tine charges.          The Crown Prosecution Service has still, as at 1
       February 1999, not provided the reasons for this decision, despite an
       undertaking to do so "in January 1999".

3.4    Both Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray have obtained advice from Leading
       Counsel regarding the prospects of making a successful application for judicial
       review of the decision of the Crown Prosecution not to intervene, Details of the
       advice they have each received, as provided to die Authority, appear at
       Appendices B3 and B4 together with relevant correspondence received from
       their respective solicitors both making and supporting the officers' applications
       for financial assistance to meet their legal costs and disbursements in relation to
      judicial review proceedings.            The basis of the challenge is that by not
       intervening the CPS has allowed prosecutions to continue where there is "no
       realistic prospect of prosecution" contrary to the terms of the Code for Crown
       Prosecutors.

3.5    The cost estimate of taking such proceedings given by the solicitors acting for
       Mr Duckenfield is in the region of £10,000 - £15,000. The cost estimate given by
       the solicitors acting for Mr Murray is in the region of £15,000 taking into
       account travel costs.       The risk of having to meet the costs of the Crown
      Prosecution Service should also be taken into account (because the officers'


i\GAnaert\xiinnroitmmi!rcua!ns-i»m.t>oc
                  application may fall). Counsel has advised that it could be expected that the
                  latter costs would be lower than those of the officers' independent solicitors
                  and that it is unlikely that there would be two sets of costs awarded against the
                  officers, if unsuccessful.


       4        THE SEFTON PROCEEDINGS

       4.1The Criminal Proceedings above were initially commenced                              in the South Sefton
                  Magistrates' Court,                        However, as the alleged offences were not committed
                  within that area and neither defendant resides within that Court's area, the
                  officers1 solicitors objected to the prosecution being undertaken at that Court.
                  Those objections were upheld by the Court and an order was made for the
                  payment of the defendants' costs from central funds. The Clerk to the Justices
                  has now questioned the claims which have been submitted for the officers'
                  costs because the Authority has agreed to fund their legal representation (but
                  the Clerk has not yet made a final ruling).The applications made for funding
                  to pursue a challenge to an adverse decision are included within the papers
                  which are attached as Appendices B3 and B4.

       4.2        The solicitors representing Mr Duckenfield have provided a cost estimate of
                  £5,000 to £7,500,                      Again the risk of the respondent's costs being awarded
                  against Messrs Duckenfield and Murray must be borne in mind.

 c       DECISION MAKING PROCESS TO DATE


 1       MATTERS TO BE CONSIDERED BY THE AUTHORITY

 1.1     In deciding whether to meet the legal costs of former Chief Superintendent
         David Duckenfield and former Superintendent Bernard Murray, (whether in
         relation to the criminal proceedings or any of the other potential proceedings
         referred to above) the Authority is subject to the public law principles of
         decision making. Briefly, these are that it must (amongst other tilings):

          •    act within whatever statutory powers are conferred upon it by Act of
               Parliament;

          •    act with procedural fairness;

          •    take all relevant considerations into account;

          •    ignore all irrelevant considerations;

          •    not act irrationally;

          •    not fetter its discretion;

          •    not unlawfully delegate the decision making function.

1.2      Failure to comply with any of these principles w ill expose the decision to
        challenge by judicial review.

1.3     The decision making process to date in respect of financial assistance to Mr
        Duckenfield and Mr Murray has been as follows:


2       MEETING OF THE POLICE AUTHORITY ON 1st AUGUST 1997

2.1     At this meeting, the Clerk and Treasurer and the Chief Constable submitted a
        joint report informing members of the appointment of Lord Justice Stuart-
        5mith to conduct a scrutiny into aspects of the Hillsborough disaster.

2.2     At that meeting, the Authority made die following resolutions:

                "1 - That approval be given to the provision of up to £300,000 from
                reserves for expenditure likely to be Incurred in respect of the scrutiny,



j\t:Arir.irrT\soirn(YohK3iimEroucc^rN-050(i,ooc
                   2 - That approval be given to a commitment to provide financial
                   assistance for legal representation for officers (serving and retired) in
                   connection with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's scrutiny in accordance with
                   the principles set out in the Home Office Circular 77/87 Financial
                   Assistance to Police Officers in Legal Proceedings.

                   3 - That the Clerk and Treasurer be authorised to determine individual
                   applications for financial assistance in consultation with the Chief
                   Constable".


3         MEETING OF THE POLICE AUTHORITY ON 27™ FEBRUARY 1998

3.1      Shortly after tine presentation of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's scrutiny report to
          the House of Commons, the members of the Authority agreed to consider an
          item relating to Hillsborough. Assistant Chief Constable Dairies gave an oral
          report to the Authority on the findings of the Scrutiny and advised members
          that private prosecutions                     had been threatened against three officers. The
          general issue of the provision of financial assistance to the officers concerned
         was addressed.                It was           recognised that   actual decisions about financial
         support could be made only on individual application.                            Members were
         accordingly invited to delegate the determination of individual applications to
          the Clerk and Treasurer. Members resolved as follows;

                   "1 - That in the light of the findings of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's inquiry
                   and his comments on the outcome, members do not believe there is any
                   new evidence to cause them to reconsider the Authority’s previous view,
                   and remain of the opinion that the officers acted in good faith.

                   2 - That the Authority agrees to authorise the Clerk and Treasurer to
                   consider applications for financial assistance from officers (serving and
                   retired) in accordance with the provisions of Home Office Circular 77/87,
                   Financial Assistance to Police Officers in Legal Proceedings".

3.2         On 28 February 1998, Mr Duckcnfield applied to Assistant Chief Constable
         Dairies Daines for financial assistance from the Authority for legal
         representation. On 2«» March 1998, Assistant Chief Constable Daines wrote to
         the Clerk and Treasurer asking them to approve Mr Duckenfield's request At
         the request of the Authority's solicitor, Ms Maureen Oades, Assistant Chief
         Constable Daines provided supporting information on 5‘h March 1998 to the
         Clerk and Treasurer. These letters are attached at Appendix Bl. Following

            receipt of this letter, the Clerk and Treasurer approved Mr Duckenfield's
            application towards the costs of legal representation in the event of a private
            prosecution being brought against him in connection with the Hillsborough
            disaster.


4          MEETING OF THE POLICE AUTHORITY ON 24th APRIL 1998

            On 24th April, the Chief Constable and Clerk and Treasurer submitted a joint
            report to members requesting that members note the expenditure of £11,900 on
             the Chief Constable's costs in connection with the Scrutiny from the earmarked
            reserve and requesting members to agree that the earmarked reserve continue
            to be held for purposes related to the Hillsborough disaster. The Authority
            resolved as follows:

                         "1 - That the use of the funds to date be noted.

                        2 - That the Authority agree, for the time being, to maintain the
                        earmarked reserve for future costs associated with the Hillsborough
                        Stadium disaster, subject to periodic reports and expenditure from the
                        reserve".


5          APPLICATION OF 28™ JUNE 1998 FROM MR BERNARD MURRAY

            By letter dated 28thJune 1998, Mr Murray informed the Chief Constable that his
            wife had accepted a summons on his behalf arising from the events of the
            Hillsborough disaster and requesting that the Police Authority reimburse any
            legal expenses that he may incur in defending himself. The next day, Assistant
            Chief Constable Daines wrote to the Clerk and Treasurer setting out the
            reasons for his support of Mr Murray's application and the application was
            approved by the Clerk and Treasurer that day.


6          THE CLERK AND TREASURER'S DECISIONS

            In approving both of these applications, the Clerk and Treasurer consulted ihe
            Authority's legal adviser and took into account a number of considerations.
            These included:

6.1        The terms of the Home Office Circular 4/1998 relating to financial assistance to
           police officers in legal proceedings.

        D             POTENTIAL CHALLENGE


        1          Ms Adiington, on behalf of the HFSG, has raised a number of questions about
                   the decision making process to date and has indicated that she is considering
                   commencing judicial review proceedings against the Authority.


        2          On 22nt>December 1998, following a report by the BBC that the Authority had
                   agreed to pay the legal costs of Messrs Duckenfield and Murray, Ms Adiington
                   wrote to the Clerk and Treasurer to the Authority (Appendix D l) challenging
                   the Authority's power to provide such assistance on a number of grounds,
                   including the following:

                   2.1        that there was no legal authority under statute for the Authority to pay
                              the legal costs of a police officer (serving or former) in relation to criminal
                              proceedings against him/her;

                   2.2        that even if such an authority existed, it had been exerciscd improperly in
                              this case as the Authority had taken into account a number of irrelevant
                              considerations, ignored a number of relevant considerations and
                              delegated powers, which it should itself have exercised, to the Clerk and
                             Treasurer.


        3          On 5th January 1999, the solicitor to the Authority sought preliminary advice
                   from barrister, Mr Bernard Phillips. He confirmed that the general principle of
                   whether to afford assistance at all was a matter for the discretion of the
                   Authority. In the light of the representations received from Mrs Adiington,
                   however, he believed that the decision should be reconsidered by the
                   Authority.


        4          On 5lh January 1999 Ms Adiington wrote a further letter to all the members of
                   the Authority (which members have already received) making additional
                   points about the propriety of die decision to make financial assistant® available
                   to the officers. She has subsequently supplemented that letter with a fax to
                  Garretts, the solicitors instructed by the Authority, dated 29 January 1999
                  (Appendix D2).

5      On 12thJanuary 1999 the solicitor to the Authority took legal advice on the two
       letters received from Ms Adiington from Leading Counsel, Richard Mawrey
       QC- His advice, which is referred to in mote detail in Sections E and F below,
       was that there was a power to provide financial assistance to police officers in
       legal proceedings.        However, this could only be exercised in appropriate
       circumstances and only to cover "out of pocket" expenses, (but not expenditure
       which would otherwise be paid from central funds or by the Legal Aid Board).
       He added that the HFSG might seek to challenge the procedure by which such
       powers had been exercised because it covered more than "out of pocket"
       expenditure, with some prospect of success and that accordingly the Authority
       should be asked to reconsider its original decision in order to ensure it took
       take account of all relevant considerations, including those Mr Adiington
       alleges might have been overlooked earlier.


6      On 15lk January 1999, the Authority instructed Garretts, solicitors, to advise the
       Audiority in reconsidering its decision to make financial assistance available to
       the officers for the criminal proceedings and considering the new applications
       for financial support for judicial review proceedings. Garretts, whose advice is
       also referred to below in more detail, expressed its own concern about the
       statutory power to give financial support to officers in these circumstances and
       recommended that a second opinion be sought from Presiley Baxendale QC
       and Mark Shaw . Their advice was then taken and, for the reasons set out
       below, they reinforced Garretts’ concern about the existence of such a pow er.


7        On 19th January 1999, following a conversation with Garretts about the
         challenge from Mrs Adiington, the solicitors representing Mr Murray wrote
         to them commenting on that challenge (Appendix D3).                  This was
         supplemented by a letter of 27thJanuary 1999 (Appendix D4).

      Proceedings) (attached as Appendix El) specifically stated, in the context of
      private prosecutions that where a member of the public brings a ptosecution
      against an officer, in circumstances where he ha9 acted in good faith and
      exercised his judgement reasonably, the Authority should provide or fund legal
      advice and/or representation. The Circular stated that an Authority had a
      discretion "to meet expenditure incurred by officers in all kinds of legal
      proceedings where the officers have acted in good faith in pursuance of their
      duties, or where the interests of the force as a whole are involved”.

1 2 Circular 4/1998 (attached as Appendix E2) issued on 17 February 1998,
      replaced circular 77/87 with immediate effect. This circular, in common with
      circular 77/87 with immediate effect, also stated that it is important that police
      officers should be able to carry out their duties in the confidence that their
      Authority will support them if they act in good faith and exercise their
      judgement reasonably. However, it deals with the issue of an Authority's power
      to provide such assistance much less categorically than its predecessor. In
      particular, it states:

             5. "Section 88(4) [of the Police Act 1996, which allows Police Authorities
                to pay the costs of police officers who are sued for damages for loss or
                damage caused to others by their alleged negligence or other torts]
                does not apply to criminal proceedings, but police authorities may
                wish to consult their legal advisers as to whether they have any other
                power to provide such assistance (whether in respect of private
                prosecutions or prosecutions brought by the CPS). In this context,
                 they may wish to note that section 111(1} of the Local Government Act
                1972 enables police authorities to do anything '’which is calculated to
                facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the discharge of any of their
                functions"          It could be argued that to allow payment to be made
                to officers (either former or serving) involved in criminal proceedings
                would in some way facilitate or be conducive to a policy authority’s
                broad functions. For example, failure to provide financial assistance
                could adversely affect the morale of the force if officers had to meet
                their own costs after an acquittal.

               6. it is for individual police authorities to decide in the particular
                   circumstances of a case, and on the basis of legal advice, whether to
                   make      financial        assistance   available   to   officers   in   criminal
                   proceedings."

1.3    It will be noted that the latest Home Office Circular specifically invites Police
       Authorities to take legal advice whether the power to provide such assistance
       exists, rather than asserting with certainty that it does in particular (non tort)
       cases. Nevertheless, like its predecessor, the latest Circular does appear to
       contemplate that the Authority is capable of giving the assistance in the right
       case.


2      ADVICE OF RICHARD MAWREY QC

2.1    Richard Mawrey expressed the view that a power to provide financial
       assistance to officers and former officers in legal proceedings of ail types was
       within the scope of section 6(1) of the Police Act 1996 read with section 111(1) of
       the Local Government Act 1972.

       Section 6 of die Police Act 1996 gives the Policc Authority its basic duty to
       secure "the maintenance of an efficient and effective police force for its area".

       Section 111(1) of the Local Government Act 1972, which applies to police
       authorities as it applies to local authorities, states;

               "Without prejudice to any powers exercisable apart from this section but
               subject to the provisions of this Act and any other enactment passed
               before or after this Act, a local authority shall have power to do anything
               (whether or not involving the expenditure, borrowing or lending of
               money or the acquisition or disposal of any property or rights) which is
               calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the discharge of
               any of their functions."

2.2    In this regard, Mi Mawrey relied upon R -v- Derbyshire Police Authority ex park
       Wilson and Dalton (1989) in which two police officers challenged a decision of
       the Derbyshire Police Authority not to pay part of the legal expenses they
       incurred in being represented at an auditor's enquiry into illegal expenditure.
       In that case. Lord Justice Ralph Gibson overturned the decision of a panel of
       the police authority not to award reimbursement of costs on the grounds that
       the decision had been improperly taken by five members of the authority.


i\^AHfirm\S0UTHTUH»«MHl£r0UCC/FN*urt<n\fX)C           17
               rather than the whole authority.        But he rejected a further contention that
               because the officers had acted in good faith, the authority should automatically
               have granted them financial assistance with theit costs. Richard Mawrey QC
               thought that this indicated that the judge had implicitly accepted that a police
               authority could provide assistance with legal costs, (even in non tort cases
               which were outside the powers granted by section 88 of the Police Act 1996),


        3      GARRETTS' ADVICE

        3.1    As already stated, Garretts were instructed to advise the Authority of the
               relevant factors to be taken into account in reconsidering the officers'
               applications for financial assistance with the criminal proceedings and the
               applications for support with the CPS proceedings and Sefton proceedings.

        3.2    After they were instructed, however, they raised fresh doubts about the basic
               power of the Authority to meet the officers' costs of the criminal proceedings
               and related judicial review proceedings. In particular, they were concerned
                that legal cases, following the Wilson and Dalton case, on section 111(1) of the
               Local Government Act 1972, had considerably weakened the argument that the
               Authority had power under Section 6(1) of the Police Act 1996 and section
               111(1) of the Local Government Act 1972 to grant financial assistance to police
               officers in proceedings other than tort proceedings. In particular, they felt that
               tiie existence of section 88(4) of the Police Act 1996 (specifically allowing police
               authorities to pay such costs in tort cases) made it strongly arguable that such
               costs could not be paid in other types of proceedings.

        3.3    Given these concerns, Garretts recommended that a second opinion be sought
               from Presiley Baxendale QC and Mark Shaw.


        4      ADVICE OF PRESILEY BAXENDALE QC AND MR MARK SHAW

        4.1    Counsel advised that they had initially been attracted by the argument that the
               Authority had power to pay "out of pocket1' legal costs and expenses of officers
               in all types of proceedings, where they had acted in good faith and it was
               otherwise appropriate. The wide duty conferred on the Authority by section 6
               of the Police Act 1996 to maintain an effective and efficient police forcc, in
               conjunction with Section 111(1) of the Local Government Act 1972, appeared to
               give a very broad discretion to the Authority to preserve the morale of the
               police force without which, an effective and efficient policc force could not be


        !\CAHKirrr\SOUTHTORJ<3MlHEPOl.Cq/fNmOUI1.HOC   IK

                                                                                         n - L \ (KOJSi66 . ‘8 3 J - I 0
      maintained. Accordingly, if it was, in the Authority's view, genuinely and
      reasonably necessary, in order to maintain police morale, to meet the out of
      pocket costs and expenses of police officers, incurred in defending themselves
      against criminal or civil proceedings, it was arguably within Section 6 of the
      Police Act 1996, coupled with Section 111(1) of the Local Government Act 1972,
      to pay such costs.

4.2   Counsel also considered, however, that diere were powerful arguments against
      this interpretation including the following:

      4.2.1   If there were a general power under section 6 of the Police Act 1996 to
              indemnify officers against the costs of legal proceedings arising from
              the performance of their duties, there would be no reason for section
              88(4) of the Police Act 1996 specifically to allow the recovery of such
              costs in tort proceedings. Section 88(4) would simply be unnecessary.

      4.2.2   The issue turns on the proper construction of the Police Act 1996. In
              London Borough of Sutton -v- Morgan GrenjbU & Co Limited (1996) the
              Court of Appeal stated that where Parliament had enacted specific
              provisions setting out how a local authority was intended to perform its
              functions, there was no room to imply other means of carrying out
              those functions under section 111(1) of the Local Government Act 1972.
              In particular, where a local authority was intended to have power to
              incur financial obligations that power must specifically be identified by
              statute. This was an example of a well established general principle of
              statutory interpretation: where Parliament specifies one particular
              matter, it impliedly excludes any other allied matters.     In addition,
              section 6 of the Police Act 1996 is so wide in its language that counsel
              doubt that recourse to section 111(1) of the Local Government Act 1972
              could usefully expand it. The real question is the relationship between
              section 6 and section 88.

      4.2.3   In the Wilson and Dalton case, both parties had accepted that the basic
              power to meet the officers' costs existed, and accordingly this did not
              fall to be decided by the judge. The power to pay costs was therefore
              assumed not decided. Similarly, a Circular is only guidance. It does not
              define or modify the law and should not be assumed to be correct,

      4.2.4   Mr Justice Denning stated in Askey -v- Golden Wine Co Limited (1948) the
              public policy that the punishment inflicted by a criminal court is


j\CARium\wmmwraiimtroucm-N-oooii.Doc       19
                                       personal to the offender and that such an offender is not entitled to
                                       recover from a third party an indemnity against the consequences of the
                                       criminal proceedings whether that be a fins, an award against him of
                                       the other party's costs or the accused's own legal costs. This public
                                       policy helps to explain why section 83(4) of the Police Act 1996 does not
                                       cover criminal proceedings.

                      4.2.5            A judge would not necessarily consider it desirable for the Authority to
                                       have such 3 power. Counsel considered that, in the light of Ashey ~v-
                                       Goldett Wine Co Limited, it was doubtful if a police authority was
                                       intended to have power to indemnify officers against costs of a case in
                                       which they were found guilty. An acquitted defendant would, in any
                                       event, normally receive an award that his/her reasonably incurred non
                                       legally-aided costs be paid In full out of central funds, unless the
                                       accused was at fault in bringing suspicion on himself or was found not
                                       guilty on a technicality see Prcctice Direction (Crime: Costs) (1991) 1 WLR
                                       498. Accordingly, in the normal run, an acquitted police officer should
                                       have no (of few) costs to pay himself/herself, which a police authority
                                       would need to meet.

         4.3          Counsel stressed that they had both found this issue difficult and that there
                      was no guarantee which way a Court would decide.                     There were certainly
                      strong policy reasons why the Authority should have power to support its
                      officers (current and former) in this way. Given the points summarised in
                      paragraphs 4.2.1 to 4.2.5 above, however, they had considerable doubts about
                      the power of the Authority to support the costs either of the criminal
                      proceedings or the judicial review proceedings (neither being covered by
                      Section 88(4) of the Police Act 1996), particularly before any judgement had
                      been given in those proceedings.

         4.4          Counsel are also mindful of the terms of die latest Home Office Circular. They
                      do not lightly advise that it is wrong but it is much more hesitant that its
                      predecessor. Counsel sense, therefore, that the Home Office may have its own
                      doubts about the existence of this power.

         4.5          Accordingly, whilst they wished to review the matter further in the light of any
                      representations made on behalf of the officers, the Chief Constable or the
                      HFSG, their current recommendation was that the Authority should resolve to
                      reverse its earlier decision and decide that it has no power to provide the
                      financial assistance which had been sought. It should then co-operate with

tcO 'd
                  those parlies in bringing the matter before a court for an early decision on
                  whether that view of their legal powers was correct. The Authority's solicitors,
                  Garretts, agree with that recommendation and will be available at the next
                  meeting of the Authority to discuss it with members.

         F        PROCEDURAL CONSIDERATIONS

         1.       Members will note from the correspondence from Ms Adiington that the
                  decision to provide financial assistance to Messrs Duckenfield and Murray for
                  their legal costs and expenses of the criminal proceedings is also challenged on
                  procedural grounds. Representations are also made that it would not be
                  appropriate to provide such assistance in relation to any challenge to the
                  decision of the Crown Prosecution Service not to take over and discontinue the
                  criminal proceedings or any other challenge to decisions taken in the course of
                   the criminal proceedings, given the circumstances of these cases.

         2.       Given the doubts about the underlying legal power of the Authority to provide
                  such assistance at all, it is recommended that the Authority defers considering
                  consequential procedural matters until the Authority has secured an
                  authoritative (judicial) determination of the existence and extent of its
                  underlying statutory power to provide the officers with financial assistance for
                  criminal or judicial review proceedings,

         3.       If the Authority accepts the recommendations set out in this report it is hoped
                  that all concerned w ill co-operate tn an urgent judicial review application. If
                  the existence of the power is then established, the Authority will need to
                  proceed immediately to decide how it should be exercised. It is hoped that a
                  hearing can be secured before the Court in late February or early March to
                  enable all concerned to know where they stand before the committal heating in
                  the Leeds Magistrates' Court in April. It should be in everyone's interests to
                  clarify the legal position as soon as possible. This can be done definitely only
                  by the Court.

SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY

5 FEBRUARY 1999

REPORT OF THE CHIEF CONSTABLE

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 1989: Financial Assistance to Officers Facing Private
Prosecutions


1.0   Introduction

1.1   Today members of the Police Authority are to consider one of the most weighty
      issues that each member is likely to' encounter in their time serving on the Police
      Authority. The Hillsborough Stadium Disaster was the single most traumatic event
      in the 25 year history of South Yorkshire Police and, nearly ten years afterwards,
      the shockwaves still reverberate, often with terrible tolls on people’s emotions and
      their health.

1.2   In this report I will summarise the principle facts of the disaster, make some
       observations on these particular private prosecutions and some general
       observations on private prosecutions.

2.0   The Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

2.1   On 15 April 1989 an FA cup semi final football match was due to be played at the
      home of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club; the Hillsborough Stadium. Liverpool
      and Nottingham Forest were the two teams.

2.2   Overcrowding occurred in the areas behind the Liverpool goal in the period
      immediately before and after the 3.00 pm kick off. The crowd crush caused the
      deaths of 96 spectators (95 people died that day, one person lived in a vegetative
      state until his death in 1993).

2.3   The disaster happened in full view of over 50,000 spectators. It was transmitted, as
      it unfolded, by BBC Television. It was recorded by the football club’s CCTV system
      and the police CCTV system. Sports photographers took hundreds of still
      photographs. The impact of the Hillsborough Disaster is unique because it was
      beamed live into the homes of millions and was recorded so graphically.

2.4   Lord Justice Taylor was invited to conduct a public enquiry and the West Midlands
       Police were commissioned to gather evidence. The Taylor enquiry considered
      3,776 statements, 1,550 letters, 71 hours of video tape, hundreds of photographs
      and the personal and public testimony of 174 witnesses. Taylor’s interim report
      (published 4 August 1989) analysed the causes of the disaster and apportioned
      blame.

2.5   In March 1990 the West Midlands Police submitted a report to the Director of Public
       Prosecutions (DPP). In August 1990, Mr Allan Green, then the DPP, concluded that
       there should be no prosecution of any person for any matter arising from the
       disaster.

2.6   Between November 1990 and March 1991 the Sheffield Coroner and jury heard 230
      witnesses. The jury returned verdicts of accidental death. In 1993, relatives of six
3.2   Lord Justice Stuart-Smith wrote;

      i)     “The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) had the responsibility of deciding
             whether criminal proceedings, in practice charges of manslaughter, should
             be brought against any corporate body or individual. In their submissions to
             me Counsel for the Family Support Group have only invited me to make a
             recommendation to the DPP in the case of Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray.”
             (para 25, chapter 1)

      ii)    “The DPP, accepting the advice of two very experienced Queen’s Counsel,
              concluded in 1990 that there was not sufficient evidence to justify such
              charges against either of these officers. The fresh evidence, therefore,
              would have to be of sufficient significance that there is, in my view, a real
              possibility that in considering it the DPP might change her mind and institute
              proceedings for manslaughter, or any other offence, against one or both of
              these officers.” (para 26, chapter 1)

      iii)   “I have read the joint opinion of Counsel dated 6 August 1990 which gave
              advice to the Director of Public Prosecutions on the possible criminal
              proceedings against Mr Murray and Mr Duckenfield, amongst others.
              Although the material available to Counsel was more extensive than that
              which was placed before Lord Taylor, because by that time the criminal
              investigation carried out by the West Midlands Police had been completed,
              Counsel stated that

                  “the criminal investigation, for all its thoroughness, has not significantly
                  added to or contradicted Lord Justice Taylor's findings.            In our
                 judgement, therefore, the Taylor analysis of the facts is as firm a base as
                  any from which to approach the question of Criminal Liability.” (para 52,
                  chapter 1)

      iv)    “Counsel then set out a full, detailed and careful resume of the facts based
             on the evidence then available. I have not found any error or omission in
             this resume, nor in my view is any particular aspect understated or
             exaggerated. I have also considered the statement of the law set out in the
             opinion. Counsel considered both the offences of manslaughter and
             culpable malfeasance in public office. They were plainly correct to consider
             that the latter offence would be no easier to establish than manslaughter in
             the circumstances of the case.” (para 53, chapter 1)

      v)     “In order to recommend that the DPP reconsider the decision not to
              prosecute, therefore, I must be satisfied that any fresh evidence establishes,
              or may establish, facts not previously considered by Counsel or the
              significance of which was not fully appreciated, which makes it more likely
              that charges of manslaughter could be established. Essentially this relates
              to Mr Duckenfield's and Mr Murray’s knowledge and appreciation of the risk
              in doing what they did or omitted to do.” (para 54, chapter 1)

      vi)    “From my meetings with the bereaved families and their representatives, I
              am left in no doubt that there was widespread disappointment at the DPP’s
              decision not to prosecute. They find it difficult to understand in the light of
              Lord Taylor’s trenchant criticisms of the South Yorkshire Police and the fact
              that the Force have been paying compensation." (para 55, chapter 1)

      vii)   “What the Director of Public Prosecutions had to bear in mind, however, is
              the significantly different and greater degree of culpability which is involved
                                             3
3.5   The HFSG are not just conducting a prosecution against Mr DuckenfiekJ and Mr
       Murray, they are also lobbying the Authority to cease funding the cost of Mr
       Duckenfield and Mr Murray’s legal defence. Thus the HFSG are seeking to impose
       a financial penalty on Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray and to limit their ability to
       defend themselves.

3.6    I am bound to question whether Ms Adlington, solicitor to HFSG, has made a
       professional assessment of the evidence and whether it is likely to produce a
       conviction or whether the prosecution of Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray is motivated
       by other factors.

3.7   Members of the HFSG have said that it is unfair that they have to struggle for funds
       while Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray have access to the Authority's funds. I do not
       know what funds are held by HFSG or whether they publish accounts. In summer
       1997 a pop concert raised a reported £500,000 for their funds. It is incumbent upon
       the prosecutor to be in a position to sustain the prosecution. Neither I or my legal
       advisors have before encountered a case where a solicitor prosecuting a case has
       tried to influence the funding arrangements for the defence. In her submission to
       the Authority, Ms Adlington made it clear that she sought a revocation of funding in
       order to influence the defendants’ ability to defend themselves.

4.0   General Observations on Private Prosecutions

4.1   Police officers have to make split second decisions which affect people’s liberty and
       even their lives. Those decisions are open to challenge through the police
       complaints procedure, action in the civil courts and action in the criminal courts.

4.2   Private individuals can initiate prosecutions, that is a valuable safeguard against
       official inertia. The DPP can terminate a private prosecution, that is a valuable
       safeguard against capricious prosecution.

4.3   Home Office Circulars offer Authorities guidance on how to deal with applications
      from officers for funding to meet the cost of defence against a prosecution. This
      Authority agreed to fund the defence costs of Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray.

4.4   In the limited time available I have not been able to research policy in other forces.
       However, the Metropolitan Police comprises about 23% of all police officers in
       England and Wales. Any officer who faces a private prosecution is defended by the
       Metropolitan Police solicitors department or solicitors employed by them for that
       purpose.

4.5   Some commentators have suggested that Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray’s costs are
      taking funds away from the policing of South Yorkshire. In a superficial sense that
       is correct but that is not a situation of their choosing. However at a more profound
       level the decision to pay their costs sustains the morale of the Force and its efficient
      functioning.

4.6   I consider it vital to the morale and good management of the Force that officers
      should know that, if they act in good faith when performing their dangerous duties,
      the Chief Constable and all the Police Authority will do whatever it can to support
      them. If officers do not have that confidence, they will push decisions up the rank
      structure, thereby delaying resolution of problems and reducing the ability of
      managers to manage. In medical circles, the fear of litigation is prompting talk of
      “defensive medicine"; using valuable resources to eliminate every conceivable
      cause of illness. In policing terms, “defensive policing” would mean that officers
      would be less inclined to make those necessary split second decisions of life and
                                              5

SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY

5 FEBRUARY 1999

REPORT OF THE CHIEF CONSTABLE

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 1989: Financial Assistance to Officers Facing Private
Prosecutions


1.0   Introduction

1.1   Today members of the Police Authority are to consider one of the most weighty
      issues that each member is likely to encounter in their time serving on the Police
      Authority. The Hillsborough Stadium Disaster was the single most traumatic event
      in the 25 year history of South Yorkshire Police and, nearly ten years afterwards,
      the shockwaves still reverberate, often with terrible tolls on people’s emotions and
      their health.

1.2   In this report I will summarise the principle facts of the disaster, make some
       observations on these particular private prosecutions and some general
       observations on private prosecutions.

2.0   The Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

2.1   On 15 April 1989 an FA cup semi final football match was due to be played at the
      home of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club; the Hillsborough Stadium. Liverpool
      and Nottingham Forest were the two teams.

2.2   Overcrowding occurred in the areas behind the Liverpool goal in the period
      immediately before and after the 3.00 pm kick off. The crowd crush caused the
      deaths of 96 spectators (95 people died that day, one person lived in a vegetative
      state until his death in 1993).

2.3   The disaster happened in full view of over 50,000 spectators. It was transmitted, as
       it unfolded, by BBC Television. It was recorded by the football club’s CCTV system
      and the police CCTV system. Sports photographers took hundreds of still
       photographs. The impact of the Hillsborough Disaster is unique because it was
       beamed live into the homes of millions and was recorded so graphically.

2.4   Lord Justice Taylor was invited to conduct a public enquiry and the West Midlands
       Police were commissioned to gather evidence. The Taylor enquiry considered
       3,776 statements, 1,550 letters, 71 hours of video tape, hundreds of photographs
       and the personal and public testimony of 174 witnesses. Taylor’s interim report
       (published 4 August 1989) analysed the causes of the disaster and apportioned
       blame.

2.5   In March 1990 the West Midlands Police submitted a report to the Director of Public
       Prosecutions (DPP). In August 1990, Mr Allan Green, then the DPP, concluded that
       there should be no prosecution of any person for any matter arising from the
       disaster.

2.6   Between November 1990 and March 1991 the Sheffield Coroner and jury heard 230
      witnesses. The jury returned verdicts of accidental death. In 1993, relatives of six
       of the deceased applied to the High Court to quash the inquest verdict; the High
       Court turned down the application. In December 199.3, the West Yorkshire Coroner
       returned a verdict of accidental death of the 96th victim who had recently died.

2.7   In December 1996, Granada Television broadcast a drama programme titled,
       "Hillsborough”. The drama purported to show the discovery of significant evidence
       which had not been considered by previous enquiries. The Hillsborough Family
       Support Group (HFSG) is an association of some of the relatives of some of the
       deceased. They pressed for a fresh enquiry into the disaster.

2.8   In June 1997, the Home Secretary announced the establishment of a scrutiny to
       look into the reports that fresh and relevant evidence had been found. Lord Justice
       Stuart-Smith, an Appeal Court Judge, reported in February 1998. He found that
       there was no relevant material which should be put before the DPP which might
       cause her to reconsider the decision not to prosecute. The DPP, then Dame
       Barbara Mills, considered the position and decided there should be no prosecutions.
       The Home Secretary, and other Government Ministers, accepted Stuart-Smith's
       findings.

2.9   In June 1998, the solicitor to the HFSG, Ms A Adlington, began a private
       prosecution at South Sefton (Merseyside) Magistrates against David Duckenfield
       and Bernard Murray. Mr Duckenfield was a chief superintendent at the time of the
       disaster and was in charge of the police operation. Mr Murray was a superintendent
       and was in charge of the control room arrangements. They are each charged with
       the manslaughter of two named individuals and with the criminal offence of, being a
       public servant, neglecting their duty (culpable malfeasance in public office). Mr
       Duckenfield is also charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice.

2.10 The Police Authority agreed to pay the costs incurred by Mr Duckenfield and Mr
      Murray in defending themselves against these private prosecutions.

2.11 Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray challenged the jurisdiction of South Sefton
     Magistrates, the case was withdrawn and Ms Adlington started them afresh at
      Leeds Magistrates.

2.12 The DPP has a legal right to intervene in a prosecution initiated by a private person.
      He can take over the prosecution and pursue it or take it over and discontinue the
      prosecution. Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray invited the DPP to take over the
      prosecution and discontinue it. On 19 December 1998 the DPP, now Mr David
      Calvert-Smith, announced that he would not intervene to continue or discontinue the
      prosecutions. If the DPP had been satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to be
      confident of a conviction and that the public interest required a prosecution, Mr
      Calvert-Smith would have been obliged to take over the prosecution and conduct it
      through the Crown Prosecution Service.

2.13 Those are the background facts to the private prosecutions of two retired officers.

3.0    Some Observations on the Private Prosecution

3.1    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny examined the previously made decisions about
       the disaster and he looked at the purported fresh evidence. I will quote extensively
       from those parts of his report that deal with the question of criminal prosecution.
       (He also dealt with the Coroners inquest, the police disciplinary process and the
       public enquiry but those matter are not relevant to today’s issues.)



                                             2
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith wrote;

i)     “The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) had the responsibility of deciding
       whether criminal proceedings, in practice charges of manslaughter, should
       be brought against any corporate body or individual. In their submissions to
       me Counsel for the Family Support Group have only invited me to make a
       recommendation to the DPP in the case of Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray.”
       (para 25, chapter 1)

ii)    “The DPP, accepting the advice of two very experienced Queen’s Counsel,
       concluded in 1990 that there was not sufficient evidence to justify such
       charges against either of these officers. The fresh evidence, therefore,
       would have to be of sufficient significance that there is, in my view, a real
        possibility that in considering it the DPP might change her mind and institute
        proceedings for manslaughter, or any other offence, against one or both of
       these officers.” (para 26, chapter 1)

iii)   “I have read the joint opinion of Counsel dated 6 August 1990 which gave
        advice to the Director of Public Prosecutions on the possible criminal
       proceedings against Mr Murray and Mr Duckenfield, amongst others.
       Although the material available to Counsel was more extensive than that
       which was placed before Lord Taylor, because by that time the criminal
        investigation carried out by the West Midlands Police had been completed,
       Counsel stated that

            “the criminal investigation, for all its thoroughness, has not significantly
            added to or contradicted Lord Justice Taylor's findings.            In our
           judgement, therefore, the Taylor analysis of the facts is as firm a base as
            any from which to approach the question of Criminal Liability.’' (para 52,
            chapter 1)

iv)    “Counsel then set out a full, detailed and careful resume of the facts based
        on the evidence then available. I have not found any error or omission in
        this resume, nor in my view is any particular aspect understated or
        exaggerated. I have also considered the statement of the law set out in the
        opinion. Counsel considered both the offences of manslaughter and
        culpable malfeasance in public office. They were plainly correct to consider
        that the latter offence would be no easier to establish than manslaughter in
        the circumstances of the case." (para 53, chapter 1)

v)     “In order to recommend that the DPP reconsider the decision not to
        prosecute, therefore, I must be satisfied that any fresh evidence establishes,
        or may establish, facts not previously considered by Counsel or the
        significance of which was not fully appreciated, which makes it more likely
        that charges of manslaughter could be established. Essentially this relates
        to Mr Duckenfield’s and Mr Murray’s knowledge and appreciation of the risk
        in doing what they did or omitted to do.” (para 54, chapter 1)

vi)    “From my meetings with the bereaved families and their representatives, l
        am left in no doubt that there was widespread disappointment at the DPP’s
        decision not to prosecute. They find it difficult to understand in the light of
        Lord Taylor’s trenchant criticisms of the South Yorkshire Police and the fact
        that the Force have been paying compensation.” (para 55, chapter 1)

vii)   “What the Director of Public Prosecutions had to bear in mind, however, is
        the significantly different and greater degree of culpability which is involved
        in manslaughter, or culpable malfeasance in public office, as against the
        degree of negligence which gives rise to liability, and compensation
        payments, under civil law. Any prosecution of an individual police officer
        would have to establish his individual responsibility. It would not be enough
        simply to prove the composite failure of the police operation, (para 56,
        chapter 1)

viii)   “The causes of the disaster were many and complex. So far as these two
         officers were concerned, the prosecution would have to prove to the high
         standard required for a criminal conviction that the failure to give the order to
         close off the tunnel when Gate C was opened amounted to the serious
         degree of recklessness necessary to constitute manslaughter, (para 57,
         chapter 1)

ix)     “I do not consider that there is any material which should be put before the
         Director of Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints Authority which
         might cause them to reconsider the decisions they have already taken.”
         (para 5, chapter 7)

        “None of the evidence I was asked to consider added anything significant to
        the evidence which was available to Lord Taylor’s Inquiry or the Inquests",
        (para 6, chapter 7)

I donot know the strength of evidence held by the private prosecutor but I am
bound to make the following observations;

a)      Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray have not been living abroad, they have not
        been in hiding; they have been available for prosecution throughout the
        (nearly) ten years since the disaster. One must therefore ponder why the
        private prosecutions were not started earlier.

b)      Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny was established largely because of
         claims by the Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG) that they had
         uncovered significant fresh evidence. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith decided
         those claims were not accurate and referred to some of their arguments as
         ‘irresponsible’. After his report was published, HFSG again claimed to have
         uncovered fresh evidence.

c)      After beginning the private prosecutions, Ms Adlington wrote to me to ask for
        copies of all the witness statements. It is normal procedure to gather
        evidence before launching a prosecution, not after. This leads me to
        conclude that HFSG do not have the relevant fresh evidence they claim to
        have discovered.

d)      Three Directors of Public Prosecutions (Mr Green, Dame Barbara Mills and
         Mr Calvert-Smith) have each reviewed the case and decided not to
        prosecute.

e)      Ms Adlington and leading figures in HFSG have, in recent years, made a
        number of outspoken statements which lead me to question their objectivity
        and judgement. When the Home Secretary accepted Lord Justice Stuart-
        Smith’s report, Mr Trevor Hicks, Chairman of HFSG, said, “New Labour,, new
        cover up”. Mr Hicks threatened to prosecute the previous Chief Constable,
        Richard Wells, for malfeasance in public office by allowing Mr Duckenfield to
        retire from the police service on medical grounds before he had faced a
        disciplinary tribunal. These are only two examples, others can be given.
3.5   The HFSG are not just conducting a prosecution against Mr Duckenfield and Mr
      Murray, they are also lobbying the Authority to cease funding the cost of Mr
      Duckenfield and Mr Murray’s legal defence. Thus the HFSG are seeking to impose
      a financial penalty on Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray and to limit their ability to
      defend themselves.

3.6   I am bound to question whether Ms Adlington, solicitor to HFSG, has made a
      professional assessment of the evidence and whether it is likely to produce a
      conviction or whether the prosecution of Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray is motivated
      by other factors.

3.7   Members of the HFSG have said that it is unfair that they have to struggle for funds
      while Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray have access to the Authority’s funds. I do not
      know what funds are held by HFSG or whether they publish accounts. In summer
      1997 a pop concert raised a reported £500,000 for their funds. It is incumbent upon
      the prosecutor to be in a position to sustain the prosecution. Neither I or my legal
      advisors have before encountered a case where a solicitor prosecuting a case has
      tried to influence the funding arrangements for the defence. In her submission to
      the Authority, Ms Adlington made it clear that she sought a revocation of funding in
      order to influence the defendants’ ability to defend themselves.

4.0   General Observations on Private Prosecutions

4.1   Police officers have to make split second decisions which affect people’s liberty and
      even their lives. Those decisions are open to challenge through the police
      complaints procedure, action in the civil courts and action in the criminal courts.

4.2   Private individuals can initiate prosecutions, that is a valuable safeguard against
      official inertia. The DPP can terminate a private prosecution, that is a valuable
      safeguard against capricious prosecution.

4.3   Home Office Circulars offer Authorities guidance on how to deal with applications
      from officers for funding to meet the cost of defence against a prosecution. This
      Authority agreed to fund the defence costs of Mr Duckenfield andMr Murray.

4.4   In the limited time available I have not been able to research policy in other forces.
      However, the Metropolitan Police comprises about 23% of all police officers in
      England and Wales. Any officer who faces a private prosecution is defended by the
      Metropolitan Police solicitors department or solicitors employed by them for that
      purpose.

4.5   Some commentators have suggested that Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray’s costs are
      taking funds away from the policing of South Yorkshire. In a superficial sense that
      is correct but that is not a situation of their choosing. However at a more profound
      level the decision to pay their costs sustains the morale of the Force and its efficient
      functioning.

4.6   I consider it vital to the morale and good management of the Force that officers
      should know that, if they act in good faith when performing their dangerous duties,
      the Chief Constable and all the Police Authority will do whatever it can to support
      them. If officers do not have that confidence, they will push decisions up the rank
      structure, thereby delaying resolution of problems and reducing the ability of
      managers to manage. In medical circles, the fear of litigation is prompting talk of
      “defensive medicine”; using valuable resources to eliminate every conceivable
      cause of illness. In policing terms, “defensive policing” would mean that officers
      would be less inclined to make those necessary split second decisions of life and
                                             5
      liberty if they thought that, years after the event, after previous enquiries,
      they might face the cost of defending themselves against the action of a
      private individual.

5.0    Legal Issues

      This report has been concluded (midday Monday, 1 February 1999) in time
      for circulation to members. Barristers are still considering the legal issues. If
      their advice is that the Authority cannot meet Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray’s
      defence costs then discussion will be truncated. However, if the Authority’s
      decisions to date have been lawful, as I believe they have, then I would
      recommend that the present funding arrangements continue. Indeed legal
      advice may well be that the funding arrangements cannot be rescinded once
      granted. I would also recommend that the Authority look favourably upon
      the request for funding to seek a judicial review of the DPP’s decision not to
      intervene in the prosecutions.

      If there is a conflict of view between Counsel advising the Authority and
      Counsel advising the Chief Constable, and the decision is taken that the
      officers will not be funded for the criminal prosecutions as previously agreed,
      I would have to consider either making a legal appeal or, jointly with the
      Authority, seeking a declaration from the Divisional Court.

Dear Mr Duckenfield

Legal A ssistance

This letter is addressed in identical terms to David Duckenfield and Trevor Bichard.

Home Office Circular 77/87 provides for Police Authorities to provide financial assistance
for legal representation for police officers (serving or retired).

Following tne publication, on 15 February ISSo, of Lord Justice Stuari-Srr.iih’s Scrutiny
report on the Hillsborough Disaster leading members of the Hillsborough Family Support
Group have spoken openly of prosecuting people for alleged offences in connection with
that disaster.

They refer to prosecuting;

a)    David Duc;kenfie!d for manslaughter

b)    Trevor Bichard for perjury.

W e cannot be sure whether they will follow through into action nor csn we be sure of when
they may act.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's Scrutiny report reviews the process by which the Director of
Public Prosecutions (DPP) decided, in 1990, not to prosecute for manslaughter. Sir Murray
Stuart-Smith finds no fault in the decision making process and says that no new evidence
has come to light since that decision was made.

The allegation of perjury is more recent and revolves around the assertion by some
members of the Hillsborough Family Support Group that Trevor Bichard lied on oath about
the functionality of the CCTV system. Sir Murray dismisses any suggestion that Trevor
Told lies.

The members of the Police Authority have resolved to make the offer of financial
assistance for legal representation to officers who may be in jeopardy from Hillsborough
Disaster related prosecutions. If you wish to use this facility you must apply.

The members have agreed to allow the Chairman, the Clerk and I to decide on such
applications on their behalf. For simplicity, I suggest that you endorse this letter with words
to the effect of, “ I wish to apply for financial assistance for legal representation as outlined
in this letter” , sign and date. As soon as I receive your reply the Clerk and I can consider
your application.

The Chief Constable has used Winckworth Pemberton Solicitors, 35 Great Peter Street,
Westminster, London, SW1P 3LP (Telephone 0171 5935000) in connection with Sir
Murray's Scrutiny. They came well recommended and have been of great assistance. Nick
Owston, Ailsa Lawrence and Simon Eastwood have mastered the complexities of the
disaster and subsequent enquiries. I suggest that you use their services.

if your application for financial assistance is approved and you are happy to use
Winckworth Pemberton their bills will come direct to us.

I have already asked Simon and Ailsa to research the procedures by which a private
prosecution is initiated; who does what, where, when and how. If you are content to use
their services, Simon suggested a meeting at an early opportunity, it would help me to be
at that meeting and perhaps the three of us could attend together.

If I can be of any assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me. This must be a worrying
time for you. I am on leave 2-6 March 1998 but we are not going away and my secretary,
Nina Hazlehurst will phone me daily with any news.

Yours sincerely

connection with the above subject. I hsve v t o             retired Chief Superintendent
David Duckenfield and Sergeant Trevor Bicnara. Mr Duckenfield has responded and
requests financial assistance for legal representation.

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR LEGAL COSTS;
DAViD DUCKENFIELD AND TREVOR BICHARD

i refer to my letter of 3 March 19S8 and my telephone conversation with Miss Maureen
C-ades on 4 March 1995. I will try to provide the initial information to which Miss Cades
referred

Chief Superintendent David Duckenfieid (retired) made mistakes on the day of the
Hillsborough Disaster, 15 April 1SS9. Hs was clearly called to account for those mistakes
by Lord Justice Taylor’s judicial enquiry. His errors were based on not recognising the
distress of football supporters on the terraces and avowing the over-crowding to continue
Others aiso contributed to tne disaster but similarly failed to recognise over-crowding.

In 1990 the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) directed that there be no prosecutions.
Lord Justice Stuart-Snrsith’s Scrutiny Repcrt finds no fauit in the process by which tne DPP
made his decision and says that no new relevant evidence has been adduced since 1930.

!n the eight years since the DPP's decision, there has been no attempt to initiate a private
prosecution. Some people's disappointment at the Scrutiny Report causes them to talk of
starting a private prosecution. I suggest that ycu agree with me that D3 vid Duckenfiold
acted in good faith.

You will also have an application from Sergeant Trevor Bichard. He operated the police
CCTV system on the day of the disaster. Some people aliege that he lied about the
malfunction of the system in order to cover up police mistakes. These allegations are
reiatively recent. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith considered them and rejected them. 1suggest
that you accept that Sergeant Bichard acted in good faith.

The morale of the Force would be serious!) impaired if financial assistance were not
granted. The prospect of private prosecutions for events nearly nine years ago is alarming
to Mr Cuckcnfieid and Sergeant Sichard. The Force is aware cf the Scrutiny Report
findings and would anticipate that the officers would receive financial assistance to defend
them in these circumstances.

I have written this letter to deal with the issues which Miss Oades very property raised witn
me. i have phrased it in terms which she said would provide the necessary information. !
wish to be able to tel! Mr Duckenfield and Sergeant Bichard cf your decision and would be

D ear M r Wells,

On 15th April 1989 I was a superintendent o f the South Yorkshire Police,
stationed at Hammerton Road Police Station and was on duty in charge o f
the control room at the F.A. cup semi-final at Hillsborough football
stadium, before and during the terrible events that occurred on that day. I
have always maintained that I acted in good faith and to the best o f my
ability. I gave evidence at the public enquiry that followed the tragedy,
and gave evidence at the subsequent Inquest, which resulted in a verdict o f
accidental death on those who lost their lives. At the Inquest I was legally
represented by M r Richard Manning o f W alker Morris, solicitors o f
Leeds. After representation, the legal costs incurred were met by South
Yorkshire Police Authority.

As a result o f the trauma o f the events o f 15th April, 1989, and the
subsequent pressures, South Yorkshire Police retired me on ill health
grounds in August 1992.

On 26th June 1998, my wife accepted a summons on my behalf, a copy o f
which is attached. I deny all the allegations and it is my intention to
contact Mr. Manning and seek his advice, but in order to seek proper
representation I would request that the Police Authority is approached,
with a view' to reimbursing me any legal expenses that I may incur in
defending m yself

Dear Bill

Retired Police Superintendent Bernard MURRAY

The South Yorkshire Police Authority recently resolved to provide financial assistance for
legal representation of serving and retired police officers who face private prosecutions
arising out of the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster of 15 April 1989. The members of the
Authority delegated to you the power to deal with specific requests.

Chief Superintendent (retired) David Duckenfield and Sergeant Trevor Bichard applied for
financial assistance for legal representation and it was granted. I attach an application
from Superintendent (retired) Bernard MURRAY. He v. =s second in command to Mr
Duckenfield at Hillsborough Stadium. Mr MURRAY has received summonses to appear
before Bootle Magistrates on 17 July 1998 to answer criminal charges arising out of the
disaster. Mr Murray received the summonses on 27 June 1998.

In 1990 the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) ruled that there should be no
prosecutions arising from the disaster. In February 1998 Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, an
Appeal Court Judge, found no reason to recommend that the DPP reconsider his ruling.

Mr Murray acted in good faith in his policing of the football match that became the
Hillsborough Disaster. Nine years after the tragedy he faces a prosecution for unlawful
killing which can carry a prison sentence. He will cbntest the charges. It would be
damaging to the morale of the Force if Mr Murray were left to meet his legal costs without
assistance.
I support Mr Murray's application for financial assistance for legal representation . I would
be obliged if you could write to him as soon as possible at his home address and fax your
letter to his solicitor;

Dear Sirs

FINANCIAL  ASSISTANCE    TO    POLICE   OFFICERS                                                                               IN     LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS - O U R CLIENT :M R BE RN ARD M U R R A Y

We refer to your letter by fax of 19 November. First I would restate that it is wholly
proper in my view that former Superintendent Murray should have the support of the
Police Authority insofar as his legal costs are concerned when the allegations made
against him arise from his duties as a then serving Police Officer with your force. I
believe that there are numerous precedents for this view. It would be unconscionable
for my Client to have to use what savings he may have and to even sell his house to
defend himself. He has not himself claimed one penny by way of compensation for
the trauma that he himself has suffered and which he continues to experience both as
a direct consequence of the disaster itself and the continuation of the Prosecution
against him.

I bear in mind the substantial sums paid to some of the people who form the
Hillsborough Families supporters Group and the fact that apparently £0.5 million was
raised at a pop concert in Liverpool last year. I leave you to decide the appropriate
way in which you will provide the information as to the financial support that has
been given.

May we now turn to the issue of an application to the Divisional Court for Judicial
Review. We have already spoken to Leading Counsel. He is strongly of the view
that if the Director of Public Prosecutions decides to allow the Prosecution to continue
and not to intervene to take over the proceedings and then quash them, then this is a
matter that should go to the Divisional Court. It has also been made clear by HFSG
that if the DPP intervenes to take over the proceedings and quash them, they will
immediately make application to the Divisional Court for Judicial Review.

Either way, there is going to be the need for Client to be represented either as
Applicant or Respondent in Judicial Review proceedings.

Dear Miss Oades

FINANCUL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
OUR CLIENT: MR B MURRAY

Thank you for your letter of the 14th December, and we note the decision of the
Authority. Obviously we all anxiously await the decision of the Director of Public
Prosecutions. We are glad to know that our Client's application can be brought before
the Authority without delay because it seems to us that either way he is going to be
a party to judicial review proceedings. If the Director's decision is to take over these
proceedings quash them, then H.F.S.G. will undoubtedly take the matter by way of
judicial review and our Client will be a party. On the other hand if the Director's
decision is not to intevene, Leading Counsel has already advised that our Client should
himself take the matter by way of judicial review. That was why we had sought the
decision in principle.

May we also respectfully refer to the supplementary request for financial assistance,
namely in relation to the challenge to the refusal of the Clerk to the Justices at South
Sefton to pay costs out of Central Funds. If that position is not challenged, then not
only will the Police Authority have to meet costs that in our view properly should
have been paid by Central Funds, but in the event that the D.P.P. does take over this
case and some Order is able to be obtained for further costs to be paid out of Central
Funds, the South Sefton refusal might be a precedent upon which no payment is
actually able to be obtained. What could be even more damaging would be if the
D.P.P. did not intervene, the case went to trial and at some stage, either by way of
submission or even a finding of not guilty by the jury, a similar Order were to be then
made for payment out of Central Funds, and again the South Sefton decision used as
a precedent.
                                                                                  t
At this moment in time, the costs involved are going to be relatively modest because
it will simply mean the liaison of the Cost Draftsmen of ourselves and Winckworth
to make a submission to the Clerk to the Justices at South Sefton.

Dear Mi 5>5> Oades

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
OUR CLIENT : MR B MURRAY

We refer to recent letters namely ours of 20 November and your response of 14
December. You are aware of the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions as
communicated through the Crown Prosecution Service not to intervene, a copy of which
letter is attached hereto. The case came before Leeds Magistrates’ Court on 21 December
and the proceedings have been adjourned to 7 January. That hearing is for a decision as
to bs made as to the issue of a witness summons inter alia against the Assistant Chief
Constable of South Yorkshire and requiring the production of a vast amount of documents.

At the Court Leading Counsel for Mr Murray and Counsel for Mr Duckenfield both
indicated to the Stipendiary' Magistrate that in view of the wholly unsatisfactory decision
of the Director of Public Prosecutions it was intended to proceed by way of an application
for Judicial Review.

There is now attached to this letter a copy of the advice of Leading Counsel and Junior
Counsel for Mr Murray. The way in which they put their very strong opinion is that this
is not only of great importance to the Defendants in this case but raises a matter of public
p o l i c y sofar as all Police Officers are concerned.


We ask the authority to give most urgent attention to this request since it is intended to
start work on Thursday morning at a meeting between ourselves and Leading Counsel.
The application' for Judicial Review will also include an application to stay the
Magistrates’ Court proceedings pending determination of the Judicial Review so to that
extent if it is granted, it may effect a saving of costs in the Magistrates' Court
proceedings. We expect to be able to give you an indication of costs within the next
couple of days.

                                               A D V IC E




 1.     The parlies were notified on IS December 1998 of the decision by the C.P.S. not to
intervene to take over the conduct of this prosecution and withdraw the charges. We consider
that decision to be plainly wrong. No reasons were given. By letter 18 December 1998 from Mr
Murray’s solicitors, the C.P.S. has been asked to explain both the factual basis upon which they
have acted and the policy which they purport to have applied, and to respond by 10.00am today.

2.     In our view, the decision is open to challenge in the High Court by application for judicial
review. Before finally advising and formulating the basis of such a challenge, we would wish to
consider any response the C.P.S. cares to make, although it is likely that we already know how
they have come to their conclusion in view of what they said to HFSG in earlier correspondence.

3        We can indicate that the principal basis of the challenge is likely to be directed to:
         [a] the decision of the D P P in August 1990 that there wcuid be no prosecutions arising
out of the Hillsborough tragedy.
         [b] the Inquest verdicts in March i 991 of'accidental death';
         [cj the Februar>- 1998 conclusion of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny that there was
not any material to be put before the D.P.P. which might cause reconsideration of the 1990
decision not to prosecute;
         [d] the statement of the Home Secretary to the House of Commons on IS February 199$
that he, the Attorney-General and the D.P.P. had considered Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Report
very carefully, and that they had no reason to doubt his conclusions,
         [ej the absence of any genuinely ‘new’ evidence to undermine the earlier decisions.

4       The application is likely to raise questions of law of general public importance upon which
there is, as yet, no clear authority:
         [a] the scope of the right to bring a private prosecution;
         [b] the duty of the D.P.P. to institute and have the conduct of any case where it appears
to him that ( I ) the importance or difficulty of the case makes it appropriate, or (ii) it is otherwise
appropriate for proceedings to be instituted by him: s.3(2)(b) of the Prosecution of Offences Act
 1985;
         [c] the exercise of the D.P.P.’s power to take over a prosecution where net under a duty
to do so: s 6(2);
         [d] the exercise of the power to discontinue proceedings under s 23(3);
        [ej the policies adopted by the D.P.P/C.P S. with regard to the above, with particular
reference to the facts and circumstances of this case;
        [f] the partiality of the private prosecutor.

5.      We must take account of the alternative course open to us, namely to submit to the
Magistrate that the proceedings should be stayed on the basis that they are an abuse of the process
of the court. If judicial review failed, this submission would be made. It cannot realistically be
made before judicial review.

6.        Obviously the chief constable will be concerned about the additional costs involved in a
High Court action. From Mr Murray's standpoint alone, we are satisfied that it is proper to pursue
such an application. One of the arguments we shall advance is that it is inappropriate for the
D.P.P. to stand aside and let this particular private prosecutor continue the conduct of a
prosecution of this seriousness and complexity. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith found that HFSG
submissions included propositions which he characterised as ‘irresponsible’. Our own assessment
is that their claims to have ‘new evidence' are contrived and spurious. These are not the hallmarks
of responsible prosecution which every citizen charged with criminal offences is entitled to expect.
In our view, they are not fit to have continued conduct of the case, and that alone is sufficient
reason for the D.P.P. to have intervened.

7.       But there is a broader issue which the chief constable might wish to take into account. We
are satisfied that the C.P.S./DP.P. are applying inappropriate policies on the question of
intervening to take over and withdraw prosecutions launched by private prosecutors. If the
present position is allowed to pass unchallenged, in every case where police officer is accused of
a criminal offence, but a CPS decision is taken not to prosecute, the aggrieved complainant will
be encouraged to launch a private prosecution in the knowledge t’na: the C.P.S. will stand aside
and let the proceedings continue.

S.     Our arguments are already substantially prepared because we deployed them in our
submissions to C.P.S.

Dear Sirs

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
YOUR CLIENT : MR B MURRAY

We acknowledge your letter of 23 December. The position with the Crown Prosecution
Service is that they have now gone back on the information given that the reasons would
be provided by 24 December. They now say that this will be “in January 1999".

We believe that they will attempt to restate the position as set out in their letter of 27
July 1998 to HFSG in which they talked about “there is clearly no case to answer”.
Against this and in that same letter, they sought to maintain that the Crown Prosecution
Service policy builds on that contained in the Code for Crown Prosecutors and they have
been asked to advise which aspects of the code have been considered in coming to the
conclusion reached and the weight given to any such factors.

We do not believe that they can change the Code for Prosecutors which must be applied.
We have provided you with the advice of Leading Counsel and this is the best that can
be done at this stage save that we do confirm that as soon as we have a definitive
response we will both copy that to you and try to get early advices from Leading
Counsel. You will also be aware of the letter from Winckworth Sherwood and they ask
similar but slightly different questions of the CrowTi Prosecution Service and those will
fall to be considered by you as well.

In relation to the claim for costs from Central Funds further submissions have been sent
by ourselves and Winckworth Sherwood to the Clerk to the Justices at South Sefton.
He has been told that if he now refuses to make payment upon submissions made to him
and upon the advices of our Law Costs Draftsmen then we would intend to seek to make
application for a Judicial Review'.
                                                                                         /



Whilst our costs at this end have been free of any substantial travel element, those of
Winckworth Sherwood in relation to the Leeds Magistrates’ Court proceedings would
c le a r ly have had that greater element because of travel.
                                                                   FAO Miss M V Oades
                                                                      24 December 1998
                                                                                Page 2


Hie reverse is true in relation to the application for Judicial Review because in this case,
we and our Counsel will have to come down to London. Our best guess (and we shall
be speaking to Leading Counsel again) is of the Order of £15,000.00 plus VAT and the
disbursements associated with travel.

We will try to get you a figure insofar as the application for Judicial Review on costs
is concerned.

Finally, we are aware of the last paragraph of your letter and indeed have been copied
with the letter sent by HFSG to yourselves. How can they say that you are not entitled
to take the view' that Officers acted in “good faith” simply because they have charged
them with manslaughter and the Chief Constable of the force has admitted negligence.
If it is right that the Officers did not act in good faith, then why have the Prosecution
not charged them with murder rather than manslaughter based on gross negligence,

Yours faithfully

Dear Miss Oades

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
OUR CLIENT: MR B MURRAY

We have had a long conference with Leading Counsel and Counsel and upon their
advices we would wish to add to our letter of the 24th December. We refer to the letter
of the 22nd December written by H.F.S.G. to yourselves. We do not believe that they
have anv locus standi to seek to intervene in this wav.
        •                                         *




What we do want to tell you however is that Leading Counsel has said that he would
give exactly the same ad\ice to our Client, even if Mr. Murray was in receipt of a Legal
A i d Order. In the mind of Leading Counsel there is absolutely no question on Mr.
Murray's behalf that there is need to make application for judicial review of the decision
of the Director o f Public Prosecutions.

The fundamental issue here is the way in which the Director of Public Prosecutions has
exercised it’s power and the way in which that power should be exercised, Leading
Counsel would certainly very strongly maintain that such argument cannot be dealt with
under an application to the Court to stay the proceedings for abuse of process.

In relation to Mr. Murray personally, it is not correct for H.F.S.G. to suggest that
because Mr. Duckenfield is alleged to have misled people after the event, that Mr.
Murray before the event, had not acted in “good faith”. We would respectfully submit
that if the Prosecution thought that they could prove that Mr. Murray had acted in bad
faith, they would have charged him with murder and not with manslaughter. At no time
has it been suggested that Mr. Murray did not fulfil the criteria of “aiTofficer acting in
good faith"and that is why the indemnity for costs has been given to him.

Leading Counsel also would suggest that a prosecution of this kind has further impact,
namely on the Chief Constable himself. It actually goes further because if the Director’s
decision is upheld, then any Police Officer could find themselves the subject of a
prosecution and with no likelihood that the Director of Public Prosecutions will intervene
to prevent that prosecution going ahead.
                                                                                        Miss M.V. Oades
                                                                                       30 December 1998
                                                                                                 Page 2




            That may be something which is beyond the scope of Section 111 of the Local
            Government Act 1972, but the involvement of the Chief Constable and the possible
            impact upon him is something which in our submission is within that piece of
            legislation.

            We hope that these points are of assistance to you when the Authority comes to consider
            it’s response to H.F.S.G. for our pan we look forward to hearing from you as quickly
            as possible after your forthcoming meeting that authority has been given to extend the
            existing indemnity so as to cover this application for judicial review, as well as any
            necessary challenge to a decision from the Justice’s Clerk at South Sefton.




                                                                                                              •

Dear Miss Oades

OUR CLIENT : MR B MURRAY

Thank you for your letters of 23 December and 30 December. At the date of this
letter the Crown Prosecution Service have still not provided details of the reasons for
the decision not to intervene. A further letter has been written to them today.
However, although of course the application for the Judicial Review has to be based
upon the reasons, having regard to the way in which they set the matter out in earlier
correspondence. Leading Counsel has already given you his written advices that an
application for Judicial Review is entirely justified. He has also dealt with a number
of the matters which were raised in the letter to you from HFSG.

We are concerned about the delay. It would be extremely useful if either on receipt
of this letter or at least at the meeting on 8 January you could confirm that cover will
continue so as to deal with the preparation of the application for Judicial Review even
if the application itself is not lodged with the Court until approval of your meeting of
15 January.

At the moment there is no decision from the Clerk to the Justices at South Sefton.
It may very well take him three or four weeks to make that decision. You appreciate
the significance of the necessity for the challenge and what they therefore seek is a
decision in principal that if he maintains the stance which he has so far indicated that
an application for Judicial Review may be submitted. Once we have knowledge of that
position we would get you some actual figures, but we would not anticipate that they
would be in any way as substantial as the principal matter.

Ypurs sincerely____________

Dear Miss Oades

OUR CLIENT : MR B MURRAY

We refer to your letter of 6 January. It has not been necessary thus far for us to
consider our Client’s financial position. W’e are now however seeking details of this
from him and with it we will try to assess his likely financial eligibility for the grant of
both a Civil Legal Aid Certificate and a Criminal Legal .Aid Order. We believe that you
will either have or have easy access to details of the pension payable to our Client and
that will probably give you a pretty direct answer as to financial eligibility.

We will ny to deal with our view on the further representations that you have received
from .Ann Adlmgton. However, we are sure that Counsel advising the Authority will
have regard to the Code of Conduct for Prosecutors and we are very concerned that the
very attempt to make such representations to you give rise to great concern under that
Code. As to Mr Hicks, whilst one is of course very conscious of his grievous loss of
his two daughters, the Authority must carefully consider whether he can possibly have
any locus standi.

Yours sincerely

Dear Miss Oades

Adlington -v- Duckenfield and M urray

I refer to your fax of 19 November and our subsequent telephone discussion.

I am grateful for your advice and courtesy in letting us know the position which of course if
now in the public domain.

In regard to any judicial review proceedings, I note your advice, and have seen Mr
Manning's letter of 23 November. I echo his comments that it would appear that whatever
decision is taken by the DPP regarding intervention, it is likely that judicial review
proceedings will ensue. I would be grateful therefore if you could consider this letter as a
formal request for financial assistance to Mr Duckenfield to be continued to meet his legal
costs and disbursements in those proceedings. I will naturally provide further information
once we have any formal correspondence from the DPP or the CPS, and would be happy to
clarify any queries that you have.

When we spoke recently. I also raised the question of our claim for costs from central funds,
pursuant to the Prosecution of Offences Act which we are pursuing with the Clerk to the
Justices. South Setton Magistrates Court in regard to the original proceedings. At the
present time the Clerk to the Justices has not accepted the claim, and has requested further
comments. I am attending to those submissions, but in the event the Clerk makes a formal
decision to deny the claim it is my view that a challenge to that decision is justified, both on
legal and commercial grounds, given the potential implication for the Leeds proceedings. I
will naturally keep you advised of the progress of that application but thought it may be
helpful to raise the question with you now for your early consideration.

Dear Miss Oades

Adlington -v- Duckenfield and M u rray

I refer to my letter of 10 December last in regard to judicial review proceedings, and
confirm that we now have the advice from the Crown Prosecution Service regarding our
request for intervention and enclose herewith a copy of their letter of 18 December 1998.

I have discussed this matter with Leading Counsel and am pleased to enclose herewith a
short memorandum of advice regarding the desirability of making an application for judicial
review of this decision.

On the basis of that advice, which I strongly echo, may I formally request that the Police
Authority agree to underwrite Mr Duckenfield's costs of an application for judicial review
of the CPS/DPP decision not to intervene in this matter.

It may assist you to know that we anticipate the framework for this will involve initially
preparation of an Application with a supporting Affidavit which Counsel hopes can be
prepared within the first 2 weeks of January. The documentation would then be submitted
to the Crown Office of the High Court here in London, and it is likely that an oral
application will have to be made before a Judge, requiring the attendance of Counsel, for
leave to move for judicial review. The prosecution may or may not be heard on that
application, depending upon the Court's approach, and we are confident that leave will be
granted. It is likely that the Court will order that the judicial review proceed expeditiously,
and there is some possibility that the full substantive hearing, which will take several days,
could be heard before the present committal date of 19 April 1999. A very rough and ready
cost estimate for this exercise I would put in the region of £10.000-£15,000.

         I hope the above assists, and naturally my client would be greatly reassured by an early
         positive response from you in regard to the Police Authority decision. In the short term,
         however. I would be grateful if you could let me know the mechanics of consideration of
         this request so that we have some idea o f the relevant timetable.

         Yours sincerely

Dear Miss Oades

Adlington -v- Duckenlleld and M urray

1 refer to our recent exchange, and your letters of 23 and 30 December. \ o u have ol course
received mine of 23 December, and for the Authority’s consideration I enclose a further
Note from Counsel specifically dealing with the costing issue generally.

I am grateful for vour advice regarding the proposed meetings of the Authority and will
await your advice as to deliberations.

You have requested an update on the claim for costs from central funds from South Sefton
Magistrates Court. As you know I have been liaising with Mr Manning of Walker Morris
reuardinu this matter, and I propose writing further this week to the clerk to the Court in
response to his original letter, a copy of which I will forward on to you. I remain hopeful
that the Clerk will reconsider the position and allow, as a matter of principle, the claim for
costs, which will thereafter leave us arguing about the quantum. If the clerk maintains his
present approach and denies the claim, an application for judicial review of his decision will
be required. This review will be much more of an administrative process, and I anticipate
the costs of such to be in the region of £5.000-.£7.500.

  The importance o f this aspect is of course that it relates to the basis of our instructions from
 Mr Duckenileid. notwithstanding that the bills have been met by the Police Authority. This
 is clearly an important matter of principle, and if the clerk's approach is correct, it would
 preclude us from making a successful claim for costs from central funds in the event that the
 present prosecution is successfully defended. Clearly the costs involved-in the defence will
 be considerable and we think it of the utmost importance to resolve this issue, because we
 believe the clerk to clearly wrong in his assessment of the law and it is important to state
 this, for the benefit of both Mr Duckenfield and the Police Authority so that we can proceed
 to deal with the defence with the question of entitlement to costs reimbursement clarified at
 the earliest time.

 Naturallv if 1 can advise you further regarding this matter please do not hesitate to let me
 know.

RE DAVID DUCKENFIELD




        NOTE
                     RE DAVID DUCKENFIELD




                                  NOTE




      This    note   is written      in response          to the   letter


from the H.F.S.G. dated 22nd December                1998.




      The      letter         completely         misrepresents          the


evidential position in this              case.     For the avoidance

of    doubt    the   Taylor       Inquiry        concluded       that    no


recommendation          for     prosecution         against        either


defendant would be made.            Thereafter all the evidence


was examined by two Queen's Counsel instructed by the


Dire ctor of Public Prosecutions they concluded that no

charges     should   be   brought    against       either    defendant.


All   the   evidence was       examined     again    at    the   coroners


inquest where the verdict of the jury was inconsistent


with any crime having been committed.                     An attempt by
                                    K U DO'S t>t3dH.X 3           IU : U1715935099




the    H.F.S.G.        to    overturn          that        verdict    by     judicial

review      failed.         Thereafter          following u n substantiated


allegations       of    relevant          fresh           evidence    Lord    Jut -ice


Stuart-Sroith conducted a scrutiny of all the evidence


both   "new"    and old.            He considered the advice of the


two leading counsel and he also made no recommendation


for prosecution concluding that

       “I do    not         consider       that       there      is   any    m a t erial

       which should be put before the Director of Public


       Prosecutions           or the Police Complaints                      A u t hority

       which      might        cause          them          to   reconsider          the


       decisions they have already taken."




       Against this background it is frankly a s t o n ishing

to find the allegation that the officers c o ncerned did


not act in good faith still being advanced.                                 If it was

the view of the authority that the officers                                  acted    in

good faith then powerful and cogent reasons                                  exist to

support that view.




       At    every          stage     the       H.F.S.G.          have      sought     a


prosecution and at every stage the arguments advanced


on their behalf have failed.
        The letter from the H.F.S.G. contains a number of


factual inaccuracies, it is quite wrong to allege that

the    C.P.S.,       Police       Complaints             Authority       and    Coroner

were    all    misled.            This    allegation            has    already           been


reje cted     by    the     Divisional          Court,          when   the     H.F.S.G.


applied       for    judicial       review          of    the    coroners          verdict


and by       Lord    Justice       Stuart-Smith             whose       scrutiny was


de s i g n e d to address this very issue.                        There never was

any    cover-up       by    the    South       Yorkshire          Police       and       this

allegation          was     expressly          rejected          by    Lord        Justice


Stuart-Smith.




        It    is    perhaps        unwise       to        speculate       as       to     the


motives       behind        the    letter       from        the       H.F.S.G.            The


position       in    law    is that       The       Home    Office       Circular          of


17th February 1998 accu rately sets out the position as


I understand          it.     The guidance of the Horae Office                             is


not     "highly       dubious"           as    alleged,           even       though        it

defeats       the    submission           of    the        H.F.S.G.            There       is


nothing "extraordinary"                  in the view that the officers


acted in good faith.                The 1998 circular does provide,


contrary       to    the    assertion          of    the    H.F.S.G.,          a    lawful

basis    to    provide       for     the      provision           of   funds        to    the
                                                                   rn u d - oo




defendants.    Whether the authority decides to provide

that   funding      is   obviously     a   matter   for    their

discretion    but   they have   the   rignt   to provide   it in


the circumstances of this case.

 Dear Sir


 Xdlm^on \ Muira\. Adiinuton v Duckcntield


 1         i am. the prosecutor in the above case, in which the defendants are charged before the
            Leeds Magistrates Court with serious offences arising out of the disaster at the
            Hillsborough Football Ground in April I9$9. I write on the advice of leading counsel,
            as solicitor to the Hillsborough Family Support Group to express concern about the
            decision to fund the defence of these two men. As you know, the defendants were
            senior police officers on duty at the ground when the disaster occurred. Both are
            charged with manslaughter of two representative victims, and with misfeasance. Mr
            Duckenfield is also charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice.

 2         it has recently been admitted publicly by Mr lan Daines. Assistant Chief Constable,
            that the South Yorkshire Police Authority has agreed to fund the defence of these two
            men We ha\e suspected this for some time. The purpose of this letter is to argue that
            the decision to provide finance appears to have been made irrationally and unlawfully.

H      Minute 86 of the South Yorkshire Police Authority Meeting or 50th October
        [
1.     The South Yorkshire Police Authority Scheme cr Delegation.
J      A document headed "Standing Orders. Interpretation. Issued January 1906"
       on the headed paper of the South Yorkshire Police Authority.

The Home Office Circular No 77/87. suggests that, in the case o* a private
prosecution, where a police officer has been acquitted and has not been awarded all his
costs, the police authority may make up the difference. It also suggests that, in the
case o f a private prosecution, the authority should prov ide or fund leg?.! advice and/or
representation if the authority is "‘.satisfied" that the officer has acted “in good faith
and has exerciscd his judgment “reasonably".

The Home Office Circular of 17,k February 1998. 4/1998. replaces with immediate
effect the 1987 circular, and suggests that under the very wide terms of section 111(1)
of the Local Government Act 1972. “it could be argued" that payment of money to
"officers (either former or serving) involved in criminal proceedings would in some
\\a\ facilitate or be conducive to a police authority s broad functions. The Circular
emphasises that a police authority must take its own advice. It is noticeable that the
''guidance" has been prepared after consultation with “ACPO". the Superintendents
Association, the Police Federation, and the Association of Police Authorities, it does
not purport to be an independent legal opinion.

This Circular se e ms to have coincided almost exactly with the report of the "Scrutiny"
of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith in February of this year. I note that on 27"'’ February this
vear. your authority agreed to authorise the Clerk and Treasurer to consider
applications from officers, serving or retired, for financial assistance in relation to
possible pri\ ate prosecutions arising out of the ‘’Scrutiny".

For a reason which is not clear, the Resolution was taken under the replaced 1987
Circular There is therefore no lawful authority to validate the decision taken on that
riav. The assertion, recorded in the minutes, that the members of the Authority
•'remain of the opinion that the officers acted in good faith" is extraordinary. The
Enquiry of Lord Justice Taylor of 1989 found that there had been negligence, and
blamed the two defendants (among other police officers). The failure of these two to
seal oft'the tunnel to the central pens at the Leppings Lane'end of the ground was a
•■blunder of the first magnitude", and the immediate cause of death. The then Chief
Constable of South Yorkshire Police, unequivocably accepted these findings.

Further. Lord Taylor found, at page 16, paragraph 98 of his Interim Report that Mr
Duckenfseld misled Graham Kelly and Glen Kinon of the FA and Graham Mackreli ot
     Sheffield Wednesday, at a time when he knew there were fatalities (and that there
     would therefore be an inquest and no doubt other formal inquiries) Duckenfield
     indicated that ;i gate had been forced and there had been an inrush of supporters, and
     pointed out to them the fate allegedly forced on the screen.

     In 1998. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith upheld these findings after his ‘'Scrutiny", referring
     scathingly to Duckenfieid’s “disgraceful lie” .

     In July 1991. the Police Complaints Authority directed that charges of neglect of duty
     be preferred against both men. These charges were never determined because the
     Chief Constable of South Yorkshire retired Mr Duckenfie’d on "health grounds” , and
     il was thought to be unfair to try Mr Murray,

     It is impossible in the light of this history' to understand how your authority could have
     been satisfied in February 1998 that ‘'the officers had acted in good faith”; and also
     impossible to understand how the other condition in the 1987 Circular, namely, that
     the officers had exercised their judgment reasonably, could be thought to have been
     satisfied The minutes show that this condition was not even considered.

i'J'JS C i r c l t h t r


    The 1998 Circular was not applied If it had been, it would have become clear in my
    v iew that its terms were not met. and that there was no lawful authority for the
    provision of tax-payers' money in this wav to fund the defence in this case. There is
    no statutory authority. There is a limited power in relation to civil proceedings to pay
    damages and costs; but no power even.in civil proceedings.to fund an action brought
    against an individual officer. Section SS of the Police Act 1996 deals with “Liability
    for w ronuful acts of constables”, and allows for the provision of costs incurred and nor
    recovered

    Parliament Las not provided for the payments of any fines incurred by constables; or
    for reimbursement of costs incurred and not recov ered. To have done so would have
    been surprising, since criminal liability is individual and personal. You v.jll note that
    the Circular indicated at the higher.: that “it could be argued” that to allow the payment
    to be made to officers, (either former or retired) involved in criminal proceedings
    would "in some way facilitate or be conducive to a police authority’s broad functions.
    For example, failure to provide financial assistance could adversely affect the morale of
    the force if officers had to meet their costs after acquittal.*’

    This is legal nonsense. The case law indicates that section 111(1) of the 1972 Act
    cannot be used in this way. The practice in relation to costs incurred by an acquitted
    person is set out in the Practice Ditvcrian (Clasts in Criminal Proceedings) .93 Cr.
    App.R.S which provides that a person acquitted after trial On indictment should
    normally nave his costs paid out of central funds except where the defendant has
    brought suspicion upon himself andltas misled the prosecution into thinking the case
    against him .\s stronger than it is; or where he has'been acquitted on a meritless
    technicality How can it be said that police morale would suffer if the officers of a
        force heard that one uf its members had been refused its costs on one of the reasonable
        grounds set out in this direction?


15      In any e\ent the South Yorkshire Police Authority seems to have gone way beyond
        (ins highly dubious guidance in the 1998 Circular and authorised, in February 199S.
        any financial assistance to be given by the Clerk and Treasurer in respect of
        applications from serving or retired officers tor potential and future criminal
        proceedings, in which, of course, a defendant could be convicted. (Is counsel
        instructed on this basis able to advise that a defendant plead guilty9).


/ k'/cgiition and i'.xc!ttsion o f the public

16      Maureen Oades' Setter to me of 25"' September 199$ says that the public were
        excluded from that part of the meeting when this matter was dealt with as it was a
        matter relating to “any action taken in connection with the prevention, investigation or
        prosecution of any crime." It seems to have been the basis for granting the financial
        assistance that there was no crime at a!!, and that the officers had acted in good faith
        In any event it is submitted that paragraph 14 of Schedule I2A to the Local
        Government Act 1972.'refers to prosecutions by South Yorkshire Police and not by a
        private prosecutor against two former police officers.

i7       Furthermore. 1 do not understand how such a decision, ever, if it could be laufully
        made, could be delegated to the Clerk and Treastlfer. The Authority resolution of 27
        February i 998 purports to delegate, absolutely, the decision making process to the
        “Clerk and Treasurer" who is one and the same person. -The report presented to the
        Authority on      October was a joint report of the Clerk and Treasurer and the Chief
        Constable i understand that the Clerk and Treasurer is not a Solicitor. It is implicit in
        vour standing order 5 2 5. that any consideration of applications for financial assistance
        for Sega! proceedings ought to be UndertaKen by a person who is legally qualified and
        would thus understand the danger of granting open-ended financial provision.

Smnc feumrox ui the citnxnt criminal proceedings

1'6     You also .vaguest in that letter that this delegation “was not viewed as a delegation
        which would extend beyond six months*’. This may have been because Mr Daines,
        Assistant Chief Constable of the South Yorkshire Police, publicly asserted earlier this
        year that he believed that any private prosecutions would "fall at the first hurdle". Did
        he repeat this at the meeting of 2 T" 'February'? We do not know what applications have
        been made by* Mr Murray and Mr Duckenfield, but we assume, for reasons that appear
        below, that authority has been given for any judicial review proceedings of the CPS
        decision not to discontinue the case, and for leading and junior counsel to appear at
        old style committal proceedings, as well as at trial.

10.     On 1S'1’ December 199$, the Crown Prosecution Service, after five months of careful
        st uc! v, reiected the applications of the defendants to take over und discontinue the

                                                -4-
prosecutions. It is clear that the criminal proceedings are now likely to be protracted,
complex and very expensive.




The prosecutions are straightforward. We enclose for your guidance a copy ot the
informations presented to the Leeds Magistrates Court last July on the bas;s of v.h-.ch
she summonses were issued. You will see that the allegations are based upon the
findings of the Taylor Enquiry in 19S9. supported by evidence that has come to the
Family Support Group in 1997-98. Negligence has been admitted again and again by
the Chief Constable in court proceedings. It has never been disputed that the acts
alleged against the defendants were the acts of negligence that caused the deaths of the
96 people.

Before the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service was announced on 18'1'
December, the solicitor for Mr Murray indicated that it was highly likely that an
adverse decision of the CPS would be challenged by judicial review proceedings. At
the hearing of the case before the Leeds Magistrates Court on 2P' December, it was
made clear by leading and junior counsel for Mr Murray, in the presence of his
solicitor. Mr Manning, and by junior counsel for Mr Duckentield, that a decision had
already been made to seek judicial review of the CPS decision. The magistrate was
told this by counsel for the defendants when he was dealing with the question? of
timetable and voluntary disclosure of documents.

           it was also made dear, although a concluded decision had been made to
H o w e v e ;.
apply for judicial review, that the defendants had asked the CPS for their “reasons":
alternatively, their "policy" behind the decision, and that those reasons of policy might
be recei\ed by 2‘!‘"December.

No legally-aided lawyers could proceed in this way. Professional obligations exist
which require that a lawyer must assess the prospects of success before committing
hard-pressed public funds to an expensive application for judicial review. I am advised
by lending counsel that the prospects of quashing the CPS decision in such proceedings
are smali on the following, among other, grounds. The CPS have told us all what
criteria ihey were applying; the defendants argued that the CPS were in a good
position to, assess the public interest involved in the prosecution; the CPS, Police
Complaints Authority and Coroner were aii misled by a cover-up by the South
Yorkshire police, the magnitude of which has become apparent only after the Home
Ofrice ordered the release of documents this year; and the defendants have alternative
remedies in the Magistrates’ court.

The fact that the court was assured that applications for judicial review- would be made
suggests that the South Yorkshire Police Authority has already agreed, before the CPS
decision, to fund these applications, irrespective of their merits. Counsel would not
have told the court that the applications would be made, if funding was no: in place.
Neither would they have told counsel for South Yorkshire Police of their decision to
apply to the High Court; they knew that the fact of impending applications was

                                        -5-
           material to decisions that the South Yorkshire police and the CPS were making that
           day about voluntary disclosure to the prosecution of documents in their possession It
           is clear that both those bodies decided to defer any decision on voluntary disclosure
           because of the assurance from counsel that judicial review applications would be
           lodged ("in the first two weeks of January") on behalf of both defendants.


25        The prosecution and the Court have also been told that both defendants have estimated
          tint four weeks at least will be needed at committal proceedings. The court has set
          aside four weeks beginning I9:h April 1099, and the time was chose to accord with the
          convenience of leading counsel for the defence. The court has been told that two
          leading counsel will appear, one for each defendant. No doubt two juniors will also
          appear, and two solicitors. Leading counsel for Mr Murray has indicated that there
          will also be an abuse of process application to the magistrate to stay the proceedings
          He intends to argue that this should be heard on a different occasion from the
          committal, and before it I suspect that the defendants will seek leave to move for
          judicial review of any adverse decision upon inis issue. This is hardly surprising as
          vour Authority does not appear to have placed any restriction as to the amount or
          duration of the financial assistance to the defendants.

20        I am advised bv leading counsel that the prosecution his a "strong prima facie case on
        , the charges alleged; and that an abuse o f process application is likely to fail. We have
          a mass of evidence ir. our possession'which has come to us in the last year, indicating
          that the South Yorkshire Police force has_covered up facts w hich are embarrassing as
          to the nature and extent of its admitted negligence, and that the C PS, Coroner and
          Police Complaints A u t h o r i t y , intar alia. were misled when they were pursuing their
          various enquiries betw een |9$9 and 1992. 1 shall willingly help you further about tr.is
          on request

2?        Ofcoursc, the trial of this matter could take many months. From all these facts, you
          wil! see that the exposure of the South Yorkshire taxpayer (in relation to its own costs,
          let alone ours) is of the order of millions of pounds. 1 should make it clear that neither
          1 nor the Hillsborough Family Support Croup, on whose behalf I act, wish in any way
          to deprive either defendant of the means to conduct a proper defence to these charges.
          They should surely apply, like anyone else, for legal aid if they are unable to fund the
          costs of the defence thimselves. In that event they would be subject to the usual
          restraints and disciplines of the legal aid system. I believe that the defence, with access
          to public funds'from your authority, are seeking at present to inflict unnecessary
          expenses upon us by recourse to every possible type of legal hearing, in the knowledge
          that we do not have such access, and are instead dependent on private donations and
          fund-raising events. Neither defendant lives in South Yorkshire, but the South
          Y orkshi re Police has a strong interest of its own in the discharge or acquittal of these
          defendants

                  Note of a meeting oo25 November 1997.


                  P resen t     -        L a r d J u s tic e S tu a r t-S m tih
                                         M r W eih , C h ie f O jp c e r c f South Y orkshire p o lic e

                  Mr Wells visited Lord Justicc Stuart-Smith at US-S’s request


                  F o lic t e v id e n c e:

                  2.      Lord Justice Stuarc-Smith recapped the process by which officers involved in
                  the disaster were asked. to provide full recollections of it, and these were then scat on,
                  after ‘vetting’ to the West Midlands police who were collecting evidence for the
                  Taylcr Inquiry. The ‘vetting’ consisted of removal of expression of opinion and
                  intemperate language. Mostly this was Quite proper bur there was a tendency it,
                  remove opinion ana intemperate language about senior police officers tut leave in
                  similar material about tnisbchaviour by Liverpool fans.                       ’    '

                  3.      This plainly did not affect Lord Taylor, because he made serious criticisms of
                  senior officers. But It was of concern that there seemed to be a pattern of changing
                  this material in this way. LJS-S noted that Sheffield Wednesday FC also took
                  statements from their people and could cut out what they -wanted so iong as the
                  authors were prepared to sign them.


                  A s s b la n C jL b v S o u th Y o r k s h ir e p e l l e t


                  4.    LJS-S had good cooperation from the South Yorkshire police. He wasn't
                  aware o f any ixxiica.tLem that the police wtse dragging their fest Over requests for
                  information from him or from the Hillsborough families.

                  5.      RW said the force were committed to Openness. There was an element in the
                  Family Support Group which seemed to be trying to make them stumble ard appear
                  ns 'S they -.vere lioleir.^ up rcScise of information * for instance * recent request for
                  sheaves of ‘body files’ had » slight feding of red herrings being drawn across the trail.
                  But the force would still respond as quickly as it could.

                  6.    LJ^-S said k "would help him to be «We to show that the police ha2 acted
                  promptly on requests f r o m the Sanities - the Support Group might well n y he had cut

 his scrutiny short before they ha d been abic to assemble their m a t e r i a l . RW would
 let US-S have a schedule of wh2 t the force bad supplied the families with and whin.


 MrMucAcnflctif
 7.     LJS^S said that on* person he had met bad said that RW bad icld them that Mr
 Duckenileld would be prosecuted, and that it was announced, very soon afterwards
 that he wouldn’t be.

 8.      RW was sure he had not guaranteed that anybody would be prosecuted. That
 was not in his gift. He might have said that or.« or two officers might face discipline
 - and two did* though in the event neither went before a tribunal.


 Liability an d exfirvxrtons o f tu rret

 9.     LJS-S hid had no dear answer as to whether South Yorkshire Police had
 admitted liability or simply acceptcd it - albeit that this wsj, in I=gal terms, a
 distinction without a differec.ce. RW recalled that he was continually going on public
 platforms to express the rorce’s regret An example was of his TV interview on the
 day of the inquest verdicts. Me gave LJS-S a "videotape of this.

 10.    RW acknowledged that South Yorkshire police had made four main errors at
 Hillsborough. These were

                  not breaking out of ihe assumption that there had to be a 3 o'clock
                  kick-off

                  not foreseeing where the fans would go after Mr Marshall had (rightly)
                  had Gate C opened (this was the critical error)

                  not noticing o r taking full account o f the building up of pressure
                  in the pens behind the go*I

                  not being able to distinguish between distress and disorder.

 11.     LJS-S noted that these were the things which Lord Taylcr had criticised. The
 police disputed why they had lost control of the cro w d outside the Leppings Lane
 gates.

 12.     RW recalled that Lord Taylor had drawn a distinction between junior and
 senior police and between those seaior police who realised what was going on and did
 something about it and those who did not. His aims in dealing with the issue over the
 years had been to be as open as possible, to express sorrow, both personal tad
 professional, over what had gene wrong and to make sure that the forte stayed
 capable o f doing whtt it should be doing.

30      A        I do u n d e r s t a n d that there were one o r two o f f i c e r s who
31                   w e r e a l i t t l e bit u p s e t that t heir s t a t e m e n t s h a d been

33                   refused        to sign,          to b e honest.          I imagine        that    that might

             Dear Sirs

£            OUR CLIENT : MR BERNARD MURRAY
f'
V
             Thank you for your telephone call of 18 January and we note your instructions on
             behalf of the South Yorkshire Police Authority.

             You will be aware that those instructing you have passed a resolution providing
             financial support to our Client in relation to the criminal proceedings which had been
             instituted under a private Prosecution by Ann Adlington.

             Although we have been advised by the Clerk that the Authority have sought certain
             advices from Leading Counsel, we must say that we do not understand why those
             advices suggest that the Authority should have investigated the availability of Legal
             Aid to our Client.




             Finally, we know of no precedent where a person who was a serving Police Officer
             at the time of the alleged commission of an offence has not been given ail necessary
             financial assistance, by his then employer, to defend those criminal charges arising
             from his employment, unless it can be shorn that he did not act “in good faith” and
             no such allegation has ever been raised in relation to our Client, even by the
             Prosecution.




                                                     To have had the plank of the financial assistance of your

               and we hope in the circumstances that the Authority wall very quickly resolve to
               continue the financial assistance already the subject o f the resolution and to extend its
               scope so as to cover the application for Judicial Review in relation to the decision of
               the Director of Public Prosecutions.

                  Dear Sirs

£                OUR CLIENT : MR B MURRAY
                 YOUR CLIENT : SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY

                  We acknowledge receipt o f your letter of 26 January. We confirm that it is the
                  writer’s intention to make submissions at the meeting on 5 February and we note the
                  rules laid down.

                  As we indicated in our telephone conversation, the nature of the consideration appears
                  to have changed. The starting point was our request for additional funding to cover
                  and application for-Judicial Review of the decision of the Director of Public
                  Prosecutions not to intervene. That still falls to be determined. The Committee then
                  determined to consider and listen to submissions made on behalf of HFSG as to
                  whether the Authority should continue to fund. Finally, the Authority having sought
                  Leading Counsel’s advices, seems to have had doubt cast on the decision to fund as
                  minuted.

 0^              We really need some clarification from you as to the words in your letter “the issue
                 of funding”. For our part we do not see how the Authority can resile from its minutes
                 decision. If this is one of the issues, then without prejudice to our preparedness to
                 accept such review, we are surely entitled to know the reason why Counsel has
                 advised that there ought to be reconsideration of that original decision. In view of the
                 timetable could we please have your urgent advices.

                  Yours faithfully

2.        Ar. o f f i c e r who is the subject of a p u b l i c prosec u t i o n for an
a l l e g e d offer.ce committed while carrying out his duties as a police
o f f i c e r is ir. the sane position as any o ther d e f e n d a n t and must be
e x p e c t e d to bea r the costs of his defence.            If he is acquitted, he
should,           like      any    other   defendant,    loo k   to      the     court fcr
reiriursemer.t of his expenses.                 If the costs are not paid, or not
p a i d in full from central funds, the p o l i c e aut h o r i t y are in a
p o s i t i o n to decide, on the full facts, w h e t h e r or not to rake a
p a y m e n t to the officer or to the Police F e d e r a t i o n if they have
p r o v i d e d the funding.          There na y be cases w h e r e it is proper to
p r o v i d e legal advi ce and/or legal r e p r e s e n t a t i o n even where the
o f f i c e r is found guilty.          This c a y arise for e x a m p l e in test cases
where         the     officer     has  been  carrying    out    a p r a c t i c e hitherto
a p p r o v e d of b u t is found guil ty as a result of tha t practice being

4.      A p o l i c e o f f i c e r should be able to c arry cut his duties m the
confidence           that,       if he acts    in goo d f a i t h     and exercises his
j u d g e m e n t r easonably, his poli ce a u t h o r i t y w i l l support him.     If,
in a cas e w h e r e a e e r i e r of the public br i n g s a p r o s e c u t i o n against
an officer, the authority is s a tisfied t h a t the officer has actea
in t his w a v . th e auth ority should c r o v i d e or fund, legal advice
and/or representation.

5.       VTnere a c o u r t decides         that a p r o s e c u t i o n b r o u g h t against an
o f f i c e r w a s not brought in good faith, it m a y o r d e r the prosecutor
t o p a y th e w h o l e or any part of the costs i n c u r r e d by the defence;
again, if t h e o f f i c e r is acquitted on indictment, his costs may be
m e t fro m c e n t r a l funds.         In eith er of t h e s e cases, the question cf
t h e p o l i c e a u t h o r i t y providing financial s u p p o r t to the officer may

authority            should       consider w h e t h e r to   reimburse          any costs not
cov ered,         t a k i n g into account the reasons,              if any, g i v e n by the

and an y sums p a i d in connection wTith the s e t t l e m e n t of a claim.
This         provision               applies  to  actions    against          officers      of  the

a rea u n d e r m u t u a l aid arrangements, and s p e c i a l c onstables for the

the      a u t h o r i t y will wish to c o n s i d e r in p a r t i c u l a r whether the
o f f i c e r c o n c e r n e d acted in good faith and e x e r c i s e d his judgement
reasonably.               W h e r e the court finds for the officer, he m a y seek his
costs         f rom th e plaintiff; should the c osts not be awarded                             or

           Dear Chief Officer/Clerk,

p          This circular:

               provides updated guidance to police authorities on financial assistance to police
               officers in legal proceedings.

           • distinguishes between officers involved in civil proceedings, criminal
             proceedings and other types of legal proceedings.-

           • replaces HO Circular 77/1987.
Introduction

1.      It is important that police officers should be able to earn' out their duties in
the confidence that their police authority will support them, if they act in good faith
and exercise their judgement reasonably. The following guidance, which has been
prepared in consultation with ACPO, the Superintendents Association, the Police
Federation and the Association of Police Authorities, should be read against this
principle.

Civil Proceedings

2.      Under section 88 (1) of the Police Act 1996 which re-enacts section 48(1) of
the Police Act 1964, chief officers are liable for torts committed by officers under
their direction and control. Section 88(2) provides that any damages or costs
awarded against the chief officer and any costs they incur themselves (which are not
recovered) should be met from police authority funds.

3.     Alternatively, a court may award damages against individual police officers.
Section 88(4) of the Police Act 1996 empowers a police authority wto such an extent
as appears to it to be appropriate” to pay any damages or costs awarded against
officers (this includes both officers of other forces serving in the police area under
mutual aid arrangements and special constables), any costs incurred by the officers
themselves and any sum paid in connection with the settlement of a claim. It is for
police authorities to decide when to make assistance available, taking account of the
circumstances of a particular case.

4.     Police authorities are reminded that the discretionary powers in sections
88(4) and (5) of the Act, enabling them to provide financial assistance to officers
involved in legal proceedings, apply to civil proceedings only. Sections 88(4) and
88(5) may also apply to police officers who were members at the time of the action
which gave rise to the claim but who are no longer members.

Crim inal Proceedings

5.     Section 88(4) does not apply to criminal proceedings, but police authorities
may wish to consult their legal advisers as to whether they have any other power to
provide such assistance (whether in respect of private prosecutions or prosecutions
brought by the CPS). In this context, they may wish to note that section 111(1) o f
the Local Government Act 1972 enables police authorities to do anything ‘"which is
calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the discharge of any of their
functions". The provision applies to provincial authorities (but not the Metropolitan
or City of London police) by virtue of Section 146A of the 1972 Act (as inserted
by Schedule 14 to the Local Government Act 19S5 and amended by Schedule 4 of
the Police and Magistrates’ Courts Act 1994). It could be argued that-to allow
payment to be made to officers (either former or serving) involved in criminal
proceedings would in some way facilitate or be conducive 10 z police authority's
"broad functions. For example, failure to provide financial assistance could
 adversely affect the morale of the force if officers had to meet their own costs after
an acquittal.

6.      It is for individual police authorities to decide in the particular circumstances
of a case, and on the basis of legal advice, whether to make financial assistance
available to officers in criminal proceedings.

O ther tvpes of legal proceedings

7.     Similarly, there is no express statutory authority for providing financial
assistance in proceedings brought against police officers in tribunals other than the
courts. It is for police authorities outside London (bearing in mind the
recommendations of chief officers) to decide whether to make financial assistance
available to officers (either former or serving) involved in Public Inquiries and
Tribunals. Police authorities will therefore need to consider whether section 111(1)
of the Local Government Act 1972 provides sufficient scope to enable financial
assistance to be given in any particular case. In this respect tribunals may include
certain industrial tribunals where it is clear that officers have acted in good faith in
pursuance of their duties and the interest of the force as a whole is involved. It is to
be expected that, where appropriate, the service's grievance procedure
arrangements should be exhausted before there is recourse to legal proceedings.
These arrangements are set out in Home Office Circular 16/93, issued 10 March
1993.

8.     There are specific provisions in the Race Relations Act 1976 and the Sex
                 Act 1975 for compensation, costs and expenses awarded against the
D iscrim in atio n
chief officer of police and any sum required for settlement, if approved by the
police authority, to be paid from the police fund.

        There is no express statutory authority’ for providing financial assistance to
an officer wishing to initiate court proceedings. The considerations set out in
paragraphs 5 to 7 above apply to such cases.

CONFIDENTIAL: SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT
SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY

5 FEBRUARY 1999

REPORT OF THE CHIEF CONSTABLE

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 1989: Financial Assistance to Officers Facing Private
Prosecutions


1.0   Introduction

1.1   With the papers previously circulated to members, your Clerk and Treasurer
      included advice from his solicitors (Garretts). As mentioned in the last paragraph of
      my previous report I have obtained advice from Counsel (Ms Louise Varty) which I
      summarise herewith.


2.0   Legal Advice to the Chief Constable from Counsel

2.1   I attach Ms Varty’s advice. She supplies answers to the following questions:

      Question 1

      Does a Police Authority have the discretion to pay the legal costs involved in
      defending a private prosecution against serving or retired officers?

      Answer; Yes. There is power to grant financial assistance.

      Question 2

      Has the South Yorkshire Police Authority exercised its discretion properly in
      respect of Duckenfield and Murray?

      Answer: Yes. That power has been properly applied in granting assistance.

      Question 3

      Can the Authority now add a condition (Legal Aid) to the undertaking already
      given to Duckenfield and Murray?

      Answer: No. It would be inappropriate to require the officers to apply for Legal Aid.

      Question 4

      Can the Authority pay the cost of Duckenfield and Murray bringing a judicial
      review challenge to the DPP’s decision?

      Answer: Yes. Financial assistance can and should be extended to allow the
      defendants to apply for judicial review of the DPP’s decision on Counsel’s advice.
      Question 5

      Could the Authority lawfully rescind the undertaking it has given to pay
      Duckenfield and Murray’s costs in defending the criminal prosecution?

      Answer: No. The Police Authority may well leave themselves open to an application
      for judicial review by the defendants if funding is withdrawn now.

2.2   Unfortunately, we are now in a position where lawyers are offering conflicting
      advice. As mentioned in my previous report this dilemma can only be resolved by
      your Clerk and Treasurer and 1 going to the High Court to ask for a declaration from
      a judge on this unresolved issue.

                                      ADVICE



  BACKGROUND


  1.       In July 1998 a private prosecution was commcnced against former
 officers of South Yorkshire Police, David Duckenfield and Bernard Murray
 arising out of the Hillsborough disaster.


 2.        Thus far, the Defendants have received financial assistance from die
 South Yorkshire P olice Authority or at the very least acted on the
 understanding that financial assistance will be forthcoming. Pursuant to a
 resolution in August 1997, financial assistance was given for legal
 representation for officers in connection with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s
 Scrutiny. Then in the light of the Scrutiny, on 27th February 1998, the Police
 Authority authorised the Clerk and Treasurer to consider applications for
 financial assistance from officers in respect of any private prosecution which
 may be made. While we do not have any documentation in respect of the
 individual applications which were made, we know that both Duckenfield and
 Murray were granted assistance.


 3.        The private prosecution is now at a very important stage.      On 18th
 December 1998 the DPP decided not to intervene in the prosecution. At a
 hearing at Leeds Magistrates Court on 21st December 1998 those acting for
 the Defendants decided to apply for judicial review of that decision and
 informed the Prosecution. Further, given their intention to apply for judicial
 review, those acting for the Defendants attempted to extend the tight timetable
 imposed by the Magistrates’ Court leading up to the fixed date for an old-style




                                                         0 11 3   £04   700 1   PAGE . 0 0 'd.

committal. They were unsuccessful. H ie stipendary magistrate acceded to the
submission made by the Prosecution that it was essential that the action be
proceeded with speedily and that it was for the Defendants to make their
application for judicial review as soon as ever possible.


4.      The day after that hearing, the private prosecutor wrote to the Clerk to
South Yorkshire Police Authority and argued that decision/s made by the
Authority to provide financial assistance to the two Defendants were made
“irrationally and unlawfully”. This letter was then followed by copy letters
sent to each o f the members of the Police Authority dated 5th January 1999
which further argued in detail that the decisions to grant funding were
“unlawful, irrational and proeedurally improper, and that a further such
decision would now be unlawful in any event.”


5.      We understand that after the Clerk to the Police Authority received the
letter of 5th January 1999, he sought the advice of Leading Counsel, Richard
Mawrey Q.C.       Those instructing me have been given to understand that
Leading Counsel advised that there should have been applications made for
Legal Aid before seeking financial assistance from the Police Authority.


6.      I am asked to advise on the following matters :


(i)     whether the decisions made by the Police Authority to provide financial
assistance were ultra vires ;


(ii)    those considerations which die Police Authority should take into account
when making a decision whether or not to provide financial assistance in these
circumstances;


(iii)   the weight which should be given to the relevant considerations in
deciding whether or not to fund.


THE LAW
      7.          The first question to be addressed concerns the root power by which the
      Police Authority are entitled to grant funding in these circumstances.


      8.          Pursuant to section 6(1) of the Police Act 1996 :


      “Every police authority established under section 3 shall secure the
      maintenance of an efficient and effective police force for its area.”


      2.          The wording of this provision is very similar to the previous provision
      at section 4 (1.) o f the Policc Act 1964 :


      “It shall be the duty of the police authority for every police area for which a
      police force is required to be maintained to secure the maintenance o f an
      adequate and efficient police force for the area, and to exercise for that
      purpose the powers conferred on a police authority by this Act.”


      3.          In B^v Derbyshire. Police Authority ex parte Wilson and another The
      Times 8.8.89 the Divisional Court considered an application for judicial
      review of the decision o f the Derbyshire Police Authority not to pay any part
      of the legal expenses of two police officers with regard to an auditors inquiry.
      The Divisional Court proceeded on the basis that section 4 of the Police Act
      1964 provided the statutory basis for the payment of money to police officers
      with regard to legal expenses. Then, as now, there was specific statutory
      provision with regard to the payment of damages and legal expenses in respect
      of actions concerning torts brought against police officers. This was provided
      for formerly in section 48(4) of the Police Act 1964 and now in section 88(4)
      of the Police Act 1996.


      4.          Save with regard to actions in respect of torts, there has been and is no
      specific statutory provision concerning the provision of assistance to police
      officers facing legal proceedings.




                                                                      01 13   Z 'd 4   700 1   PAGE . 0 0 4
2   FEB    ’ 99     13:38
      5.          There are two relevant Home Office Circulars 77/1987 and 4/1998.
      Interestingly, they both offer guidance to police authorities against a
      background of essentially the same statutory provisions.


      6.          The 1987 Circular referred specifically to the general statutory power
      to maintain an adequate and efficient police force.           This was plainly a
      reference to section 4 o f the 1964 Act. The Circular stated that pursuant to
      that power “the police authority had a discretion to meet expenditure incurred
      by officers in all kinds o f legal proceedings where officers have acted in good
      faith in pursuance of their duties, or the interests of the force as a whole are
      involved”. The stated purpose of the Circular was to offer guidance to help
      police authorities as to when assistance should be granted.


      7.          The Circular featured a “central principle” that “where a police
      authority considers that an officer has acted in good faith in pursuance of his
      duties or that the interests of the force as a whole are involved, the officer
      should have the support o f the police authority to ensure that he has the
      services of a la yer and that he should not be out o f pocket”.


      8.          A distinction was drawn between those cases where an officer was
      facing a public prosecution brought by the Crown Prosecution Service, and
      those where an officer was facing a private prosecution. While it was said that
      an officcr who was the subject of a public prosecution must be expected to
      bear the costs of his defence, with regard to private prosecutions the following
      provision was made :


      “A police officer should be able to carry out his duties in the confidence that,
      if he acts in good faith and exercises his judgment reasonably, his police
      authority will support him. If, in a case where a member of the public brings
      a prosecution against an officer, the authority is satisfied that the officer has
      acted in this way, the Authority should provide or fund legal advice and/or
      representation."




2   FEB    ’ 93    13:33                                          0 113   ' d H A   7001   P A G E .00 5
     9.            No doubt the reasoning behind the distinction drawn in the Circular
     between public and private prosecutions was that prima facie a public
     prosecution is properly justified, while the same presumption cannot be made
     with regard to a private prosecution.          A police officer, by reason o f his
     employment, is put in the most difficult situations and is liable to face a
     number of allegations made by those without scruple. Equally, he is liable to
     face private prosecutions without proper foundation. As a result, an officer
      who has acted in good faith should have the comfort o f knowing that he will
     have financial support from his authority.


      10.          The Circular o f 1998 is rather more vague in its terms, but it is
     important to note that it does not contradict the earlier Circular.                The
     introduction section restates the “central principle” o f the 1987 Circular :


     “It is important that police officers should be able to carry out their duties in
     the confidence that their police authority will support them, if they act in good
     faith and exercise their judgment reasonably.”


     In my view, it is highly significant that this principle is restated.


     11.       Interestingly, the 1998 Circular goes on to leave it to police authorities
     and their legal advisers to consider whether they have power to grant
     assistance in respect of private and public prosecutions. It is suggested that
     section 111(1) of the Local Government Act 1972 may assist. Further, it is
     suggested that a justification for providing financial assistance may be the
     maintenance o f morale. It is noteworthy that the Circular does not suggest
     that funding should not be provided to an officer facing a public prosecution,
     but leaves the matter open.


      12.          In R v Derbyshire Police Authority ex parte Wilson the Divisional
     Court had no difficulty proceeding on the basis that the Police Authority had
     power to grant financial assistance to officers in respect o f an auditor's inquiry
     into allegations of illegal expenditure. While it would appear that it was not




                                                                  0 1 13 2 8 4   7001   PAGE. 00b
2   FEB     ’ 99    13:39
specifically argued before the Court that the Police Authority had no power to
grant financial assistance, the Court went into some detail in considering the
Authority’s power and how it should be exercised.


13.    In Wilson the status of a Home Office Circular was touched upon. The
Court stated, as is obvious, that a circular is not a regulation and does not have
the force of statutory law. However, they went on to refer to and to endorse
what was said by Scarman LJ in Bristol DC v Clark [1975] 3 A ll ER 976
concerning the status of Home Office Circulars. Scarman U said at pl450 : “I
do not think it possible to rely on those circulars as imposing any direct
statutory duty upon a housing authority ; but I think they are a good indication
as to the purposes to be served by the Housing Acts and as to what are relevant
matters within the language of Lord Greene MR in the Weduesbury case, to be
taken into account by a local authority serving a notice to quit upon a council
tenant in arrears o f rent." In other words, the circulars assist with regard to
what is intended by the relevant statute. Further, the Court went on to say that
the relevant circular assures a police authority with regard to those matters
which will not be questioned by the Secretary of State.


14.    Where then have we got to ? In summary :


(a)   the statutory provisions under the 1964 and 1996 Acts are essentially the
sam e;


(b)   pursuant to section 6 of the Police Act 1996 the Police Authority is
required to secure the maintenance of an efficient andeffective police force
for its area ;


(c)   both relevant Home Office Circulars recognise the importance that
police officers should be able to carry out their duties in the confidence that
their police authority will support them, if they act in good faith and exercise
their judgment reasonably ;
(d)   there is nothing in the later Circular to suggest that it is improper to
extend financial assistance to officers facing criminal proceedings, indeed,
there is suggested justification for doing so ;


(e)    the earlier Circular made a firm recommendation that financial
assistance should be provided to officers facing private prosecutions ;


(f)    In W ilson the Divisional Court proceeded on the basis that there was
statutory power by virtue of the predecessor to section 6 of the 1996 Act to
provide financial assistance in circumstances other than those where officers
are facing actions brought in tort.


15.    In the light of the above, I am confident that the Police Authority had
power to grant financial assistance to both Murray and Duckenfield.


16.   Indeed, having made the decision to provide financial assistance, I am
concerned that to withdraw it in these circumstances would be the subject of
challenge from the officers bearing in imnd the following :


(a)   The present informal challenge to the Police Authority’s excise o f its
powers is made by the private prosecutors who despite their somewhat
disingenuous claim that they do not want to see the defendants without
financial assistance in defending their prosecution, plainly seek to cause the
Defendants problems with funding.


(b)     This challenge comes at a crucial stage in the private prosecution. The
Defendants seek to make a judicial review application in respect of the DPP’s
decision not to intervene in the prosecution. They have a limited amount of
time in which to make the application and are the subject of a pressing
timetable with regard to the old-style committal proceedings.


(c)   The Defendants have not as yet sought to apply for legal aid and now
face the prospect o f having to make such application at this crucial stage in the
proceedings.


17.   It seems to me that there are grounds here for the Defendants to assert
that they have a legitimate expectation that financial assistance will be provided
such that if financial assistance were to be withdrawn they could challenge any
such decision by way of judicial review.


18.   I turn now to look at the sort of considerations which the Police
Authority should heed when deciding whether or not to grant financial
assistance to an officer. The two Home Office Circulars seek to grapple with
two essential considerations:


(a)   Much is asked of police officers in acting on behalf of the Force. They
have to make difficult decisions, often in the heat of the moment, where lives
are at risk or individuals exposed to injury. It is essential to morale, and
necessary in order to avoid defensive policing, that policc officers know that if
they make mistakes, or face litigation arising from their work on behalf of the
Force that they will reccive financial support.


(b)   The wicked or the undeserving should not receive financial assistance.


The net effect of grappling with these two considerations has been the
formulation of the principle that policc officers should be able to carry out
their duties in the confidence that their police authority will support them, if
they act in good faith and exercise their judgment reasonably.           This the
product of an attempt to balance the two considerations,


19.   In the light of W ilson , it would appear that while the question of
whether an officer has exercised his or her judgment reasonably may be taken
into account, the question of whether the officer acted in good faith is rather
more important. Ralph Gibson LJ stated at p23 :


“I have no doubt that a police authority, if satisfied of good faith on the part of
the officer, would normally act, and be pleased to act, on the central principle
stated in the circular ; but discretion is given to the authority and it is
impossible, in ray view, to hold that, once good faith is established, a police
authority must disregard clear evidence of negligence or a failure to “exercise
judgment reasonably”         The decision whether evidence of such negligence
in a particular case justifies withholding reimbursement, wholly or in part, is,
of course, entrusted to the police authority/’


Thus, while a police authority is entitled in the exercise of its discretion to take
into account both whether the officer concerned has acted in bad faith and
whether he or she has exercised his or her judgment reasonably, the first of
the two considerations is rather more important than the second. This stands
to reason. If an officer has acted in bad faith, there is good reason not to
provide funding. If he or she has acted in good faith, but fine distinctions are
to be drawn with regard to whether the exercise of his or her judgment was
reasonable, there would still be good justification in providing funding.


20.   As I have stated above, both Home Office Circulars emphasise the
importance of the public policy consideration that officers who act in good
faith and exercise their judgment reasonably should carry out their duties in
the confidence that the police authority will support them, It strikes me that
this is of paramount importance. Police officers should not have to worry that
they will have to meet their own costs or have to try to apply for legal aid
should the next defendant they arrest take out a private prosecution for assault.
Of all the considerations which the Policc Authority should have in mind in
deciding whether to grant financial assistance, it seems to me that this is the
most important.


21.   In the light of the above, there is no proper reason to conclude that the
Police Authority did anything other than to exercise their discretion properly
in granting the Defendants legal assistance. While there is reference to the
earlier Home Office Circular in their decision of February 1998, I understand
that they had the later Circular.      Moreover, they took into account the
          appropriate criteria in reaching their decision.


          22.     I have been able to speak by telephone to Ms Baxendale QC and Mr
          Mark Shaw who are in the process of advising the Police Authority as to their
          powers. It appears that while they understand and appreciate the weight of the
          reasoning or analysis outlined above, they have some concerns. The essence of
          their concerns can be shortly stated.       Section 88 of the Police Act 1996
          provides a specific power to pay any damages or costs awarded against an
          officer in respect o f proceedings for tort. There is no specific provision for
          meeting criminal costs. Can section 6 of the Police Act 1996 be construed so
          as to imply a power to provide financial assistance in respect of proceedings
          other than those provided for in section 88, in circumstances where Parliament
          has not made any specific provision ? They suggest that the application of the
          linguistic cannon of construction “expressio unius est exclusio alterius” (which
          means - to express one thing is impliedly to exclude another) weighs in the
          balance against there being a power to assist financially the officers.


          23.     Further, T understand that Ms Baxendale QC and Mr Shaw refer to three
          cases which they say support their concerns:


          Sutton LBC v Morgan Grenfell 29 HLR 608
          Bursoine v Waltham Forest LBC 95 LGR 520
          Askev v Golden Wine Co Ltd [1948] 2 AH ER 35.


          24.     I propose to deal first of all with the three cases. I have to say that in
          my view none of these cases properly assists in determining whether or not the
          Police Authority had power to provide financial assistance.


          25.     In Sutton a local authority provided a guarantee in respect of a loan to a
          bank. The bank sought to enforce the guarantee. The lo c a l authority relied
          upon section 111 of the Local Government Act 1972 which provides for a
          general power to facilitate the discharge of their functions. It was held that
          the guarantee was not enforceable as the local authority had acted ultra vires.




£   FEB    ’ 99   13:44                                            0 113   284   70U1   P h GE. W 1 1
        This was not ail surprising in the circumstances. By virtue of section 111(3)
        and section 58 o f the Housing Associations Act 1.985, the local authority’s
        power to provide guarantees was expressly limited to certain circumstances
        which did not apply to the circumstances of the guarantee in issue.


        26.     There is no question of section 6 o f the Police Act 1996 being fettered
        by any express provision limiting the circumstances in which legal assistance
        can be provided to those outlined in section 88. It is also worth, noting that
        section 6 o f the 1996 Act is even wider than section 4 of the 1964 Act. There
        is no provision in section 6 that the police authority exercise their powers as
        conferred by the Act, as there is with section 4.          Section 6 creates an
        unfettered obligation to maintain an efficient and effective police force.


        27.     I move on to B u rsoin e. If anything Burgoine suggests that a local
        authority can provide an indemnity to its employees. In that case a local
        authority sought to indemnify an employee who set up a company to build and
        operate a water park. It was held that the setting up of the company was an
        ultra vires act (the local authority had no statutory power or discretion to do it
        in circumstances where the exercise of their power was specifically provided
        for), and as a matter o f simple construction, the terms of the indemnity did not
        cover the liability incurred. However, Neuberger J considered that a local
        authority could validly grant an indemnity to an employee who incurred
        liabilities when they undertook activities lying outside the capacities of the
        local authority. In a commentary on the case in Local Authority Law 6.6.97,
        it was suggested that this approach was to be commended : “In the absence of
        such a power local authorities and councils would no doubt, experience
        substantial difficulties in recruitment of persons to carry out their business.”
        This sort of worry has to be a real consideration in this case.


        28.     A skev concerns whether an individual who is convicted of a criminal
        offence can recover any financial penalty incurred and costs from a third
        party. Not surprisingly, it was held that his punishment was personal to him
        and he could not through the Civil courts recover in respect of these sums




£ FEB    ’ 99   13:44                                           0 113     234   7 0tH   P h GE
from a third party. This is a far cry from whether a police authority should
provide financial assistance to a police officer facing a private prosecution
arising from what he has done in the course of his duties. The public policy
considerations are very different.


29.     I am of the firm view that these cases do not begin to suggest that the
Police Authority acted ultra vires in providing financial assistance to the
Defendants in this case. The cases are all readily distinguishable from this
case.


30.     I turn to the application of the principle expressio unius est exclusio
alterius. This cannon of construction "operates only where not outweighed by
other interpretative factors” (Bennion on Statutory Interpretation p970).
Further, it is said that “it is doubtful whether the maxim does any more than
draw attention to a fairly obvious linguistic point, viz that in many contexts the
mention of some matters warrant an inference that other cognate matters were
intentionally excluded” ( Cross on Statutory Interpretation 2nd edn 1987 pi 38-
139 and referred to again in Bennion on Statutory Interpretation p970). Thus,
it has to be bome in mind that this maxim is only of lim ited assistance,


31.     The maxim has been applied to effect in pretty limited circumstances.
The most relevant category of case in which it has been applied concerns Acts
which set out specific penalties. It has been held in a number of cases referred
to in Bennion that where an Act sets out particular penalties, the penalties can
only be imposed in the circumstances which are prescribed.                  This is
understandable. It would clearly he wrong to apply something as draconian as
a penalty in circumstances not specifically covered by an Act, Further, in
Felix v Shiva [1983] QB 82 at 90-91 (referred to in Bcnnion p972), the Court
of Appeal held that where the County Courts Act 1959 had made specific
provision for parties before the County Courts to apply for interim payments,
and where the provision had not been brought into effect, a general power
could not be relied upon to assert that interim payments could be applied for
before specific provision had been made. Again, this decision made a good
deal o f sense. There was specific provision as to how the power would come
into effect and it could not be brought into effect by some other route.


32.    The situation we face here is very different. Scction 6 is unfettered. It
is difficult to see how an efficient and effective police force could be
maintained without providing financial support to officers who have been
acting on behalf o f the Force in good faith who find themselves enmeshed in
litigation.   The specific obligation in section 88 is to deal with awards of
damages in tort actions so that members of the public have a remedy. Without
section 88 no recovery could he made against a Force in respect o f the torts of
officers, since there is otherwise no vicarious liability.      Section 88 also
provides that if an action in tort is brought against an individual officer, the
police fund may meet an award of damages and costs. It makes great sense
that the obligation to meet such awards be specific. The public needs to know
that recovery can be made in such circumstances from police officers. Section
88(4)(b) allows for a police authority to pay to a police officer any costs
which he does not recover in an action brought against him. This provision is
incidental to the rest of section 88. Section 88 does not deal at all with the
provision o f financial assistance to police officers who need such assistance in
order to defend themselves against litigation.


33.   I cannot see that it makes any linguistic sense to deduce from the mere
presence of section 88(4)(b) that there is no power at all to assist financially
officers who face litigation of all varieties. The maxim referred to by those
advising the Police Authority only helps us to make linguistic sense of the Act.
Quite simply there is no specific provision for officers to be assisted
financially in conducting litigation.    Section 88(4)(b) is incidental to an
essential provision by which recovery can be made against police forces for
actions in tort.    Section 88(4)(b) does not deal with assisting officers
financially to defend proceedings, but merely to make up any shortfall in costs
incurred and not recovered. It does not deal with proceedings other than those
brought in tort. It is a very specific narrow provision and is not inconsistent
with the appUcation of a general power in unrelated circumstances. Surely to
seek to find an inconsistency offends against a common sense reading of the
Act.


34.   There is nothing in the Police Act 1996 which precludes the provision
of financial assistance where an officer faces a private prosecution. There is
no provision which suggests that financial assistance is limited to the
circumstances provided for by section 88. Wilson clearly suggests that section
6 provides the power to provide such assistance. The Home Office Circulars,
which are of assistance in deducing statutory intention, emphasise the
importance of providing financial support to officers who act in good faith
and exercise their judgment reasonably.       The Police Authority can quite
properly conclude that in order to maintain an efficient and effective police
force such financial support should be provided where officers face private
prosecutions.


35.   There are very strong public policy reasons, which I have referred to
above, as to why financial assistance should be available.


36.   It is to be remeir bered that the CPS have declined to prosecute as a
result of separate deliberations in 1990 and 1997. Plainly, they did so on the
basis that there was no realistic prospect of conviction. The DPP has declined
to intervene.   It would appear that he has concluded that the prospects of
success are still not good enough, but he is unable to conclude that there is
clearly no case to answer such that he should intervene to terminate the
prosecution. Can it be right that in these circumstances, where there is no
realistic prospect of conviction, that officers who face a prosecution in respect
of actions taken in the course of their duties, should be left to deal with the
costs o f their defence on their own ? Surely, the failure to support w ill
undermine morale and the ability of the Force to police efficiently and
effectively ? What is to be done if it becomes kn ow n that if a private
prosecution is brought against a police officer he is left to h is own devices ?
It takes little imagination to imagine how the unscrupulous might use this.
Moreover, can it be right that as a result of pressure from a prosecutor, who
          is far from disinterested, defendant police officers are deprived of financial
          assistance, when it was previously thought that they should have such
          assistance ?


          37.     If the Police Authority do have the power to grant financial assistance in
          circumstances such as these, and I think they do, it would appear that it falls
          within the ambit of their discretion to decide the form such funding is to take.
          As a purely hypothetical matter, I see no reason why funding could not be
          limited to making good any loss by way of legal aid contribution after the
          verdict. However, I find it hard to see how this could work in practice. A
          decision to make up a legal aid contribution could very easily prejudice the
          grant o f legal aid. If a decision were to be made to assist financially on this
          sort o f basis at this sort of stage, it is hard to justify why full financial
          assistance were not being granted. It seems to me that it would be inconsistent
          with the public policy considerations which indicate that officers acting in
          good faith should be supported. In order to provide assistance in any form the
          Authority has to conclude that (a) it has power to provide srch assistance (b)
          that it should do so in all the circumstances.       Once it h concluded that
          assistance should be provided, 1 find it difficult to see how it could properly be
          limited to refunding the legal aid contribution.


          38.     It follows from the views I set out above, that I cannot see any proper
          justification for requiring officers to apply for legal aid in the first instance.
          There is no form of statutory requirement that this should be done. It has
          never been suggested in any Home Office Circular. There is no case law
          which suggests that it is a requirement. If it were a requirement, it would
          undermine the public policy justification for providing funding. It would be
          inconsistent with the maintenance of an efficient and effective police force.


          39.     I understand that it may be difficult for the Defendants to obtain legal
          aid. At the very least it would involve substantially divesting themselves of
          any capital.    I do not think that the Legal Aid Board could require the
          Defendants to exhaust their remedies in pursuing alternative forms of funding




2   FEB    ’ 99   13:48                                           0 1 13   £84   7001   PAGE.01b
          as a condition to granting assistance. There is no specific provision to this
          effect. But I have to say that 1 doubt that they will find it easy to obtain legal
          aid. If they can, it will cost them dearly in financial terms. Again, I cannot
          see that news of this will do anything for morale in the Force. I fear that it
          will be pretty devastating.


          40.     If the Police Authority have the power to assist police officers
          financially in the way that I contend that they have      above,   it would be well
          within their discretion to extend funding to covcr a judicial review application
          in respect o f the DPP’s decision if Leading Counsel so advises. If Leading
          Counsel were to advise in favour of an application, there is no question but
          that legal aid would be available in respect of such an application if the
          officers were legally aided. If they continue to enjoy funding from the Police
          Authority, it would be wrong to deprive them of funding for an application
          which would be available were they legally aided.


          SUMMARY


          41.     In summary :


          (a)     there is power to grant financial assistance ;


          (b)     that power has been properly applied in granting assistance ;


          (c)     it would be inappropriate to require the officers to apply for legal aid ;


          (d)     financial assistance can and should be extended to allow the Defendants
          to apply for judicial review of the DPP’s decision on counsel’s advice ;


          (e)     the Police Authority may well leave themselves open to an application
          for judicial review by the Defendants if funding is withdrawn now.


          42.     I hope that I have addressed all points of concern. Please do not hesitate

SUBMISSIONS ON LEGAL AUTHORITY


These are submissions on behalf o f Mr Bernard Murray.


1.       The discretion to authorise funding in this case is derived from the statutory pow^r under
section 311(1) o f the Local Government Act 1972 and the statutory duty under section             6   o f the
Police Act 1996.


Th<i power
2.2      The power o f the police authority: Section 11 ) (3) LGA 1972, so far 3 5 is material:
             a local authority shall have power to do anything (whether or not involving
         the expenditure ... o f money...) which is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive
         or incidental to; the discharge o f any of their functions.’1
      the word '‘functions” embraces all the duties and powers o f a local authority; the sum total
o f the activities Parliament has entrusted to it. Those activities are its functions.” (Per Lord
Templcman, H azdl -v- Hammersmith L.B. C. [1992] 2 A.C. 1 atpage29F.)


2.3      The sub-section is couched in the widest possible terms. Jt is elementary that such a broad
enabling provision cannot empower a local authority to do an unlawful act, or zc do anything
which is expressly or by necessary implication prohibited by other statutory provisions, or to do
anything which is not truly in discharge o f its functions. But unless so limited the power exists
and is exercisable subject only to challenge on the basis o f an improper exercise of discretion
amounting to V/ednesbury unreasonableness.


iA       Section   1 1 1(3)   is an example o f an express limitation. It restricts the power to raise- or
lend monsy except in accordance with other statutory provisions relating to those matters. But
this has no relevance to the present case. The police authority’s resolution does not involve
borrowing or lending money.


The duty

3.1      The duty o f the police authority: Section 6 ( 1 ) o f the Police Act 1996 (re-enacting s . 4 c f
the Police Act 1964 as amended):
           “Every police authority ... shall secure the maintenance o f         efficient ami
           effective police force for its area,”

Discharge o f this statutory duty is a Junction o f the authority within the meaning o f section
i 11(1) above. The scope of the duty under section 6(1) is not restricted to fulfilment o f the
objectives provided for by sub-sections (2) and (3). The matters there mentioned are not
exhaustive o f the objectives which the police authority may promote in discharge o f the section
6 ( 1)   duty.


3.2        In R -v- Derbyshire Police Authority, exp . Wilson (unrcported, 20 July 19S9), the scope
o f section 6 , (then section 4 o f the 1964 Act) was said to define the duty of the police authority
and the purposes for which the authority may spend the money provided, namely to secure the
maintenance o f an adequate 2 nd efficient police force: Ralph Gibson L.J., (ppA-5).


3.3        Adapting Lord Tetnpleman’s speech in Hazell -v- Hammersmith L. B. C.:
^Accordingly a local authority can do anything which is calculated to facilitate or is conducive
or incidental to the local authority’s function of [securing the maintenance o f cn efficient and
ejfea'h ' 2 police force fo r its area],M(ibid. page 29F).


3.4        A police authority is entitled to be guided by Home Office advice in determining the
scope of its duty to secure the 'maintenance o f an efficient and effective police force’, (see R -v-
Derbyshire Police Authority, ex p. Wilson (unreported, 20 July 1989), per Ralph Gibson L.J. 6 -
7). Home Office circulars 77/1987 and 4/1998 have both stressed the importance o f police
officers being able to cany out their duties in the confidence that their police authority will
support them if they act in good faith and exercise their judgment reasonably. With reference to
the scope o f the power under section 111(1) o f the 1972 Act, paragraph 5 o f Circular 4/1988

states:

           "... It could be argued that to allow payment to be made to officers (either former
           or serving) involved in criminal proceedings would in some way facilitate or be
            conducive to the police authority’s broad functions. For example, failure to
           provide financial assistance could adversely affect the morale o f the force if
            officers had to meet their own costs after an acquittal.”
It is important to note that payment of costs after an acquittal is given by way o f example only.


                                                    2




                                                     <LZ52<LiSccT0S - SliB'diKS        If-tl
The principle at issue is as to the provision o f financial assistance in general. Paragraph 6 states:
        “It is for individual police authorities to decide in the particular circumstances of
        a case and on the basis o f legal advice whether to make financial assistance
        available to officers in Criminal Proceedings,”
The purpose o f this submission being to deal with the legal basis for funding, we shall not
rehearse the plain case which we have established on the merits showing that to deny funding
to Mr Murray in the circumstances o f his case would be wholly contrary to the statutory duty of
securing an effective and efficient police force. The original decision o f the police authority was
correct in principle and well within the proper exercise o f a discretion under section           6   o f the
1996 Act. The proposed payments were rightly judged to be calculated to facilitate, to be
conducive tc, and to be incidental to, the discharge o f the functions arising from section 6 .


The Section 88 fallacy
4.1     Section   88   o f the Police Act 1996 (re-enacting section 48 o f the Police Act 1964) does
net determine or affect the scope of the section       6   duty with respect to funding the defence of
criminal charges brought against individual officers.


4.2     The section exists simply to extend the common law doctrine o f vicarious liability for tort
to the relationship between the chief constable and his officers: (the original statutory provision
reversed the decision in Fisher -v- Oldham Corporation [1930]              2   K.B. 364), and to make
consequential provisions as to tbs payment o f damages and costs by the police authority which
would otherwise fall upon the chief constable by operation o f sub-section (1). Sub-sections (2 )
and (4) are necessary to relieve him from the ordinary civil consequence o f bearing the damages
and costs, which is the usual position o f a vicariously liable employer.


4.3     Once the provisions o f the section are properly understood in this way, the principle
expressio unius can be seen to have no application to the true interpretation o f the scope o f the
power under section 6 . There is no basis for the suggestion in the letter (I February’ 1999) from
the Authority’s solicitors that section 88(4) might be interpreted as precluding financial
assistance for non-tort claims, it is not, and cannot possibly have been intended to be, a provision
circumscribing the authority’s powers in discharge o f its wide-ranging statutory duty under
section 6 .


                                                   3




                                                    iiSciiScSI06 «- Sil5*ad9            ZP-X> X
  "ON
  Cases on Section 111(1)
  5.1        The Authority’s solicitor has suggested that the scope of section 11 1(1) as it applies to
  this case, might be affected by recent case law. We have identified such case law as might have
  a bearing upon the true interpretation o f that section. We have concluded that, upon carefai
  reading, none o f the cases establishes any basis for undermining the propositions outlined above.
  It is unnecessary to set out any extensive analysis o f the cases. We believe it sufficient to identify
  and extract the essential ratio o f each case, as follows. None o f the cases jutifies a conclusion
  that the section    1 1 1 (1)   power is limited by other provision or authority so as to preclude the
  police authority from deciding to authorise expenditure in what it perceives to be a proper
  discharge o f its duty under section 6 .


  5.2        H atcll -v- Hammersmith and Fulham L.BC. [1992] 2 A.C. 1. Two main issues arose:
  first, whether swap transactions were within section 111(1) of the 1972 Act, second, whether an
  interim strategy o f damage limitation after it appeared the swaps might be ultra vires was within
  the sub-section. The swap transactions were held to have been ultra vires because they were not
  incidental to the authority’s borrowing function “having regard to the provisions and
  Limitations of the Act of 1972 regulating that function”. (Sec Lord Templeman, p.3 IE.) This
  is a clear example o f the general power o f section              1 1 1 ( 1)   being circumscribed by other specific
  statutory provisions, namely Schedule 13 o f the 1972 Act, which Lord Templeman said (page
  33H-34A): "establishes a comprehensive code which defines and limits the powers of a local
  authority with regard to its borrowing. The Schedule is in my view inconsistent with any
  incidental pow er to enter into swap transactions.” Transactions under the interim strategy were
  struck down because they could only bsve been incidental to transactions which were themselves
  ultra vires.


  5.3        McCarthy & Stone (Developments) Ltd -v- Richmond Upon Thames London Borough
  Council [ 1992] 2 A.C. 48. The House of Lords held that pre-application planning advice was not
  a function within section        1 1 1 ( 1 ),   and that to charge for such a service did not facilitate, nor was
  it conducive to or incidental to, functions o f considering and determining planning applications.
  It followed that to charge for such a service could not be brought within the sub-section. Lord
  Lowry (page 75 A) categorised such charges as “incidental to the incidental and not incidental
  to the discharge o f the functions.”


                                                                4

5.3    Credit Suisse -v- Waltham Forest L.B.C. [1997] Q B. 362 [C.A.] Hare the Court of
Appeal struck down the authority's guarantees to a bank in respect o f loans to a company the
authority had set up in breach o f its statutory powers; similarly, an agreement to indemnify the
company was ultra vires. Again, the basis o f the successful challenge to the authority’s action
was that it contravened other express statutory provisions. Neill L.J. said (374 C).                  where
Parliament has made detailed provisions as to how certain statutory functions arc to be carried
out there is no scope for implying the existence c f additional powers which lie wholly outside
the statutory code.” (It is important not to be misled by the immediately following reference m
his judgment to section 111(3): “Section 111(3) makes it clear the power to enter into financial
obligations is subject to any statutory controls which may be imposed.” ‘Financial obligations’
refers to lending and borrowing only; there are no relevant statutory controls affecting the
present situation.) Credit Suisse -v-Allerdale Borough Council [1997] Q.B. 306 [C.A.] is to the
same effect in different circumstances.


5.4     Sutton L 3 .C -v- Morgan Grenfell & Co l td (1996) 29 H.L.R. 60S. Here, guarantees and
indemnities were struck down because they were held not to be incidental to the authority’s
legitimate function; this was an example o f the incidental to the incidental. Peter Gibson LJ.
approved a formulation o f Elizabeth Appleby Q.C.:
        “Where Parliament has expressly enacted provisions which define the means by
        which local authorities are to carry cut their functions, section       111(1)    cannot be
        relied upon in support of performance of those functions by other means not
        expressly empowered by relevant provisions.”
We respectfully agree with that. It is necessary to be careful about the passage in the judgment
o f Pete Gibson LJ. which immediately follows the citation’ (page         6 1 7).   It is not Intended to say
any more than that the authority’s powers under section      1 1 1 ( 1)   are not circumscribed unless
there exis* specific statutory provisions regulating the exercise o f powers in particular
circumstances.




Conclusion
6. 1    There is no identifiable statutory provision which can properly be said to circumscribe
the application o f section 111(1) to the issue before the police authority. Their discretion is, to
         th a t e x t e n t , u n f e tte r e d s u b je c t o n iy to W edm sbury u n r e a s o n a b le n e s s .


         6.2        Comparisons with other areas of locai authority functions regulated by statutory' schemes
         are likely to prove unhelpful. Tne Police Act 1996 is predicated on the basis that Police
         Authority and Chief Constable will work together. The former’; ability to act is circumscribed
         by the requirement to take advice from the latter and from the Secretary o f State and the
         community (see sections 7,                     8   and 96). Hie latter’s ability to act is circumscribed by the
         requirement to follow the guidance o f the former. Thus, the power given to the Police Authority
         is wide. The instrument o f regulation o f that power is not statute or staiutory instrument, but
         consultation and agreement. In other words, precisely the exercise thus far undertaken in this

SUPPLEMENTARY* SUBMISSION O ' LEGAL AUTHORITY


O r behalf of M r Bernard Murray.


5ecffoj? 88 (4) o f the Police Act 1996.
I. I      In view o f the emphasis apparently being placed upon this sub-section, we wish to amplify

our submission. We re-state our submission that the provisions of the section as a whole are
consequential upon the effect o f sub-section ( 1) which imposes vicarious liability upon the chief
constable. Viewed from the standpoint o f the parliamentary draftsman, sub-sections (2) and (4)
are made necessary by what goes before



i.2       Sub-section (2 ) imposes a duty to indemnify the chief constable in respect o f damages as

well as costs. This is on the premise that he is liable only as a joint tortfeasor by operation o f sub­
section ( 1 ).


1 .3    Sub-section (4) becomes necessary to accomplish two objectives which wouid not arise
by necessary implication if it did not exist. First, it makes clear that the police authority may

relieve the principal tortfeasor of liability. But secondly, and importantly, it has effect that the
authority may make a payment in respect of damoge.t as well as costs, This establishes an
important principle which would not necessarily be derived from the terms o f section         1 1 1 ( 1)   of
the Local Government Act 1972 if that were the only statutory authority for such a payment.
Having provided authority for payment o f damages, it is a natural and necessary next step to

associate that with express power to make payment in respect of costs.



1.4       There is nothing inherently contrary to ordinary canons o f statutory construction in
parliament making an express provision for something which might arguably be derived by
implication from another statutory provision, especially where to omit an express provision might,
in the context o f other express provisions, be mis-interpreted.



1.5     On its proper construction, sub-section (4) cannot be interpreted as demonstrating that
parliament has given no power to t police authority to fund &criminal        defence.

    Funding the application for Judicial Preview o f the Director‘s decision
    2     1   Fcr reasons set out in cur first submissions to the police authority concerning the merits
    o f Mr Murray's case, the ergumcnts we seek to advance on his behalf are arguments which are
    the legitimate concern cftfae chief constable ar.d police authority, because they deal with a v.tdly
    important question o f whether the D.P.P. or Attorney-Genem! have a duty to intervene and step
    a private prosecution mounted against individual officers in a case where the public prosecutor
    has repeatedly said that there should be no prosecution and that there is no realistic prospect of
    conviction.

Dear Sirs

SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY MEETING ON 5 FEBRUARY 1999

As requested we set out further pieces o f information.

1.       Costs.

          Our cc*ts as authorised by the Authority and on the charging basis agreed with
          them to the 12th January 1999 amount to £115,948.50 plus VAT o f £20,290.98.
          The disbursements incurred by this Off.ce amount to £2,131.94 including VAT.

          The fe « of Mr-Michael Harrison Q.C. are £32,750.00 plus VAT o f £5,731,25.

          The fees c f Mr.Simon Myerson are £10,843.75 plus VAT o f £1,897.66.

2.       Legal Aid.

          There are various complications before the Clerk to the Justices would even
          consider a LcgalAid Application, one of which is the present issue o f funding
          through yourselves. On a pure financial calculation, if these issues were
          resolved our Client would have to make a capital contribution o f £81,000 end
          an ongoing weekly .payment o f £23.00 which would continue untii the
          conclusion o f the proceedings.

We make the following additional comments:-

1.       We believe that the Authority is contractually bound in any event (and without
         prejudice to the arguments being advanced as to the continuation o f funding)
         to pay the costs stated above, and they are estopped from being able to resist
         the liability to make payment.

        Meeting o f Members Friday 5 February 1999.

        SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF M R BERNARD MURRAY

        The decision to authorise financial assistance
        LI       The original decision was not ultra vires. It was plainly within the power o f the.
        authority to decide as it did. Further, the decision was correct and a proper exercise o f the
        power.


        L2       In so far as it is considered necessary to review the decision to take account of
        alternative sources o f funding which might be open to Mr Murray, we submit that your
        present decision should be tc affirm the original decision and to continue funding on the basis
        o f reasonable expenses incurred.


        Pending proceedings
        [a] the private prosecution
        2.1      The charges o f manslaughter must be defended vigorously. HFSG submissions to the
        police authority imply that defending counsel conducting the defence funded by legal aid
        would have a duty, if necessary, to advise the defendant to plead guilty. The inference that
        Mr Murray could properly be advised to plead guilty is absurd. There is no question of such
        advice being tendered by counsel in this case. It is important to note that the Director of
        Public Prosecutions has long held the view that there is no realistic prospect o f conviction.
        Thai was the advice of two leading counsel advising the Director in 1990. Lord Justice Stuart-
        Smith’s scrutiny concluded that the original opinion had been correct and that there was no
        basis whatever for the HFSG claim that fresh evidence justified re-consideration of the
        decision not to prosecute. We axe satisfied that the HFSG claims that further fresh evidence
        has emerged since the Stuart-Smith Scrutiny are spurious. The DPP’s decision not to intervene
        is an application o f an indefensible policy about when the Director should take over (and stop)
        a private prosecution following his own clear decision that a conviction is not a realistic
        prospect. Counsel advising Mr Murray are in no doubt that these charges can be and must be

  2.2       The further suggestion o f HFSG that defending counsel would conduct the defence of
  Mr Murray differently if he were funded by legal aid is irresponsible and wrong. The advice
  Mr Murray has received from counsel would be precisely the same in every respect regardless
  o f the source o f funding.


  [b] judicial review o f the Director’s decision
  2.3       KFSG complain that the police authority is being asked to support Mr Murray's
  application to judicially review the Director’s decision not to intervene. The authority will
  wish to contrast this with the fact that, had the Director’s decision gone against HSFG, this
  is precisely the course they would have taken to get his decision set aside; and they would
  have done it without regard to the cost to themselves or the proposed defendants or any public
  funding o f the defendants.


  2.4       Important matters of general principal arise in the proposed application. The issues to
  be raised on Mr Murray’s behalf apply equally to all serving and retired police officers who
  find themselves subject to private prosecution in circumstances where the DPP or CPS has
  decided that there is no realistic prospect of conviction. This case highlights the urgent need
  for clear and authoritative guidance from the courts as to the role and the responsibility o f the
  CPS and DPP in such situations.


  2.5       Counsel are satisfied that the DPP’s decision is plainly open to judicial review and that
  leave to proceed will be granted. If successful, this application would bring the criminal
  proceedings to an end, avoiding protracted and expensive committal proceedings which HFSG
  are proposing to mount.


  2.6       It is wrong that Mr Murray and Mr Duckenfield should be left to fund a cause which
  will seek to protect police officers in the future as well as themselves in the present
  proceedings on such important issues o f principle. Mr Murray cannot obtain civil legal aid

3.1    Criminal legal aid will only be available     to   Mr Murray on condition that he pays




3.2    It is unthinkable that Mr Murray should have to face this financial commitment in
order to take proper and justified steps to defend himself.


3.3    In the event of art acquittal in the Crown Court or of the proceedings being stopped
by the magistrate or the Crown Court for abuse of process or any other reason, the utility of
a defendant’s costs order against the prosecutor is doubtful in this case. KFSG is an
organisation which has not made its own structure, organisation and funding a matter of
public knowledge. There is no established basis for a defendant to obtain an order for security
for costs against such an organisation. Even if, following acquittal cr dismissal of the charges,
Mr Murray obtained an order for his defence costs to be paid from central funds: [1] it would
not necessarily amount to a complete indemnity of all expense reasonably incurred in the
conduct of his defence and    j




3.4    As a Superintendent, no longer protected by the Police Federation, Mr Murray acted
on the advice of the Force and arranged legal indemnity insurance at a recommended level.
That cover ran out during the Inquest proceedings in which he had to be represented
separately from the South Yorkshire Force.
3.5     The HFSG submissions expressly acknowledge that the obtaining of legal aid wiM
involve    the defendants in personal financial commitment and risk. We believe that the
campaign to have the police authority funding withdrawn is designed to put financial pressure
upon tha defendants and thus prevent them from taking proper steps to fight their case in the
ir.02» effective ways open to them. That such campaigning should com* from the prosecutor
io a case involving extremely serious criminal charges is itself a very serious matter of
concern, and wholly unprecedented in the history of criminal prosecution in this country.


7/ia ez.penze
4 .1      The HFSG submission to the authority talks of “millions of pounds” being committed
to fund the defence. The claim is an exaggeration, now typical of HFSG submissions.


4.2       Concern about public expense ought to be addressed first to the conduct of the private
prosecutors rather than to the conduct of the defendants. In the face of clear and well-founded
decisions that there is no realistic prospect of conviction, supported in the House of Commons
by the Home Secretary, the Attorney-General and the DF? (following Lord Justice Stuart-
Snvlth’s Scrutiny), HFSG have started proceedings which in one way or another will be
certain to involve considerable public expense to defend


4.3     Responsible expressions of concern about public expense should be condemning the
unjustified prosecutions which HFSG persist in bringing rather than challenging the merits of
the defendants seeking to defend themselves.


Generally
5.1     Mr Murray served the public for 26 years as a police officer.


5.2.    Mr Murray has suffered substantial and continuing financialloss by virtue of his
retirement on medical grounds. He would have expected to have achieved the rank of Senior
Superintendent and to have remained a police officer until August 2001.

   5.4      It is because he was a serving police officer on the day of the Hillsborough tragedy
   that HFSG continues the relentless pursuit of charges against him in the face of the clear and
   responsible opinion of the public prosecuting authorities and an independent Scrutiny that
   charges should not be brought To test this, it is worth considering whether H?SG would have
   been so reieniless :f Messrs Murray and Duckenfield had been doing precisely the same job
   as ground control employees of the football club.


   5.5      In paragraph 17 of the HFSG submission to this Authority an accusation is made of
   conspiracy and dishonesty against both the South Yorkshire Police and "West Midlands Police
   and Mr Murray is the vehicle for that attack. For this reason alons the Police Authority
   should provide continuing funding to Mr Munay for only through him can the Authority rebut
   these accusations.


   5.6      There are some very serious issues and concerns arising from the pursuit of these
   private prosecutions which go beyond protecting the interests of the individual defendants in
   this case.


   5.7      It is unthinkable that the police authority should in effect cut them adrift and leave
   them to their o%vn resources and legal aid to defend themselves against charges which, in
   truth, they should not be having to face at ail.

  South Yorkshire Police Authority - Payment o f Legal Costs to retired Chief
  Superintendent David Duckenfieid.


   i.        The Police Act 1996 replaced the Police Act 1964 and re-codified the statutory
             provisions for policing in England and Wales.

             Section 6 of the 1996 Act provides:-


             “(1)         “Every police authority established under s.3 shall secure the maintenance of
                          an efficient and effective police force for its area.”

   2.        Section 3 stipulates that there is to be a police authority for every police area listed
             in Schedule 1. Schedule 1 includes Sooth Yorkshire (but not the Metropolitan

             have regard to:-

Section 6(3) and (4) provide that in discharging zr.y function to which a Code of
Practice issued under s.39 relates a police authority shall have regard to that Code
($.39 provides for the establishment of Codes of Practice in relation to any of the
functions of a police authority and by subsection (4) were is a provision requiring
the police .authority tc comply with any direction given to it by the Secretary of State
under $.38 (performance targets) or under s.40 (to remedy adverse reports)).

Subject to the intervention of the Secretary of State and with reference to the various
plans and objectives referred to above the overriding principle and general function
of the police authority is to>

 “Secure ihe maintenance of aa efficient and effective police force.”

The other powers contained in the Police Act merely rr.abie this function to take
place. In particular the establishment of a police fund and record of payments and
receipts (s. 14) the employment of employees (s. 15), the appointment of a clerk,
(s.. 16) and the supply of goods and services (s. 18). Equally the provisions dealing
with collaboration agreements (s.23), the aid of one police force by another (s.24) or
the provision of special services by way of quasi contract (s.25) or even the
assistance of international police organisations (s.26) are all examples of incidental
powers to achieve the main object ofs. 6 .

Tnd'ted the Police Act 1964 sA contained the same general function. Section 4(1)
stipu’ared:-

        “It shall be the duty of the police authority for every police area, for which a
        police force is required to be maintained by section I of this Act to secure
        the maintenance of an adequate and efficient police force for the area, and to
        exercise for that purpose the powers conferred on a police authority by this
        A ct”

 Ths issues raised with the Clerk and Treasurer cf SYPA by Hillsborough Family
 Support Group (HFSG) in Ann Adlington’s letter of 22nd December deal with the
 decisionmaking process by SYPA to support Mr Duckenfield's legal costs and the
 Home GfSce Circulars referred to. It does not however address the substantive
 constitutional position of the police authority as to whether this assistance can
 legally be granted.

 The Home Office Circulars referred to are 77/87 of 4ih December 1987 and HOC
 4/1998 of 17th December 1998.

 The intention behind these Home Office Circulars (which do not have the force of
  law and cannot breathe statutory authority into police authorities that they do not
 otherwise have) was to provide, in effect, a practice direction for funding the
 defence of police officers in several kinds of legal proceedings where the officers
  have acted in good faith, in pursuance of their duties or (quoting from the 1987
  Circular).. .“where the interests of the force as a whole are involved". The 1987
• Circular did not extend to the costs of an officer defending himself from prosecution
  by the Crown Prosecution Service. It did however talk about reimbursement after
  the event if acquitted. There were also extensive provisions about costs of civil
  actions by reference to s.48 of the Police Act 1964.
                                          2

                                         iiBZLLSZZiQe    - siiaaas          ts :«         se/ee^a
S'ilJ dealing with the 1987 Circular under the heading “Private Prosecutions” it
states:

       A police officer should be able to carry out his duties in the confidcnce that,
       if be acts in gocd faith end exercises his judgement reasonably, his police
       authority will support him. If in a case where a member of the public brings
       a prosecution against an officer, the authority is satisfied that the officer has
       ac-tcd in this way, the authority should provide or food legal advice and'or
       refpreseatsdon.”

Under the same heading paragraph 5 goes on to say:-

        ‘IVfcere a court decides that a prosecution brought against an officer was not
        brought in good faith, it may order the prosecutor to pay the whole or any
        part of the costs incurred by the defence; again, if the officer is acquitted on
        indictment, his costs may be met from central funds. In either of these cases,
        the question of the police authority providing financial support to the officer
        may not arise. However, where the costs of an acquitted officer are not
        awarded by the court or awarded only ir. part, the police authority should
        consider whether to reimburse any costs not covered, taking into account the
         reasons, if any, given by the court for failing to award ali costs claimed.

The Circular 4/1998 cancels 77/1987 and therefore the earlier guidance must be
regarded as historical contextual information only albeit that the Circulars are net
themselves substantive statutory authority.

 Dealing now with the HOC 4/1998 the introduction states

        “It is important that police officers should be able to carry out their duties in
        the cenfSdecjcc that their police authority will support them, if they act in
        good faith and exercise their judgement reasonably. The following guidance,
        which has been prepared in consultation with ACPO, the Superintendents'
        Association, the Police Federation and the Association of Police Authorities,
        should be read against this principle/’

 It deals with various different headings of Civil Proceedings, Criminal Proceedings
 and other types of legal proceedings. Concentrating on Criminal Proceedings and
 referring to s.8 S of the Police Act 1996 the Circular states:»

 “5.     Section 88(4) does not apply to Criminal Proceedings, but police authorities
         may wish to consult their legal advisers as to whether they have any other
         power to provide such assistance (whether in respect of private prosecutions
         or prosecutions brought by the CPS). In this context, they may wish to cote
         that s.l 11(1) of the Local Government Act 1972 enables police authorities to
         do anything “which is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental
         to, tbs discharge of any of their functions55. The provision applies to
         provincial authorities (but not the Metropolitan or City of London Police) by
         virtue of S.146A of the 1972 Act (as inserted by Schedule 14 to the Local
         Government Act 1985 and amended by Schedule 4 of the Police and
         Magistrates Court Act 1994). It could be argued that to silow payment to be

                                         3

                                                        - SiJL3&W0         c     £         66 '
                          made to officers (either former or serving) involved in criminal proceedings
                          would in seme way facilitate or be conducive to a police authority’s broad
                          functions. For example, failure to provide financial assistance could
                          adversely affect the morale of the force if officers had to meet their own
                          costs after an acquittal.

        14.       The Circular goes on to say:-

                  “6 .   It is for individual police authorities to decide ia the particular circumstances
                          of a case and on the basis of legal advice whether to make financial
                          assistance available to officers in Criminal Proceedings”.

        15.       It is significant that the Circular goes on to say under the heading “Other typss of
                  legal proceedings”

                  “7.    Similarly there is g o express statutory authority for providing financial
                          assistance in proceedings brought against police officers in tribunals other
                          than the courts”.                                                                             ^

         i 6.     Section 8 ? of the Police Act 1996 is a section with a long history and is substantial'y
                  a re-enactment of the provisions in the Police Act 1964 s.48. It is, as the Home
                  Office Circulars indicate, designed to support the good running of any police force.
                  The Chief Constable effectively becomes vicariously liable for the torts of bis
                  officers in the course of their employment. It is not. however a limiting provision. It
                   is merely dealing with the most common ar.d normal situation in an environment
                   where civil litigation against the police Ls becoming more aad more common. It
                   docs not address or provide for the situation faced by Messrs DuckenSeld and
                   Murray aad neither was it intended to.

         11.      Tnere are several references to s. 111 (1) of the Local Government Act 1972 in the
                   Circulars. The problem with reference to s.l 11(1) of the 1972 Act is the
                   concentration of criticism by the courts on the use of the incidents! powers section.
                   The four leading cases are Hezcll v. Hammersmith & Fulham L3C 1992, McCarthy
                   8l Stone (Developments) Limited v. Richmond upon Thames LBC, Credit Suisse v.
                   Borough Council of Alierdaie 1996 and Credit Suisse v. the London Borough of                         *
                   Waltham Forest 1996. The Home Office guidance simply dees not take this very
                   important case law into account.

          18.      When interpreting statutes and investigating a statutory body’s powers and duties
                   the only place to look for those powers and duties is in the statutory constitution of
                   the statutory creature in question.

          19.      In Baroness Wenloclc v. River Dee Co 1885 Lord Watson said:

                   “Whenever a corporation is created by Act of Parliament with reference to the
                   purposes of the Act and solely with a view to carrying those purposes into execution
                   1 am of opinion not only that the objects which the corporation may legitimately
                   pursue must be ascertained from the Act itself but that the powers which the

                                                           LLZZLL3ZZ106 - S li S ii a b S    ££*«        £ 6 /2 0 ^ 8

                  corporation may lawfully use in furtherance of thtse objects rsay either be expressly
                  conferred or derived by reasonable implication from its provisions."

                  Jusx over one hundred years later Lord Temaieman in Hazel’ v. Hammersmith LBC
                  1992 said:

                  “Although democratically elected and representative of the area, it is not a sovereign
                  body and can only do such things as arc expressly or impliedly authorised by
                  parliament”

        21.       All the local authority eases involved a consideration of s. 111(1) but the McCarthy
                  & Stone case waa confined to it In the Court of Appeai a distinction was drawn
                  between the Council making a charge for a service that they had the power to
                  provide rather than the duty to provide. The Council had axgued that it was
                  incidental to its good running and efficiency if it did impose a charge for replying to
                  enquiries in relation to planning end redevelopment proposals. To quote Lord
                  Lowry:

                          “The Council’s interpretation of s.l 11( 1) is built on that preposition” [i.e.
                          that if they had the duty to answer questions they had by implication the
                          power to levy a charge]... "but I consider its reasoning to be mistaken
                          because it does not by any means follow that all of the discretionary
                          functions of the Council or all of the facilitating or incidental activities
                          contemplated or possibly contemplated by s. 111 are services for which it is
                          permissible to charge in the absence of express authority to do so. The role
                          is that a charge cannot be made unless the power to charge is given by
                          express words or by necessary implication. These last words impose a
                          rigorous test going far beyond the proposition that it would be reasonable or
                          even conducive or incidental to charge for the provision of a service.
                          Furthermore, as it seems to me, the relevance of the contrast attempted to be
                           drawn, with respect to the power of a. Council to charge, between duty
                           functions and discretionary functions is vitiated when one baa regard to the
                           large number of discretionary functions for the provision of which express
                           statutory authority to charge has been enacted. I am not impressed by the
                           submission that an express power to charge for the performance of
                           discretionary functions may have been conferred “for the sake of clarity

         22.       [n the case of a police authority it may be that a slightly different interpretation
                   would be placed on the effect of s. 111 (1). Regina v. Greater Manchester Police
                   Authority 1996 was a case where the High Court refused to give leave for a Judicial
                   Review where aa aggrieved service provider challenged the authority of Greater
                   Manchester police to outsource and for a charge to be made for the removal of
                   abandoned vehicles. It was recognised that there was no express power but the
                   general powers section in s.4 of the Police Act 1964 (as emended by the Police and
                   Magistrates Courts Act 1994) was held to be sufficient. The right to levy a charge
                   was also held to be incidental to the general statutory object.

         23.       The situation in the Greater Manchester Police Authority case would now probably
                   be authorised by the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994. However one of

the cruciaJ factors which appears to have supported the Courtrs decision that the
outsourcing was permissible was the retention of control by tbs Police Authority
together with a recognition of the generality of the Police Authority’s powers.

following ch«se cases it is submitted that the correct procedure for deciding whether
there is statutory authority, instead of resorting to an incidental powers section is>

(i)    Analyse the legislation to see if there 12 an express statutory power.

(ii)   If there is not, consider whether there is a statutory power by necessary
        implication.

(in)    Analyse whether the function which is desired to be carried cut is necessarily
        unlawful in the sense that if it is carried out something will be done which
        the enabling legislation. did not mesn to be done.

(iv)   Look at 2ny express statutoiy powers of the sane nature- that there are and
        compare them with what is desired to be done.

If there is a primary statutory power to do something then that power should be
pointed to by the police authority when authorising funding, I? there is no express
statutory power there may be a genera] statutory power but an incidental powers
section ■cvili not authorise it.

The availability of legal aid or indeed the possibility of funds being available from
any other source must be a relevant consideration. It is probably something that the
authority should have considered (as it probably did) when taking account of the
legal plight which Mr Duckenfield found himself in. Considerations like this yelate
only to the decision-making process and not the existence of a statutory power. Any
defect in decision-making can presumably be corrected by further, corrective,
decision-making.

 The case cf Regina v. Derbyshire Police Authority Ex-psrte Wilson and Another
 1989 is instructive on the deliberations of a police committee when deciding to pay
 costs in that under the 198? Circular (Police Act 1964) it was confirmed that the
 Circular was sot a regulation and did not have the forcc of statutory law. It
 contained guidance with reference to a power to make payments but had not created
 a specific duty to make payments. Tne Divisional Court held that the power to
 consider and, if thought fit, to award reimbursement of costs arose under the general
 administrative powers given under the Policc Act. The case had to consider the
 extent to which the police authority had to be properly informed of the decisions it
 was taking and on what evidence.

 Bearing in mind that the Circulars do not have the force of law and that they should
 be considered like practice directions, one can understand why these unusual
 circumstances have given rise to an anomaly. The CPS have decided not to
 prosecute: There is no provision (except after acquital) for any reimbursement if
 the CPS prosecute an officer.
A private prosecution however is usually a last-ditch affair when an aggrieved
member o f the public wants to cany on a vendetta either instead of or in addition tc
a civil action. The Circulars therefore contemplate that.

But this is a really exceptional case and is unlikely to &e one accommodated by
usual or best practice. The question which needs to be answered is Ces SYPA
'lawfully .fund the costs cf aad incidental to the defence of these two individuals in
the circumstances of the private prosecutions which have been launched and any
other legal action which it is deemed necessary or expedient to undertake on their
behalf and in connection with the defence - such as the Judicial Review of certain
key decisions?

The answer it is submitted is as follows (refer to paragraph 24 above):-

(a)     Is there an express statutory power?

        Answer. If it is within the policing objectives, ihe policing plan or is
        pursuant to a direction given by the Secretary of State thee provided the
        police authority has properly informed itself it is submitted that the police
        authority would have used an existing statutory power to approve and adopt
        a course of expenditure which was authorised. There is a general statutory
        power and it is not necessary to resort to the incidental powers section.

(b)     If there is no express statutory power is there a statutory power by necessary
        implication?

        Answer. If there is the capacity in existing general statutory powers for a
        course of expenditure to be adopted, there is no need to imply one.

 (c)     Is the function which it is desired to carry out necessarily unlawful in the
         sense' that if it is carried out something will be done which the enabling
         legislation did not mean to be dooe?

         Answer, The legislation, clearly contemplated the maintenance of an
         efScicnt police force of high morale. The express provisions for the
         payment of legal costs in certain circumstances are clearly not of a limiting
         effect but are of a regulatory effect to cope with the most common situations.
         There is nothing in the legislation to prevent the authorisation of a course of
         expenditure of this type and there is express capacity in the planning and
         budgetary processes (see above) to enable the payment of such costs.

 (d)     Having regard to express and general statutory powers of the same nature is
         there say comparison in them with what is desired to be done?

         AAvwer. This analogy is being followed and if some shortcoming or
         inadequacy is discerned in the meetings or procedures of the police authority
         that should be overcome by re-eppraising the considerations and if necessary
         ratifying earlier decisions.

  In an extreme (but hypothetical) case it is submitted that there is no reason why a
                police authority should not fund the defense of an officer who svas being prosecuted
                by the CPS. Clearly the police authority would need to make an Informed decision
                and for it to be within their objectives aad budget plan. It "would be an unusual case.
                It might be a test case. It might be a case to avoid a miscarriage of justice. It must
                however be easily within the power aad competence of a police authority, on proper
                consideration, to fund such a defence.

  33.           The main esse law on s.l 11(1) has had a detrimental effect on the Home Office
                Circulars bul the basic powers and functions referred to above and at the beginning
                o f this note show that there is plenty of scope for the police authority to authorise
                this course of expenditure without reference and without resort to any incidental

       South Yorkshire FaUce Authority ~ Financing of Defence costs - Mr D DuckcafieJd
       We refer lo previous correspondence and in particular your sr.ost recent letter of 1 February
       1999 advising that‘the forthcoming meeting on 5 February 1999 would be limited to
       considering “whether the Authority has the legal power to provide the assistance sought".
       Accordingly we have restricted our submissions, as invited, to this issue, and in the event
       that more detailed submissions are required concerning the exercise of discretion, we would
       be happy to provide those.

       1)          The power

                     We enclose herewith memorandum of cur senior partner, Mr Nicholes OwTtcc.
                     dated 2 February 1999 dealing with this issue. Mr Eastwood of our cS 5« wili
                     attend the meeting at 11.00 am to elaborate on this paper as required by the
                     Authority. In this context, the Authority wili no doubt bear in mind that as a result
                     of lengthy submissions, a number of meetings, and with the benefit of &d\iex
                     specifically referring to the case of Regina -v- Derbyshire Police Authority ex p a r t e
                     Wihon end Another, the Authority resolved in 1990 to assist police officers,
                     including our client, in regard to the legal expenses incurred in relation to the
                     inquest. It is important lo point out that expenditure did not fall within section 48(4)
                     of the Police Act 1564, the precursor to the present section 38(4) Police Act 1995
                     The Authority clearly considered it had the power to make such an order on that
                     occasion. Wish this position we respectfully agree.

        7)         Legal costs

                     In response to your telephone request we czn sdvise that our best estimate of legal
                     costs incurred to 12 January 1999 are as follows.

Leaal aid

As requested by the Authority we have mace enquiries regarding the potential for
Mr Duckenfield to obtain lega] aid. Accordingly the following ccmir.ents are nade
nn the basis of enquiries of the relevant legal aid authorities cn an informal basis and
at best can be considered guidance only.

In regard to legal aid to assist in the defence of the criminal prosecution we
anticipate that the seriousness of the offences charged is such that the legal aid
authorities would consider Mr Duckeafield’s financial position before determining
the position.

As indeed the prosecutors allude to in paragraph 23 of their letter of 5 January 1999,
should legal aid be granted in this contort a considerable capital payment would be
required, and we understand this would be in the region of i




In regard to legal aid for applications for judicial review, different criteria apply as
these are considered civil proceedings. On the basis of the enquiries we have made,
it is our understanding that Mr Duckenfield's present financial position will preclude
a grant of civil legal aid with or without contributions, regardless of the legal ments
of the proposed proceedings. Accordingly, unless supported by the Authority, Mr
Duckeafjeld will need to fund these applications from his private resources to allow
them to proceed, with the potential financial benefit to the Authority should they
succeed.
       H will be important for the Authority to know that on 2 February we received a letter dated
       1 February 1999 from the CPS in response to our request for tu.!I and detailed reasons for
       the decision of tKe CPS, indicated by letter of 18 December 1098, not to exercise its power
       under section 6(2) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 to lake over and discontinue the
       criminal proceedings against our client. Accordingly it is incumbent upon us to consider
       the contents of that letter and to take any steps expeditiously in regard to judicial review,
       and accordingly we look forward to the Authority resolving the outstanding questions
       concerning financial assistance at the earliest opportunity. Naturally if we can assist further
       in the provision of information or clarification regarding our submissions please do not
       hesitate to contact us.

       Yours faithfully

         HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR 4/1998 • FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS
0        IN LEGAL PPROCEEDINGS

         Thank you for your letter of t February to John Lyon in this office.

         Hom«s Office Circular 4/1998 states deafly that sections 88 (4) and (5) of the Police Act 1996 apply
         tc civil proceedings only. The circular goes on to say that Scction 88(4) does not apply cc criminal
         proceedings. There is no provision in the Police Act 1996 enabling police authorities to provide
         financial assistance to officers involved in criminal proceedings. The circular does not purport co
         suggest otherwise. Nor does the Circular proffer advice to police Authorities cn whether section 1! 1
         of the Local Government Act 1972 provide!; authority for the payment of such financial assistance.

         We have nothing further to add to the advice in HO Circular 4/1998 and the Home Office does not
         wish to be involved in any legal proceedings which may result from a challenge to the policc
         authority's decision in this matter.

         A number of Parliamentary Questions have been tabled on this issue which are due for Answer over
         the next few days. These will be available in the Official Report (Hansard) .

  The report accurately sets out my views at paragraph E2 but it would be misleading
  to suggest that my opinion is solely or ever, heavily dependent on Ex parte Wilson and
  Dalton. Far more significant in my thinking axe the following:-

  1.        Police authorities have paid their officers' legal costs for many years without
             anyone ever suggesting that this was ultra vires.

  2.        No objection was raised by anyone to the payment of very substantial legal
            fees for the representation of officers in this matter before both judicial
            enquiries and at the inquest.

  3.        The view of the Home Office since the first circular on the subject has patently
             been that the combination of sec 6 of the Police Act and sec 11 of the Local
             Government Act provides police authorities in appropriate cases with the
             poweT to finance legal expenditure. It is noticeable that the circulars treat this
             as an entirely different question from that of the specific powers in tort cases
             given by sec 88 of the Police Act.

I think we had some telephone conversations some time ago about a grant from the
money allocated by the Police Authority crime and disorder funding for the cost of
producing a training video.

I have been unable to contact you by telephone. Could you please let me know whether
this money has in fact been spent and if so to where the spending has been allocated. I
understand we can then arrange to transfer the funding through to the crime and disorder
allocation.

Yours sincerely

Dear Sirs

RE    THE LATE JONATHON OWENS - HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

I refer to your letter of 19 September 1990 which I have received from the
Chief Constable, South Yorkshire Police.
                                                                    V J ,   ""

With regard to the matters raised, I have spoken to Inspector Layton giving him
details of the concern your clients feel.

He informs me that he saw Mr and Mrs Owens at Sefton Social Services Office on
23 November 1989 to show them photographs and video material in an effort to
identify and confirm the identity of their son, Jonathon.

I understand some of the photographs were timed but others did not have this
facility.  Inspector Layton, states he only gave his opinion as to Jo n athon’s
condition when the photographs were shown whilst going through the sequence of
events leading to his death.  It is extremely unfortunate that Mr and Mrs Owens
suffered further distress at the Inquest when he (Inspector Layton) testified
under cross-examination by Mr Limb as follows

     "I have said this before, it is very difficult from these photographs
      but my impression is that Jonathon is possibly still alive but as to what
      medical state he is in at that stage, it is very difficult to actually
      s a y ."

      (Copy of transcript attached.)

The officer only gave his personal opinion from viewing photographs and at all
times made every effort to minimise distress to Mr and Mrs Owens.




     PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT
                                      - 2 -



In respect of the evening before the Inquest the officers who had arranged to
meet Mr and Mrs Owens were detained with enquiries concerning other deceased
relatives until after the agreed time of the venue but did telephone to give
their reasons.  I understand that Mr and Mrs Owens had gone out with friends to
a Wine Bar, which the officers were pleased to hear that Mr and Mrs Ow e n s ’
evening was not completely spoilt by the meeting being unavoidably cancelled.

It was arranged for the officers to collect Mr and Mrs Owens at their hotel at
9.00 am on Friday, 27 April 1990 to attend the Inquest on Jonathon, but when
Woman Police Constable Parkes arrived at the hotel your clients had already
left with friends.         The officer went immediately to the Medico Legal Centre to
meet Mr and Mrs Owens, but her delay at the hotel meant she had to rush into
the C o r o n e r ’s Court to give evidence and again had no contact with your clients
prior to the Inquest.

The summary of what was to be stated at Court was sent to you on 23 March 1990
which you acknowledged receipt of on 2 April 1990.  (Copy of your letter
attached.)   I understand HM Coroner's letter which accompanied the summary
asked you to carefully consider what to disclose to your clients because he was
very conscious of the upset the summary may have caused if not explained to
them by their legal representative.

Therefore the summary was not sent to any of the deceased relatives.

I hope that the explanations given to Mr and Mrs Owens questions are
satisfactory and may help to ease the sad loss of their son, Jonathon.

Please do not hesitate to contact me again if there is any further information
I can assist you with.



Yours faithfully




S Beechey
Detective Superintendent

     Dear Sirs

     RE:     THE LATE JONATHON OWENS - HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

     Thank you for your letter of 19 September 1990 in which you indicate that
     the parents of the late Jonathon Owens are concerned about the evidence
     given by Inspector Leighton to the inquest at Sheffield on 27 April 1990.

     You also indicate that police made arrangements to meet with your clients
     when they were in Sheffield at the time of the inquest which arrangements
     were not kept.

     When we spoke today on the telephone I gained the impression that your
     clients consider that the summary of evidence apparently given to the
     inquest was at variance to what your clients have been told by others of
     events on 15 April 1989 and they have not been furnished a copy of the
     summary. At present it is unclear as to the circumstances of the summary
     qr if they involve any allegation of misconduct on the part of any police
     officer.

     As suggested I have forwarded a copy of this correspondence to West Midlands
     Police and shall take no action until I receive your letter on any of the
     three aspects of concern.

     Yours faithfully

                Dear Sirs,

                BE:       THE IAEE JCKA3HH OHEHS - HDXSBOBOOGH DISASTER

                We refer to our letter of 13/7/89 and to the inquest which was heard on
                27/4/1990. %

               Our clients are concerned about the evidence given by Inspector Leighton. In
               November 1989, our clients saw still photographs of their deceased son and
               Inspector Leighton informed our clients that he believed that Jonathon was dead
               when the photographs were taken. He was not sure as to when the photographs
               were taken.   At the inquest, he testified that he thought that Jonathon was
               still alive when the photographs were taken. This is clearly a contradiction of
               what he had told our clients in November 1989.

               On the evening before the inquest, it had been arranged that two representatives
               from the Police would call to see our clients but they did not turn up although
               our clients waited until 9.30 p.m. at the agreed venue. The Police did give a
               message to the effect that the representatives were too busy to come and see our
               clients but would meet them at reception at 9.00 a.m. the following morning.
               However, they did not turn up then either.      Our clients were never given a
               summary of what was to be stated to the Court at the inquest.

               Would you please take these matters up with those concerned and let us hear from
               you in reply at your earliest convenience.

               Yours faithfully,

                                                                                                 8 0 U T H YORKS. POLICE

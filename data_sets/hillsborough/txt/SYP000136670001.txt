  Your ref:
  Dear Sir,
  Hillsborough Inquest
  I have taken instructions of Superintendent Marshall. He would
  prefer to give evidence immediately after the evidence of the nen
  he commanded - all ranks - so that what he says can be received in
  context.
  Hay I also ask, in view of the continuing difference of opinion
  between witnesses as to whether there was any substantial
  drinking by supporters, for the earliest possible production of
  the South Yorkshire Police video taken on the day following the
  match showing the cans and bottles lying in the streets and
  forecourts of buildings in the Hillsborough area. I an instructed
  that the video is in the possession of the West Midlands force.
 I an sorry I did not learn of the existence of this video until
 yesterday and did not put it to any resident for comparison with
 the scene on any non-match day or 'ordinary' natch day but it nay
 not be too late for this to be done if the scene is aTleged to
 be normal fqr m v i g h ^ rough.
 Yours faith
 VINCENT HALE

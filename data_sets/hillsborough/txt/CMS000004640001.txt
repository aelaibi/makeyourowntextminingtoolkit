Mr Speaker




The message from this debate and the exchanges which took place

across the chamber yesterday afternoon                                is clear.              Solutions must

and can be found to the problems which beset football.




An      ailing     game        must    be       treated        and    brought          from     the     inward

looking boardrooms of Victorian England into the 1990’s.                                              That Mr

Speaker          will    not    be    done       overnight           nor    will      this     report    alone

provide the cure.




It will require more than the detailed                           package of measures which

Government              and    football     agreed        in    1987.            It   will    require    more

than a      boardroom            revolution in football.                   It requires more than a

package of measures to curb hooliganism.                                     W hat is needed is a

total    change          in    attitude,    a    new      realism          and        above     all   courage

from those who run the game.
I recognise, as my Hon. Friends have made clear that football can

creak and lumber on as it has been doing for years, bedevilled by

trouble and shabby venues.                    Of course change can remain a dirty

word at most football clubs.




Yesterday in the intervention from the Hon.                           Mem ber for Bassetlaw

we saw symptoms of such an altitude when                                he was        unwilling to

accept      that     football     is    an     industry     -     a    part    of     the     leisure

industry    which      has to compete               for spectators.           The     fact    is that

there    is simply no excuse for the raw deal that most supporters

get from their clubs nowadays.                  And as has been made clear by my

Hon     Friends,     the complacency of the clubs in                        relying       so heavily

on the      unquestioning         loyalty of their fans to keep                  providing gate

receipts for so little return amazes me.




Clubs      must     get    closer      to   their    supporters       and     take    their    views

and     needs      fully   into   account.           Take   the       approach       of    American

football    towards        its fans.         Clubs    actively    market       themselves        and

are always thinking up new ideas to attract new customers.                                      And
Mr Speaker I use the word customer deliberately - because that is

what     supporters         are    when        you    take      away     their     club       colours.

American          spectators        enjoy comfortable           seats      and      a   choice        of

good-quality food when they go to their                         stadia.And they expect

their surroundings to be clean.                      Rubbish io juct nove r allowed to

accunfwlate.




Compare         that     comfort        with   the    discomfort        and      dirt   so     vividly

described         by      Lord     Justice Taylor,       that most         of    our    supporters

have to put up with.               Standing room only or hard wooden benches

if    you’re           lucky.       Local shopkeepers             too      terrified     to     open.

Supporters having to be herded                       into grounds and            protected every

match day for their own safety by 5,000 or more police.




The    police     are     on     duty    to    contain    the    problem        not to        cure    it.

W hat other industry has the nerve to presume to ask the police to

marshall its paying customers in and out of its premises?                                       Police

who    would      be     far    better deployed          in the    local      communities            and

town upholding law and order.
Somehow the supporters have got to realise that masochism is not

obligatory in football.                 They should demand and expect to receive

a better deal from their clubs.




The football authorities should be leading the way.




Just        like   every     other form             of activity     for the     paying spectator                  -

be     it    cinemas,        theatres-,       tennis       or    fitness    clubs       -    football       clubs

must pay for the safety improvements themselves.




Even        if every ground converted to all seater and                                     all _these seats

were        covered          the cost        is     estimated | a t £130m .                  Many        clubs,

particularly         in      the lower        divisions         have      attendances             well     below

capacity           and     many       currently        uncovered           standing         areas        will   no

doubt        simply        not   be     used        thus    substantially       lowering            the     cost.

Meanwhile            the    football        trust    have       offered     £50m        towards          ground

improvements and even if only half the income the FA and League

derive        from       television     -    currently      £18m- a . year          -       was     spent       on

ground safety               over the next 10 years the costs would                              be covered

in full.           That      Mr Speaker             is withoutconsidering           the        sponsorship

and commercial arrangements,                          gate money and transfer fees - all

of which provide important sources of revenue.
                 Of course the Government will study all the arguments put forward

                 by Lord Justice Taylor.                  But taking Chelsea as an example,




                        it cost just under £1m to police Chelsea last season

                        of which £140,000 net of VAT was recovered from the clubs.




                 £8 60 ,0 00     is a      high price for the local ratepayers                   in the borough

                 of     Kensington         nnrl     CheJsear to          pay    for    the    disruption      caused

                 outside       the    ground        and    in    the    neighbourhood,         particularly    since

                 the    club     estimate      that       only    2%     of    their   gate   come     from     local

                 population.




                 It is totally       reasonable       for the          ratepayers      of -Chelsea ^to     ask the

                 opposition         why,    when      they       have    to    face    such   large   bills    today

                 they    should       now    agree        with    a    Labour     party seeking       to   increase

                 taxation      to     pay     for     safety       improvements          at   Stamford        Bridge

                 tomorrow?

RECOMMENDED,
Mr Speaker over the last few years the Government has, in some

cases    introduced,            and           in others     commended                to    football,   a tough

package            of       measures          to      counter    the        threat        posed   by    football

hooliganism both inside and outside the grounds.



               '
I know that O0 i all of this money is evenly spfead among the 92

League^ptubs.                 As far as the income frorfv television is concerned,

a J^fge share of the money goes io                                   the big clubs.               But that is

football’s choice.                  The       FootbaJr League could                   decide      on a    more

equitable          distribution          if   tl^ y    wished.         If    they     choose         not to   do.-

s o , . they can hardly ejcpect the Government to bail out the smaller

clubs.      Nor c a n /m e y - or the Opposition - reasonablv/^xpect the

Govern m e n t/fo            give    back tax            revenue to fo o tb alL /an y                more than

the   hojefl        industry        or        cinemas      would       e x p e ^ their         tax     revenues

In 1987 we introduced                         local plans for each              League ground about

how best to handle football matches
      all ticket arrangements




      the use of closed circuit television surveillance of grounds

                              ■                             /

      we promoted family enclosures and the type of voluntary

      membership scheme which allows half of Manchester United

      supporters, without incident, to attend with a membership

      card every home game




We    are     now working with         the football        authorities, tfie      police and

the    \ytman   authorities       on   preparation     for       th e /w o r ld   Cup      Finals

ttys summer.




The    Government      has        legislated   in    the        interests   of    safety    and

public order




      to introduce exclusion orders




      to introduce a new offence of hooliganism




      to clarify and strengthen existing legislation on public

      order
     to implement major safety recommendations




     to control the sale and consumption of alcohol, and




     to enable the courts to prevent convicted hooligans from

     travelling to matches abroad.




We   have     also    established         a   national    football   Intelligence    Unit   to

co-ordinate    police       initiatives       against    football    hooligans -at— hem e

and abroad.          This   Mr Speaker is a record of action.                       A record

which will continue with renewed commitment.
National Membership Scheme




I come to the national membership scheme for football spectators.

Lord Justice Taylor addressed                      himself to the       Invitation     to Tender

issued      by    the    management          consultants        employed        by    the    football

authorities.        On     that     basis    he    recommended          that we       should       not

proceed with the implementation of the scheme.                               As I have always

said to this House we were insistent that we would                                   not move to

the establishment of an FMA until we had given full consideration

to Lord Justice Taylor’s Report.                     That we have done and we will

not now move to set up the FMA whose job it would be to prepare

the scheme.




But the provisions of Part I will remain                        in force.        The proposals

for a national membership scheme will be put "on the back-burner"

and work will continue to see how Lord Justice Taylor’s anxieties

can   be     met.        The      problem     of    hooliganism        has     not    gone    away.

Indeed      one     of   Lord       Justice Taylor’s anxieties              about    the    type   of

scheme      envisaged          by    the    ITT    was ' that    it    might    not    be     robust

enough       to     deal    with       determined       attacks        by     hooligans.           He

certainly    did     not   take       the   view     that   football     hooliganism         was    a

thing of the past.
Lord Justice Taylor proposed a number of measures to deal                                                  with

the continuing problem of hooliganism - the                                 creation of three              new

offences,       wider      use of attendance                  centres and        electronic tagging.

My Rt Hon Friend has said that he will look quickly and carefully

at     these        suggestions.           But        against        the    possibility        that        Lord

Justice        Taylor’s       strategy            does         not         succeed        in     defeating

hooliganism we will have a national membership scheme to divorce

the    true     football    supporter            from     the       hooligans     in     reserve.            As

Lord Justice Taylor acknowledges,                         he did not have the opportunity

to consider the bids for the national membership scheme made by

five    major        consortia        in response             to     the    Invitation     to     Tender.

Those      bids      were    submitted           to     the    consultants       employed             by    the

football      authorities    on       19    January.               For the     time      being        we    will

devote        all    our    efforts        and        attention      to     making        Lord        Justice

Taylor’s alternative proposals work.
           24. I know that not ail of this money is evenly spread among the
           92 League clubs. As far as the incorrie from television is
           concerned, a large Share of the money goes to the big clubs. But
           that is football's choice. The Football League couid decide on a
           itere equitable distribution if tney wished. If they choose not. to
           do sc, they can hardly expect the Govern-ent to bail out the
           smaller clubs. Nor can they - or the Opposition - reasonably
           expect the Government to give back tax revenue to football, any
           more than the hotel industry or cinemas would expect their tax
           revenues returned.



           Conclusion

           25. In conclusion, Mr Speaker, may I return to a theme that runs
           through Lord Justice Taylor's report and through my Rt Hon
           Friend's statement yesterday and his speech today^ It is time for
           football to face up to its responsibilities^ Our decision not to
           set up ^zhe Football Membership Authority to draw upythe national
           membership scheme does not mean that we will ab^ricion the fi^ht^
           against hooliganism. Anyone in football who see^i/that decis^<5n as
           a teason to take refuge in the old do-litt^ 'ways w±Y)/ make a
           dreadful mistake.

           26. In the first place, the powers td come back to the national
           membership scheme are still thep4 and we will continue with
           preparatory work to have the/scheme ready if n e e d e d . . In the
           second place, the return of English clubs to European competition
           depends, as it always h a ^ o n the behaviour of supporters in this
           country throughout the^ rest of the domestic season and at the
           World Cup Finals in/Italy this summer. Nothing which Lord ..Justice
           Taylor has said hsfs altered that»-   ^

                        British- public will not forgive another Heysel
           2   7   *

           another     Hillsborough. There have been too man^ disasters     in
           English football in the last twenty years.^ T h e        football
           authorities and the clubs must show the leadership that has been
           lacking; ,the^ must treat their supporters like human beings, not
                                                              1 A   :

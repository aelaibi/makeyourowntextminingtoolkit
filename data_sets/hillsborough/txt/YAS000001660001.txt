                    states :
1.   I was born on 17th May, 1958.
2.   I am a Qualified Ambulancewoman.           I am stationed       at
     Middlewood Ambulance Station.           I have been employed by
     SYMAS for seven years and prior to that I was a police
     officer.    I have had the following training - 2 weeks basic
     at Rotherham, 6 weeks basic at MarkfieId, Leicestershire, 2
     weeks advance driving at Markfield, SYMAS extended training,
     National extended training and I am a Registered Emergency
     Medical Technician.   I am paramedic.
     On Saturday 15th April, 1989 I was due to be on the night-
     shift commencing at 2200.     In the afternoon I was at home.
     At about 1515/1520 I saw on my television what was happening
     at Hillsborough.      I waited by the 'phone expecting to be
     called in but nothing happened.            I then called in to
     Control who told me to proceed to Middlewood Ambulance
     Station    as soon as possible.           I was   told   that   an
     unidentified individual was on his way in and would meet me
     there.      I arrived at the Station at about 1615.              I
     prepared an ambulance for emergency duty.           Three other
     personnel - Ambulancewoman          Q.A.          and Q.A.
     arrived.    Q.A.        contacted Control and informed them
     that there were now two crews on station ready to proceed.
     Q.A.         and I then received an emergency call from
     Control to attend an asthma attack at a house on
     Road Off Leppings Lane.      We proceeded to ShenstonRoad.
     On approaching the scene we could not go direct to              ~

Road because of fire engines blocking the road.              We
therefore had to proceed all the way around the ground and
approach from the northern end.     On arrival at the house we
found a Liverpool supporter who had been let in to use the
telephone and at the end of the call had apparently had an
epileptic fit.      He had gained consciousness by the time we
arrived.      We took him immediately to Northern General
Hospital.     On arrival we handed him over to the staff.    We
reported to Control over the ambulance radio and were given
another emergency call to attend a Liverpool supporter who
had collapsed on a coach in Halifax Road (just north of the
ground).      The log should show the precise time of this
call.   We attended that spectator and took him to Northern
General Hospital.      We then called in to Control once more
over the ambulance radio and were instructed to take an old
lady home to                 Nursing Home from casualty at
Northern General.
                       ciAs.
We proceeded to Ohapojijio'im Nw=eiiig -flBme but could not find
the old lady when we arrived there.     We called into Control
again and was stood down for a period of 20 minutes.         We
were then contacted by Control and told to take patient
number 19 from the east floor of intensive care at Northern
General across to Royal Hallamshire        for a scan.       We
collected that patient and an anesthetist and transported
him across.      We called in again to Control from Royal
Hallamshire.        We then attended to another unconnected
emergency and called into the Station at about 2000      I then

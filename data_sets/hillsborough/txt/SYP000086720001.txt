              i ncreased as the          coaches arrived,            and grew to a large and               constant

             st rearn as       time went     on.



              I saw huge        numbers    drinking a l c o h o l i c       beverages       such as    canned      beer

             and    lager,      bott 1 es of wine saQd/^aErt i n^L^-arfid we had to adv i se several

             y ouths who were           running a ro u n d    the     rear of the          nearby shops       to

             ur i n a t e .     We were also       p er si s t e n t l y a s k e d for d i re ct io ns     to public,

             As the time a p p r o a c h e d 2 . 3 0pm       (1430)        that    date,   the volume        of fans

             increased further            to a huge      level,       and    these     numbers     continued to          pas

             us up to 2 . 45pm          (1445).



             It was a pp arent          that a large       number      of these        fans w&r'e drunk.



             At S. 45 pm       (1445)   we joined the         rest of our           serial     outside a nearby

             public      house,     then a fter a short             time we all made           our way down H a li f a

             Rd towards        the football        ground.           The    f oo tp a t h and a jo in in g    grounds

             were    littered with         cans and      bottles       of various a l c o ho li c        drinks.

              the ground,             and   it was a pp ar en t      that a large       d isturbance       had taken

              move a w a y from the gates.                     These    gates were      s u b s e q u e n t l y op en ed for

              e m e r g en cy      services     to enter,       still    the   crowd    refused to be dispersed.

              the officers,             including myself.               I remained      in that     location,        outside

              the L e pp in gs Ln gates               until    it was a pp ar e n t    that    the ground      had    been

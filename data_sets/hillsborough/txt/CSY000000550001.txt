       JOINT REPORT OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE, '                   FIRE SERVICE COMMITTEE
       THE CHIEF FIRE OFFICER AND THE CHIEF                     3RD SEPTEMBER, 1981
       CONSTABLE    :

                        SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT, 1975

1.     Background

1.1   The County Council's powers and duties under this Act are delegated to the
      Fire Service Committee. On 8th January, 1976, the Committee decided that the
      necessary detailed investigation should be undertaken by Officer Workiqg
      Parties for each of the four Borough Council areas. These Officer Working
      Parties consist of representatives of the Fire Service, the Police, the
      Building Inspectors of the Borough Council, co-ordination being undertaken by
      the Department of Administration.

1.2   Whilst it is Parliament's intention that all sports grounds which have
      accommodation for more than 10,000 spectators should be subject to the provisions
      of the Act eventually, the only grounds designated by the Secretary of State to
      date as requiring General Safety Certificates from the appropriate County Council
      have been certain "International" grounds and those of clubs in the First and
      Second Divisions of the Football League.

2.    Position in South Yorkshire

2.1   The Hillsborough Stadium of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. was
       designated by the Secretary of State as requiring to apply to the County
       Council for a General Safety Certificate by 1st January, 1979. Following
       detailed investigations by the Officer Working Party for the Sheffield District,
       the Certificate was granted on 21st December, 1979, after approval by the
       Committee.

2.2   The Officer Working Parties for     the four Districts have also been giving
       informal advice, on request, to    the remainder of the football league Clubs in
       South Yorkshire.

2.3   Following their promotion to the Second Division of the Football League, the
       Barnsley Football Club Ltd. and the Rotherham United Football Club Ltd. have
       been designated by the Secretary of State as requiring to apply to the County
       Council for a General Safety Certificate by 1st January, 1982.

3.    General Safety Certificate

3.1   On 30th November, 1978, the Committee approved a draft General Safety Certificate
       (copy attached) as the basis for the standard certificate to be used throughout
       the County.

3.2   The General Safety Certificate granted to the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
      Ltd. on 21st December, 1979, was based on the standard certificate with additions
      to meet the particular conditions at the Hillsborough Stadium.

3.3   Experience gained since the granting of the Sheffield Wednesday General Safety
      Certificate has shown the desirability of incorporating two minor amendments
      to the standard certificate for the following reasons




                                             -1-
     (a)     the Chief Constable feels it essential that, in order to maintain
             public safety, the police commander at a football ground should,
             in consultation with the Holder, have the discretionary power to
             decide the actual moment when the exit gates should be opened. To
             safeguard'the Police and the Club concerned, it is suggested that
             paragraph 10 should be amended accordingly, and

     (b)    as it is standard practice for Institution of Electrical Engineers'
            Certificates to be issued for five years for completely new
             installations and lesser periods for other installations (based on
             the results of tests and the known age of the installation) it is
             felt that the 12 months requirement mentioned in line 2 of paragraph
            26 should be amended accordingly.

4.   Recommendation

     (i)    That the standard South Yorkshire General Safety Certificate be amended
            to read as follows:-

             (a)    Paragraph 10

             "The Holder shall ensure that, except where otherwise marked on
             the plans, all doors and gates which form an egress route between
             any spectator accommodation and the public highway, or other open
             space outside the stadium, shall be so secured as to open immediately
             and easily from the inside and shall be manned at all times the stadium
             is being used for a Specified Activity by at least the number of stewards
             required by Part 2 of Schedule 3. All such doors or gates shall be
             opened by the stewards responsible and secured in the fully open
             position at a time agreed between the Holder and the Chief Constable
             and at any other time on evacuation of the stadium or a part thereof on
             being ordered so to do by a police officer in uniform or by the sounding
             of the alarm".

             (b)    Paragraph 26

             "The Holder shall within    months of the date of this certificate and
             thereafter not less than once in each period of five years in respect
             of new installations (and such lesser period as the Chief Fire Officer
             may require in respect of other installations) supply to the Chief
             Fire Officer the certificate of an independent Electrical Engineer as
             to the current compliance or non-compliance of the electrical
             installation within the stadium, with Section E of the I.E.E. Regulations
             or other sections or Regulations for the time being in force relating
             to the Electrical Equipment of Buildings".

     (ii)    That the General Safety Certificate granted to the Sheffield Wednesday
             Football Club Ltd. on 21st December, 1979, be similarly amended.

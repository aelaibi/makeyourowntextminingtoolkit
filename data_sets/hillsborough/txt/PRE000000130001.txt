                                          British judges.

                                                      Exactly how they judged the cars is secret, but we do

                                          preferred the Tipo to the B M W 5 series, the Renault 19, the Vauxha 11 Cavalier, the

; Lord Justice Taylor rejects the ‘conspiracy theory’
' put forward by the police, claiming that an

  order to burst into the ground without tickets. A
  police dossier compiled to support the theory was
 flawed because it did not refer to previous matches
  with a capacity crowd.
    After 2.30 the crowds built up around the Leppings
 Lane entrance. They were funnelled together by the                 mm
 pattern of streets and trapped between an outer wall
 and the turnstiles because too few turnstiles were
 available to cope with numbers needing to get to the

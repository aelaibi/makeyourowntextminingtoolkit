        T C d e f e n d e d by L iverpool    and     I was aware       of fans       spi 1 1 ing onto the

            playing area,         my very first        thought was a pitch i nv as io n was                      taking

            p l a c e , but that was        only for seconds as          I real is ed fencing was                  in

            place,    making a pitch          invasion v ir tu a ll y        impossible.

            A P olice Off i ce r s to pp ed the game and the                  playe rs left the            playing

            area,    I saw more and more             people going       onto the        playing a r e a from the

            Leppi ngs Ln terracelNsjarea.

            The Pol i ce Of f i cers        in frlHTt of the N S t a nd stood up and then faced

            the hi Stand,        these Off ic er s w e N t j oined by a f ur ther 40 or so

            Offi ce rs,    I could see        no    reason for      this a c t i o n as the s u pp o r t e r s            in
                                                                                                             PAGE

the N S tand were            of no threat          to a ny situation.

The      other    supporters         o bv i o u s l y formed the same           view as        the s t ar t e d      to

a buse      the Police Of fi ce rs w ith foul                  language      but the m es s ag e        they were

trying       to convey was           for    the O ffice rs        to go to the L ep p in g s         Ln end          to

a ss is t    the s it u a t i o n    in that area. Some of the crowd s eemed                         intent          in

their       hatred for       the Police and            in fact      I told one        supp or te r      in

particular         to shut     up and        I as a result was a b u s e d v er b al l y and

threatened,          but    I d o n ’t want       that     to detract        from the more           important

issue and         I wish to make            clear than         it has     not b i as ed my views at all

a nd     in fact     if I had        not been a s ke d spec if ic            q u es ti on s    I w ou ld     not

have m e n t i o n    it.

S h o r t l y after     this some of the Polic e                  in front of the stand               I was        in

<N ) m o ve d towards         the L e p p i n g s Ln end,          and    I b el i ev e d the      crowd

clapped as a result.                 An a m b u la nc e a r r i v e d    s ho r tl y a f t e r w a r d s and by

this     time a large         number of         persons where            on the    playing area,             some of

w ho m    I saw    lying and         some sitting, from my view point                     I could not tell

what      if any injuries            they had.

It became ap pa re nt          that a number             of    persons were        injurerd as

s t r e tc he rs a rr iv ed and         people were           t aken on either s tr et c he r s            or

advertising          boards     to be treated,             the N o t t i n g h a m Forest       s up po r te r s

at this       time jeered the arrival                 of      injured,      but this turn ed to

clapping when they              r ealised the          serious      nature of the             incident.I        left

my seat at this             time and my way down to the                     playing a re a and

s u b s e q u e n t l y to the goal a rea at the L ep p in g s Ln end to offer my

assistance.          At that        stage    I saw nobody          in immediate         need of help and

so I returned to the                 corner     of the        pitch by the S pi on H op a nd the N

Stand.

I saw one fan being                 rest ra in e d by four P ol ic e O ff i ce r s            he s eemed

a g g r e s s i v e and was being           taken out of the ground.

I a lso ob se rv ed one fan who                 I took to have died,               as he was         lying      on

             the g round by the        shsde of the S p i on K op u n a t t e n d e d a nd his face was

             covered.        I saw an ot he r    being carried on a m ak e sh i ft s t re tc he r and

             his face was           purple.      I c oncluded he was         either     dying     or dead.     He was a

             large m an       in his e arly twenties wearing a grey sweater and jeans,

             I saw a number of other                     people under the N S ta nd near to a exit                point

             and     the    point tT&Ssqg used by the amb ul an ce s,               m a n y of these      people were

             took to be "wiise d ripping                 down   into the a re a that       people were         bieng

             treated.        I had no reason to              connect     the two y ouths       spitting     of being

             respo ns ib le for uri na ti ng and                I don't    believe    that     they had u r i n a t e d

             at that        point.     I am sure         that   the   persons     r es ponsible    for   the

             uri na ti ng w ould be t otally unaware                   of the fact      that    it was    or w o u ld

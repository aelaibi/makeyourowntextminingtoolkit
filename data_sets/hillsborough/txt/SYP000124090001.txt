 I HELPED A WHITE HAIRED OLD h          THE FENCE BETWEEN PENS 3 AND 2.    HE WAS

 F £ N T BUT I THINK HE WAS ALL/


Q17

 G49    DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS, OR

 THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 I THINK THE OPENING OF THE GATES WHICH ALLOWED THE CROWD IN UNCHECKED WAS AN

 IMPORTANT FACTOR.    ALSO POLICE ON THE PITCH SEEMED TO BE TAKING NO NOTICE OF

 PEOPLE ASKING TO BE HELPED OUT.

 HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?                             Qjlu&tL?— C o (Ma*aJ '
 THE POLICE DIDN'T HAVE       A CLUE WHAT WAS GOING ON.     THEY        WEREN’TPROPERLY

ORGANISED.        IT DIDN’T SEEMED TO BE     ORGANISED UNTIL THE        FIRE BRIGADE TURNED UP.
 tL----------
 IT SEEMED ALONG TIME BEFORE THE FIRST AMBULANCE ARRIVED.

^       IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY.

THE F.A. WERE WRONG IN CHOOSING THE GROUND THE FACILITIES AND THE SHEFFIELD

POLICE ARE NOT USED TO        CROWDS LIKE THERE WERE.

THE FIRST AID PROVIDED    WAS ONLY ON A .VERY SMALL SCALE.
                           C®X     \°u>b
 I ATTENDED THE SAME FIXTURE LAST SEASON.    IT WAS FAR BETTER ORGANISED THE

CROWD WAS CHECKED AWAY FROM THE GROUND BEFORE YOU GOT NEAR TO THE TURNSTILES.

A COMPLETE LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN WHAT WAS GOING ON AND WHAT THE POLICE

THOUGHT WAS GOING ON WHICH CAUSED THEM NOT TO RENDER ASSISTANCE WHEN IT WAS

REQUIRED.      I BELIEVE THAT THE OTHER EMERGENCY SERVICES SEEMED ALSO TO BE

SLOW.

        POLICE WERE LIMITED INTO A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY.       I ALSO CANNOT UNDER­

STAND WHY THE POLICE CONTROL BOX, LOOKS OVER THE SITUATION IN PENS 3 4 4           WHY

THE GAME KICK OFF WAS N ’T DELAYED AND MORE ORGANISATION OF CROWD COULDN’T BE

ARRANGED.

 Q52

 NO.

 053

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE MOST STRIKING WAS THE POLICEMEN ON THE HALFWAY /ARK.                           THEY COULD HAVE USED

THEMSELVES TO PULL THE FENCING DOWN.                            THEY WERE UNCO-ORDINATED, THEY WERE NOT

COMMANDED WHICH WAS QUITE EVIDENT,                           IN THAT SMALL/GROUPS OF OFFICERS SEEMED TO

DO THERE OWN THING (HELPING).                            THE AMOUNT OF SUPPORTERS HELPING WAS

A BOUNDING.              I WAS OUTSIDE THE GATES, THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE NEXT TO

ME AND A MOUNTED OFFICER,                        I WAS BEING PUSHED INTO THE HORSE.     A STEWARD

OPENED THE GATES FROM LEPPINGS LN, THJT CROWD SURGED TO THE TURNSTILES.

                   WAS PULLED THROUGH THE GA/TE OF THE FRONT FENCING IN PEN 3 BY A

POLICE OFFICER WHOM HE STATES SAVED HIM FROM SERIOUS INJURY.                            HE DESCXlBED THE

OFFICER ONLY AS TALL AND C O M P L E X L Y BALD

HILLSBOROUGH: CORRESPONDENCE FRO M VICTIM S’ FAM ILIES

Issue

How to handle correspondence which is received from relatives o f the Hillsborough
victims. We have received one letter (copy attached), from Michelle Carlile whose
brother was killed at Hillsborough, calling for another inquiry.

Timing

2       Routine, although there is apparently speculation among the families and others
closely involved that an announcement is imminent - see paragraph 6.

Recommendation

3.      Your predecessor (Home Secretary) replied personally to letters from victims
families, and you may wish to do likewise. A draft reply to Ms Carlile is attached.

 Consideration

 4.      The amount of Hillsborough-related correspondence increased markedly
 following the “Hillsborough Justice Campaign Day o f Support” on 3 May and the
 “Hillsborough Justice Concert” on 10 May, but has since tailed off. To date, this
 correspondence has included only one letter from a relative o f one of the victims o f the
 disaster, but more may follow.

 5.     The attached draft reply follows the line that you have taken in previous
 correspondence about the re-opening of the inquiry.

 H andling

 6.      I was contacted recently by a Liverpool City Council lawyer who also
 apparently acts as an adviser to the Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG). She
 said that she understood that an announcement was imminent and was concerned that
 the families had not been forewarned. I said that an announcement would likely be
 made as soon as possible after a decision had been taken but that no date had been set
 for an announcement, and that the families would be forewarned. The terms of the

reply to Ms Carlile may be looked at closely by the HFSG and others for any clues
when an announcement will be made.

 DRAFT LETTER FO R H OM E SECRETARY’S SIGNATURE

 Ms M Carlile


 Kirkbv
 L33


 Thank you for your letter o f 13 May about the terrible disaster at Hillsborough, in
 which you request that the inquiry into the disaster be re-opened. I was deeply moved
by the tragic events that day, and I fully appreciate the distress which you and your
family must have endured.


I am currently considering what action to take in response to the representations which
have been made for a fresh inquiry. I have been following the campaign for a new
inquiry closely, and since the broadcast of the television drama about the disaster in
December I have had the opportunity to meet some of the members of the
Hillsborough Families Support Group.


I am very conscious of the strength of feeling on this issue and want to make an
announcement as soon as I can, although I cannot say yet precisely when that will be. I
also intend that the families should be forewarned of the announcement. In the
meantime, I would like to say that my thoughts remain with you and with all the
bereaved families.

Thank you for your letter of 13 M a y about the terrible disaster at Hillsborough.
I w as deeply moved by the tragic events that day, and I fully appreciate the
distress which you and your fam ily must have endured.

You ask that the inquiry into this tragedy be re-opened. I am currently
considering w h a t action to take in response to such representations. I have
been following the campaign for a new inquiry closely and, since the broadcast
of the television drama about the disaster in Decem ber, I have had the
opportunity to m eet some of the members of the Hillsborough Families Support
Group.


I am therefore very conscious of the strength of feeling on this issue. I w a n t to
m ake an announcem ent as soon as I can but I cannot say yet precisely w hen
th at will be. H o w e v e r I do intend that you and the other families should be
given forewarning of the announcement. In the m eantime, I would like to say
th a t m y thoughts remain w ith you and w ith all the bereaved families.

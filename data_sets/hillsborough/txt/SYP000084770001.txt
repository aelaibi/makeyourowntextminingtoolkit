i t ’s a l r i g h t        I ’ve       got    a     ticket        anyway.           So     we     presumed              that     it w a s

either          Sheffield             Wednesday            or     the    FA    t h at     had      sent       this         lad as a p l a n t

to       see    if t h e r e       were       any       bent      turnstile          operators.

Also       as w e r e       were        queuing           we w e r e     discussing               whether          we     were        going      to

stop and watch                    the     rest       of    the     football          match,            and    thats           when     I was

informed             that       the     players           ha d    been       taken       off      the     pitch,           this       was about

3.15       pm,       and    t h at      there        were        some    fans       on    the      pitch.

When       I ’d h a n d e d        my     tickets          in,     I went          down     the        steps       in the S o u t h

Stand          by the S p i o n K o p              end and         could       see       people,          policemen,              fans      and

ambulance             m e n at        the     West        Stand        end    of    the     ground           on    the        pit c h ,    I

could also                see a n       ambulance             by the         West    Stand         near       to     the       goal       posts.

At       first       it    looked         more       like a        riot       situation.                I could           see      people

ripping          the       boardings           off        from around              the    ground,            and     other        people

being          carried across                 the       pitch,         going       out    of      the     ground          by     the      North

Stand/Spion                Hop     area.

people          to    c lear       off      t/he pitcjfl,          which       gave       me      the     impression               that

things          were       quieting           d o w n aftd b e i n g          brought          under         control.

I remained where                      I was        f o a a few min u et s                and      as    I could           see      more        and

more       people          being        ferlrie/5 a c r o s s           the    pi t c h,       I walked            along         the      gangway

area       where          people        come       in to         sit    down.

I could           see      ho w    ba d     it was,           I could         see    people            led    out        on     the    pitch

injured,             and    I could           se e      two      policemen          giving         heart          massage          to a y o u n g

lad.           It w a s     difficult              to     see     exactly          what     was        going       on as         people         were

    rushing       backwards          and       forwards            and      I decided                as    there       wa s    nothing           that

    I could       do    to    help,        that       I should             l e av e       the       grounds.

    I walked       back       along        the      gangway           in the S o u t h               Stand       through         the       office

    and    out    of    the    grounds           via       the     exit       for         players          and    officials            at    the

    back    of    the S o u t h S t a n d .

    I turned       right       out       of    the     entrance             and       walked          along       towards         Leppings

    Lane.

    As    I approached             turnstile           Nos       19-22        I saw a fire                  engine        reversing              and

    just    by t h o s e      turnstiles              I saw        the      big       sliding             gate    was    wide         open,

    which    I thought             was    a    bit     strange.               I carried               on w a l k i n g        towards

    Leppings       Lane       alongside             the      river,         I could             see       an amb-tilartce a n d             dozens

    of    police       men    in f r o n t       of me        and a few               fans  m i n g l i n g in w i t h                them.

    I could also             see    fans,        sat       d o ^      by    the/wall               on the        opposite         side       with

    their    heads       in t h e i r         hands,         I did'iT*-tr k n o w              whether        they      were      injured             or

    just    crying.

    After    I had w a l k e d           through           this       particular                   stage    of    the     crowds           the    air

    stank    very       heavily          of a l c o h o l ,        whether            it       had    been       spilled         on    the

    floor    or    not       I d o n ’t know.

    I eventually             got    to m y       vehicle           and      came       h ome.

    I forgot       to m e n t i o n e d        earlier           that       when          I    initially went                 to w a t c h       the

match and              I was       stood       at     the S o u t h Starid/Spion H o p                           corner,         rumours

    were    coming       through          to     us    via       the       crowd       that          the    Liverpool            fans       had

    kicked       down an       exit       gate        and     had      rushed          into          the    ground.            Somebody           had

also        mentioned          t ha t     the       f i re    brigade          ha d           come    to    use    wire        cutters           on

    the    fencing,          and    it a l s o        came a c r o s s         that            somebody          had    heard         on    the

    radio    that       two    people          had     been        killed.

12.   HILLSBOROUGH - THE ASSOCIATION RESPONSE

           In closed session the President outlined to Conference the action taken
      by the Association since the Hillsborough Tragedy had occurred.           The
      National Secretary had maintained close contact with the Branch concerned
      and bad put Andrew Weir and the Allianz Insurance on notice for legal
      assistance to be arranged for those involved.        An initial Association
      response was forwarded to the Lord Justice Taylor Inquiry, which addressed
      general areas of concern, but upon receipt of the Interim Report a circular
      was prepared and sent out to Branches from Pangbourne, drawing attention to
      the issues that bad emerged and which needed to be discussed at Branch level
      in order to obtain a view as to how the Association should react. Extra­
      ordinary Branch meetings had subsequently been convened by most forces and
      full responses had been received and the President extended an invitation to
      delegates to further contribute.        Delegates expressed concern at the
      balance of blame set out in the Interim Report.      Public order and major
      disaster were seen as proper matters for the police. Safety precautions,
      structure and systems within football grounds were seen as matters for
      football clubs. The requirements made of other organisers of other public
      entertainments were contrasted with the massive support in manpower and
      equipment supplied to football clubs by the police.        Members expressed
      concern that the burden, in resource terms, imposed upon the police by
      football was then so high that other services to the public were suffering.
      It was pointed out that it would be quite impossible for the police to
      support other sports and entertainments in the same way as football.

           Particular emphasis was laid upon the problems that had ensued in
      attempting to draft agreements between clubs and police setting out the
      responsibilities of each.      Such agreements were seen by some as legal
      contracts. The differing terms and conditions in those agreements that had
      been put into effect was of concern. Others pointed out that agreements had
      not been possible and in any case the proper person to draft, what was
      effectively a legal contract, was a lawyer.    Delegates regretted that the
      Interim Report had not clarified the police role in football matches nor
      fully defined the responsibilities of clubs.    It was pointed out that the
      lack of authority for police to have real impact on decisions made as to
      dates and times of matches, coupled with the demand for a police attendance
      on a massive scale imposed heavy burdens on police resources.      Clubs, in
      fact, paid little towards the cost of events that they organised, but even
      if funds were available the reality of police manpower levels meant that the
      response needed for all public entertainments could not possibly be met.
      Certain tasks were seen as properly those for fully trained stewards.
      Illustrations were given of stewarding. Mention was also made for the need
      for legislation to deal with the problems of ticketless fans and ticket
      touts.

           The President announced that a special meeting of the Executive
      Committee would be held to prepare further written and oral evidence to be
      submitted to Lord Justice Taylor. Branch responses, the comments of members
      and delegates and any further information any member or delegate wished to
      supply would be taken into consideration. At the conclusion of the debate,
      the President thanked members for their contribution. The following press
      release was proposed and issued:

            "It is natural that at our first Conference following the
            publication of Lord Justice Taylor’s Interim Report that we should
            consider his recommendations.        There are officers in the
            Superintending ranks at this Conference who are responsible for

                                            5
            policing football and other sporting events throughout England and
            Wales and the National Executive considered it appropriate to
            obtain their views and to hear their experiences in implementing
            those recommendations.      The debate we had was practical and
            constructive.   The delegates were quite naturally concerned too
            about our colleagues in South Yorkshire,    We are conscious that
            regular commitment of police personnel to football matches,
            mainly at public expense, attended by about lj£ of our population
            is to the detriment of the quality of policing provided to the
            other 99?.   This balance is wrong and is a problem that must be
            addressed. You will know that Lord Justice Taylor is carrying on
            with the second phase of his Inquiry and we will be submitting to
            him our opinions about the root causes of football disorder and
            our future role in policing sporting events."

             Chief Constable of the Devon & Cornwall Constabulary



     Home Secretary, President of the Association and Chairman of            the
Executive Committee, Ladies and Gentlemen.

     My first and, I suppose, customary duty which is indeed a pleasure is
to welcome you to the fair county of Devon and, 1 hope to some extent, the
hospitality of the Devon & Cornwall Constabulary.

     I know that in your business over the next few days you will consider
the future of the Service which, as the Home Secretary knows only too well,
usually entails spending more money I

       In this regard I am reminded of the world's three greatest lies:

(i)        the first - "the cheque is in the post"!

(ii)       the second- from the most ardent of us -     "of course I love you
           darling"!

(iii)      and thirdly - "I'm from the Home Office and I'm here to help you"!

     I hope Home Secretary you will forgive me for that - we know we have
your full support in seeking to enhance the quality of Service we seek to
provide in our communities.

     Convivial though your surroundings are, the business you have in hand
is pressing and my task is simply to set you on your way.

     All Conferences are, almost inevitably, concerned with examining the
problems that have gone before but, in looking towards the future we must
ensure the lessons are learned. Sometimes we are reasonably satisfied with
what has been achieved and we are looking for incremental changes and
reasonable advances in our affairs.    Other times we seem to stand at a
"water-shed" and address our minds to some new and great enterprise the
Service has had to confront with limited resources. In the recent past the
Service and your Association have considered such mighty issues as serious
urban disorder and a rising tide of crime. Today the sheer volatility and
awkwardness of so many people when facing up to police officers fulfilling
their law enforcement role entails that public disorder is an issue before
us constantly.

      Yet, it is arguably less the practical things which loom on the horizon
 than Issues concerning principles and structures.

      I note from your Agenda that our ties with Europe in 1992 figure
 prominently. Indeed, the developing role of the Police Service is implicit
 in almost everything you will debate. This is hardly surprising and ACPO

                                       11
 are looking at a very similar agenda. Most significantly, the framework of
 the debate which, at times, seems almost to be "mysterious" in the sense
 that it is referred to constantly, but not on any "formal" aganda, relates
 to the structure of the Service itself.

     These are large questions and, I suppose, the Home Affairs Select
Committee raised many issues which continue to arouse discussion at all
levels in politics and within the Service*     Indeed, such is the level of
discussion that it may be the Service cannot simply stand aside and let that
discussion take place around it without developing its own considered view.

     Two questions seem to be at the heart of the matter.         Should the
present structure of the Service once again be reconfigured, say along
Regional lines? And should the existing tripartite arrangements, which have
become the bedrock of local identitiy and accountability, be superseded?

     In this respect there are at least two other questions which may at
times seem anti-pathetic: on the one hand, and more than ever before, the
Service is particularly concerned to continue to develop its links with
local communities and a sense of joint responsibility for law and order; on
the other and such is the need for weighty expenditure on manpower and
equipment, the present arrangements will need to be kept constantly under
review to ensure the means for financing the Service's needs, particularly
given the impact of the community charge on the local authority's ability to
raise the necessary funding.

     Parallel to these heady matters is another question which the Home
Affairs Select Committee directed its mind to, particularly in relation to
ACPO. I think it is fair to say that the same question is just as pertinent
when directed towards your Association. If Staff Associations are to play a
critical role in the evolution of policy, as they must, are they resourced
sufficiently? Do they have the means? And does their constitution need to
be placed on a more formal footing?

     In all these matters it does seem to be of vital importance that Ube
Staff Associations continue to discuss jointly their thoughts and positions.
The continued work of the Joint Consultative Committee is imperative and,
without surrendering any responsibility for individual members and their
needs, there is an essential role for joint discussion, so that the whole
Service can work together to achieve the objective. Indeed the work being
undertaken at present by the Operational Policing Review in relation to two
of last year's Home Office Circulars is an excellent example of that.

     Over the past twelve months we have, as ever, been faced with disasters
and calamitous events. These sorts of problems are accompanied constantly
by calls for national plans or national schemes or whatever.           It is
inarguable that, whatever the structure of our Service, our ability to co­
operate and co-ordinate in detail must continue. On the crime front too,
such matters as fraud, series murders and the pervasive tentacles of drugs
syndicates entail that none of us police an "island". The need to maintain
the co-ordinated approach does not necessarily sit uneasily with the
individual character of separate police forces and the prime
responsibilities of Chief Constables, but it has emphasised the need to
examine considerably the arrangements we have for achieving the greatest
possible degree of uniformity.




                                    12
     When we look at the role of Staff Associations and particularly ACPO,
we face the difficulty that so much of our time is taken up with matters of
policy, procedure and practice but perhaps too little of our time has been
concerned with enhancing the conditions of service of our membership. It is
essential to the future of the Service and, indeed, to the prospects of the
Superintendents' Association, that the right people and the most able people
are attracted to command in the highest reaches of the Service.          The
arrangements for facilitating career development at the higher levels, where
it is so evident that officers may need to move around the country, remain
unattractive. This is only one issue but a very important one and I would
suggest that we cannot afford to ignore the importance of articulating the
staff needs of senior police officers because it is only when we get those
things right that we can anticipate the best prospects for the management of
the Service.

     Home Secretary, President of the Association and Chairman of the
Executive Committee, Ladies and Gentlemen.

     It is my great pleasure to welcome you to this splendid location and,
despite the seriousness of some of my remarks, I know you will enjoy the
best of debate. In fact, serious matters are the stuff of good conferences
and I know that worthy debate will be accompanied by all the good humour and
professionalism that I wish you in the days ahead and indeed, for the future
of your Association.

         TO THE HOME SECRETARY THE RT. HON. DOUGLAS HURD. CBE. MP

    Home Secretary, distinguished guests, Ladies and Gentlemen.

     It is with pride and pleasure that I welcome you to this, the 36th
A.J.M. of our Association.

     Horae Secretary, we note this is your fifth successive Conference, in
fact you have a 100JS attendance record since taking office which is very
much appreciated.

     There have been many changes, both in society and the Police Service
since our founders first met.    Indeed during our own career spans, which
for some of us is around 30 years, the list of changes is phenomenal. In
our structure alone we've reduced from in excess of 100 forces to 43.

     We were pleased you quickly laid to rest the suggestion that the
Service should be changed yet again with regionalisation when you expressed
confidence in the present structure.           We are of the view that
regionalisation would create unnecessary tiers of administration, both
police and civilian, at highly inflated salaries, and this increased
bureaucracy would give the public poor value for money.          For police
commanders to be truly successful, they should not be too far removed from
the communities they serve and to whom they are, quite properly,
accountable.

     Having said that, we recognise that regionalisation of some resources,
e.g. vehicle fleet management, computers and uniform could lead to
improvements in standardisation, compatibility and co-operation, with
better value for money. With 1992 fast approaching, there is merit too in
Sir Peter Imbert's suggestion about an FBI arrangement for the U.K. to
combat national and international crimes.

     I started my service in the summer of 1959 which was when there was
more respect for uniform and authority, respect earned by tradition,
encouraged by parents and education, and guaranteed because many of the
adult male population had served our country in uniform.

     Today we are faced with a much more complex, cosmopolitan and mobile
society. One which has great expectations of us and makes ever increasing
demands.   It is sometimes difficult to meet all these demands which range
from dealing with noisy, inconsiderate neighbours, or their children, to
rape, murder and the armed criminal, as clearly demonstrated by the tragic
death of Inspector Codling. In attempting to properly manage resources, we
are obliged to make hard choices about what can and cannot be done which
inevitably means that some may be disenchanted with our response to their
problem.

                                     14
     During the past 12 months the Service and our Senior Officers have
been the focus of media attention for various reasons.

     In one article I read discussing the Right of Silence, the author
suggested a change in the rules would enable the police, and I quote "To
harass and intimidate defence witnesses in the months preceding the trial
—       What Police Service was he talking about, Sir?    It certainly was
not the one we manage and the one for which you are responsible. I wonder
if the author has ever considered the position of prosecution witnesses
after committal papers have been served?

     Sadly, this year has been overshadowed by the events at Hillsborough
but the subjudice nature of the case prevents me from making comments about
specific issues.   However, I believe in this opening address it would be
remiss of me not to make some general comments.

     Hillsborough was a salutary reminder of the crucial role played by
members of this Association in planning for and dealing with major events;
it highlighted the importance of training, continuity and the gathering of
intelligence; and above all else it demonstrated the heavy responsibility
which lies with members of this Association in all policing operations
involving public order and control and which for the first time in a case of
this nature could lead to criminal proceedings.

     Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations are considered to be most
appropriate for dealing with big matches but we have reservations as to
whether they should apply to every Football League Match.       We will be
discussing the implications of the Interim Report in closed session at this
Conference.

     While not wishing to make too fine a point of it, it should not be
forgotten that members of this association who are on call 24 hours a day,
are committed to providing an effective, efficient and caring service. To
that end they often make great personal and family sacrifices in order to
serve their communities. They have even been required to undertake duties
outside their normal remit like, for example, manning a prison. However,
we recognised the need to protect the public and stepped into the breach.
All in all the public gets good value for money.       We are proud of our
performance and Home Secretary, you have every reason to be so too.

     I would now like to turn to what we believe are some of the main
problems affecting the police and the public on a daily basis. (The list
is by no means exhaustive).

identical to yours.     That is to safeguard and if possible improve the
quality of life for each and every citizen.         Sir, if you heed our
re commendations and acknowledge the requests we have made today, most of
which should be self-financing, we will together be moving in the right
direction.    That is protecting and preserving life and making sure that
crime does not pay.

              ADDRESS BY THE BT. HON. DOUGLAS HURD, CBB, HP

                              HOME SECRETARY

                           26th September, 1989



     Thank you, Mr President, for your welcome and for your deeply
thoughtful speech. You mentioned that I have come here on every occasion in
the last four years. I have always enoyed it very much and found it a very
useful moment in the year to take stock with members of your Association on
what is going in policing, and I have always gone away the wiser as a
result.

     You have set a good theme this time, because it is clear to me that the
next 10 years will be very important in the history of the police service.

     I don’t want to look back at any length into the past, although history
does give a bit of perspective. It is perhaps worth remembering that in May
1979 the Metropolitan Police alone needed over 4,000 officers to bring them
up to their authorised establishment and for the whole of England and Wales
the figure was over 7,500. There is no doubt that the police service was
then, compared to now, poorly equipped to meet the challenges of the 80's.

     By and large, all forces are now up to strength and there has been an
increase of some 13,800 since 1979 in the number of police officers in
England and Wales.   In addition, there are over 8,000 more civilian staff.
During the past 6 years, civilianisation has released some 4,000 police
officers for operational duties. These are all record totals. They are not
the act of some reckless policy of generosity on the part of Government,
because Governments on a whole are not generous by nature - that is not what
they are there for.     Always distrust a politician who comes before you
dressed as Santa Clause.     The increases were achieved because they were
needed - because of the ground which had to be recovered to make the
deficiencies I have just mentioned and because of, what you accurately
described, the steady build up of tasks which society has loaded onto the
police.    That is why my predessors and I have been able to argue
successfully for these increases.    They are not as big as you, or indeed
most of the public would like, but we do have to look at them alongside the
substantial improvement in police pay and allowances.     It is part of the
same story, the money all comes out of the same pot and a trained police
officer is now a very expensive person.

     I am not going to go on today about money and value for money because I
entirely accept that that is not the whole or indeed the essence of
policing.   But in real life it can’t ever be very far from my mind as Home
Secretary.   It now costs £400 to keep a presence of one police officer in
one place for 24 hours in London, a bit less elsewhere. Despite this we are
planning a further substantial increase in police manpower over the next few
years and I hope to be able to give details of that before long.          With
expenditure on the police expected to reach £.4.1 billion in 1989/90 , there




                                     21
are clearly limits to the speed at which the service can be allowed to
expand.    But no other public service has had the same proportionate
increase. The priority was deserved, for the reasons you stated and it has
been given, and is still needed.

     Now you mentioned civilianisation and you warned about the risks of
going to far. You mentioned the possible consequences of an all-out strike.
Those risks must be balanced against the advantages.     You mentioned the
recent pay dispute when NALGO called all their employees out on strike.
About 8% of the total provincial civilian strength responded to that call.
In most cases, the loyalty of police civilians to the police service was
greater than their loyalty to the union.

     You spoke about drugs and quite rightly I don’t think any police
conference would be complete without a mention of that.   I agree with you
about the need for firm police action to deal with drug trafficking on our
streets and in our pubs. Rigorous enforcement of the criminal law against
all those involved in this trade - the drug users as well as the dealers-
Is crucial.    The police have my full support for their efforts and I have
never gone    along with the criticism of over-policing in the kind of
incidents to which you referred.

     I don’t think thre is any lack of powers there. In 198? the maximum
penalty for trafficking in Class A drugs like heroin and cocaine was
increased to life imprisonment. The Drug Trafficking Offences Act I986 has
greatly extended the scope for enforcement action by providing new powers to
trace, freeze and confiscate the proceeds of drug trafficking. This Act is
quite new, but it has already proved itself.      Thanks to the Act we are
getting at    traffickers where it really hurts: in their pockets.      £8.1
million was    ordered to be confiscated last year by the Courts in this
country.

     But the harder I have looked at the drugs problem, the more clearly I
realise from every piece of information I get that we shall not be able to
solve it be enforcement action alone.     Indeed I was very struck by that
message when I heard direct from David Owen, Chief Constable of North Wales
and Mr Mullett of West Mercia the account of the most recent ACPO seminar on
it. We have to find improved ways of tackling the demand for drugs, because
without that demand there would be no market for the traffickers to supply.
The arrival of "crack" on our streets makes this task more urgent. So as
the seminar pointed out and as every message that we get from across the
Atlantic reinforces, education is the key, through the schools and national
publicity campaigns, and also at the level of the local community. With my
Ministerial colleagues, I am urgently working on what more can be done, at
the community level, to get the right messages across to young people most
at risk.   If we are to succeed in getting this support mobilised for drug
prevention, we have to make use of all the available people and groups,
churches, parents, business, tenants associations as well as the statutory
services and that certainly includes the police. The police have a crucial
role to play in these efforts at prevention, and we shall see that you are
fully involved.

     Like everyone, X was shocked and saddened by the murder of Inspector
Golding.    His name has already passed from the headlines: it is worth
remembering that the grief of his family is only just beginning.   We are
thinking also today of the lads and their families in Kent.



                                    22
     Life imprisonment is the mandatory penalty for murder. I am continuing
my predecessor's policy of requiring those responsible for the worst
categories of murder - including those who kill police or prison officers to
serve at least, and X emphasise at least, 20 years in prison.            Any
suggestion that the murderer of a police officer is being released after ten
years is very wide of the mark. Since 1965 , 26 adults have been given life
sentences for the murder of police officers. Two have died in prison. Not
one has been released.

     The Government's policy is that those who are convicted of serious
violent offences should expect to spend a long time in custody.           We
reinforce that by one of the latest changes in the law, familiar to you-
the Criminal Justice Act 1988. Since the 1st February, the Attorney General
has had power to refer to the Court of Appeal cases triable only on
indictment if he considers that the sentence given was too lenient. In the
last few days you will have seen that he has actually used that power and in
the first case where he did use it the Court of Appeal increased the
sentence for an offence committed in Preston. In the last few years, the
Crown Court has been giving more severe sentences for serious violent crime.
The courts give harsher sentences when the victim is elderly or very young
for precisely the reasons you were giving just now, Mr President.
Burglaries of people's homes are treated more severly by the courts than
other burglaries and there is no question of domestic burglaries being
"downgraded" as you feared.    What you said about the upset, the suffering
and at worse the inconvience to those who suffer domestic burglaries is
just.

      Nearly half the burglaries committed each year are not of people's
homes and the value of the property taken is small. We have to consider if
custody is the most effective way to deal with many offenders who commit the
less serious property crimes. The Probation Service is doing a lot of new
work to get offenders to face up to what they have done and understand the
consequences for their victims and themselves.    It is very important that
the Probation Service should understand the responsibility which falls on
them to be convincing to you, your members, the Police Service, to the
Magistrates, to the Judges, about what they offer in the way of punishment
in the community.     But equally I hope that your members and the Police
Service and the Judiciary will keep their minds open to what is happening in
this field.    This work and Community Service which is now operating under
new national standards, should make considerable demands on offenders. They
should not be soft options, we are seeking to make sure that they aren't.
We are talking now about the lesser property offence.        Doing something
useful in the community, paying something back to the community, may often
be a better punishment than sitting in prison without responsibilities,
mingling with other more serious criminals at a cost of £275 a week to the
 community.

      The other point you mentioned, Mr President, I can give you another
 assurance - we have no plans to amend the Bail Act.

      You spoke, Mr President, about the toll of death and injury on our
 roads.   I agree that the figures you gave are far too high and too often
 forgotten.   Certainly there can be no cause for congratulation so long as
 the figures are anything like that level.




                                      23
     The Government has set a target of reducing casualties by a third "by
the year 2000. We published a White Paper earlier this year, following the
North Report, on the reform of road traffic law. The proposals in the White
Paper which deal with the classification and punishment of offences will
make a substantial contribution to achieving that target.

     You referred in particular to the breath testing powers of the police.
As you know, we have been looking carefully at that since ACPO came forward
with the proposal that the existing powers should be extended to include
unfettered discretion.      I announced a period of public consulation in
February. We are considering carefully that response and as part of that, I
certainly take note of your remarks.

     A word, Mr President, about recruitment, because I think everyone in
the Service and certainly everyone in your Association knows that in the
next decade there will be a substantial fall in the number of school leavers
coming on to the employment market. Competition for good quality recruits
will be intense and the Police Service will have to take a critical look at
its recruitment procedures. Policing today, more than ever before, provides
a variety of opportunities for acquiring skills and self knowledge and for
advancement to tasks of great responsibility such as your own. I sometimes
think, that in the national desire of the police to bring to the attention
of the public the problems which exist as you are perfectly entitled, we may
be loosing sight of the attractiveness of a career in the Police Service to
a go-a-head youngster. I have heard one Chief Police Officer say "What we
haven't got across is that there are not private soldiers in the Police
Service". My point is a simple one, that a police constable nowadays starts
with a range of duties which is varied and testing.         Somebody who is
interested in a career of that kind may not realise that is true, the range
of duties, risks and skills which he can apply.       The experience gained
advancement owed is very great indeed. I am not clear that we are getting
this message through to those whom we need to reach in the schools and
universities.

     A Police Advisory Board Working Party is looking at this and I expect
them to report back to the Board very shortly.     The Service will need to
think more about getting people in and less about keeping people out. That
doesn't mean a lowering of standards, but if there are arbitrary and
unnecessary obstacles to appointment, then they clearly need to be looked at
and removed.

     There has been much recent debate, to which you referred, about whether
the present structure of the Police Service is right. I must make it clear
that I have no intention of standing up in this Parliament and proposing a
statutory change in the structure of policing. I see no charm and some loss
in upheaval for upheaval's sake.        I don't want to obliterate local
loyalties, the kind of loyalties which I find whenever I visit a police
force, mess night or police station, just when the local roots of policing
are showing themselves more important than ever before.        We intend to
maintain the present structure of the 1964 Act with the responsibilities
shared between the Chief Constable, the Police Authority and the Gome
Secretary. We have no plans at present to re-exaraine the structure, either
with a new Royal Commission or otherwise. Our present police arrangements
has prove sufficiently strong and flexible to cope with the stresses and
strains to which they have bee subjected over the last quarter of a century.




                                    24
     But within the structure much has to change.        We have to bestir
ourselves to make sure that new needs are being well met.        We need to
strengthen co-operation between forces. The regional crime squads exist to
combat crime which crosses force and regional boundaries. The drugs wings
were added, and have since been strengthened, to help them to tackle drug
trafficking. These structures can be developed to meet new challenges. For
example, on the front of criminal intelligence, many people in the Police
Service have questioned the wisdom of isolating drugs from other criminal
intelligence. There are good reasons, based on history, for having focussed
on drugs because of the special threat which they pose. I certainly would
not want any changes which undermine the the progress which has been made in
improving our drugs intelligence facilities.

     But we should ask ourselves whether the increasing sophistication of
major crime and the clear links between drug trafficking and other serious
crimes, make it necessary to bring all criminal intelligence together in a
national unit. A facility of this kind may also be necessary to help us to
co-operate effectively with enforcement agencies abroad.

     The National Drugs Intelligence Unit provides a model for how this
might be done and the benefits to be gained. There are certainly practical
issues which have to be resolved.      There have to be adequate computer
facilities to make the Unit acceptable to the Police Service at all levels
and provide an interface with other law enforcement agencies.

     We cannot afford to wait for events to expose weaknesses in our present
arrangements.   Improvements of this kind need a lot of preparation. I am
not a Minister of the Interior, I don't have the kind of powers which some
of my colleagues on the Continent have where if I were to decide that this
was a good idea, I could simply impose it. That is not the nature of our
structure, but the consultation which is needed will take place.      In the
coming months we will be looking closely at our intelligence arrangements
and whether a national criminal intelligence unit is now desirable.

     Then there is the European dimension.    I am not talking particularly
about 1992. The Government has made clear its determination to maintain the
frontier checks necessary to combat terrorism, drug trafficking and serious
crime. There are signs that the need for such checks to continue is now
widely accepted within Europe.    But these important checks have not been
enough.

     There is an overwhelming case for strengthening police co-operation in
Europe.    What used to be, perhaps when you started Mr President, the
exception - an operation which involved other police forces speaking other
languages from other countries is now of course normal.       You go to The
Hague, you go to Paris - you hear of the telexes flowing all the time asking
for assistance. This is the goal we are pursuing in its own right and 1992
gives us an opportunity to make faster progress. I am trying to strengthen
these links through a series of agreements on terrorism, the confiscation of
drug trafficking assest and organised crime.      I hope to be able to go
further in changing our own law so that we can give and take mutual legal
assistance to a greater extent than now. We have changed our own law on
extradition and that should enable us to ratify the European Convention on
that subject. I am pressing for all European countries to establish their
own nation drug intelligence units and then we want to discuss the need for
a European unit. I welcome the growing awareness and interest in the Police
Service of these developments.

     If we are to respond effectively to the overwhelming case for greater
co-operation across tbe Channel etc., the Police Service must speak with a
united and coherent voice to those overseas who are ready to speak and
listen to us.   Our friends will have difficulty with a system of policing
here which cannot at the right moment stand and speak as one. The co­
operation in this area between Government and police will grow closer, and I
know I can look to you to play your full part.

     Another need is an increase in the pace of technological developments,
ranging from DNA profiling to new devices for traffic policing.     Perhaps
particularly worth mentioning today is information technology which is the
application of technology to the handling of large amounts of data,
including both words and pictures.

     The Police Service has been living with computers for many years now.
The PNC became operational in 197^. Most officers now on the beat cannot
remember a time when the PNC was not there to give them answers to vital
questions about vehicle ownership and so on. But the time has come to look
beyond the facilities of the PNC or even its successor, PNC2, which will be
ready at the end of next year.

     Advances in information technology over the last 5-10 years mean that
it may now be possible to build cost-effective national Systems for handling
millions of fingerprints, photographs and detailed criminal records.       A
comprehensive survey of police needs for more and better information was
undertaken by the Home Office last year.         We are now exploring the
feasibility of building systems capable of meeting these needs. This is a
big undertaking, it will cost a lot and need a lot of careful planning by
tbe Home Office and the Police Service, working together. The aim will be
to provide officers on the beat with direct access to national collections
of information which today require days and even weeks of manual effort to
use.

     You mentioned the Forensic Science Service, Mr President, and I hope
that under its new Director General, Jan Thompson, the Forensic Science
Service is now moving forward across a wide front.        It went through a
period, which happens in the public service from time to time, when a lot
of committees and working groups look at it, but I hope the Forensic Science
Service has now come through that stage and will now be able to move
forwards. I entirely share your understanding of Its importance. The most
spectacular of its new advances is, of course, the introduction of DNA
profiling, which is now an integral part of tbe investigation of crime
agains the person. Something in which this country is taking a lead.

      I have gone quite quickly over some of the issues which I picked out of
policing for tbe 90's. There are others which we will need to address, I
hope during the next few weeks to be putting forward some ideas on police
leadership, which is how we make sure under our present system that the
leadership emerges of the kind and quality that the Police Service will need
during the 1 9 9 0 ' I think that Is an issue on which more work needs to be
done.

     The Police Service can be proud of its achievements and the way it has
coped with the intense variaty of tasks over the past decade. I believe that
it is in good shape to meet the equally formidable demands of the coming
decade. Times are changing too fast, and the challenges are too great, for
us to feel we can take a breather. You have sometimes gently chided me in
the past for producing too much legislation. I am not thinking now of new

                                    26
laws for the police, I don't actually see the need for that. I believe the
present legislation can accommodate the progress we now need. I think we
can put tbe new wine into the existing bottles without breaking them. But
on the subjects I have mentioned we need fresh, intelligent and energetic
thinking from all parts of the system.    That, Mr President, emphatically
includes the Home Office and the Home Secretary, and I look forward to
working with you in that task.

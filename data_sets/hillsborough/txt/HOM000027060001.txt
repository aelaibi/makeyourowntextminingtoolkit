                      TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR FOOTBALL CLUB
                            EMERGENCY PROCEDURES


In the event of a major incident, stewards, police and other
emergency services will be alerted by the following message over
the Club public address system and the P/R system (police and
security).   The code phrase to indicate the exact location of
the incident will be:

         The Club has a message -for Mr ENGLAND. ......(location of
         incident).

This message will be preceded by a single electronic note and the
message will be repeated once.

The following action will      immediately be taken;-


(1)       All turnstiles,   if open will close   immediately.

(2)       All exit gate stewards will unlock     but not open their
gates.

(3)    All police officers will come to the alert and await
further directions.

(4)      The Club Secretary and senior police officer in        charge-
will   go to the police control room.

(5) Designated officers from Serial 162 (and Serial 163 if A or B
match) will immediately return to exit south and east gates to
ensure that they are unlocked and manned by stewards and standby
to facilitate evacuation.

(6) Designated officers from Serial 164 will immediately return
to exit North gates to ensure that they are unlocked and manned
by stewards and standby to facilitate evacuation.

(7) Designated officers from Serial 166 will immediately return
to exit west gates to ensure that they are unlocked and manned by
stewards and standby to facilitate evacuation.

(8) The remainder of Serial 166 will return to pre match
deployments and standby to assist arrival of emergency vehicles.



STAND DOWN PROCEDURE

In any case where the emergency signal has been transmitted, the
decision to restore the situation to normal will be relayed by
police radio and club security radio network e.g. "The previous
message for Mr ENGLAND is cancelled". No P.A- announcement will
be m a d e ■



SEARCH


RESPONSIBILITY FOR SEARCH

The responsibility for searching the stadium for explosive
devices and any decision to evacuate part or whole of the stadium
rests with the "Club Secretary" and Senior Police Officer.


METHOD OF SEARCH

In the event of a bomb threat the "Club Secretary" will put into
operation the pre-arranged stewards search plan(Copy with Control
Spurs). Police will assist if necessary, particularly in the
public areas under the stands. If a suspected explosive device is
found, police will take command, seal off the area and call for
an explosives officer.


REGULAR PRE-MATCH SEARCH

This is the responsibility of Serial 161 which will always
comprise local officers familiar with the ground. The task, will
be undertaken after "their meal but prior to being deployed by
Control Spurs. The search will be carried out in company with a
designated Chief Steward before gates are open- Control Spurs
will be informed by Inspector i/c Serial 161 when the search is
complete.

Should it become necessary for any subsequent searches, these
will also be undertaken by Serial 161 who will be in the best
position to note any significant changes from their original
search.

Control Spurs will ensure reserve serials are deployed to replace
serial 161 whilst they undertake this duty.


BOMB THREATS

If a bomb warning is received subsequent to a search, the
following message will be conveyed over the club's and police
P / R :-

"Would Mr. HUMPHREY meet Mr. MILES outside the main entrance
after the match".

The officer in charge of Serial 161 will report   immediately to
the Chief Superintendent in the control room.
GENERAL STRATEGIES FOR PARTICULAR SITUATIONS


LOCK OUT

Police will be deployed at Paxton Road j/w Worcester Avenue; Park
Lane j/w Worcester Avenue to preserve order amongst spectators.
Spectators will be informed that access to the ground is no
longer possible and asked to disperse. They will be given ample
time to do so. A sweeping tactic will not normally be used unless
serious public disorder occurs.


EVACUATION

If evacuation becomes necessary it will not normally be possible
to continue with the policy of segregation.
Police will ensure that stewards open all gates and do their
utmost to prevent panic and facilitate the calm but swift egress
of spectators.


PITCH INVASION

Serials 161; 164; and 165 will go   immediately to the half w a y •
line and sweep the crowd to their   respective ends, 161 towards
the south and 164/165 towards the   north. All horses and dogs will
go immediately to the area by the   police room and await
instructions from Control Spurs.


CROWD DISTRESS

There will be a designated police officer to each self contained
terrace area(4 to South Terrace, 3 to East Terrace, and 1 to
North Terrace).   His sole responsiblity will be to check crowd
conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress,
throughout the period that the area is occupied by spectators.
He will always have means to immediately communicate with the
Police Control Room, and will constantly liaise with officers
posted to perimeter gates, and Senior Officers in charge of that
area.

PERIMETER F E N C E S .

There will be a police officer deployed to each perimeter gate
around the pitch.   This officer is authorised to decide whether
or not to allow spectators through gates to relieve overcrowding.
It is appreciated that such judgement will be subjective, and in
practise will be assisted through consultation with Senior
Officers and officers monitoring crowd distress.
HOWEVER IF THE OFFICER GENUINELY BELIEVES THAT IMMEDIATE DANGER
IS LIKELY TO ANY SPECTATOR HE IS AUTHORISED TO TAKE APPROPRIATE
ACTION.

FIRST AID F A C I L I T I E S -

L-A.S. Ambulances will be on standby at every match (The number
will depend on the anticipated crowd capacity-)    They will be
parked in Worcester Avenue/Park Lane.   In case of emergency all
supporting L-A.S- vehicles will be directed to Park Lane where
access to the Stadium can be gained via the entrance near the
junction with Worcester Avenue.
A Medical Practitioner will be on standby near the St Johns
Ambulance Post, near the Police Control Room-

DELAYING K -0-/STOPPING MATCH

If for any reason it becomes necessary to delay kick off or stop
the match, Control Spurs will notify the officer responsible for
referee/officials-   A message will be relayed immediately to the
match officials by this officer.

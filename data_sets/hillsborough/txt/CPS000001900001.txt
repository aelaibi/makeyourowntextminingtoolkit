Dear Mr Croston

HILLSBOROUGH : ADLINGTON -V- DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

We are dispatching to you by fax, and putting into the Document Exchange the hard copies
o f the following.

1.       Representation on behalf o f Mr Bernard Murray.

2.       Schedules A, B and C referred to in the representations.

3.       Copy of the report o f R -v- H M Coroner for South Yorkshire ex parte Stringer
         and others.

4.        Copy Yorkshire Evening Post o f 17 September 1998.

So that I know both that you have received the papers and that you have a full set o f these,
could I trouble you to please acknowledge safe receipt.

I can tell you that there will be a very short further submission to be made to you
tomorrow on the further representations that have been made by HFSG. As a matter of
courtesy, I have copied all of these documents to HFSG and to save you having to do so,
I have also sent a copy to Winckworth and Pemberton.

I would welcome in due course advices as to the date when you have submitted your report
to the Director of Public Prosecutions. I think it is then important to try to establish within
what period of time the Director expects to have made a decision. There seems to be little
point in bringing matters back before the Magistrates’ Court on 30October                if the
Director’s decision is not likely to have been made by that date.

Y ourt sincerely

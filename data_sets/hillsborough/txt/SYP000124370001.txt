 OTHER THAN SEEING THE GATE OPEN AND A MASSIVE RUSH OF FANS INTO THE GROUND.

 GSO

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 AT ABOUT 3.40 <1540>-3.45PM (1543).

 051

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A LOUD

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 I DID HEAR AN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE GAME HAD BEEN ABANDONED AND SO AFTER THAT

 IT WAS A MATTER OF LEAVING OF MY OWN ACCORD.


G18



 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YO lN^ONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 I DIDN’T SEE ANYONE STEALING OR A N Y T H ^ G LIKE THAT. I DID SEE A PHOTOGRAPHER

 TAKING PHOTOS TO THE RIGHT OF LEPPINGS LNSSJAMD LOOKING FROM PITCH S I D E SOME

 FANS WERE HITTING AND KICKING HIM FOR WHATEVER REASON, SOME POLICE TOOK HIM

 AWAY.

 G53

 DID YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 |0!AS VERY IMPRESSED BY THE WAY THE SUPPORTERS DID THEIR     BIT TO HELP.   IN FACT

 THEY DID A GREAT DEAL THAT DAY FOR THE DEAD AND INJURED.     I MUST SAY I DIDN’T

 REALISE THAT PEOPLE WERE DEAD UNTIL MUCH LATER.

 THE ONLY ANNOUNCEMENT I WAS AWARE OF WAS THE ABANDONMENT     OF THE GAME.

 I THOUGHT THE POLICE DID AS MUCH AS THEY COULD DO ALSO.

 ONLY CRITICISM REALLY WAS THE LACK OF ORDER AT THE TURNSTILES AND INSIDE THE

 TURNSTILES AND GROUND.

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1. ONLY THE ORGANISATION OUTSIDE THE GROUND AND THE LACK OF SIGNS/DIRECTIONS
                                                                           PAGE    9

 AND ORGANISATION INSIDE,   I ’VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND ITS EVERYONES FAULT REALLY

 FANS INTENT TO GET IN, LACK OF ORDER, VENUE, TICKET ALLOCATION EVERYTHING.

 IT IS MY HOPE THAT THIS TRAGIC INCIDENT WILL PUT THINGS RIGHT FOR THE FUTURE

 AND THAT IT WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN.    I FEEL THAT THE GATE THAT WAS OPENED TO

 ALLOW FANS IN FROM OUTSIDE HAD TO BE OPENED IT WAS REALLY BAD OUTSIDE. NO-ONE

 WAS TO KNOW WHAT THE RESULT WOULD BE BUT IT MAY HAVE SAVED LIVES OUTSIDE.

 WHO WAS TO KNOW.

AFTEft THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

TOTAL DISGRACE - OBVIOUS THAT POLICE IMMEDIATELY OUTSIDE FENCE KNEW OF THE

 TRAGEDY,    NO OTHER HELP TOOK 20 MINUTES FOR FIRST AMBULANCE ARRIVE, THE 200

THE ALLOCATION OF TICKETS BY FA WAS WRONG, LIVERPOOL HAVE MUCH GREATER WEEKLY

ATTENDANCE AND SHOULD HAVE HAD OTHER END.

 1^1 POLICING ON DAY WAS TOTALLY INEFFECTIVE.

 DOES NOT BELIEVE IN FENCING FOR FANS.             THERE SHOULD BE LINE OF POLICE.

CHOICE OF GROUND WAS WRONG, ENTRANCES OFF LEPPINGS LANE FAR TOO SMALL.

ATTENDED LAST YEAR’S SEMI-FINAL AND            WENT INTO PEN AT END OF TUNNEL, WAS

 INVOLVED IN CRUSH THEN BEFORE GAME,, AND MOVED OUT INTO PEN 7 WHERE THERE WAS

PLENTY OF ROOM.

THERE WERE QUEUES OUTSIDE TURNSTILES AND MORE TURNSTILES WERE OPEN FOR USE.

 POLICE APPEARED TO Bjg INCOMPETENT/TO DEAL WITH A CROWD SITUATION.     THERE

 WERE NO STEWARDS, _NO PC!LICE INjHDE THE GROUND DIRECTING AND DISPERSING FANS

 IN THE PENS.   I WAS THEF      FEBRUARY THIS YEAR AT LEAGUE GAME AND THERE WERE

 TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THE CENTRAL PENS.    PEOPLE WERE BEING PULLED UP THEN AS WELL

 s i ^ L I A R GROUNDS TO SHEFFIELD WEDS ARE MANCHESTER UNITED AND ASTON VILLA

 WHERE THE PENS ARE THE SAME BUT THERE ARE ALLEYWAYS AT THE BACK OF THE PENS

ALLOWING ACCESS ALONG THE BACK OF THE PENS.      AS SOON AS THE PEN IS FULL,

 THE PEOPLE ARE DIRECTED ALONG TO THE NEXT PEN.     AT SHEFFIELD THIS ACCESS

 IS NOT AVAILABLE AND I FEEL THE FENCING AT THE SIDE OF THE PENS ARE

 UNNECESSARY NOT ALLOWING LATERAL MOVEMENT.

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 AS I LEFT THE GROUND THERE WERE FIRE ENGINES AND AMBULANCES BLOCKING THE EXIT

GATES, I D O N ’T THINK IT WAS INTENTIONAL, BUT IT APPEARED THERE WASN’T

 SUFFICIENT PARKING FOR THE EMERGENCY VEHICLES.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE MOTORWAY POLICE SHOULD HAVE TOLD THE GROUND AND THE COACH COMPANIES ABOUT

THE DELAYS THEN THE POLICE AT THE GROUND WOULD HAVE KNOWN LIVERPOOL FANS WERE

GOING TO BE LATE.    I BELIEVE THAT DESPITE THE COMPLICATIONS LIVERPOOL SHOULD

HAVE HAD THE OTHER END OF THE GROUND.      IT APPEARED THERE WERE TOO MANY POLICE

 IN THE SURROUNDING AREAS OF THE GROUND AND NOT ENOUGH IMMEDIATELY AROUND THE

^&UND.     LAST YEAR I WAS ASKED TWICE FOR MY/TICKET BEFORE I GOT TO THE

 TURNSTILES, THIS YEAR I WASN’T ASKED AT A L L . T H E R E JUST WASN’T ENOUGH POLICE

 TO ORGANISE THE QUEUES AT THE TURNSTILES.     ONCE INSIDE THE GROUND AFTER THE

 DISASTER THERE WASN’T ENOUGH FIRST AID AVAILABLE OR SUFFICIENT POINTS OF ENTRY

 FOR THE AMBULANCES.    THE POLICE DIDN’T APPEAR TO DO ENOUGH PERHAPS BECAUSE

 THEY HADN’T BEEN TOLD, THERE WAS A LINE ACROSS THE PITCH PROBABLY FOR CROWD

CONTROL, THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER HELPING TO GET PEOPLE OUT.        WHEN THE

 EMERGENCY SERVICES DID ARRIVE THEY WERE GOOD, BUT IT APPEARED THAT THEY DIDN’T

WERE TOO SLOW TO REACT, AS IF THEY WERE WAITING FOR ORDERS.        IT WOULD APPEAR

 SENSIBLE TO ME THAT IF THERE HAS TO BE FENCES, CUTTING GEAR SHOULD HAVE BEEN
                                                                        PAGE     8
                                                                        Q SL1743

 CLOSE AT HAND TO CUT THE FENCES DOWN, AND ALSO THE GATES AT THE FRONT JUST

 WEREN’T BIG ENOUGH FOR A MASS EXIT.

 FINALLY I WOULD SAY THAT THE GROUND LOCATION WAS JUST NOT DESIGNED TO COPE

 WITH SUCH LARGE ATTENDANCES.

 3.    THE STEWARDS WERE JUST MILLING ABOUT WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING.

 THERE WERE DIFFERENT THINGS GOING ON WHERE WAS THE POLICE EMERGENCY

 PLAN DID THEY HAVE ONE?

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1.    THE SIDE FENCES SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN THERE FOR AN ALL TICKET AWAY

 END WE DID NOT NEED SEGREGATING ALTHOUGH I KNOW WHY THEY ARE THERE.

®      BETTER DIRECTIONS WHEN INSIDE THE GROUND BETTER IF GIVEN BY STEWARDS.

 3.    WE ARE A NATION OF QUEUERS WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN PUT INTO QUEUES OUTSIDE

 THE GROUND.

 4.    BETTER LOUDSPEAKER SYSTEMS.

 5.    THE GAME SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED BECAUSE WHEN THE PLAYERS CAME OUT THERE

 WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOUD CHEER AND PEOPLE OUTSIDE WOULD HAVE HEARD THIS AND

 WOULD HAVE WANTED TO GET IN KNOWING THE TEAMS WERE ON THE    PITCH.

 THE SIDE FENCES CAUSED THE DEATHS.       I ENTERED THE TERRACES AND EXPECTED TO 8E

 SIDEWARDS AND NOT FORWARDS.

 PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE PENS AND ON THE PITCH WERE ASKING THE POLICE FOR HELP

 AND THEY WEREN'T GIVEN ANY HELP.

 THE FITTEST OF THE FANS SHOULD HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THE PITCH AND THIS

 WOULD HAVE GIVEN BETTER ACCESS FOR EMERGENCY SERVICES.

 AN ANNOUNCEMENT INFORMING THE PEOPLE NOT INVOLVED SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN

 THERE SEEMED TO BE CONFUSION AMONG THE P^LlJCE AS TO WHAT TO DO.    IN THAT THEY

 CORDONED OFF THE PITCH WHILE FANS WERE RACING AROUND WITH STRETCHERS AND

 BODIES.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1 WOULD LIKE TO STRESS THAT I WAS LATE BECAUSE OF TRAFFIC DELAYS AND IT TOOK

 2 3/4 <THREE-QUARTERS) HOURS FOR A 48 MILE JOURNEY.    IN MY OPINION THE POLICE

 SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORESEE TRAFFIC PROBLEMS AND BE ABLE TO DISPERSE OF

 T^p3E PROBLEMS WELL BEFORE 1000’S OF PEOPLE ARRIVED.

 ONCE THE DISASTER HAD OCCURRED, THE POLICE WEREN’T ABLE TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP.

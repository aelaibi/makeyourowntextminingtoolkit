        Dear Sir,
                  ! refer to your letter of 12* August which has left me somewhat perplexed. Y our
   p r o le s relating to disclosure are ambiguous to soy the least. In the past your officers have
   ^Pelaased information to me without requiring the written authority of the family concerned. To
        insist upon the same at this particular time can only be regarded as a tactic to obstruct and
        impede the families who are trying to comply with the deadline set by Lord Justice Stuart-
        Srmth. It also heightens their anxiety and MnpHniw

        la relation to the written authority of the statement authors, I note that you have enclosed
        statements of, for example, Ambulance                      and Dr Bull on the basis that they hive
        been in the pubic arena previously at the Coroners Inquest and therefore you did not require
        any authority for their release. I have to tell you that neither o f these two people ( and Indeed
        most o f the others listed m your letter ) were called to give evidence at the inquest. Can you
        ttravfbre explain your inconsistent approach in such matters.

       Finally I would remind you that your Chief Constable has gone on public record stating that he
       would eo-operate fully with the Independent Scrutiny. I would urge you to put Richard Wells
       pledge into practice. As an infliction o f my concern and that o f th» HiUeburough Fttnulieu 1 am
       copying this letter to Loud Justice Sftuul-Smith

       Yours Faithfully

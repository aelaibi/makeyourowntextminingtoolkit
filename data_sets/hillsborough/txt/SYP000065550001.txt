        At about          1310 we had                 call, eel in green at Bads ley Moor where we

        had just          t r a n s f e r r e d a patient               from     casualty at R o t h e r h a m

        District          General                Hospital.        We were        l^Jld to go to the W e d n e s d a y

        did so.           I think                there was       one a m b u l a n c e         outside        the     ground and

        two    in the yard.                       When    one    of the a m b u l a n c e s            from the yard              drove

By    this    time     we heard an               in s t r u c t i o n    over    the    radio    to take all

patients        to the Royal                H a l lamshi re Hospital              and we,       therefore,

further       ambulances                subsequently         joined us.            We    probably waited

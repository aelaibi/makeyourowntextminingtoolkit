Dear Dr Muir,

Plan/Layout o f Bodies

I have been informed by Mr J Mervyn JONES, Deputy Chief Constable of the Cheshire
Constabulary who is leading the Hillsborough Inquiry Team, that he is due to meet
you at Cranfield at 10.30 am on Friday 9th November 1990. Mr Jones will be
accompanied by Detective Inspector Caroline PERKINS, a member of the Inquiry Team.

In order that you may have some prior knowledge of the Inquiry, I forward for your
information two draft composite plans of the Leppings Lane terraces at the front of
the West Stand, Hillsborough Football Ground, Sheffield. The plans show the
entrance tunnel under the West Stand leading into Enclosures 3 and 4 where the
majority of the deceased died from the result of the crushing. The plans have been
prepared as follows

1.   Each coloured circle represents a deceased person with an individual body
      number.

2.   The red coloured location was the last time seen alive and the blue
      coloured location the first where believed dead. These positions have been
      established from video recordings, photographs and witnesses evidence and
      positions marked on plans.

3.   The dotted line with number 57 to the right indicates where the two sections
      of barrier collapsed.

I hope that these plans may be of some use to you in your research and I am sure Mr
JONES will fully explain them and give you any further information necessary at your
meeting.


Yours faithfully,



                                    |\J 11 <*^6

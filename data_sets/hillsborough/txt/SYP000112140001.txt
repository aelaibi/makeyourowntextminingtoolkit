                 My   rostered         duty was 3 pm x 10 pm afternoons.

                 I was    deployed         to    cover    the Herr i e s Roa d         to Firth Park are a and to

                 as s i s t wit h N o t t i n g h a m Forest S u p p o r t e r s       coaches from the M.1                Tins l e y

                 i n t e r se ct io n to H er r i e s     R o a d / M u s h r o o m Lane    junction.

                Whilst      e s corting         the   coaches     several       of them tried to set down

                 p assen gers      as     they were       passing Public Houses.                  The D e v o n s h i r e Arms

                P.H.     on Herr i e s      Road was       full     of N o t t i n g h a m Forest       supporters.            For

                 the most      part they were             orderly.

                                                was   in charge      of Dog H a n d l e r s      duties.

                 I was    involved         in the      escorts      until     appro;-;. 2.45        pm.      At    this    time

                 there was       very      little      vehicular       traffic       on Herries         Road.

                PC W i l k i n s o n    then made        our way to N i a g a r a as direc t e d on our                   orders.

                T ra f f i c was       heard over        the   radio     r equesting         that a gate          be opened at

                 the L e p p i ng s Lane as           it was    feared there          could foe c a sualties              because

                of the      crushing.            R e q u e s t s were made     over        the air asking whet h e r            or

           not the- start           of the m at c h        could be ‘delayed.              The     reply was    "No the

          .tfams are          out   on the      field wait i n g         to start."

           S h o r t l y after 3 pm         Inspector Phe n i x           came      into   the     club house and

           i n s t r uc te d all. Dog H an d l e r s        to a t t e n d the ground.

           Once* outside Niasgara a/nd_; o n P e n i s t o n e R o a d                there was       v ery heavy

           traffic        Leppings        Lane was        blocked w i t h         pedestrians.

           Inspector Phenix               i ns t r u c t e d PC W i l k i n s o n and myself         to stay at the

           r o undabout at          the    e nd of L a p pings         L a n e.

           T h o u s a nd s   of s u p p o rt er s   began     coming along L e p pings Lane making there

           w a y back         to the    coaches      and PBV's         for    the R a i l w a y Station.

           Severa l       people       spoke    to me asking           for the nearest             public   t elephones

           were     or where        there      buses were,       most a p p e a r e d       to be    in a state       of

           shock.

           I rapidly got a feeling                   of    inade q u a c y as       though the trag e d y was

           somehow my fault a n d               I could not           do a n y t h i n g   about    it.     I found      it ,

           most     d i s tr es si ng     seeing m a n y h u n dreds          of    people    in a state . o f      shock.

           One     person c o l l a p se d at the           roundabout.             I s u m moned an a m b u l a n c e     via

           my    personal        radio.        The rnan kept          corning      round and then         passing

           out again.           I. later     c a n celled the a m b u l a n c e       as a Police         Personnel

           C a rr i e r   carrying        the walking w o u n d e d was             stopped the man was           put      in

           the     carrier and          taken to the N o r t h e r n General.                 His    friends    returned

           to their           vehicle     and a t te nd ed at the Hospital,

           A    lot of suppo r t e r s         had ob v i o u s l y    been drinking          but    I w o u l d say that

           most     people were           shoc k e d at the       e n o r m i t y of the tragedy.

           I have wo r k e d several              major     games at S.W.F.C.               ground.

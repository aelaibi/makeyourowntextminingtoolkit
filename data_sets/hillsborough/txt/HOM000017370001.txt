        Dear Mr. Whalley,

                                     Hillsborough Disaster Inquiry

        Further to the letter received from the Football League dated
        26 April, we will be making written submissions in relation to
        this.

        Because of our unique system, however, you may feel it necessary
        to visit the Club?   If so, please let me know and I will put the
        necessary arrangements in hand.

        Jours sincerely,

          ,/

        J. R. Smith,
        MANAGING DIRECTOR

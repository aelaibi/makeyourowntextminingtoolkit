RE. INCIDENT AT HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL STADIUM
                                                                 \ '2.10

On Saturday, 15th April, 1989 my colleague                        and I were approaching
B.D.G.H., Casualty Department when we heard on the radio that a Barnsley mobile was
also en-route B.D.G.H. casualty to pick up a team of doctors.


Unaware of what had happened we contacted control while we were at B.D.G.H. casualty
and asked if we could be of assistance, and control asked if there was a medical team
waiting to go.       There was not, but shortly afterwards the Barnsley mobile arrived;
he wag single manned and told us he had come to take a medical team to Hillsborough.
I went into casualty and found a team had been formed.                , myself and the driver
of the Barnsley mobile,                     loaded the equipment and the medical team onto the
Barnsley mobile and control then instructed us to escort the Barnsley mobile to
Hillsborough on 'red'.         En-route Hillsborough we were told to report to the medical
centre at the ground and on arrival asked where the medical centre was - the police
directed us.


At no time were we informed of what had occurred during the journey from B.D.G.H. to
Hillsborough and on arrival we joined the end of the line of S.Y.M.A.S. crews who had
lined their vehicles up in single file.          We were the last two vehicles in line and
had to carry the team's heavy equipment all the way to the front of the queue where
we were met by a S.Y.M.A.S. Officer.          When I told him the medical team from B.D.G.H.,
was with us he told us to go to the gym inside the ground and report to the S.Y.M.A.S.
Officer there.         On-doing this he said the team was not required and that we should
take them back to the Barnsley vehicle and collect body bags off all S.Y.M.A.S.,
vehicles waiting outside and when this was done asked me to get some blankets and
place two beside each of the deceased.          Having done this he told me to return to my
colleague who was with our vehicle but when I got there he had been teamed up with
another member of the service so I continued to help other members of S.Y.M.A.S. with
the incident until it had calmed down.


At about 5.30p.m. all S.Y.M.A.S. personnel and vehicles congregated at the rear of
the gym, and an officer told crews on 1400/1600 hours to return to normal duties and
those on 1000/1800 hours to return to their stations, also S.Y.M.A.S. personnel who
had volunteered to attend the incident to continue and assist control if they wished,
and as far as I am aware additional personnel were to be picked to help return the
remainder to their stations.


We returned from the incident at approximately 1805 hours.

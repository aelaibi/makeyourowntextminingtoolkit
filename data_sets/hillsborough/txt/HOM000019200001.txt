(c)   Real Membership/Real Responsibility



      On two separate occasions during the passage of the Football

      Spectator's Bill through Parliament, an Amendment proposed by

      the FSA to "enfranchise" members of the proposed scheme has

      been rejected by the Government.     Both in the Lords and the

      Commons, the idea of meaningful membership for supporters -

      with the usual rights and responsibilities that come with such

      status - has proved unacceptable.



      In the Committee-stage of the House of Lords considerations,

      the following Amendment was debated and put to the vote:



      Rights of Members of the National Football Membership scheme



      The rights of a member of the scheme for the purposes of

      Section 5(2) of this Act are the following



      (a)   The right to participate in the election of

      representatives to a body which may be established by the

      administrator for the purpose of advising him on the

      management of the scheme;



      (b)   The right to participate in the election of a

      committee to monitor the operation of the scheme at any one

      premise, licensed under this Act, of his choice;
                           - 19 -



(c)    The right   to call a meeting of the members   of the

scheme;



(d)    The right   to be notified in writing of the reasons for

any proposed withdrawal of membership;



(e)    The right   to present a defence before any decision

regarding withdrawal of membership is made;



(f)    The right   of appeal against any withdrawal of

membership and the right to be represented at such an appeal.



Lord Hesketh for the Government did concede that the Amendment

was "a reasonable request" but felt that it "must be taken on

board by the Football Membership Authority" (FMA).       Such a

reply neatly evades the request and leaves the proper

representation of football supporters in the hands principally

of the F.A. and the Football League who will probably make up

a majority of the FMA.    Neither of these former bodies have

offered any real representation to supporters during the last

century of professional football.



In the committee-stage of the Commons debate, a more simple

Amendment was proposed.
                             - 20 -



Rights of Members of the National Football Membership Scheme



(1)       For   the purpose of the Section 5 (2) of this Act,

members     of the NationalFootball Membership Scheme shall have

a right     to participate in the election of representatives of a

body to     be established by the Football Membership Authority to

advise it on the scheme.



(2)       Members of the National Football Membership Scheme

within a particular club shall also have the right to elect a

Committee of Liaison for that Club to consider the operation

of the Scheme within the Club.



This too was rejected although, under pressure from members of

both sides of the Committee, Colin Moynihan did promise to

return at the report stage with some suggestions about

supporter-representation on the FMA.



Given the track-record of both the F.A. and League

administrators, real representation for football supporters is

unlikely to occur in either of those bodies.        Earlier this

year Jack Dunnett (then President of the League) informed the

FSA's National Conference that supporter-representation at

Club level will never happen.         (He repeated this assertion on

a recent "Panorama" programme).        The F.A. currently includes

no supporter representatives on its ruling Council and has no
                           - 21 -



intention of including any.   Consequently, only the Government

is in a position to break the stalemate via legislation.     Yet

the Government, it seems, can recognise no advantage in

building in effective supporter-representation to its Bill.

This is curious given the Government's realisation that its

Bill is highly unpopular with football fans.     Why not take the

opportunity to head off some of the criticism of the Bill by

including major representational advantages for those subject

to it?   Such a course would inevitably defuse some of the

FSA's objections to the Membership Scheme by fulfilling the

first aim in the FSA's Constitution.



How Can Supporters Help Defeat Hooliganism?



Supporter-representation is not, of itself, an

"anti-hooligan measure".   It is a legitimate aspiration

whether hooliganism exists or not, justified by the crucial

roles supporters play as consumers, part-producers and

front-line salespeople for the game.   Representation is

further justified by the powerful bond of affection and

identification which welds fans to their teams.    This bond is

so strong that, for most of the last century, football has

been able to rely on huge, regular attendances, regardless of

the poor conditions and amenities offered at most venues.

Supporters have demonstrated a "brand loyalty" which every
                             - 22 -



other business roust envy.     Instead of being cossetted and

consulted in reward, they have been ignored and reduced to

"turnstile fodder" in the eyes of many of those who run the

game and most of those who attend it.



This attitude towards the primary 'sponsors' of football may

not have directly produced modern-day hooliganism but it has

undoubtedly conditioned and drastically reduced the numbers of

active supporters.     The crowd has come to expect the worst -

both in terms of its own treatment and of the behaviour of

some if its members.     Yet people were deserting their football

grounds by the millions, long before any hooliganism occurred.

Why?   It may have been the combination of increased leisure

options for the games' traditional customers, coupled with

their complete exasperation with football's failure to treat

them decently.



That exodus from the game of millions of regular supporters

throughout the 1950's was a prelude to the rise of modern

hooliganism.     It may be that, prior to the 1960's, football

crowds were for the most part, kept well-disciplined and

reasonable by the presence of large numbers of "ordinary"

non-volatile fans.     The FSA is convinced that, even   if the

practical problems of implementing the I.D. card scheme were

overcome (an increasingly unlikely prospect), the overall

effect would be seriously to reduce attendances amongst the

very type of supporter who can, if motivated, exert a
                          - 23 -



disciplinary pressure on the whole group.   There are already

clear indications both from national polls and polls of our

own members (see Appendix 17) that anything from 10% to 40%

of existing   supporters will simply refuse to enter the

scheme.   Personal statements by supporters at public meetings

show that many of the potential "refuseniks" are older, more

mature men and women who feel deeply insulted by the

Government's proposals.   These are the very fans football can

least afford to lose.



The extent to which good-hearted supporters can be motivated

to do more to defeat hooliganism is difficult to gauge.      What

does seem clear is that the current self-image of supporters

generally is now of very low esteem.   They feel oppressively

defined by the tabloid press archetype of someone almost

sub-human and vicious by nature.   The FSA has undoubtedly

succeeded, for the first time, in publicly representing fans

as reasonable and well-informed people - and the vigorous

displays of gratitude some supporters show to FSA National

Officers (to their embarrassment!) clearly indicates the deep

feelings many fans have of being constantly misrepresented.



"Supporter Friendly” Membership



Positive membership for football fans would seem an ideal

vehicle to accelerate the process of improving the self-image
                           - 24 -



of supporters.   Though not in itself an "anti-hooligan

measure", it may produce changes in the atmosphere, nature and

composition of the football crowd that will contribute

directly towards marginalising the hooligans.



Supporter-friendly membership would have to operate in large

measure at club-level. though this would not rule out the

development of a national data base for use in facilitating

travel abroad.   The essence of any "friendly scheme" would be

that it conveys real advantages to members and is entirely

voluntary.



Such a scheme might include:



(a)    Entry at minimal cost (possibly free to children and

       0.A.P.'s) to the scheme.



(b)   The right to elect a committee to administer

       members' affairs.



(c)   The right to elect a member to represent the   supporters

       at board level of clubs.



(d)   Access to a members-only enclosure with improved

       facilities (though clubs must not simply run down

       non-members' areas to show "improvement"!)
(e)    Self-stewarding of members' areas.



(f)   Priority for ticket allocations etc.



(g)   Discounts on away travel, exemptions from   special

       fixture price increases etc.



(h)   Discounts at retail outlets and club merchandisers.



(i)   The possibility of accompanying guests.



(j)   Social activities and the development of links with    the

       club outside of match-days.



(k)   Free entry to reserve team matches.



(1)   A regular Newsletter (i.e. twice a season).



(m)   Involvement in local "Football and the Community"

       projects.



Such a scheme should be a joint venture by both clubs and

supporters.   It should clearly outline the privileges and

responsibilities of both parties (including perhaps a "code of

conduct" applicable to each party).   Loss of membership as a

result of misbehaviour would be an important deterrent,
                          - 26 -



particularly if access to all-ticket matches, cheap away

travel and international matches were subsequently denied.      If

clubs adopted mutually compatible schemes, "guest"

relationships could be developed.



Members might vote for club and national "Player of the Year"

awards, organise drives to attract more women and ethnic

minority groups to football, liaise directly with local police

forces and   monitor their Club's overall relationship to its

wider community.   In short, positive membership would

encourage the development of a new role-model for fans - one

of a responsible, committed and empowered spectator.
FOOTBALL7S ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE



The operation of a supporter-friendly membership scheme would

require an effective policing mechanism to ensure its

implementation. The lack of willingness by clubs in the past

to use, for example, the League's own "Fifty Per Cent

Membership Scheme" as a route to positive membership, leaves

no doubt that an "enforcing" sanction will be required.     It

cannot be left to the League's Management Committee - past

history shows that it simply cannot deliver the individual

clubs' compliance.    One method might be to introduce

additional regulations into the F.A.'s Rules; a "code of

membership requirements" to which League clubs must adhere.

Just as, currently, a club may be "charged" with failing to

make proper provision for segregation of fans etc, under such

a 'membership requirement' a Club would be "charged" with

failing to deliver real membership to its supporters according

to agreed criteria.



In reality, it may require Government legislation to establish

a proper, supporter-friendly scheme, with an independent body

(an F.M.A.?) to oversee and police it.   This is one of the

areas where Government can really help football because the

administrative structure of the game precludes effective

action and real change.
In conjunction with the development of a friendly scheme, a

major publicity drive would be required to inform both current

and ex-supporters of the changes.     This should include a call

on fans to "get onside" in a campaign to defeat racism and

hooliganism at football matches; encouraging fans to identify

offenders, shout down abusive chants and encourage younger

supporters to become "real fans".     The professional players

and managers, plus famous faces from the past, could feature

strongly in such a publicity drive.     (The younger fans in

particular may be highly impressionable when faced with their

"heroes").   Representatives of the supporters7 organisation

too could add considerable 'terrace credibility7 to any

campaign.



None of this will instantly drive the violent hooligan away

from football but it will begin the essential process of

isolating him from the rest of the crowd. The crowd needs more

to defend in football than it currently has; fans need to feel

its their game to protect.   "Dealing with the hooligans"

should not involve punishing precisely the group who can most

help in that aim.   If the League Management and the F.A. in

tandem cannot provide rewards for the 'good7 they will not

defeat the 'bad7.   If football's administrative structure

stymies progress, the government should intervene to ensure

success.
REPRESENTATION FOR FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS



Football fans want (possibly more than anyone else) to see the

back of the vicious, racist and mean-spirited element drawn to

our "beautiful game".     The exclusion of such people is a

proper objective - but it will not be achieved by the I.D.

Card plan.     Rather, that plan threatens to alienate and reduce

even further the counter-balancing forces in the crowd.       There

is a simple and effective means of keeping undesirable

spectators out of football matches.     But first they must be

caught (carrying I.D. Cards or no!) and subjected to

restrictions which guarantee their non-attendance.     The I.D.

Card Scheme, while putting off the mature, largely

well-behaved fans, will merely challenge the real hooligans to

defeat it. It is a static impediment, relying on unpredictable

technology and involving a huge monetary down payment,

followed by expensive running costs.     If the hooligans can be

caught and convicted, the government should target its concern

at them. It is almost impossible to 'challenge7 a requirement

to present oneself in person at a designated venue on match

days/evenings. Exclusion orders and attendance-centre

provision will cost money and require a determined effort in

terms of policing, but compared to the kind of costs the

Government's proposals involve, its a lower price for a more

effective measure.    Fans may also be able to contribute     a

service.     It might be of particular benefit, for example, to
                           - 30 -



explore "softer options" with younger fans whose behaviour is

not yet beyond the pale by requiring them to attend matches in

the company of more responsible supporters who are members of

a "friendly" scheme.



If an effective 'law and order' strategy were combined with a

serious attempt to raise the status and responsibility of

supporters, the problem of crowd misbehaviour might prove less

intractable.    Control-strategies alone have been used on an

escalating scale for the last two decades.    While proper

segregation of fans and (principally) the installation of CCTV

have undoubtedly made a contribution, little has really

changed.    For many supporters the Hillsborough tragedy

illustrated a myopic 'control-strategy' gone mad.



The time must now be right to, at the very least, include a

new approach to run alongside the traditional one.    To

positively motivate supporters, their representation at club

and national levels is essential.   All the research data on

supporters' views point up the keenness of fans to get

involved.   It is particularly instructive to note in the Sir

Norman Chester Centre Questionnaire results (a full analysis

of which is being sent to the Inquiry direct from Leicester

University) that, though over 90% of supporters completely

oppose the Government's ideas of "membership" (i.e. being
                            - 31 -



constrained to hold I.D. Cards) over one third of them are

prepared to look positively on the despised National

Membership Scheme if it includes the prospect of

representation and consultation.



The accurate representation of football supporters is not only

desirable but also possible.     The most striking feature of the

"Priority Search" survey.    (Appendix 18) is the

"extraordinary degree of unanimity" evidenced amongst

supporters.   Admittedly, this poll was conducted in a mostly

self-selected group (FSA delegates and visitors to our

National Conference), however the pollsters still express

surprise that "no matter what category of people we examine,

their perception as to priority solutions for improving

football for the supporters was virtually identical".



The general unanimity amongst fans evidenced in the poll is

borne out by the experience of the FSA throughout four years

of campaigning and organising with supporters.      The football

crowd includes a very broad spectrum of people; a group of

citizens who, outside of a football context, would show a wide

range of differing views about almost anything yet, within the

football context, they are almost as one.



Football in Britain is of substantial importance in the lives

of many people.   It attracts a special interest because it

exudes a special magic.     But for the nation as a whole, the
                          - 32 -



game can be either a crippling liability or a treasured asset.

Consequently, every effort is justified to swing the best that

football gives its devotees to counterweight the worst it

produces.   As the Priority Search analysis insists; "There is

undoubtedly a high level of preparedness amongst supporters to

take responsibility for sorting out football's problems".   Top

of the priority list for all fans is the clear expression of a

desire for inclusion, involvement and representation

throughout the game.

       12.        In the    event of a national membership/ID card      scheme being
                  introduced for football it is important to have some information
                  about what supporters want out of the new arrangements.      Listed
                  below are a number of possible   incentives   for joining    such a
                  scheme.    (We are assuming the biggest incentive will be wanting
                   :o get into  grounds,  so we have not included that here!)      We
                   /ant you to rank your five main   priorities   1 -5  in order   of
                  preference.   So,  if you feel that 'better refreshments' is the
                  most important thing that membership    could provide     for fans,
                  write a figure 1 in that box.   If you think that 'social events'
                  is the next most important, rank that   2 , and    so on up to 5 .
                  Space   has also been left if you want to include     in your top
                  five ranking something which is not on our list:

 Survey in to th e view s o f members o f th e Football Supporters' A ssociation w h o a tte n d e d
 th e ir a n n u a l conference, 2 4 June 1 9 8 9 . Sum m ary analysis o f th e prioritised responses
                                            to th e question:



   W H A T NEEDS TO HAPPEN T O IM PR O VE FOOTBALL FOR TH E
                        SUPPORTERS?
The most striking aspect of this survey is the extraordinary degree of unanimity. The FSA conference
could be regarded as a fairly homogeneous group. Nevertheless a very wide cross section of society
was represented (see Appendix 1): people of different and no earned income; home supporters and
away fans; people who watch the game with friends, with children or on their own; people who sit as
well as those who stand; different age groups; members of supporters clubs and season ticket holders;
and men and women. No matter what category of people we examine, their perception as to the
priority solutions for improving football for the supporters is virtually identical.

The first diagram below shows all the thirty items used in the questionnaire prioritised in order, 1 to 30,




                                                                                                    RANK

The following is a broad brush description of the general themes that emerge from these
results - how they hang together into a consensus outlook on the way forward for football.
Without apology, this report is a subjective account of the views of football supporters.
 It is not intended to be impartial. It does not take into account the views of the
club's management, the police, the players or the stewards. Such an overall view would
only be possible if similar surveys were conducted with these groups. In such an eventuality
an overall picture could be painted taking into account the subjective views of all parties.
The absence of such data does not, however, invalidate this search. The viewpoint of the
customer matters in its own right and deserved to be listened to without qualification.


 1.   R esponsibility

       There is undoubtedly a high level of preparedness amongst
       supporters to take responsibility for sorting out the problems of football.
       Football supporters' are more than just customers. They
       follow the game with a passion often incomprehensible
       to those on the outside. Football is an important part of many people's
       lives with deep roots in English culture. Consequently there is
       no lack of commitment to the game; no shortage of volunteers.

      Specifically supporters have demonstrated in this survey:

             a preparedness to shoulder some of the responsibility
             for the behaviour of others, which demonstrates a high level of
             positive collective identification with their fellow supporters;

             a preparedness to give up their own time, energy and
             intelligence to working with each other to finding solutions;

             a commitment to basic moral principals of fairness and
             accountability.

      In other words there is a recognition that while supporters have their
      problems of bad behaviour when they get together, these could be successfully
      tackled, largely by or with the participation and guidance of democratically
      accountable supporters in the game. The same basic principles of fairness
      that lie behind the rules of conduct of those on the pitch, should be used to
      steward the conduct of those off it.


2.     Respect

      Supporters expect to be treated better. Throughout the country there is a
      growing realisation that the customer has a right to better service and treatment.
      Their collective characteristics are there to be understood and catered for by
      the body providing the service.

      Football supporters' do pay to get in. They provide three times the amount of
      finance into the game than all the sponsorship money put together. Not only
      that but they are participative customers who give of themselves (and would do
      more if they were only asked) to improve the product in the interests and
      enjoyment of everyone.
      They pay for, and expect to be treated with more respect.

      Specifically they want:

      a)     a different relationship w ith the police. Out of all the various
            suggestions for coping with the problems of ground control, this was
            the one which highlighted the gulf in respect between the customer
            and those currently charged with their stewarding - the police. The
            gulf is too large to be bridged by statements of goodwill or policy
            declarations about impartiality. Treating rival supporters impartially
            can still result in both sets of fans being assumed collectively to be a
            problem. What the supporters want instead is a serious injection of
            police personnel training with the emphasis on serving, protecting
            and respecting the supporter as a valued, participative customer, the
            length and breadth of the country;

      b)    a different relationship w ith the clubs. Running in parallel to their
            hopes for change in their relationship with the police, supporters seek a
            more participative sort of partnership with their own clubs. Running as a
            theme throughout many of the prioritised items is the demand to be
            respected, involved and generally catered for in a respectful manner by
            those with power in the game - the clubs;

                  democratically accountable supporters should be represented at
                  every decision making level in the game and should share
                  responsibility and hence power, for managing the game;

                  the supporters 'stage' in which they play their part to the creation
                  of a football spectacle - the terracing and stands - needs to be as
                  the supporters want them to be:-

                  i)    without any fencing which is likely to impede their view
                        and movement;

                  ii)   the terracing's, where historically the core of a team's
                        passionate and melodic support emanates, should remain;

                  the general experience of being in a football ground should be
                  pleasurable; specifically clubs need to direct their investment to
                  improve the facilities throughout the ground in terms of catering,
                  refreshments, toilets and other services. Such measures by
                  themselves would reduce the unattractiveness of football grounds
                  to many women with the consequences of diluting the overtly
                  macho culture of football with all its ugly spin offs;

                  supporters' needs are important when decisions are being made
                  about investment and pricing. Their main concern is to keep the
                  game affordable to existing supporters. This may reflect fears of
                  football being priced out of their price range to suit an imagined
                  new and more affluent market.


3.   Changing th e Culture

     Supporters want to see a change in the atmosphere at football matches but they
     don't want to loose the emotion and passion of a partisan crowd at its best.
     They want to change the 'culture', but not too much!

     Specifically what needs to change is the white and male exclusiveness of football
     crowds. The proportion of black players on the pitch is in no way matched by
      black supporters in the crowd. The supporters surveyed (86% of whom were
      white men) are quite clear as to why this is: the level of racism emanating from
      a section of the white crowd which is tolerated by other supporters and club alike.
      Supporters want to see firm official action, which carries the authority of the club
      behind it, to be seen to be taken against racist supporters. Furthermore, as described
      above, supporters are prepared to play their part in tackling the problem.

      As also referrred to above, clubs need to act to improve facilities and viewing
      arrangements in the grounds in order to recruit a broader spectrum of support.
      While the game may always remain a primarily male passion, it is nevertheless a
      family passion as well. Clubs need to demonstrate, in terms of the physical condition
      of the ground, the everyone in the family is welcome and will be catered for as a matter
      of course.

      By acting against racists in the crowd and improving facilities to encourage more
      women to the game, the culture of the match will inevitably change. There is,
      however, a clear view amongst supporters that in the effort to change the crowd
      atmosphere the collective experience of the standing supporters should not be lost.

      It is obviously the strongly held belief of supporters that if we are to retain the
      spirit of the crowd, terracing must remain. The problems of safety and violence will
      only be resolved by a change in the relationship between supporters, the clubs and
      police - a partnership of mutual respect where each sees the other as indispensable
      contributors to the spectacle of the game - not by forcing everyone to sit down!

     Linked very much to the issues of retaining what is best about football crowd
     culture and encouraging clubs to developing partnerships with their supporters is
     the need to improve links with local community. Supporters see this as a practical
     way of clubs demonstrating their commitment to local people - the community which
     provides them with their (usually) life long followers. Many clubs have already seen
     the importance of such links. The message from this survey is that community links
     are not an optional extra. They should form a central commitment to the work
     programme and investment plans of every club, every year.


4.   O th e r Them es

     While not ranking quite so high as the above themes of responsibility, respect and
     culture, some further general concerns emerge.

     Supporters are looking for some of the vast sums of money around in football to
     be directed back into the game with tangible benefits to the supporters. Specifically
     they suggest new stadiums, and especially an alternative to Wembley in the North of
     England.

     Supporters also display a keen sense of fairness. They want to see a reformed
     commonsense system of democracy and discipline. Specifically they suggest attention is
     given to the standard of refereeing, the policing of away fans and the
     democratic management of the game nationally.


5.   T h e Differences E xplained

     As emphasised above the striking factor about this survey is the extraordinary high degree of
     consensus. There were however, some slight differences of emphasis which only enrich the
     overall conclusions. These differences give us a richer picture of the needs of supporters.
     At no point do they demonstrate a split of opinion. They can be summarised as follows:

           a)    women place a slightly higher emphasis on the need for improved
                 facilities in the ground, including better and cheaper catering facilities;
        b)    those under 20 years oppose membership schemes very strongly, are
              attracted by the idea of encouraging earlier arrival at grounds and want
              to see improvements to the entertaining quality of the game itself in terms
              of attacking football;

        c)    the over 40s, place considerable emphasis on the need for better and
              cheaper facilities in the ground and want to see standing areas retained.
              This links in with the view of those who attend matches with children
              (see (i) below). There seems to be a connection between the retention of
              standing areas as a means of keeping football affordable;

        d)    unwaged supporters want to see more investment in the game, namely
              the building of new stadiums and increasing the money available to
              football by bringing the pools money back into the game;

       e)    students are again another group who place extra emphasis of the need
              for better and cheaper catering facilities;

       f)    those who walk to home games, probably because they live nearby, want
              to see the clubs do more for the local community and place higher
              emphasis on tackling racism;

       g)    away supporters who travel by public transport and official transport are
              stronger in their opposition to compulsory membership schemes;

       h)    those who attend less than 50% of their teams' home match place very
              high emphasis on improved facilities to encourage more women to the
              game;

       i)    those who attend matches with children have particularly strong views on
              improved facilities both to encourage more women and to improve the
              standard of catering. They are also the group who place the greatest
              emphasis on retaining standing areas (see also (c) above).

                                        About this survey

This survey has been conducted by Sheffield City Council's Communications Unit using
a relatively new survey method called P rio rity Search

P rio rity Search is essentially a survey method which deals in finding solutions to a problem.
The first stage in the process is to turn the problem into a question - in this case;

       W h a t needs to happen to im prove fo o tb all fo r th e supporters?

A sample group of a least a dozen of the people to be surveyed are then gathered together.
Over a period of 2 - 3 hours everyone in the group is helped to contribute solutions or
 responses to the main question. Special care is taken to ensure everyone's voice gets heard.
There is no attempt to reach a consensus within the group. On the contrary, a diversity of
opinion is encouraged.

These solutions form the items to be included in the questionnaire. The questionnaire
itself is different to the usual more familiar format. It invites the person filling it in to weight
their preference for each solution when paired off with other solutions in turn. In practice,
this method is easy to follow and quick to complete. It has been used successfully with a wide
 cross-section of society.

In essence. P riority Search gives people the power to id e n tify w h a t th e ir needs really
are and to sort them out into a prioritised list of their own making as illustrated in the diagrams
 in this report.

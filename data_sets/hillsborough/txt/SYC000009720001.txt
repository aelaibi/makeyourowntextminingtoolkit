M R   FR ASER :       - but that’s the situation. As we talk at 3.30 pm that’s
                      the situation as at today.


MR METCALF:           I think that the particular problem is that for two reasons my
                      clients - and it isn’t just the MMI in this instance - don’t wish
                      to go beyond that which they are legally liable for. The two
                      reasons are firstly; we are pursuing the others, the club,
                      Eastwood City Council, and if we pay out something for
                      which we are not liable legally then we won’t get any of it
                      back. The second reason falls with that is that - without
                      giving any details of cover involved - it has been a matter of
                      comment and it is partly correct at least that if the amount to
                      be paid out goes over a certain limit it will be the rate payers
                      of South Yorkshire - whatever Treasury support they may
                      get - who will be paying out the compensation. In those
                      circumstances nobody wants to take a decision which could
                      leave them open to being surcharged at a later date for
                      having wilfully given away what turns out later to be public
                      money. So those two do present quite serious obstacles,
                      now whether there’s anything that can be done about them,
                      I’m not sure. There is indeed a meeting on Wednesday at
                      which this will be discussed again. I don’t think I can say any
                      more than that. Mr Frazer’s quite correct in saying that it’s
                      not me that takes the decisions -


CORONER:              Obviously from my point of view it would infinitely better it we
                      didn’t have -


MR METCALF:                  I can understand how awful it would be, in fact -

                                                                                         2
CORONER:              - particularly with the people that haven’t been represented
                      anyway. I mean clearly we do have many, many cases
                      where people are not represented and there’s no objection to
                      that, they’re perfectly entitled to be. So given the
                      emotiveness of this particular case and also the, if you like,
                      the limitations on it’s - you know, of this particular hearing,
                      legal representation might well be helpful and desirable both
                      for me and for the -


FEMALE SPEAKER:              (inaudible)


CORONER:              No, I don’t think we - won’t have time to do it.


                      In a sense I’m in your hands.


                      The (several inaudible words) my mind. I don’t expect half of
                      you to make a comment on this, is that assuming for a
                      moment that I were making a claim, then I would in my claim
                      the expenses which I have been put to and if that expense
                      was going - being represented at an inquest I might well
                      want to include it because you might then now have to argue
                      as to whether that was a legitimate expense. But I would
                      certainly have a go.


MR METCALF:           It’s the crux of the ...


MR FRAZER:            It’s the very crux of thing that’s the problem.


MR METCALF:           The difficulty is that comes back to this question of the civil
                      action moving on at speed and I guess in general terms, of
                      course, an inquest takes place before a civil action and it’s


www.merrillcorp.com
                                                                                        3
                      always a legitimate expense to go along and be represented
                      at the inquest because something might come out that will
                      be relevant to the civil action.


CORONER:              But in a sense we’re doing that now, you see? Because
                      we’ve brought the inquest forward -


MR METCALF:           Yes, except that we’re talking about representation here.
                      The trouble is the agreement has been made to pay out so
                      there’s no - there’s nothing else for them to gain in that
                      sense.


CORONER:              Yes, yes. I’m quite-


MR METCALF:           But - sorry.


MR FRAZER:            I don’t want to get involved in the argument which we will
                      both have on - are you coming on Wednesday?


MR METCALF:           It depends what’s happening tomorrow and whether it goes
                      over.


MR FRAZER:            Well, we’ll have this argument -


MR METCALF:           Somebody will be there.


MR FRAZER:            Our argument, obviously, is that one of the issues which you
                      are going to clarify for us is the extent of suffering before the
                      death and, therefore, we’re here to get that information and,
                      therefore, we think we should be paid. The argument is -

                                                                                      4
MR METCALF:           (overspeaking) reserve that one for Wednesday.


MR FRAZER:            - that if we’re going to get the papers in advance then we
                      don’t have to come because they - I mean it’s a - it’s one of
                      those discussions which is very difficult and however hard
                      we both try to resolve it there are problems which neither of
                      them is in fact control. But it’s certainly my wish that the
                      steering committee is here and will represent as many as
                      possible because I - I mean I will be here in any event. And
                      it’s my view that as many as possible should be done
                      because although, like you, I have no wish to do it any more
                      quickly than is necessary, if we have done the first day’s
                      worth at 8.00, then we should be able to - if we can establish
                      a pattern without it being too obvious a pattern, then it’s
                      obviously going to be easier for everybody; the officers, the
                      witnesses, you, me, everybody concerned. Obviously if we
                      can do it then we would seek to do so but at the moment -


MR JONES:             Can I just clarify here and without making any comment
                      obviously on something you wouldn’t talk about elsewhere.
                      If the decision was that it wasn’t going to be forthcoming as it
                      were, the legal costs side of things, where would that leave
                      us in terms of communication? Talking to who? To the
                      families direct? -


MR FRAZER:            Yes.


MR JONES:             - and then for them to decide as to whether they were going
                      at their own cost.

M R   FR AZER :       No. What the insurers have said is that they will pay the
                      generic costs of our - the preparation for the inquests. I
                      mean, for example, I’m here today as one of the steering
                      committee, as part of the generic costs of that steering
                      committee but the moment the inquests start then, no, we
                      would not be here.


MR JONES:             Right.


MR FRAZER:            So the preparation for it - and this is maybe a question of
                      dotting the ‘i’s’ and crossing the ‘t’s’ but the preparation
                      would be covered, I think ...


MR METCALF:           I think that is a fair interpretation of what’s been agreed.


MR FRAZER:            I mean, if you wanted information through from steering
                      committee - up to 18 April we would be in but once you
                      switch the microphone on on the 18th then we’re not here
                      because we are specifically stopped -


MR JONES:             Only legal representative there where families have chosen
                      to pay for it themselves.


MR FRAZER:            Yes. Yes, yes.


MR JONES:             It’s quite an important point, as you can appreciate as to who
                      we are going to write to and talk to in these stages -


MR FRAZER:            Yes. Yeah.




www.merrillcorp.com
                                                                                     6
C O R O N E R :       But it sounds as if - at least you would accept
                      communications.


MR FRAZER:            Oh certainly.


CORONER:              And presumably notifying your clients if at the end of the day
                      you say, “Well, you’re on your own” -


MR FRAZER:            In terms of representation yes.


CORONER:              On the 18th, you’ve got to go up there and you’ve got to do it
                      by yourself -


MR FRAZER:            Yes. Yes, I think that’s right.


MR JONES:             But it does change which is how we got here. There’s a
                      question of social services support -


CORONER:              Yes, that does change.


MR JONES:             - is that it isn’t something we could actually lay off on you -


MR FRAZER:            Well that’s - no, that’s why at that stage - I mean I wouldn’t
                      have raised the question of money had that not been an
                      obvious link for it. I mean, it’s not something which should
                      be here because it’s not your problem. But it is something in
                      terms of what we can do, our view is that we will be here - I
                      mean our present view is if funding is granted then we will
                      here in terms of an advocate and at least one legal runner
                      who knows his way around the papers and can assist your
                      officers and whatever, so that I wouldn’t have to be bothered


www.merrillcorp.com
                                                                                        7
                      about looking for files and papers and this sort of business.
                      So I don’t know how Mr Metcalf would be - I mean,
                      presumably at about the same level I would have thought.


MR METCALF:           I would have thought that we would be looking at one
                      representative here. A solicitor or even a clerk after the thing
                      has got going.


CORONER:              If I can just say something about that. Assume - let’s
                      assume that the financial side gets sorted out, you know, I’m
                      not saying that you won’t be here. If we’re going to do eight
                      a day I reckon we’ll have to move at a fairly brisk pace.
                      What I have in mind is to warn, you know, the family to come
                      at ‘x ’ - that particular time, deal with the case, take them out
                      of court, bring the next family in. Now that will mean that if
                      you want to see the family who we’ve just dealt with then
                      you’ve got to have somebody here to see them because
                      we’ll be starting the next inquest almost immediately.


MR FRAZER:            Or more importantly, they may want to see me. That’s the
                      problem. But I would have somebody from my office here or
                      there would be somebody from the committee here to deal
                      with the legal forms and take problems and either deal with
                      them then or say, Well, you know, Mr Frazer will be available
                      at such and such an hotel(?) this evening” or whatever the
                      logistics of it will be.


                      That’s - I mean, as we talk that’s what occurs to me. It’s
                      much the same as we operated for the public inquiry. It’s the
                      same sort of system basically only it wouldn’t be - obviously
                      it wouldn’t be such high profile as it was then.


www.merrillcorp.com
CORONER:              Now, I think we’ve got quite a bit of it -


MR FRAZER:            So who would you intend - who do you anticipate will be
                      before you?


CORONER:              Well, that’s a very good question. I intend to - I’ve drafted
                      letter which in fact if we - and it’ll sound as if we’re going -
                      you know, as you’re content with what we’re proposing which
                      I intend to send out to all the solicitors of whom I am aware.
                      In other words, not just the steering committee but every
                      single firm plus - and any solicitors who - from the record
                      with me, so to speak, like, for example, yourselves. There
                      are quite a lot of firms who were represented at the inquiry
                      who have not contacted me at all, but I intend to tell them
                      about the pre-inquest review so that they can come if they
                      wish. I suspect that not everybody will come and I suspect
                      that when it comes down to it we will - you know, at inquest
                      it will be yourself and possibly you. I don’t think that very
                      many other firms or companies will want to be here but I
                      can’t say at this stage.


MR FRAZER:            Yeah, some people may have a watching brief at -


MR METCALF:           I thought the club might -


MR FRAZER:            I think the club will have somebody have here.


MR METCALF:           I think the council might turn out as one who was criticised
                      and, of course, there’s that slightly political element of - with
                      a small ‘p’ - involved.

                                                                                          9
MR FRAZER:            I think to some extent the publicity that comes from your
                      office about what the inquest is for may reduce the numbers.
                      If it is known that it is non-liability, non-adversarial -


CORONER:              It’ll be - I think they’ll be here on the first two or three days to
                      see what it’s like and then they may decide there’s not much
                      to be gained.


MR JONES:             Can I just add there to remind you Dr Popper, that there will
                      be transcripts as well which is quite an important point.


CORONER:              Yes. I suppose if there’s - as you know we’re wired for
                      sound in this place and we usually transcribe from tapes but
                      at the moment I think that even if we have it here I will get
                      preferably the same firm that we used at the inquiry. To do -
                      shorthand (inaudible). W e’ll probably record as well as a
                      failsafe but we won’t rely on the tapes (inaudible) transcripts.
                      Anybody who wants copies of the transcripts we will have
                      them at the usual rate whatever that might be, if it’s changed
                      I don’t know what it is. But subject to it being possible I will
                      try and get each individual inquest bound separately so that
                      there will be one record days proceedings but we (inaudible)
                      eight... So if, for instance, you only wanted three of those
                      particular proceedings, you’d say “could you send me the
                      transcript of the proceedings in case A, B and C”. If you
                      wanted them all then obviously it’s a matter, you know, for
                      you, if you didn’t want any then that’s (inaudible). And I think
                      it’s why particularly that we may have to (inaudible) this
                      inquest. You know, if the DPP doesn’t pursue we must have
                      a good transcript -

                                                                                         10
MR METCALF:           It will reduce the need to go through the evidence again to a
                      great extent -


CORONER:              That’s right. You could use that or you can summarise it
                      possibly (inaudible). If we get the same jury back out - no,
                      I’ll have to think about it, you know, on how we’re going to do
                      it but it’s that’s in the future.


MR FRAZER:            So it’s a question of whether everybody will be attending.
                      The existence of the transcripts may be -


CORONER:              (overspeaking)


MR METCALF:           I’ll have to think about it but I can’t at the moment think of
                      circumstances in which we would have questions to ask.
                      And if we don’t have questions to ask then the likelihood is
                      we would want a low level representation and a transcript in
                      case there’s somebody, not necessarily a solicitor even, but
                      I’ll have to think about that. Clearly if they didn’t have a
                      solicitor, if something crops up they can’t speak so -


CORONER:              Well they’ll try. This is the dilemma. I mean, obviously, the
                      level of representation is entirely up to you.


MR FRAZER:            I think for a political point of view the Chief Constable might
                      want somebody in.


MR METCALF:           Well, yes and no -


MR FRAZER:            I suppose it works two ways.

                                                                                        11
MR METCALF:           If it isn’t necessary then - but having said that I would have
                      thought - I’ll have to think about it. It seems (inaudible) to.
                      (inaudible) respond.


CORONER:              No. I mean - I think - another thing I wanted to say, and that
                      is the order in which we’re going to call the cases. But that
                      (overspeaking) problem than meets the eye. I’ll start off, if
                      you like - that I want to call them in pathologists order
                      because if I do need to call a pathologist I don’t - I want to
                      call that pathologist -


MR METCALF:           Tie them up for as a little -


CORONER:              (overspeaking) -


MR METCALF:           Yes, better to do it when it’s half a dozen -


CORONER:              Of course where there are two people in the same family,
                      say, who have been killed then that’s an overriding
                      consideration. I would - you know, we would want those
                      inquests done at the - you know, on the same day. And
                      there are various other factors which come into it as well, so
                      we may not be able to strictly - so the order’s going to be
                      random or at least it will appear random. But I think that just
                      one of those -


MR FRAZER:            (overspeaking) You’re not going to complete everybody
                      however you do it.

C O R O N E R :       I’m just going to Have to take - the disadvantage is that it
                      means I’m not calling in solicitor order. Now, of course, if the
                      steering committee represents -


MR FRAZER:            It’s not a problem.


CORONER:              - and it doesn’t - it’s neither here nor there. But if they don’t,
                      then there could be a bit inconvenient for some firms of
                      solicitors but I’m afraid I can’t (inaudible) it is. I mean, I’m
                      not going to deliberately be, you know, cause trouble but it’s
                      not my primary consideration.


                      Is there anything else that we needed to talk about at this
                      stage?


MR FRAZER:            How much notice will you give the families or will you tell the
                      solicitors? You know, suppose you’re actually sitting down
                      to draw your timetable. Where will the timetable go?


CORONERR:             What I have in mind; but to a certain extent it depends upon,
                      you know, further discussion with Mr Jones and myself, is
                      that we would notify the solicitors of the timetable, we would
                      also notify the family direct. An officer would tell them so
                      that they would know. And, of course, any witnesses who
                      we want to call, the officers would notify. So essentially we’ll
                      be playing it doubly safe and, of course, we’ll tell the
                      Hillsborough Support Group. So it may be that social
                      services would turn up at the door as well and say, “Did you
                      know that inquest is on such and such?” It is quite difficult
                      because we will have to warn people presumptively. W e’ll
                      have to say, “W e’re thinking of doing it - your inquest - on


www.merrillcorp.com
                                                                                         13
                      Wednesday but prepared for it to be put back” It is unlikely
                      that we’ll bring it forward.


MR JONES:             It’s a bit like Crown Court in a sense it has to be -


CORONER:              Yes -


MR FRAZER:            Yes. There’s a daily warned list. Yeah.


MR JONES:             Pre-warn list - a daily warning list.


CORONER:              And obviously in so far as you can explain the aspects of
                      (inaudible). You know, they can’t - just they may not
                      necessarily appreciate the logistical problems, you know, of
                      all - you know, all these organisational problems of getting
                      right.


MR FRAZER:            I think it would help me if you could also tell me, with my
                      steering committee hat on, the proposed dates as well.


CORONER:              Yes. Well that’s - we can do that.


MR FRAZER:            I mean, in relation to the individual solicitors and clients. If I
                      know, if I’m actually trying to organise something here, if
                      know who to expect -


CORONER:              If I know that the same - supposing that the steering - you
                      tell me that me steering committee will be representing en-
                      bloc, I wouldn’t then notify the individual solicitors, I would
                      just notify you of the dates.

MR FRAZER:            Okay. Well I -


CORONER:              Unless you feel that you -


MR FRAZER:            You may, I think - I think it might be better if you tell the
                      solicitors as well because we don’t want to - you see, we -
                      to a large extent we are anonymous in the sense that we
                      have deliberately not - we’ve tried not identify ourselves as
                      individuals and if I have the information, then by the time - if
                      I get the information that Mr Jones’ inquest is a week on
                      Tuesday, by the time I get it to his solicitor and he gets it out
                      or he gets the information back to me, I think, if it’s possible,
                      tell the family, tell the solicitor and also tell me.


CORONER:              Understood.


                      (overspeaking)


MR FRAZER:            Yes, yes. Yes. I mean the running order doesn’t matter to
                      you does it?


MR METCALF:           (inaudible)


CORONER:              Yes, I mean you would - I mean it wouldn’t actually matter to
                      you who (inaudible) -


MR METCALF:           It only matters in terms of preparation, in terms of reading -


CORONER:              That’s right, yes.


MR METCALF:           - reading up or whatever (inaudible).

C O R O N E R :       So that is, I think, nearly all that I need, you know, need to
                      say today.


MR JONES:             Can I just raise point Dr Popper?


CORONER:              Yes, please.


MR JONES:             This question of - your objectives as it were in the sense
                      united us in terms of finding out the information in order to
                      settle on the -


MR METCALF:           We each have the idea that this thing’s is going to be settled,
                      then let it be settled. The sooner the better - settle quicker.


MR JONES:             Are there any particular pain and suffering levels - I mean
                      before they found out as it were and that type of thing.
                      There may also be need amongst the families there to
                      actually question, which they would normally do in an
                      inquest, question the people who were actually there to say,
                      “Well, what exactly did you do to help my client and couldn’t
                      you have done something faster” and those kind of
                      comments which may actually come from a number of the
                      families who are much principled than perhaps some are on
                      that particular thing. And, indeed, one the things that you will
                      have to be sure of is that this device if you will - if that’s the
                      right expression - will actually bring out that to your
                      satisfaction and, of course, a lot will centre on precisely what
                      the summaries say. The ability to cross-examine if you will,
                      will not be there at that point either for you for the families, of

                      course, and it’s just something that in fairness I ought to
                      bring out.


                      (overspeaking)


MR JONES:             If we call the police, if we call South Yorkshire Police in,
                      which in many instances they would be in a position to give
                      that evidence under cross-examination. There could also be
                      some considerable problems there which it could actually
                      become very adversarial in terms of complaints against
                      police, “You didn’t do enough” etc, etc. and it’s something
                      that, for obvious reasons - not that we’re trying to cover
                      anything, it’s just a question we wouldn’t be in a position to
                      proceed at that time bearing in mind a criminal investigation
                      (inaudible) -


MR FRAZER:            No, I understand that. I think that goes to some extent to the
                      - I mean, the majority of the families won’t be looking for that
                      problem I don’t think. There will be some, we can identify
                      them, I’m sure. I think a lot of it has to do with your advance
                      publicity, Sir, I think if you can make it as clear as it is
                      possible to make on both sides of the Pennines that this is
                      an exercise to give information and not one to ...

                      send (several inaudible words) whole page. Here you are -


MR FRAZER:            Have you got some extra copies?


MR JONES:             Would it be - before I read this, would it be your intention to
                      talk to the press before next week’s meeting or will you ...

C O R O N E R :       Well, I think - I’ve thought about the (several inaudible
                      words) and I’m inclined to say we should tell the press about
                      the meeting and, in fact, (inaudible) and other press.


MR JONES:             And I think once that letter goes out to all the solicitors -


MR FRAZER:            Yes, somebody’s going to copy it to the Press Agency -


MR JONES:             - (inaudible) and we don’t want to be wrong footed on that.


MR FRAZER:            Yeah, you want to be ahead of them.


MR JONES:             Yes, that’s right.




                      (pause)


CORONER:              Does that seem (inaudible) -


MR JONES:             Yes. (inaudible) just to check but it gets to the message.


MR METCALF:           Yes. The only thing I’d mention from your point of view is
                      some people might phone that number on the second page
                      and be surprised when someone says, “West Midlands
                      Police here”.


CORONER:              Well I -


MR METCALF:           It doesn’t actually say -

CORONER:              No. I can think about them but it is going to solicitors.


MR METCALF:           Yes (inaudible).


MR FRAZER:            I wouldn’t place any credence(?) in that.


MR METCALF:           In some cases.


CORONER:              Apart from the two people or three who are not (inaudible) I
want to do a
                      covering letter to those and send them because they’re
                      entitled to come, you know?


MR FRAZER:            So this is to all solicitors who have notified you they
                      represent a deceased to -


CORONER:              To all (inaudible) -


MR FRAZER:            All organisations who were represented at the

MR FRAZER:            When would you expect to release this?


CORONER:              I want to - if we’d finished early I would have sent it out
                      tonight but we’ve already done the envelopes. We need to

CORONER:              Yes (inaudible) -


MR FRAZER:            I’ve no doubt one or two will land on my desk anyway.


CORONER:              Well we’re - I don’t intend to send one to each - in effect,
                      each deceased, just one -


MR FRAZER:            No, just one per firm.


CORONER:              - in each firm, irrespective of how many they may represent
                      And then, as I say, I’ll tell me if you’re coming. I’ve tried to
                      explain what the object of the exercise is a little bit more
                      briefly than we have done this afternoon. And then next
                      week I’m afraid it will mean repeating to a large extent what
                      we’ve said today formally and if the press decide to come,
                      will I let them be there and have them here and I do intend

                      possible I want to try and (inaudible) I don’t any more bad
                      press for the press in my court. They can do what they like
                      away from here but not make - (inaudible) stop them doing
                      things but within reason. And as I said, I also want to talk
                      with the steering committee, not the steering committee,

MR FRAZER:            Social Services.


CORONER:              Yes, Social Services, so that they know.


MR METCALF:           I suspect you’ll get quite a big turnout next week from people
                      who -


MR JONES:             (inaudible).


MR METCALF:           I don’t whether the scope for putting extra benches in, but I
                      think people will be one on top of the other in -


CORONER:              Well you - you see we won’t have any families, it will be
                      solicitors so we can use (several inaudible words) -


MR JONES:             (overspeaking) turn this round and use that -


                      (overspeaking)


CORONER:              Yes. Because they are actually writing you know, they’ve all
                      g o t-


MR JONES:             They’ve all got desktops.


CORONER:              Desktops. I don’t think we’ll have enough space next week.
                      But I agree with you, I suspect there will be quite a few
                      representatives because they’ll want to know what on earth’s
                      going on, quite correctly, but they can form a proper
                      judgement as to what they want to do at the hearing.

MR JONES:             Can I just confidentially brief you both in terms of the
                      progress of the investigation. That is continuing, I saw Mr
                      Metcalfs eyes raise a little bit when I said that. The final
                      submission to DPP won’t have gone by this time starts, if it
                      does, on 18th, 19th. It won’t be long after, that’s the point I’m
                      making. I intend to finish it in the Spring and await the DPP’s
                      response. But, in fairness, it will not be completed and every
                      ‘t’ crossed and every ‘i’ dotted probably until the end of this
                      particular process, not that this process has anything to do
                      with it but it’s just simply that other things are going on and
                      that includes interviews which I’ll be talking to you about
                      separately.


MR METCALF:           Yes. Right.


MR JONES:             I’ve had your letter earlier but we didn’t - deliberately didn’t
                      respond although than to acknowledge because we wanted
                      to talk about, bearing in mind your letter came about the
                      same time as Miss Steel’s did asking very similar questions.


MR METCALF:           Right.


CORONER:              Okay. Is there anything else that you feel that - are you
                      content that we should proceed in the way I’ve outlined?


MR METCALF:           I see no reason why not.


MR FRAZER:            Yes. I agree entirely. I can go back to your point, I think
                      we’ve all made, there will be one or two problems with it, but
                      on balance I think it’s an excellent idea primarily from the
                      point of view of the relatives to get the information that

                                                                                         22
                      they’ve wanted for nearly a year and also from the lawyers
                      point of view, there’s an added bonus that information will
                      come out and those few problems will be the price that we’ll
                      have to pay for a much larger benefit.


MR JONES:             Without naming any individuals at this time, do you think
                      there would be scope and would it be appropriate to, as it
                      were, take those cases which perhaps could cause greater
                      difficulty towards the middle - towards the end rather than
                      being on the first day when the world’s press are queued up
                      as it were?


MR FRAZER:            It depends on the nature of the problem really.


MR METCALF:           I think it would be usual, wouldn’t it, in most courts to take
                      shorter cases before longer ones and if the anticipation is
                      that in some cases there will be a lot of questions raised and
                      hence they will take more time, the usual thing would be to
                      list them at the end, that’s the normal way.


MR JONES:             All I’m thinking is that you might get a lot of families hyped up
                      (overspeaking) you wouldn’t want to be hyped up. And I’m
                      not trying to conceal anything.


MR FRAZER:            No. I think it should be started as a low key thing and
                      hopefully it’ll run that way, whereas if you have the world’s
                      press here on the first couple of day the disadvantage is if
                      they get hold of the timetable - I mean I don’t -


MR JONES:             It might (inaudible) uncertain.

M R   FR AZER :       Yes. I think they’ll do that anyway. But I agree that the stuff
                      which can be got out of the way without any difficulty should
                      be got out of the way in terms of not to upset them as
                      individuals because there’s no reason why -


MR JONES:             That’s the whole point really - minimise the trauma early in
                      as much as we possibly can.


MR FRAZER:            Yes. Yes.


MR METCALF:           And, again, if any cases which are going to cause particular
                      problems are last on the list on a given day then no other
                      family is going to be kept waiting if there is a -


CORONER:              That’s a good point. Yes. Thank you.


MR METCALF:           Although I think that might -


CORONER:              In other words (inaudible) for (inaudible) days as well.


MR FRAZER:            Save that there is one particular case that I can think of
                      should be heard         in the morning.


CORONER:              Well, if you’ve got any views on those, Mr Frazer, you must
                      tell me (inaudible) -


MR FRAZER:            Yes, I mean I obviously have to be very, very careful.


MR METCALF:           I think I missed your point and now I understand it.


CORONER:              I’m not asking you to tell me now. But -

M R   FR AZER :       There’s one family who would swell the coffers of the local
                      hostelry before they arrived. So if they were a 9 o’clock start
                      I think. That’s one other thing, what time will you start in
                      terms of travelling?


CORONER:              Any suggestion, any thoughts?


MR JONES:             Like today it’s -


MR FRAZER:            It’s going some isn’t it?


MR JONES:             9.30 I would have thought at latest really.


CORONER:              Can you do it?


MR METCALF:           It’s no problem from our point of view. Well, I mean, just

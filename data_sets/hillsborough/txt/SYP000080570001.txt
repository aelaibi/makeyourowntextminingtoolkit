              PC 1996 WATSON of the West Midlands Police Force on a film ref No

              n - ^ J / 1 at ref times 15,25.50 to 15.25.57.00 I am on the screen,                                in my

              arms    is a young       lad dressed in green top.                I have carried hirri from the

              gate in pen thrSus^Pol lowing viewing                photographs of clothing and of

              the deceased.           I believe this to be Gary CHURCH j ^ o d y                14.     I am seen

              to place this boy on the pitch.                I did heart massage on this                      lad but

              there was no response,           I knew he was dead,              I went- to try and help

              someone else.           1 handled a number of other deceased or injured but I

              have been unable to recognise thjXfT on the film I have been shown.

              I have marked on two plans t p t f place                I was handed the body of

              CHURCH and the place          1 left him.        These      plans are Ref No DW/1 BW/2.

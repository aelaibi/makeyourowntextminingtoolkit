FILE NOTE DATED 24.10.90.
Meeting with Mervyn Jones, Stan Beechey, Caroline Perkins

and Sue Harper for part of the time and myself at Nechells

Police Station, 24.10.90.____ ______ ____________________ ______

A long meeting to discuss progress on preparation for the

Inquest. Caroline made a few notes which she will

circulate.   We discussed various matters including the

acconunodation.    Sue Harper reported progress.   Apparently

it was not possible to make accommodation available for the

Jury in the canteen.     Whilst they were prepared to provide

light meals in the jury room, I felt that on balance,

taking everything into account, we ought to give the Jury

their entitlement and let them go and fend for themselves,

subject to appropriate warnings.

We discussed the location of the T.V. screens and Videos,

Overhead Projectors, Audio equipment for the audio tapes.

Sue Harper would be liaising and sorting things out and

making sure that it was all dealt with properly.       It would

appear that we were getting a lot of co-operation from the

local authority.     Council meetings were scheduled for

November the 28th and January the 9th.      In addition to that

there was a meeting on the 6th of December and the Mandela

and Committee Room would not be available.

Jackie Harrison, the West Midlands Police Press Officer had

              the Press in hand.

We discussed attendance at the Pre Inquest Review and

agreed that we would restrict this to legal representatives

          m n g     witnesses to read out relevant sections.           We




bacaay
agreed that we would continue, with consequtive numbering.

It looked as if we would probably need 20 copies of each

exhibit or document.     One for each of the solicitors 4 for

the Jury, 1 for me, 1 for Mr. Jones, 1 for the shorthand

writer and a couple of spares or so.     We agreed that if the

solicitors wanted to introduce any documents, they would

have to produce the copies that were required.       We could

not provide the service.     We discussed the transcripts.        I

explained that these would be charged for for the benefit

of Sheffield.     That meant of course that Sheffield should

have to deal with the photocopying et c .   I said that we

would see how many we would need after our meeting on the

30th.
We discussed letter from Mr.Glover.     I said I would reply

to it.    They would deal with any police matters.     We again

discussed the scope of the Inquest and decided that a

convenient point at which we ought to draw the line would

be the arrival of the first ambulance on the pitch.        This

was really intended as a marker.     We agreed that we would

have to be fairly firm to avoid too much straying into post

incident.
I explained that the only problem I could see was that if

somebody had alleged that the medical treatment had caused

the death.      I felt that if that was put forward as a

serious suggestion, one might have to take that inquest

out, making it plain that no-one deal with it on that basis

and not as part of the Hillsborough Disaster.     We thought




 BACAAY
  that it might be a good idea to make this point at the
  procedural meeting.

  I suggested that we try and find out how many people had

  filled in questionnaires/given statements or who claimed

  be in Pen 3.    I thought this might possibly   be a back-up

  check on the calculations of Mr. Burns and the H.s.E.

 We discussed the experts.    We felt that we would have

 Mr. Philips, Mr. Stalker, Mr. Burns, H.S.E. numbers to be

 decided.    On the whole, we thought we wouldn't pursue the

 Cranfield Disaster as it looked as if this would not be
 helpful in sorting out the issue before us.

 We discussed the PACE statements and in the end felt that

 it was right to use these.    it was agreed that I would

 write to find out whether videos would be available. We

 noted that there were two or three who had refused videos.

 I would have to check who they were before I sent the

 letter.    The people who refused the videos were Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Greenwood,
everybody else agreed.

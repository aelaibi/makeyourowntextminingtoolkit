Your Private   Secretary telephoned earlier today for details of the
Government's   position on safety at football grounds following the
Hillsborough   disaster and the Interim Report of the Inquiry by
Lord Justice   Taylor.

In the very short time available I think I can do no better than
to send you a copy of our press notice and circular issued on the
day of publication of the Interim Report together with a copy of
the Home Secretary's letter of 9 October to John Carlisle MP.
Since then we have written to the Association of Chief Police
Officers about written agreements and have discussed with the
Inquiry the question of mandatory terms and conditions in safety
certificates.

I hope this is of assistance.

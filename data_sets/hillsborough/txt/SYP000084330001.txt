                 with me at                                                          /fie is     18 years       of

                 were      not delayed.          We a r ri ve d      in S h e f f i e l d at a bout          1230 hrs.          We

                 parked      the    car by the G r e y h o u n d S ta d iu m on the                 road.

                 We then walked            to some shops,            bought a drink and som et hi ng                       to eat and

                 went      back    to the    car and       listened to the                 radio

                 We   left the         car at about        140Q hrs to walk                 to the ground.            We     passed 2

                 pubs and there were a great                       number       of   people outs id e         drinking

          presumed that             these were Notts Forest                supporters.              When we got near              to
                                                                                        /
     ' V•4 the ground fay Leppirtgs Lrt we saw a lot of people drinking in the

           street.          I saw quite a lot of Police                  OfVi/cers about.              There were           some

          standing an d some               in vans.        I did not see any disorder                      on the way        to
                                                                                               /

          I a r r i v e d at the          ground to go        in at a bout        1415/hrs.           There were a           lot

          of     people      hanging a ro u nd outside             the outer      ^ates        but betw ee n        that
  *-|i_
          gate and          the t urnstiles            there were     no crowis,            just    people w a lk in g       up

          to the turnstiles                and going       straight      i n , ^ There were           police       officers

          on each turnstile.                    I cannot    remember       seeing any stewards                 outside.

          I did not          see anyone          climbing     over    the walls         to get       in.      I did not          see

          any    gates       open    or    bei.ng    opened.

          The only thing              I saw outside         in any wa y u ntowards was                 the     number       of

          people       that were          hanging about          in L ep pings Ln making              no a tt e mp t    to go

          in .

          Once     inside         the ground there was only one way                         to go to the        stand and

          by the      stairs were           stewards       showing     people w h ic h way to go.

          I got      to my seat w hi ch was over                  the tunnel about 5 rows                    from the       front

          at about          1425      hrs. I did not see anyone              drinking          inside        the   ground

          an d   I did not see any disorder                   or d r un k en n es s *
                                                                                   /
          I was      sat w ith my son and at about                    1445 h r s / he said,           ’Look     below,       it

          is very f u l l . ’          1 looked down into the pens behind the goal and I

          thought          that    there were        too many      people     in there               that     time and

          people were             still    coming       in and    pushing to get/in.                 The     people at       the

          front of the             pens were        getting      crushed.      There were            people at        the

          front      trying        to a t tr ac t    the a t t e n t i o n of Police          O ff ic er s    on the    pitch.

          The Police O f ficers                 on the    pitch seemed to         ignore           them.     After a while

          a Police          Officer       got    on the fence by Pen 3 and was                      telling     the

          crowd to move              back.       The     players    came onto the            pitch an d I was

          w at c h i n g    the    pitch.        I could see        that    the   pens were          even more        full

                clearly a lot of                problems       in the     pert.     There were       people scr ea mi ng                to

                get out.         There were            people      trying    to get     out over         the front          fence.

                There were           people      climbing         over   the side      fences and         people were             being

                pulled up out of the                   pen into the West Stand.                   At this stage             the

                P olice Officers               opened     the gate to the           pen.     I think       that       this made
FtouQ£
                things worse with                people     trying       to get     out.     The m at ch had been
     /vr
                s top p e d and there were                a lot of       po 1 i c / offcers at the             pens    t hen t r y i n g

                to get      people out           of the     pens.        Ths/y were     trying      to    pull    the       fence

                down.      There      did       not    seem,      however,    to be anyone          in charge.

                I was     looking at what was                  going     on on the      field.       There were a             lot of

                injured      people        lying on the            pitch.     There were          people       lying    on the

                pitch o b v io u sl y dead.               Pe ople were       carrying       out    deajd and      injured fans

                ground at about                4 pm.      <1600)

                I think      that a factor              in the deaths         or    injuries       to people was             the

                i naction of the Police                   to recognize        the s it u at i on unf ol di ng           before

                them.     /Also another major                  factor     is the design'of           the ground.              I did

                not <N?e anyth in g             that    I c onsidered to be of a              criminal          nature.

                initiative.           There were           no bolt       cutters     to cut down the fence.                       The

                tanoy system was                totally     inadequate.            There    should have          been

                a n n o u n c e m e n t s about what was going               on.

                I think      that     the des i g n of the ground at H i l l s b o r o u g h                   is abysmal.              The

                policing       of the m a t c h was appalling.                     It was    inevitable          that a

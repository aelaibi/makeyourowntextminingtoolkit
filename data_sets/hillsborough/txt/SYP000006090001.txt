Lord Justice Taylor,
   ,‘           Sir,
                      I am a supporter of She!field Wednesday.I live and
 socialise in tne Hillsborough area.I do not want to give my name or
 address,as I would not like to face tne wrath of tne fans or families
 who lost friends and relations in tne disaster.
      I nave watched tne T.V.,1 have read the papers,and like everyone
 else,I have been stunned and cnokea by what nappened.
      But no one nas yet mentioned the truth of what led up to tne
 tragedy.Reporters don't know,T.V.cameramen don't know,because tney were
fcere not there.We were,the people of Hillsborough. /           ■
                                                                , /
      Just before 1 o'clock,! came down Herries Ro#cL,about a mile from
 the Stadium.lt was a beautiful sunny day.As I passed the Five Arches
 pub,there were about 200 Liverpool fans stood Zbout,or sat on tne grass
 enjoying a quiet drink*iJo drunks,No trouble./
       I went for my beer to tne Horse and J^cKey.about fifteen minutes
walk from Hillsborough. It was packed with Liverpool fans,a,Il benavi ng
perfectly.They were outside,in tne sunsnine.Tney were full of joy and
laughter,enjoying tne aay out.Their day.Liverpool Semi/Pinal Day.
       Tnrougn talking to friends later in tne week^fter tne t;r^g£dy,it
was obvious tnat it was tne same story in tne Dial House,Queens Ground,
and any number of puds arouna tne fr'ootpall Ground.Tney were having a great
time.The Semi was in tnere minds.But getting tnere was not.I can only
talk for tne pub I was in,but at 2.3Q pm.tne police were tnere.Gently
trying to persuade the fans to make tneir way to tne ground.Tne police
were patient but firm.Come on lads,it's time .you were on your way,Let's
 be getting down tnere.Still peaceful tne fans finisned tneir pints and
by 2.35*they were on tneir way.With a Fli’TEEN fflMTE walk to tne match.
       This was happening all over Sheffield 6.
^      With 10 or 15 minutes to kicic off,51,000 sensible fans were in the
stadium,nice and early,to get a good view.51,000 who were more interested
in tne game,than the pre matcn drinK*
       By Liverpools own complaining,tnere were more Forrest fans tnan
Liverpool,but tne forrest fans were in tneir places,on time,to see the
kick off.Then,at 2.45pm»tney turned up.Only tnen did it dawn on tnem tnat
they were going to miss tne oeginning.Were tney surprised to find a row
of turnstyles barring tneir way?I don't tnink so.Did tney really expect
to get to tne ground at tnat time and walk straight in.Hardly.
      Then tne great Liverpool supporter lost nis cool.You cannot blame
the Police.You cannot blame the Staaium.Blarae tne men wko put more
importance on naving a pint,tnan getting to tue ground.
      As for the decision to open tne gate,t.ne Police Cnief was on a
loser.If he nadn't opened it,and people nad died otsiae,as seemed likely,




                                                                           2
 The cry would nave been,"Wny didn't tney open tne bloody gates."
        If you want conauct a full and proper inquiry,as I am sure you do,
  send' your enquiry teams around tne local puos,tnen you will see tnat I
 am‘telling tne deadly accurate trutn.
        Get noId of tne pre match videos,identify tne fans tnat        were
  shouting andpointing at tne police,ana ask THEM wnere tney were at 2 pm.
        I am not accusing any of tnem of being drun*c,or causing any kind
 of disorder,I didn't see any,All I am saying is tnat getting into tne
 Semi Final was tne last tning on tneir minds,until tney realised tnat
 they weren't going1 to get in.Then it was everyboays fault but tneirs.
        They were the killers.
|l       The late Liverpool fans wno forced tneir way in,onto tne backs of
 tot tne fans who nad gone in early,to be safe.
         Already I see tnat some families axe suing the Soutn Yorkshire
 Police,and Sheffield Wednesday.Get tnem all togetner,snow THEM tne
 films taken outside the ground at ten to tnree,Tney are Liverpudlians,
 ask them if tney recognise any of tne fans in tie crowd,then get THEM
 to ask them wnere tney were till that time.IN THE PUBS.
         Then, let tnem sue tnem,tne real cause of tae tragedy.
         Lord Justice Taylor,I've spent years going to ±iillsborougn,I love
 the place.It was not tneir fault.
         I'll give you a number to get going on.

       That is tne number of a private club
 that is FIVE miles from Hillsborougn,at tne otner siae of tne City.
        From tnere,at after 2.30pm.five taxi loads of Liverpool fans,set
 off for the matcfe.Does it sound as if tney were realy expecting or even
 interested in seeing tne game.
       I admit I am afraid to ^ive my name,I'm only a football fan,But
 you are a strong and powerful person.
^      Don't be afraid to lay tne blame wnere it belongs.
       Three tnousand fans who put tneir beer before tnei y team.




                                                                              3

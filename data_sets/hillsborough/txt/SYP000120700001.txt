                At 0945 am           I was       in the N o r t h S t a n d with Serial No. 59 which

an d were          eagerly awaiting              the match.

considerable               distance         away,       but this didn't         deter      them   in seeking a

By    1.30     pm       (1 3 3 0 ) the        pavements were b e g inning             to swell        with

di s t u rbance          from within.            On arrival        I saw a p p r o x i m a t e l y 30

Nottingham Forest                  fans milling          outside        eating      sandwiches         and

The m aj o r i t y        of     the   fans    on    the whole were well                behaved,       taut a small

group of a p p r o x i m a t e l y         10 male you t h s           aged    between      18 and H 5 years

were     being          b oisterous,       shouting and           singing       football       songs.         I could

see     that       at    least     half    of them were           carrying 4 and 6 packs                  of beer and

litre     bottles           of    cider.       I even s a w o n e y o u t h         carrying a t h r e e        litre

W hen    I questioned              him he      informed me         that       he had bought           it from a,

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 . 0 0        pm    (1 4 0 0 ) the      p r oprietor      of    th®     shop     came out

and    re q u e s t e d a P o l i c e         presence,         to    remove 4 male youths who                    had been

in for a p p r o x i m a t e l y SO minutes and were                          causing a disturban ce.

After     an initial             discussion           the y o u t h s    were     e s c o r t e d out      of the        shop,

an d then told to make                      their way       to the         ground.

I noticed at              this    time        that there was an aura of tension and

anticipation              in the air.              The    crowds a pp e a r e d        to have a m i x t u r e           of

emotions         ranging         from exci t e m e n t          to    lethargy.

From     that        time    onwa r d s       there was a st e a d y flow of s upporters

comprising            of f a m i l i e s      to groups         of youths who w e r e           walking         from

S h e f f i e l d C i t y Centre.                There were          still    a large        number       of fans

carrying         some       form of alcohol.                 I informed a number                of them that              once

they     had     reached         the     immediate         vicinity          s u r r o unding   the      S t a d i u m any

form of alcohol                present w o u l d          foe confiscated.              Their       replies       were        to

the effect            that     ther      would       be no alcohol            left     by the t i m e        they had

r e a c h ed    the     g r ouncl., whi ch was a p p r o x 1mate 1y ha 1 f a mi 1e away .

By now the             crowds were            spilling      onto       the    road and some were                becoming

a g i t a t e d when tol d to keep on the                        pavement.            I could see          that     a

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 . 3 0        pm    ( 1 4 S O ) the     crowds were        running         towards         the

ground.          I could see             that      the m a j o r i t y   of t h e m     comprised          of young men

There was            no a n i m o s i t y    towards       the Police.

At 3.00         pm     ( 1 5 0 0 ) I was         informed       by P S |                 to make my w ay with

As    1 approached           gates       77 to 88        I could see a large             number        of

Nottingham forest                 supporters         s t a nding     outs i d e    showing me their

bonaf ide tickets an d d e manding                       to     be   let    into   the ground.          It became

a p p arent        to me    that       there was        so m e t h i n g a miss whe n the        t u rnstile

o pe r a t o r s    refused       them entry.            By now the a t m o s p h e r e     was    electric.

I then e n t e r e d        the g r o u n d      by the S p i o n Ho p an d walked             straightaway

onto     the football             pitch.         I was    g r e e t e d w i t h a large        number       of youths

running a r o u n d the             field       ripping       boarding       from the    perimeter           of the

field.         1 walked          up to the halfway               line to see a large             number       of both

sexes and all              ages     lying       on the ground.              Some were    screaming           for

help,      some were          c o v e r e d with their           coats and were         obviously           dead.

The scene was              one    of    total      carnage       and to a certain extent                confusion,

X t was at          tbi s poi nt that            I he 1 ped an urtcons cious supporte r who was

laid down on the                 centre       line    in the N o t t i n g h a m Forest         end.

Approximately              six youths           brought       him on a piece of b o a rding and                    laid

him on the           ground.           I. could see        that      the    lad was about        18 years          ot

age     I quickly          tu r n e d him on his           back and began m outh               to m outh

resuscitation              followed        by enter rial heart massage.                  After

approximately              15 m i n u t e s     the y o u t h didn't         respond to treatme nt              and a

Doctor,        1 don't        know      his     name,    pronounced          life extinct.         This       youth

was     then carried             by the       same    team of        lads    to the gymnasiurn at             the

rear of the N o r t h Stand.

1 stayed w i t h the Doctor and wo r k e d on a second y outh who was

approximately              the    same age.           1 could see that             he had been

        minutes.          I then        placed my      tunic      over       the   dead body.              It was at this

         point    that a p h o t o g r a p h e r a s k e d      if    1 would        remove       the T unic and             pose

         in the m o u t h      to m o u t h   position        in order          that    he     could take a

         photograph.           I d i d n ’t reply as          I was      too busy wit h the                  injured and

         dying.       I did notice however                 that      not one of the              photographers          helped

         any    of the       injured,      they were        too keen to take                  ’a c t i o n ’ photographs.

         Whi 1st w a l k i n g     towards       the Spiort Ko p end               I was      stop p e d     by a y outh who

         was a p p r o x i m a t e l y SO years         of age,       who was        carrying          his    friend over

         his shoulder.             He    told me that         he had just            stopped          breathing,         I

         placed him on the               grass      and after        an e x a mi n a t i o n f ound that            there was

         no    pulse.        I began to a d m i n i s t e r       m outh       to m o u t h    r e s u s c i t a t i o n and

         external       heart massage.               Upo n a further            examination            I now found a

         pulse and          found that        he was     breathing,             I placed him            in the      recovery

         position and awaited                 for    the a m b u l a n c e     to ar r i v e     to    convey him to the

         Hospital.          Once    placed       in the a m b u l a n c e       I then joined others                 who who

         this    time were         s t a nding      forming a cordon               i mmediately         in front       of the

         S p i o n Kop.       I was      informed       by my S e r g e a n t       that      1 was     to m a i n t a i n

         order at this           end and       to    prevent any of the                supporters            from   invading

         t h e p it c h .

         After    the       crowds were        informed that           the m a t c h w o u l d be            cancelled         1

Dear Mr. Croston

HILLSBOROUGH

I have been speaking to the Assistant Chief Constable, Ian Daines of South Yorkshire.
He tells me that you had written a letter to the Solicitor acting for the Hillsborough
Family Support Group asking for details of any new evidence. Is this correct and have
you had any response? It seems to me that unless they can establish that there is new
evidence of substance, and which is beyond anything that has already been seen by
the Director of Public Prosecutions, and including the scrutiny by Lord Justice Stewart
Smith, then the Director should agree to take over conduct of this case and
discontinue the proceedings.

I also understand that there is a policy statement issued by or on behalf of the Director
of Public Prosecutions as to the Directorâ€™s policy on private prosecutions. It would be
very helpful if you would agree to provide me with a copy of that policy statement.


Yours sincerely

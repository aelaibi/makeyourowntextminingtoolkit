 Dear Miss Oades

 Adlingtoa -v- Duckenfield and Murray

 I refer :c my letter o f 10 December last in regard to judicial review proceedings, and
 confirm that we now have the advice from the Crown Prosecution Service regarding our
 request for intervention and enclose herewith a copy o f their litter of 1S December 1998.

 I have discussed this matter with Leading Counsel and am pleased to enclose herewith a
 short memorandum of advice regarding the desirability o f making an application for judicial
 review or this decision.

 On the basis o f that advice, which 1 strongly echo, may I formally request tb it the Police
 Authority agree to underwrite M r Duckeafield’s costs o f im application for judicial review
 o f the CPS.'DPP decision not to intervene in this matter.

 It may assist you to know that we anticipate the framework, for this will involve initially
 prepararion o f an, Application with a supporting Affidavit which Counsel hopes can be
 prepared within the first 2 weeks of January. The documentation would then be submitted
 to the Crown O m cc o f the High Court here in London, and it is likely that an oral
 application wiU have to be made before a Judge, requiring the attendance o f Counsel, for
 leave to move for judicial review. The prosecution may or may not be heard on that
 application, depending upon the Court's approach, and we are confident that leave will be
 fcanied. It is likely that the Court will order that the judicial review proceed expeditiously,
 and there is some possibility that the foil substantive hearing, which will take several days,
 could be heard before the present committal date o f 19 April 1999. A very rough and ready
 cost estimate for this exercise I would put in the region o f £lO.QQO-£l5.COO.

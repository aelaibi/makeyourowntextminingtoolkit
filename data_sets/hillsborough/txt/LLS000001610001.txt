Statement of

P.O.B.

P.O.S. 2/5/89

Address:




On Saturday morning 15th April 1989 I travelled to Hillsborough by

Special train to watch the semi final of the F.A. Challenge cup.




We left Liverpool at 11.00 a.m. and arrived at Sheffied at 14.05 p.m.




We were then escorted to the ground by the Police and I arrived at the

ground at approximately 14.10 p.m.    On arrival at the ground there were

no queues and we just walked straight in and through the tunnel which was

quite full at this time.



I walked into the middle   of the ground in enclosure B and because it

was getting over crowded I moved to the left hand side of the goal

at about 10-15 ft from the fence.


          *



At about 14.30 hours this started filling up and the crush became

far worse.




I eventually hauled myself over the bars    and escaped this crush and

began to help the medical services.




I was carryibng one chap on an advertising board but he died and the

Police Officer told me to put him down.    I carried another chap to

the Gym and repeated this process carrying the dead and dying bodies

across the pitch until about 4.30 when i just sat down to regain my

breath.



I ev-riI ually /rained composure and left the ground about 17.00 hrb where
                                                                   i

I g<'i. on a bus to the main station and the train left the station about

18.45 and I arrived back in Liverpool
Although I was not hurt very much I have terrible nightmares and I am still

very shocked that I did not expect anything like this just going to watch

a football match.

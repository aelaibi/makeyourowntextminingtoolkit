Dear Sirs,

Joseph C h ris to p h e r GLOVER

I refer to your letter of 5th December 1990, regarding your client Joseph
Christopher GLOVER and his giving evidence at the Inquests of the Hillsborough
Football Stadium Disaster.

Whilst Mr GLOVER may have been informed that he will be required to give evidence,
no date has been fixed for this to be heard.  This is due to the difficulty in
assessing the time to be allowed for other witnesses to give their evidence, prior
to that given by Mr GLOVER.

As to your request for a copy of your client’s statement, this matter is receiving
attention as indicated in a letter forwarded to you on 30th November 1990.

However, you may be assured that prior to Mr GLOVER being called to give evidence,
he will have sight of any statement he has previously made to the Inquiry Team in
order that he may refresh his memory as to that d a y ’s events.



Yours faithfully,




J M JONES
Deputy Chief Constable

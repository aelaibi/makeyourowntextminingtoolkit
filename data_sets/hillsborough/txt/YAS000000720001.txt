HAME:      Ambulanceman

VEHICLE:       S405

SHIFT:     1000 - 1800 (extra crew assigned to Hillsborough
                        Football Ground duties)

DATE AND TIME OF INTERVIEW:           19 April 1989 - 1020-1145 hours



On Saturday 15 April 1989, I came on duty at 1000 hours, along with my
colleague Ambulanceman                   to specifically provide additional Ambulance
cover    for    the     semi-final   football match         at Hillsborough.        During     the
morning we did a few jobs for Control (a couple of admissions and a couple
of '999' calls.


We returned to Longley Station for a break at approximately 1315 hours.                        At
approximately 1400 hours we             left Longley        Station and proceeded to           the
football       ground    along with     Station      Officer      Eason   and   Station   Officer
Higgins, arriving at approximately 1410 hours.


We   parked     the Ambulance        inside   Gate    'O'    at    the    Ground which    is   off
Penistone Road.          We stood-by at that location.             I was stood at the corner
of the pitch between the North Stand and to the right of the Kop, as you
look towards the Leppings Lane end of the ground when the match kicked off.
Shortly after kick off I noticed the crowd were spilling onto the pitch at
Leppings Lane end from the West Stand terracing.


I immediately went up to this area with Station Officer Eason and saw a
number of people laying on the ground.                   In a short space of time large
numbers of the crowd spilled onto the pitch and whilst trying to assess the
situation I was assaulted by a fan who punched me on my right shoulder.


                                                                                     /continued

By this time Ambulanceman          had joined me and Station Officer Eason
sent us back to the vehicle for equipment.      We returned to the football
pitch area at the Leppings Lane end with a cot, frac-pac, bag and mask,
portogen equipment and two first aid bags.     We could see a fan with what
appeared to be a broken leg lying close to one of the goal posts.          I
started to treat him and put a frac-pac on the injured leg.


By now   I could   see Police Officers doing   resuscitation on people.    I
grabbed my first-aid bag and took out some airways.      I handed one to a
Police Officer and I inserted at least six airways into casualties who were
being resuscitated by both Police Officers and by-standers.


I then went to a young teenager who was being resuscitated by a Policeman.
I inserted an airway and commenced mouth to mouth whilst the Policeman did
cardiac massage.   Whilst doing this we were surrounded by fans one of them
kicked me several times, then a group of fans fell on top of us with some
advertising boards.    We pushed them off and continued resuscitation.    We
got no response from the casualty so we stopped and I carried on attempting
to both treat and revive several other fans with the aid of Police Officers
and fans.


I eventually managed to get back to my Ambulance for more equipment.      At
this stage there were two people working on a casualty already laid on the
stretcher on my Ambulance.     I got into the back of the Ambulance and
started to resuscitate the patient with an automatic resuscitator.   Someone
loaded an asthmatic patient into the cab of the vehicle.       Ambulanceman
         jumped into the driving seat and we set off to travel to the
Northern General Hospital with a Police motor cycle escort.



                                                                 /continued

We arrived at the hospital and unloaded our patients and handed them over
to Casualty staff in the Plaster room which was being used as an overflow
room     for    resuscitation.        By this    time approximately    1540,   there were
already five or six Ambulances in the Casualty yard that had either brought
or were bringing patients from the Hillsborough incident.


We left our cot at the hospital with a patient on and picked up a spare one
at the hospital and returned back to the Ground with a Police motor cycle
escort.        We arrived back at the Ground on Penistone Road and eventually
loaded two more casualties both stretcher cases, one with a drip set up.
Both these casualties were from the Gymnasium which was being used as a
Casualty Clearing area.


We were advised that the Northern General was full so we conveyed these two
patients to the Hallamshire Hospital arriving there at approximately 1605
hours.         We    arrived   at   Casualty    and were   directed   to the   Orthopaedic
entrance.           We transferred the patients       from our stretchers to hospital
trollies and handed them over the hospital staff.                              was at the
Hallamshire and she told us not to return to the Ground but to stand-by at
a point on Netherthorpe Road.           This we did and informed Control by radio.


Another Ambulance joined us on Netherthorpe Road and after a short time
Control informed us by radio to proceed to Herries Road Bus Depot and to
stand-by there.         We arrived at Herries Road Bus Depot at approximately 1630
hours.     We stood by at this point with approximately 30 other Ambulances
and were eventually directed back to the Car Park behind the Gymnasium at
Hillsborough Football Ground.


We were briefed by Mr Jones after having a drink and returned to Station
signing off duty at 1840 hours.

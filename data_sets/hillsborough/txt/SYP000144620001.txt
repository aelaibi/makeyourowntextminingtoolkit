                       - School Teacher

1    Due to se v e re t r a f f i c h old-ups a t S to c k p o rt in p a r t i c u l a r we
      arrived about th re e -q u a rte r of an hour l a t e r than we had planned.
      Probably many more people were l a t e f o r the same reason.

2    We made our way t o Leppings Lane and Gate B, as s t a t e d on th e
      tick ets.

3    Two la d s asked i f we had any sp a re t i c k e t s as we approached
      Leppings Lane end i t s e l f . When we tu r n e d th e c o r n e r we were
      c o n fro n te d by a large crowd being held back by police on horses.
      By now i t was 2.50 pm.

4    Some of the fans were eager to get in f o r the k ick -off and there
      were some challenges to the police but nothing serious - wanting to
      know why we w eren't being l e t through.               One policeman said 'You're
      not going anywhere, so t h e r e 's no point in pushing forward' and
      w h i l e a few s t i l l t r i e d t o g e t th ro u g h most of t h e crowd was
      standing p a tie n tly back from the horses across the road.

5    About 2.55 pm a policeman said 'Right lads th e y 'r e opening the side
      g ate. You can go through t h e r e '.

6    We went through, but at th a t point the surge from outside was not
      so g re a t.      I , f o r in stance, was holding our 4 t i c k e t s , expecting to
      give them in before going into the stadium.                My e ld e r son to ld me
      to put them away in case they were snatched and, without being
      j o s t l e d , I had tim e t o sta n d and put them in my younger s o n 's
      jacket pocket and secure i t .

7    We t h e n e n t e r e d a dark tu n n e l and i t was w h ile we were going
      through t h e r e t h a t p r e s s u r e from b eh in d , th en from a l l s i d e s ,
      s ta r te d to build up.

8    I was frig h te n e d but an ticip ated the crush would ease when we got
      on the t e r r a c e s , but when we got into the fresh a i r , we came up
      against another block of people and the crush was intense - swaying
      in every d ir e c tio n .

9    I clung on to my husband, but we were separated from our sons.        I
      f e l l , but was hauled up and we found ourselves with our bodies to a
      b a r r i e r which was behind us.

10   Meanwhile the game kicked o f f , and supporters s t i l l coming in , made
     t h e crush even worse.       They could not see what was happening in
     f r o n t - only th a t the match had s ta r te d and they were caught up at
     once in the furore of the game.

11   We j u s t clung on to the b a r r i e r behind in desperation. Some people
      began to climb over the 'cage' fence and i t 'looked' as i f they
      were invading the p itc h , but they were only escaping.
                  c o n tin u e d /...




12   Then the game was stopped.         The po lice came to the 'cage' r a il in g s
     as they would to suppress a r io ti n g crowd - in a s t r a ig h t lin e
     y e l l i n g to everyone to g e t back but we could not as b a r r i e r s
     p a r a l l e l to the pitch prevented i t .  Some supporters were dragged
     up to the seating area above, so as to leave more room below in our
     area.

13   Then th e police opened the narrow gate through on to the pitch -
     only one gate - 3 ft wide atmost.

14   Gradually the crush in fro n t of us began to th in to reveal many
     dead and dying people - many on top of each other up to about 5 ft
     back from the 'c a g e 1 r a ilin g s and some furtherback j u s t in f ro n t of
     us.

15   My elder son found his way back to us but had lo s t               our younger
     son, and was panic stric k e n .

16   My husband was j u s t g o in g forw ard t o se arch f o r him among th e
      people on the ground, when             spotted him climbing the 'cage'
      fence and y e lle d to him to get over on to the p itc h .

17   We saw him do so and knew he would be sa fe .

18   There were many people lying on the te r ra c e s in fro n t of       us - many
     a purplish blue colour and obviously dead or dying.

19   Friends were try in g to revive some people but th ere was very l i t t l e
     room to s tr e tc h people out.

20   We t r i e d t o comfort two lads who had 'come round' without help but
      were injured and very srhocked.

21   A f t e r what seemed a long while the police came through and began
      checking the people on the ground on the t e r r a c e s , but i t was too
      la t e f o r many.

22   Ambulances s ta rte d to a rriv e a c tu a lly on the p itc h , by which time
      many of the victims were on the pitch receiving help.

23   We l e f t as soon as we could f i n d a way o u t , to r e l i e v e th e
      congestion.

General comments

I feel t h i s was an avoidable accident.


1        Allocation of t i c k e t s inadequate

2        Liverpool fans housed in sm allest section of stadium

3        Fans could not move across to less cramped te r ra c e s due to b a r rie r s
          a t r i g h t a n g les t o p i tc h p re v e n tin g easy a c c e s s . Had we gone
          through the t u r n s t i l e s however, we would not a ll have been
          channelled into th a t central section but more would have gone to
          the less congested areas.
          No organised and audible communication with crowd outside wanting
         t o g e t in to see th e k ic k -o ff. They were j u s t being y elled at to
          stay back by mounted police.

I asked a policeman i f kick -o ff had been delayed as i t seemed a sensible
i d e a . He sa id not as y e t.       One policeman said the large crowd outside was
th e f a n s ' f a u l t fo r coming la t e : unavoidable in some cases as explained :
but f a u l t was simply too many people who were i n e f f i c i e n t l y c o n tro lle d .

Some of the crowd were g ettin g anxious to get in but i f they had been
properly informed of the overcrowding already on the t e r r a c e s , the majority
would have waited e s p e c ia lly i f k ick -o ff had been delayed, and gone through
th e t u r n s t i l e s and been channelled into t h e i r allocated areas.  I query
whether communication was adequate with police in sid e and outside the
ground since th ere was already a bad crush inside before the gate was
opened as was evidenced when we were f i n a l l y allowed in .

As i t was the police crowd control went from f i r s t l y holding everyone back
t o q u i t e suddenly opening t h a t large side gate to allow all and sundry in .
No t i c k e t s were checked.     Who can blame n o n -tick et holders fo r going in -
i f any did?        I t was a p erfec t opportunity. O f fic ia ls had no idea of the
actual numbers on the te r ra c e s - as a r e s u l t .

Equally, i t seemed the police were slow to re a c t to prevent even more
coming through from o u tsid e, when the real d i s a s te r was under way.


In add itio n , communication of events in the stadium were poor.                        At one
pont opposing fans were je e rin g the Liverpool supporters on the pitch -
unaware o f the problem - they thought i t was a pitch invasion - there
should be a n a tio n a l/in te r n a tio n a l warning 's i r e n ' when a l i f e threatening
s i t u a t i o n has developed - ordinary public address i s a waste of time - i t
c a n ' t be heard in a l l t h e n o i s e , but perhaps would be, i f used in
conjunction with s ir e n .

Hopefully t h i s would prevent other unnecessary inciden ts developing out of
f r u s t r a t i o n which demand even more police resources, which are required
elsewhere.

In th e l i g h t of re p o rts in the media following the d is a s t e r we feel as a
family we must now add :

1     Wedid not witness any drunken people waiting outside the ground

2     We did not smell alcohol on the breaths of people in the crush

3     We did not witness any criminal acts or in te rfe re n c e on any of the
     numerous bodies which lay on the te rra c e s immediately in fro n t of us or
     those "stacked" behind the perimeter fence

4     We did witness one d istr a u g h t, angry and help less supporter shouting
     abuse at a policeman, using very bad language.             My elder son said t h i s
     s u p p o r te r swung at the o f f ic e r and knocked his helmet o f f but he f e l t
     i t was done out of sheer helplessness and f r u s tr a ti o n and with no other
     motive in mind.

Outside the ground th e re was a g reat deal of congestion but nothing s i n s te r
as everybody could simply move back onto the road. The police on horses
c r e a t e d a lin e separating those going for the t u r n s t i l e s and those coming
late.        People were asking for the K.O. to be delayed as they w eren't going
t o get in on time.         Suddenly the lin e of mounted police s p l i t and one of
th e policemen said "Go to the r i g h t , a gate has been opened".

As we channelled through the gate, th e re wasn't any congestion u n til we
a c t u a l l y got into section ' B' . Once in the section I j u s t couldnd't move
and, as people were s t i l l coming in from behind th ere was no way back.
With th e constant supply of people I was gradually c a rrie d towards the
f r o n t of the section and, lu c k ily , to the side where I managed to climb
over the r a i l i n g s .

The s e c t i o n into which I climbed was at le a s t h a lf empty and, as a r e s u l t ,
people were able to lay th e inju red down.

F i n a l l y , I climbed over the large r a i l i n g stopping people g e ttin g onto the
p i t c h , from where I managed to spot my family s t i l l in the ' B' enclosure,
which was beginning to c l e a r , revealing the mass of bodies towards the
fro n t of the enclosure.

Dear Mr Whalley,

                                  H illsborough D isaster


M yself, my wife and our two children were present in Section B of the
Leppings Lane end a t the time of the above d i s a s t e r , and myself and mywife
w ould be w i l l i n g to give o r a l ev idence t o t h e i n q u i r y . For your
information I enclose four statements each independently made on Sunday 16b
April 1989.




Yours sin c e re ly ,




nm i i r . K. i . u. S.
F A Cup Semi Final Hillsborough 15 April 1989



Arrived a t 14.45 pm at Entrance B.

Large crowd m illing around - noisy but not menacing.

No real crowd movement ; nobody appeared to be going in .

Police announced side gates opened.

Crowd walked through a t f a s t pace but not running.

Mo ti c k e ts asked fo r or inspected.

Funnelled through tunnel onto packed t e r r a c e .

My w ife and I managed to get to the pitch                      side of a b a r r ie r but     our two
children (16 and 14) became separated.

Game kicked o f f - massive surging of crowd, much                            discomfort but no           sign of
tro uble only obvious tremendous overcrowding.

Noticed people try in g to climb over b a r r ie r to pitch but police lined up on
pitch and t r i e d to push fans back (v erbally and p h y sic a lly ).

Game then stopped by police due to number of fans on p itc h .

I was s t i l l unaware of seriousness of problem except people were try in g to
push back from fro n t and much shouting.

Fans being hoisted up to te r ra c e above.

Fans then began to disperse more quickly as small door opened onto pitch
(n o t aware of t h i s a t th a t moment although c le a r ly fans were leaving on to
pitch through t h i s opening).

Approximately now 15.15 pm.

H orror o f incident now emerging - a mass grave was appearing some 2 metres
in f r o n t.

People dying in fro n t of us - ashen white and beginning to turn blue.

Fans giving f i r s t aid - kiss of l i f e , chest thumping.

P o l i c e and f i r s t a i d e r s now g e t t i n g to d e a d /in ju r e d ands t a r t i n g   to
help/move.

Elder son located us and was O.K. and then sawyounger sonclinging to side
r a i l i n g s obviously O.K. but could not get back to usandended up onpitch
from righthand area.
People stunned with d i s b e lie f and began to f i l t e r out through entrance.

There is no doubt in my mind the s itu a tio n was completely out of control
from the time of opening the side g ates.

Problem caused by too many people in too small a space.

No communications.

Police on pitch watching had no idea what was happening and when they
re a lis e d did not appear to know what to do.

Had fro n t b a r r ie r been quickly taken down (ie wire c u tte r s ) then would have
been no d is a s te r .

The so lution however was so so simple :

1        Should NOT have opened gates

2        Should have delayed kick -o ff

3        Should have kept the crowd, both outside and insid e informed of
         the reason fo r the delay and th e re would have been no animosity

Arrived a t 14.45 pm a t Entrance B.

Large crowd m illin g around - noisy but not menacing.

No re a l crowd movement ; nobody appeared to be going 1n.

P o lice announced sid e gates opened.

Crowd walked through a t f a s t pace but not running.

No t i c k e t s asked f o r o r In spected .

Funnelled through tunnel onto packed t e r r a c e .

My w ife and I managed to get to th e p itc h sid e of a b a r r i e r but our two
c h ild re n (16 and 14) became se p a ra te d .

Game k ick ed o f f - massive surging of crowd, much discomfort but no sign of
tr o u b le only obvious tremendous overcrowding.

Noticed people tr y in g t o climb over b a r r i e r to p itc h but p o lic e lin e d up on
p itc h and t r i e d to push fans back (v e rb a lly and p h y s ic a lly ).

Game then stopped by p o lic e due to number o f fans on p itc h .

I was s t i l l unaware o f seriousness o f problem except people were tr y in g to
push back from f r o n t and much shouting.

Fans being h o isted up to te r r a c e above.

Fans then began to d isp e rse more quickly as small door opened onto p itc h
( n o t aware o f t h i s a t th a t moment although c l e a r ly fans were leaving on to
p itc h through t h i s opening).

Approximately now 15.15 pm.

H o rro r o f In cid en t now emerging - a mass grave was appearing some 2 metres
1n f r o n t .

People dying 1n f r o n t of us - ashen white and beginning to tu rn b lue.

Fans giving f i r s t aid - k iss of l i f e , c h e s t thumping.

P o l i c e and f i r s t a l d e r s now g e t t i n g t o d e a d /1 n ju r e d and s t a r t i n g t o
help/move.

Elder son lo cated us and was O.K. and then sawyounger son c lin g in g to sid e
r a i l i n g s obviously O.K. but could not get back to usand ended upon p itc h
from rlghthand a re a .
People stunned with d i s b e l i e f and began to f i l t e r out through en tran ce.

T here i s no doubt in my mind th e s itu a tio n was completely out of control
from th e time of opening th e side g a te s .

Problem caused by too many people in too small a space.

Had f ro n t b a r r i e r been quickly taken down (1e wire c u tt e r s ) then would have

                         • School Teacher

1    Due t o s e v e re t r a f f i c h o ld -u p s a t S to c k p o rt 1n p a r t i c u l a r we
      a rriv e d about t h r e e - q u a r te r o f an hour l a t e r than we had planned.
      Probably many more people were l a t e f o r th e same reason.

2    We made our way t o L epplngs Lane and Gate B, as s t a t e d on th e
      tic k e ts .

3    Two la d s asked 1f we had any s p a r e t i c k e t s as we approached
      L ep plng s Lane end I t s e l f . When we tu r n e d t h e c o r n e r we were
      c o n f ro n te d by a la r g e crowd being held back by p o lic e on horses.
      By now i t was 2.50 pm.

4    Some of th e fans were eager to get 1n f o r th e k ic k -o ff and th e re
      were some challenges to th e p o lic e but nothing se rio u s - wanting to
      know why we w e re n 't being l e t through.     One policeman said 'Y ou're
      not going anywhere, so t h e r e 's no point 1n pushing forward' and
      w h i l e a few stm t r i e d t o g e t th ro u g h most o f t h e crowd was
      standing p a tie n tly back from th e horses across th e road.

5    About 2.55 pm a policeman sa id 'Right lads th e y 'r e opening th e side
     g a te . You can go through th e re * .

6    We went through, but a t t h a t point th e surge from o u tsid e was not
     so g r e a t. I , f o r In sta n c e , was holding our 4 t i c k e t s , expecting to
     g iv e them 1n before going In to th e stadium.            My e ld e r son to ld me
     t o p u t them away 1n case they were snatched and, without being
     j o s t l e d , I had tim e t o s ta n d and put them 1n my younger s o n 's
     ja c k e t pocket and secure 1 t .

7    We t h e n e n t e r e d a d a rk tu n n e l and 1 t was w h ile we were going
     th ro u g h t h e r e t h a t p r e s s u r e from b e h in d , th e n from a l l s i d e s ,
     s t a r te d to build up.

8    I was frig h te n e d but a n tic ip a te d th e crush would ease when we got
      on the t e r r a c e s , but when we got In to th e fre sh a i r , we came up
      ag ain st another block o f people and th e crush was In ten se - swaying
      1n every d ir e c tio n .

9    I clu n g on t o my husband, but we were separated from our sons.      I
      f e l l , but was hauled up and we found ourselves with our bodies to a
      b a r r i e r which was behind us.

10   Meanwhile th e game kicked o f f , and supporters s t m coming 1n, made
     t h e crush even worse.         They could not see what was happening 1n
     f r o n t - only t h a t th e match had s ta r te d and they were caught up at
     once 1n the fu ro re of th e game.

11   We j u s t clung on t o th e b a r r i e r behind 1n d esp eratio n . Some people
     began to climb over th e 'c a g e ' fence and 1t 'look ed' as i f they
     were Invading th e p i tc h , but they were only escaping.
                    c o n tin u e d /..




12   Then th e game was stopped.            The p o lic e came to th e 'c a g e ' r a i l i n g s
     as they would to suppress a r i o t i n g crowd - in a s t r a i g h t lin e
     y e l l i n g t o ev eryo ne t o g e t back b u t we co u ld n o t as b a r r i e r s
     p a r a l l e l t o th e p itc h prevented i t .    Some supporters were dragged
     up to th e se atin g area above, so as to leave more room below in our
     area.

13   Then th e p o lic e opened th e narrow gate through on to th e p itch -
     only one gate - 3 f t wide atmost.

14   G radually the crush in f ro n t of us began to th in to reveal many
     dead and dying people - many on top of each other up to about 5 ft
     back from the 'c ag e' r a i l i n g s and some furtherback j u s t in f r o n t of
     us.

15   My e ld e r son found h is way back to us but had l o s t                   our younger
     son, and was panic s tr ic k e n .

16   My husband was j u s t going fo rw ard t o s e a rc h f o r him among th e
     people on th e ground, when            sp o tted him climbing th e 'c ag e'
     fence and y e lle d t o him to get over on to th e p itc h .

17   We saw him do so and knew he would be s a fe .

18   T here were many people lying on th e te r r a c e s 1n f ro n t            of us- many
     a purplish blue colour and obviously dead or dying.

19   Friends were tr y in g to rev iv e some people but th e re was very l i t t l e
     room to s t r e t c h people o u t.

20   We t r i e d t o comfort two lads who had 'come round' without help but
     were Inju red and very shocked.

21   A f t e r what seemed a long while th e p o lic e came through and began
     c h e c k in g the people on the ground on th e t e r r a c e s , but 1t was too
     l a t e f o r many.

22   Ambulances s t a r te d to a r riv e a c tu a lly on th e p itc h , by which time
     many o f the victim s were on th e p itch receiv in g help.

23   We l e f t as soon as we c o u ld f i n d a way o u t , t o                 r e l i e v e th e
     congestion.

   I fe e l t h i s was an avoidable accid en t.


   1        A llocation of t i c k e t s Inadequate

   2        Liverpool fans housed in sm allest se c tio n of stadium

             Fans could not move across to le s s cramped te r r a c e s due to b a r r ie r s
             a t r i g h t a n g le s t o p i t c h p r e v e n tin g easy a c c e s s . Had we gone
             through the t u r n s t i l e s however, we would not a l l have been
             channelled in to th a t c e n tra l se ctio n but more would have gone to
             th e le s s congested a re a s.
             No organised and audible communication with crowd o u tsid e wanting
             t o g e t In to see th e k ic k -o ff. They were j u s t being y e lle d a t to
             s ta y back by mounted p o lic e .

   I asked a policeman i f k ic k -o ff had been delayed as i t seemed a se n sib le
   I d e a . He s a id not as y e t .       One policeman sa id th e larg e crowd o u tsid e was
   t h e f a n s ' f a u l t f o r coming l a t e : unavoidable 1n some cases as explained :
   but f a u l t was simply too many people who were I n e f f i c i e n t l y c o n tro lle d .

   Some o f th e crowd were g e ttin g anxious to get 1n but 1f they had been
   properly Informed o f the overcrowding already on th e t e r r a c e s , th e m ajority
   would have waited e s p e c ia lly 1f k ic k -o ff had been delayed, and gone through
   t h e t u r n s t i l e s and been channelled In to t h e i r a llo c a te d a re a s. I query
   w h eth er communication was adequate with po lice Inside and o u tsid e th e
   ground sin c e th e r e was already a bad crush Insid e before the gate was
   opened as was evidenced when we were f i n a l l y allowed 1n.

   As 1 t was th e p olice crowd control went from f i r s t l y holding everyone back
   t o q u i t e suddenly opening t h a t large sid e gate to allow a l l and sundry 1n.
   No t i c k e t s were checked.      Who can blame n o n -tic k e t holders f o r going 1n -
   1 f any did?        I t was a p e rfe c t o pportunity. O f f ic ia ls had no Idea of the
   actual numbers on th e te r ra c e s - as a r e s u l t .

   Equally, 1t seemed th e po lice were slow to r e a c t to prevent even more
   coming through from o u tsid e , when the re a l d i s a s t e r was under way.


   In a d d itio n , communication of events 1n th e stadium were poor.            At one
   pont opposing fans were je e rin g th e Liverpool supporters on the pitch -
   unaware o f th e problem - they thought 1t was a p itc h Invasion - th ere
   should be a natio n al /I n te rn a tio n a l warning 's i r e n ' when a 1<ffl

   elsewhere.
                   (Aged 16)


There was a huge crowd o u tsid e th e Lepplngs Lane entrance a t 2.55 pm.                      The
p o l i c e had formed a wall o f two horses 1n f r o n t o f the g a te s , preventing
th e e n try of a rriv in g fans to the already congested t u r n s t i l e s .                 The
p o lic e assured us t h a t th e re was nobody a c tu a lly g e ttin g In to th e ground a t
t h i s end.        The horses moved ap art c re a tin g a gap and we were In s tru c te d to
move to a sid e gate which had been opened to allow fans In to the ground.
M y s e lf and t h r e e o t h e r members o f my f a m ily p assed 1n th e d i r e c t i o n
I n s t r u c t e d and passed through th e g a te s .       There were no groundsmen around
and a l l f o u r of us passed through without our t i c k e t s being taken.                    We
passed through a tunnel which o v e rsp ille d In to th e Lepplngs Lane se ctio n
 ' B1 segm ent.          We were packed 1n lik e sa rd in e s .       I l o s t both my parents
and g rim ly held on to my younger broth er who was fin d in g 1t very d i f f i c u l t
to b reathe in the cru sh .         Nobody watched th e game. We were more concerned
a b o u t keepin g our f e e t firm ly fix ed on th e ground.              A g i r l was g e ttin g
badly crushed and I helped pass her above th e heads of fans towards the
narrow gate which had been opened by th e p o lic e .                     By now people were
s t r u g g l i n g to climb over th e r a i l i n g s and g et onto the p itc h .     The police
were t e l l i n g us to move back but we c o u ld n 't, because people were stm
coming 1n from behind.             People were f a l l i n g down a ll over the p lace, many
were trodden on.             People were being passed to th e people 1n the se atin g
area above and behind and slowly space was forming 1n f ro n t of us.                        By now
my b ro th er had disappeared and I considered searching through th e blue
corpses which were p ile d th re e persons high 1n f r o n t of me.                 I sp o tted him
on t h e r a i l i n g , climbing over onto the p itc h a f t e r he had climbed out of
s e c tio n ' B' In to th e le s s densely packed area to th e r ig h t of th e goal.
Fans were weeping everywhere and we a l l comforted each o th e r.                     I found my
p aren ts and esco rted them out of th e ground v ia th e tunnel through which we
e n t e r e d . My brother made h is way o f f th e p itc h and we eventually met him
o u tsid e th e ground.

Outside th e ground th e r e was a g re a t deal of congestion but nothing s l n s t e r
as everybody could simply move back onto th e road. The p o lic e on horses
c r e a t e d a lin e separating those going f o r th e t u r n s t i l e s and those coming
la te .       People were asking f o r the K.O. to be delayed as they w e re n 't going
t o g e t 1n on tim e.      Suddenly th e lin e of mounted police s p l i t and one of
th e policemen said "Go to the r i g h t , a gate has been opened".

As we channelled through th e g a te , th e re w asn 't any congestion u n til we
a c t u a l l y got Into se ctio n 'B '. Once 1n th e se ctio n I j u s t c o u ld n d 't move
an d , as people were stm coming 1n from behind th e re was no way back.
With th e constant supply of people I was g rad u ally c a r rie d towards the
f r o n t of th e section and, lu c k ily , to th e sid e where I managed to climb
over th e r a i l i n g s .

The s e c t i o n Into which I climbed was a t l e a s t h a lf empty and, as a r e s u l t ,
people were able to lay th e Inju red down.

F i n a l l y , I climbed over the large r a i l i n g stopping people g e ttin g onto the
p i t c h , from where I managed to spot my fam ily s t m 1n th e ' B' en clo su re,
which was beginning to c le a r , rev ealin g th e mass of bodies towards the
f r o n t of th e enclosure.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - EVIDENCE

     Whilst not wishing to block your telephone "evidence" lines
by providing duplicate information, we thought that we should
write to record what my husband and I witnessed on 15th April and
that if you wanted further information from us, you could
telephone us during the day on                 or drop us a line
asking us to telephone you.

      We sat towards the mid.dlg_of_the North stand, four rows.
back.   Almost immediately that tne matcn naa started, we Knew
that something was happening at  the West end of the ground, due
to a growing presence of police. We were not surprised whe n the
game was stopped.

     Fans poured onto the pitch; no one knew what was happening;
loudspeakers could not be heard above the crowd's roar. We saw
the entire football pitch fill up with fans and policemen.
Having read the accounts etc., we would believe that policemen
and fans near the crush were more than helpful, but in the middle
of the pitch   (all that we could see) there were hundreds of
people,  both policemen , some 200-300 we would guess, and fans,
some 500 or so, milling around.  Policemen attempting to round up
fans obstructed both ambulancesand "stretcher" bearing   parties.
Noone could hear the requests from ground staff over the loud
speakers to get off the pitch,       at least, not until Kenny
Dalglish made an appeal to the crowd.    Even then, when the fans
began to take notice and policemen joined hands in a circle in an
almost half hearted way to round them up the pitch was still full
of people.   If only the crowd had been told how serious the
situation was, we have thought occasionally, they might well have
behaved in a more helpful way and that in turn could perhaps have
helped the injured and dying to get out more quckly        All we
knew was that something dreadful was happening,      rumours were
spread to the effect that perhaps eight or nine people had died,
but I don't know how many people even believed that.

             STATEMENT CONCERNING THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
                     ON SATURDAY 15TH APRIL, 1989.



We set of for Hillsborough at approximately     10.20<Bn, and arrived

at the Sportraan Pub in    Sheffield   at around 1 pm.   We left the

pub at 2 pm having drank two pints.     There vere eight of us in a Montego

Estate car, and we found parking space at about 2.20 pm which was

a ten minute walk from the ground.     We reached the ground at

approximately 2.30 pm; as we walked down we could see it was bedlam

down there.



It was obvious there was no organisation, no queueing, which we found

hard to believe for a crowd like this.     There was just a mass of

people.    We encounted very few police on the way to the ground.       To

our knowledge there was no trouble, and we had noticed very few with

cans in hand going towards the turnstile.



On reaching the ground it was obviously everyone for themselves, it

was ridiculous; you could hardly move, arms were trapped in whatever

position you stood.     On going through the turnstile at approximately

 2.40 pm, I said to the fellow collecting tickets that the situation

outside was ridiculous, and if they didn't do something people would

be killed.    I admit I swore at him, so he called for a policeman

to arrest me.    A copper came but told him to behave, and sent me

through.     I would mention here that only some of us were asked to

show tickets, the rest kept theirs intact.



Having got inside three of us met, so we waited for two others who

were also in the ground with us, (three others were in the side stand).

I turned round and saw a policeman open a side gate at approximately

2.40 pm, so we decided to move quickly, as you could see a rush was
imminent.



We started walking towards the tunnel, as it was the only way we

could see, apart from stairs leading to the stand, so we decided to

see if we could get in there.    There were only two stewards and one

policeman who didn't seem interested, and we just walked past and

up into the stand.     Having squeezed onto seats with other people,

one person turned round and said the middle of the ground looked

overcrowded.     The teams were just coming out onto the pitch as we

got to our place.     At that time there was a sudden surge down

below.    From our position approximately eight rows back in the

stand, we could only see the front of the ground section by the

perimeter fencing, slightly left of the goal.     We then saw people

 climbing up on the front fence and lads were pulling people up

 into the stand.    Some of the people climbing on the fence seemed

 to be getting pushed or told to get back by the policemen at the

 front.     Slowly though, some were getting over and pleading with

 police to do something to help.     At least one policeman was seen

 to shrug his shoulders.     Eventually though, a policeman ran to

 the referee to explain and to stop the game.     It was obvious then

 that something serious had happened and still the police were

 slow to move in, seeming more concerned about encroachment onto

 the pitch than what was wrong in the terracing.



  At one stage about one hundred police walked infront of the big

  main stand where nothing was happening.    There was still nothing

  on the tannoy to explain the situation and the Nottingham Forest

  fans were getting agitated, believing it was hooliganism.     The

  net behind the Leppings Lane end was pulled down by Liverpool
                                 -   3   -




fans to make more room.    This angered the Forest fans who started

chanting and yelling, not realising what was happening.             It wasn't

until bodies were taken towards their end that they relised what

had happened.     The police had now moved into the centre of the

pitch and made a line across.        In the meantime the Liverpool fans

had ripped down the advertising boards to use as stretchers while

the police on the halfwayline stood around watching, only moving

when the stretchers were going past.            The first time the tannoy

was heard was approximately 3-50 pm when Kenny Dalglish asked

for the cooperation of the fans.             Immediately the now congested

pitch began to start clearing except for those helping with the

 injured.     In the meantime the flow of fans coming over the fence

 continued.     Ambulances were now coming        onto the pitch.    You could

 obviously see people getting revived and jumpers being put over

 other peoples faces.



 At about 4.15 pm it came over the tannoy that the match had been

 abandoned.     We were concerned about the two mates who had been

 separated from us when we got into the ground.            We saw one of them

 with another mate who had been in the side stand on the pitch, and

  the other one came up to us in the stand.            After the game was

  abandoned we took our time to leave the ground.            As we walked down

  we met the other two down below and we were relieved everybody was

  alright, but later finding out that people we knew had died.



  We do not blame     the policeman who gave the order to open the

  gates because it was probably the right thing to do as there may

  have been injuries or deaths outside, but it was the way it wasn't

  organised outside and inside once the gates had been opened.
We make the following points




1.    Organisation outside - no proper queues or gates stopping

      people getting near the turnstiles.

2.    Organisation inside — no policing or stewarding to give

      instruction to people as to what direction it was safest

      to enter the terracing.

3-   Slow police reaction to what was    happening.

4.   The manning of the police on the    halfwayline and by the side

      stand was alot more than by where the tragedy happened.

5.   The Football Associations decision as to the choice of

      ground and the inadequate ticket   allocations left alot

      to be desired.

  Home Secretary
  House of Commons

  LONDON




  Dear Mi?: Hurd


  Unlike many of those who died at Hillsborough, I have been fortunate to watch football

  for the past 45 years or so, and feel it my duty to write this letter giving you my

 views of what happened at the Semi-Final.




 I had been to last year's Matoh, and having then witnessed the crushing outside the

 Ground at Leppings Lane, arrived earlier this year at 2.15p.m.       We had no problem in

 getting in, but I was surprised to find the Police presence in the immediate vicinity

 of the Turnstiles sparse in relation to 1988.




 We took our seats at 2.30p.m. directly above the Loppings Lane Goal, and therefore,

 had an uninterrupted vie. of the unfortunate events which followed.            My immediate

 reaction half-an-hour before the kick-off was of the grossly over-packed centre section

- o f the Leppings Lane terracing.   In complete contrast, the wing sections had huge

 unpopulated gaps which over the next twenty minutes or so, slowly began to fill up.

 The situation in the centre section however, got steadily worse, and fifteen minutes

before kick-off time, waves of supporters were being pushed down the terracing.            Not

once during the half-hour before the kick-off was there an announcement over the

loudspeaker to ask spectators not to push or to keep away from the centre section.             No

attempt appeared to have been made by Police or Stewards in front of this section to

get people out and transfer them to the sparsely populated wing sections.            I contrasted

this to the Situation at Anfield just over a fortnight ago when at the Evening Match
    gainst Derby County, late arrivals caused a crust in th* i "
                                              a crust, in the lower section of the 'Kop'

  >•Immediately this happened,   the Police and Stewards were'on hand to shepherd people away

   and.announcements were regularly made over the Public Address System for spectators

   to move away from the section under pressure.




   In the period leading up to the kick-off, „ore and more people appeared to be coming

   into the centre section which, as mentioned before, was grossly over-populated half an

  hour before the Match was due to begin.




  I understand that a Gate at the Leppings Lane End. was opened to let spectators in

  following the dreadful crush outside.        This therefore, had the effect of compounding

  what was already an appalling situation.




  X have seen the Sheffield Wednesday Secretary on t»i              • •
                                      ay secretary on television referring to his computer

  telling him    that the Leppings Lane End was under capacity.           How can anyone, possibly


 ^ l y °n ‘ COmPUt6r          *"      —     stances,      only way to marshal the c ™ d s
 was to get outside and observe ann     ,,   u •
                        observe, and it was obvious to anyone with even the slightest

 wit, that marshalling of the spectators was sadly lacking.




 If. as reported, the Police allowed the Gate to be opened, why were„.t the spectators

 directed to    the wing sections? Some of the Police appeared            to have walkie-talkies.

 Did they not   co-ordinate their actions with their colleagues inside the ground who were

 Observing the mayhem in the half-hour leading up to kick-off time.              Surely, Pans should

.have been prevented from entering the central section by a line of Policemen,              or Stewards

being deployed across the tunnel entrance.




I would now like to comment on the Leppings Lane End of the ground.               Whilst, this is

normally adequate for League games,     when Home Supporters can gain access to the North

Stand from the Pennistone Koad end     also,   x would   suggest that for a Semi-Pina! where one

o f the Team's Supporters takes the    North Stsnrf        4   -h   7
                                                    »d the Leppmgs Lane accommodation,              the
arrangement is totally unsatisfactory      -n,
                          satisfactory.    The approach leading to this section of the ground
  •s on the bend of a road, extremely narrow, and   it is like asking all the Main Stand

 and .'Itop. Supporters at Anfield to make their way through the Shankley Gates and then

 to he faced by a brick wall across the main Car Park.




 I would now like to turn to another section of the ground,' which on normal match days,

 because of access from both ends of the ground, is perfectly acceptable, but which on

 Semi-Final days gives many Spectators extreme cause for concern.    This is the landing

 behind the North Stand.    Last year, I was at the 'Hop- end of this Stand, and after the

 match, made my way with my son and nephew out of the ground using this landing.     It

 was one of the most frightening experiences of my life, and there were times when I felt

 that I was being carried by the crowd without my feet touching the ground.   There were

many Spectators who showed how terrified they were.    This year, ! had decided that I

would make my way out of the Stand at ground level, come what may, but after watching

the dreadful scenes for thirty minutes, and knowing full well that I was unable to

help, we left the ground in complete safety, but in utter dismay and quickly reunited

      y son who, in that dreadful central section, had been one of the lucky ones.




In addition to following Liverpool Football Club for the past 16 years, I lived in

Sheffield for 3X years, during which time, I regularly visited both the Brammall Lane

and Hillsborough Grounds.    I feel therefore, that I am able to contribute with a

knowledge of both Anfield and Hillsborough, and conclude by expressing my utter

amazement at the apparent lack of satisfactory marshalling in the Leppings Lane area

inside and outside the ground.


Yours sincerely

 MY VIEW OF WHAT HAPPENED-BY A LUCKY RED


 After waiting eagerly all week for my season ticket serial number
 to      be announced,        it finally got chosen on the 12th.        Why did     a
 season        ticket holder have to wait to get a ticket for a crucial
 match?        This is so because there is so many season ticket holders
 at      Anfield- even        more than the Nottingham Forest       average     home
 attendance. This is' why Liverpool should have received the larger
-end of the ground.
 Saturday         morning arrived and I queued up in Lime Street           Station
 along' with two of my mates.             I left on the first train,which left
 at 11:15am.
 On arriving at the station in Sheffield at approx 2pm,we got                    off
 the         train    and   received     a police    escort   straight    to     the
 ground.         This, gave the fans no time to have a drink in the             pubs
 that were open.
         reached     the ground at about 2:20pm and the number of            people
 there was just like an average match day at Anfield at                that time.
 Once        we reached the gates I said goodbye to one of my mates              who
 had       a ticket       for the Lepping Lane seats.       My mate and    I then
 proceded         to look for our appropriate turnstile which was            B.   We
                 the turnstile with ease and waited in an orderly            queue.
        this      point    we   noticed    that  the   police were       searching
 everyone,this was just before you went throUqh the turnstile.                    We
 qot      searched briefly and this was the first point where we were
 approached by any sort of official person.
 Once       through     the turnstile we came to a large area before             the
 tunnels         to the terracing where there were programme sellers.             We
 bought        a   programme and looking round we could see no official
 person          directing      us    to   any   particular     place     on     the
 terraces.         Therefore we decided to go down the tunnel leading             to
 directly          behind the      goal.   The time at this    point   was    about
 2:30pm.
 The terracing was already tightly packed but we struggled through
 the crowd to reach about halfway down. Once we reached this point
 my     friend suggested that we should go back and go onto the wing
 section of the terrace because here was too packed. After a short
 discussion         I agreed(THIS DECISION PROBABLY SAVED US FROM             BEING
 INVOLVED IN THE ACTUAL CRUSH)
 We     again      struggled through the crowd and        finally reached        the
 t u n n e l ,we    then walked round and stood on the right side of             the
 Lepping          Lane   terrace,underneath      the scoreboard      and     police
 box.       This    section     of the ground was not packed at       all    so we
 picked are vantaqe point in front of a barrier(AFTER THE CRUSHING
 HERE IN THE SAME MATCH LAST SEASON WE THOUGHT THIS BEST).The time
 now was approaching 2:40.




                                          1
    S  the     kick off time qot closer the winq sections qot more                     and
  more    packed,and it was soon shoulder to shoulder when the                     teams
  came    out.     About 1 minute before the kick off there was the ONLY
   annoy     announcement telling people directly behind the                   goal     to
  move    back     because      there were people qettinq       crushed         at     the
  tront.     The     other    tanrioy announcements were after most             of     the
  traqically dead and injured were on the pitch and it was too late
. to do anything about it.
  The   long awaited match finally kicked off and everyone who                         was
  not   involved       in    the   crush  did   not   have   a clue          what was
  happening.       Before     the game was 2 minutes old people            then      were
  spilling      over the fence and onto the pitch.          I like many            other
  people    thought       that it was a usual over spill(which happens                  at
  most of the big games at Anfield).There were soon a lot of people
  on   the pitch in distress and after a lot of persuasion the                      game
  was stopped and the puzzled players were led off the pitch.
  At this point the police made the mistake of telling the crowd to
 move back(They couldn,t because people were still coming into the
 ground     unaware of what was happening inside the             g r o u n d ).Instead
 the    police      should     have opened the emergency      gate       immediately
 which     they     didn't     until they saw the seriousness of            what      was
 going on.
 At this point,lOminutes after the kick off,people had started                          to
 come    into     the section I was in and they were          showing         everyone
 their     FULL UNCHECKED,TICKETS,they also told us that IT WAS CHAOS
 OUTSIDE      AND THE POLICE JUST OPENED THE BATE AND LET EVERYONE                      IN
 WITHOUT CHECKING THE TICKETS OR EVEN IF THEY HAD ANY TICKETS.
 The    seriousness of what, was taking place was soon clear for                      all
 to see.      Once I saw the scenes n the pitch I seemed to have lost
 track of the time.
 There     seemed to be        ten times more       fans on    the       pitch than
 emergency       services and they all seemed to be doing more for                    the
 fans in distress than the people who are qualified to                    help.       But
 we were       all grateful for the extra police and ambulancemen                     and
 women     that     were    later brought in     because they       were qreatly
 needed.
 TJie fans       in the middle section were tryinq to get out                 any     way
 they could,over the spiked fence,onto the stand above and through
 the ONE NARROW EMERGENCY GATE.
 A®   this was going on I noticed then how the press                photographers
 were    acting.        I WAS DISGUSTED at the way they acted.          They        were
 running       around      like   SAVAGES   AND   ANIMALS   and     taking          sick
 photographs       of    the dead and injured.(When        I got     home       I kept
 thinking      how      could they stand there taking sick         pictures when
 they could have been helping the people in distress).
 This    went     on   for    what seemed an age     but   when     the      crushing
 eventually s t o p p e d ,although there were still people trying to get
 revived or treated for injuries on the pitch. KENNY DALGLISH then
 made    an announcement over the tannoy and this seemed to brinq                        a
 bit of order to the ground.
                                      2

 Police      then    attempted to move the people off the pitch        but to
 everyones       amazement     they continued to put them    back   into the
 terrace(the        fence was now wrecked including part where the wire
 mesh      had   been ripped off so that people could escape        a little
 easier).The        stands on the side were now half empty and it would
 have      been easier and quicker to move the fans still on the pitch
 into this area!
When       we then     heard the tannoy announcing     that    the game was
officially        abandoned(which      we knew would be)we left the     ground
and      met    up with our relieved mate and attempted to look         for  a
p h o n e ,although people were being turned away from many houses and
shops (riot everyones case). We eventually got to use a phone from
a very sympathetic QUEENSWAY store.
We     then     made our way back to the train station.        We got on the
train       and   we set off home at approx 5:20.By then we had heard
that       about   25   people had tragically died.      The    train   had a
sickened atmosphere although some people were trying to brighten
up are sad feelings in the usual scouse way
As     the train was travelling through Manchester we noticed             that
some       sick   minded    people had sprayed on a wall       SCOUSERS DIED
TODAY-HILLSB0R0UGH 89.           A little further towards Victoria station
the      train    was   under    a barrage of bricks from    about    5 or 6
hooligans. The train was now in a worse atmosphere.
When the train pulled into Lime Street,the people on it includinq
myself ,still only aware of there being approx 25 deaths,we were
shocked       and devastated upon hearing the correct number of deaths
94 by our relieved relatives.
Since       that   day   I ^have not attempted to look      at   any of the
sickening        pictures' ^ “^papers ,although I now realise      how
valuable        the live TV pictures where to families like my own to
waiting for any news concerning their loved ones.
Many       arguments    will arise from the Hillsborough tragedy and         I
have       included a brief conclusion to the problems of the day and
how they could have been avoided.

                                             19th April,   1989
Dear Sir,

      May I humbly venture to speak for the many survivors of
Saturday's tragic events at Hillsborough whose views will never be
sought by tribunals but who were not only within the immediate
vicinity of events at the Leppings Lane end but who, but for the
grace of God, would have been unable to speak of the afternoon's
happenings.

      On my return to Cheshire I was tempted to put my thoughts down
on paper in a letter which has been reported in the Chester
Chronicle. I expressed at that time a delight at the sensitive
manner in which events had been covered in the press but also a fear
that, when the tears had been staunched and conclusions were drawn
concerning   the   causes   and    solutions  of    such   tragedies,
sensationalism would rear its ugly head. I was right. After just
three days, comments are being made concerning the conduct ot
Liverpool supporters which are no less insensitive and malicious
than those of that foolish Frenchman, M. Jacques Georges.

       On behalf of the many supporters who do not consume barrels of
 ale before they make their way to the ground, who do not turn into
 animals the moment they pass through a turnstile and who do applaud
 the opposing side when the occasion demands, may I describe coolly
 and with detachment, the events as I saw them.

       I am a primary school headteacher living in Cheshire and,
 together with my twenty-four year old son, left home at 11-00 am to
 make the journey to Sheffield. Due to congestion of traffic on the
 outskirts of Manchester, we did not reach the ground until a quarter
 to three by which time conditions at the turnstiles were quite
 incredible. I think at this point I must emphasise the fact that I
 had never been to Hillsborough before and would have expected both
 assistance in locating the correct entrance and some guarantee for
 this    stranger that, once inside, my path would lead to a safe
 vantage point.

        That neither of these was offered me I do not attribute to any
  single agency. But there are many observations I can make. Firstly,
  unlike Anfield where turnstiles are in pairs and spread at intervals
around the perimeter of the ground, at Sheffield they are in
clusters within railed off forecourts. Thus, while pairs oi mounted
policeman at Anfield can marshal twenty yard queues through the
entrance in a matter of minutes, the Sheffield turnstiles could have
operated until 4-00 pm and would still not have moved the milling
crowd which was gathering. The resulting despair on the part of
supporters at the possibility of not seeing the start of play and
the arrival of still more - yes, tardy - newcomers caused a
situation which a handful of constables on foot could never have
hoped to cope with. No wonder a senior officer feels justified in
defending his undoubtedly incorrect decision to open the exit gate.
The crisis was already in the making.

      Nor, for the stranger arriving at the ground, were the
entrances logically labelled. Most grounds label their turnstiles
alphabetically; not so Hillsborough. Anyone carrying a 'B' ticket
might have expected the 'B' turnstile   to be somewhere between 'A'
and 'C'. Not here. Amid a noisy throng, my son and I gathered in
what we thought was the right    vicinity until we saw a string of
cursing supporters turned away from the turnstiles because they had
the wrong tickets.     <1 wonder whether these were amongst those
mistakenly     reported as 'not having a ticket'?) On asking a
policeman, we were directed to the 'B' turnstiles which were outside
the railings and around a blind corner. It was here that we found
the gate open. By this time it was almost ten minutes to three.

      May I say here that the supporters making their way into that
very dimly lit passageway under the stands - no stewards were their
to advise otherwise - were not drunk, not aggressive, not 'crazed'
as one tabloid has suggested. Some were singing their partisan
chants - after all they were there to support their team. But I saw
no instances of unruly behaviour, no bad-tempered melee. Indeed,
probably a mite dramatically, I have since likened them to the
staunch-hearted Hebrews marching to the gas-chambers. Certainly
their faith that, once through the tunnel, they would be provided
with a safe vantage point from which to watch one of the sporting
spectacles of the year was grossly misplaced. All they entered was a
death-trap.

      Whatever possesses stadium architects to place at intervals
along a terrace those treacherous front-to-back partitions mystifies
me. Common logic indicates that they will prevent the sideways
movement which would naturally level out sudden local pressures of
just the sort which occurred on Saturday.      Indeed the perimeter
fencing which has become such a villain of the peace in everyone's
eyes might have been irrelevant if these rails had not existed. But
the fact was that, once in that central compartment behind the
Liverpool goal and there was no escape.
*




      My son and I, as it happened, were amongst the lucky ones.
Why? Because we were not amongst the early arrivals who were crushed
at the front of the terrace; because we were not among the later
arrivals some of whom, I understand, died in the tunnel; because I,
though approaching 60 years of age, am sixteen stone and therefore
able to look after myself; and because my son is agile and healthy
and was able to make     his way across to the railing and, after
assisting many to escape, clamber over the fence and on to the
pitch. It was fifty minutes before we confirmed each other's safety
- a period of time I shall never forget.

      Meanwhile, others were suffering untold pain and unjury amid
scenes of, yes, increasing anger. When individual Sheffield police
constables talk of the insults they received from Liverpool
supporters - and I was moved both to compliment one such brave
fellow for his endeavours and curse several others for their
stupidity - perhaps they should remember that, when people,    caged Cn
terraces,   KNOW that deaths are taking place and DEMAND action to
relieve the pressure, they are not impressed by a policeman climbing
on the fencing and pleading weakly with spectators to "move back".
Movement is not possible when you have three thousand people
pressing on you from behind.

       It was, though the passage of time when one is in such
circumstances is difficult to judge, some fifteen to twenty minutes
before the crowd's demands for the perimeter fencing to be
                                        acrieo.      '
dismantled were   answered with positiveA By this time deaths had
already occurred. No wonder they crowd near me responded with the
observation that it^ was 'a bit bloody late'. Perhaps I am biassed
but I honestly believe that Liverpool Police would have responded
with a little more promptness and a little more understanding of the
situation. Certainly the impression was there that the police -
perhaps their previous experience justified the attitude - regarded
football supporters with very little affinity. This was the view
that my own son formed when, having struggled to escape from the
terrace and stumble on to the pitch, he was pushed to the ground by
a constable. He holds no grudge; but it did not seem accidental and
it left a very lasting impression.

      One final comment concerns the noise level of the crowd and
the total ineffectiveness of the public address system. Time means
nothing when you have a young boy dying of suffocation near you and
your only intent is to survive.      But you do      retain certain
impressions and the noise level is one. I was just four metres from
the perimeter fence yet I could not hec<r the policeman frantically
yelling at the crowd. Communications required something more than
the human voice. However,    even when the pressure was off, the
public address system pleading with those behind the Leppings Lane
goal, I understand, to emptytheterrace could notbe understood.
How strange then that when the     normallyincomprehensible   Kenny
Dalglish spoke to the crowd one could hear every syllable. Someone,
somewhere could take a few lessons in crowd psychology and control.
Why not empiy a primary headteacher. I am taking early retirement I
could have done the job with tact and sympathy.

      Finally - and those who do not care for Liverpool supporters
or indeed football supporters of any colour,    please note - it was
the fans who opened up the pgjrimeter fence; it was the fans who
stretchered the dying away on advertisement boards; it was the fans
who, with modest first aid skills, sought to bring succour to the
injured. In spite of what our       critics may say,    I saw public
conscience respond to crisis on Saturday to a degree which prompts
me to believe that all is not lost in our society.

Dear Sir,

I am writing to you regarding the disaster at Sheffield's Hillnborough atadium
which I witnessed yesterday.

After arriving at the ground at approximately 2,20 p.m. we walked down towards
the North Stand entrance. As we approached this entrance it soon became apparent
 uh.it there was a large amount of people all trying to gain entrance to different
parts o 1 the ground through one main gate. There was no organised queue for any
one of the turnstiles. The only way to gain entrance was to join the back of the
group of fans and to wait until people in front of you managed to get through into
ground. Inevitably, there was considerable crushing at this point with the
organisation and policing of the turnstiles nowhere near as good as last year when
we were all able to get in comfortably and safely. As we finally reached the
turnstile, I was pushed into the polLee officer manning thisi particular turnstile,
 it this point, he turned to his colleague at the next gate and asked if he knew
where the Sergeant was. It was as if the police on the gates already knew that
all was not as it should have been. Another problem seemed to be that actually
getting through the turnstiles seemed to Lake longer than usual which had the
eiiect of increasing the number of people waiting to get in.

On taking our seats in the North Stand,    I glanced over towards the Leppings Lane
end where the Liverpool supporters were    gathering. It was immediately apparent
that the centre section behind the goal,   was extremely full whereas the two ends
of the enclosure, at either side of tlv    goal, seemed to be comparatively empty.   *—
In fact> 1 can remember pointing out to    the people I was with how empty the sides
seemed.

At 3.00 p.m. the game started. Some five minutes into the game, the play was in
the Liverpool half ot the pitch and we could see supporters beginning to spill out
of the terracing. At first we thought ft was the type of spillage which often
happens at big football matches. Soon though, supporters started running onto the
pitch to tell -he plavers what was happening and that was when a police officer
ran onto the pitch     ask the referee +o take the players off. Even then, we all
thought that if wou'd be a temporary stoppage. Indeed, certain sections of the"
Nottingham Forest supporters began singing and chanting, not realising what was
happening. It seemed to take a long ti.>ne before supporters were able to escape
from the affected urt:as. This, in retrospect, would seem to be due to the slow
opening of^the gates in front of the enclosure and the apparent lack of understanding
of the situation by the authorities.
After five to ten minutes, about thirty to forty noli.ce reinforcements arrived
and inexplicably took up positions in front of the North Stand. Even after a
day has passed since tnis tragedy I, and many other supporters who were in the
North Stand, am unable to understand the reason behind this positioning. Behind
them, Liverpool supporters were ripping up the advertising hoardings to use as
Btretchers to carry out the dead and injured Liverpool supporters. Still the
police stood there not helping. People- around me in the stand were screaming at
the police to help and yet they would not.

Another   apparent problem during this time was the lack of public announcements
to tell   the crowd what was happening, “.‘his could so easily have caused more
trouble   as fans became more and more impatient. In fact, it is to the credit
of both   sets of supporters that there was no trouble at all.

It will probably be a while before the cause of this tragedy is known, but one
suggestion that must be thought of is a re-think of the way the fans were "penned
in" and the way that the so-called "security" fence could not be removed therefore
trapping people and inevitably killing them.

In closing this letter I would just like to thank the people, shops and businesses
of Sheffield for allowing supporters such as myself to une their telephones to let
our loved ones back home know we were safe.

I cannot comment on the opening of the exit gate which apparently contributed to
this disaster as I did not personally uee the incident. All the events I have
recounted in this letter are incidents i personally witnessed.

Nothir.g like this mu-.5t ever be allowed to happen again. In this country it always
aeemt. -that we on..y ever iearn fro.n disasters. The enquiry must be used to establi
what went wrong and why, and any recommendations must be implemented immediately.

I hope that this letter may in some way be used to help piece together the events
of that terrible day.

Yours sincerely,
                                                                                                    MIR.15

Dear Sir,

I am writing this letter as I feel I owe it to all those fans
who died or who were injured in such tragic circumstances at
Sheffield Wednesday's ground on April 15th.

Firstly I would like to relate to you my experiences at the same
ground last year in the semi-final between Liverpool and
Nottingham Forest.   My 11 year old son, his friend and his
father and myself obtained tickets for the Leppings Lane part of
the ground.  To get into this part of the ground, after passing
through the turnstiles, we had to pass through a narrow tunnel
beneath the West Gate stand.   There were many, many fans heading
for this tunnel and it became very congested many yards before
entering the tunnel.   There were no police officers or stewards
to control and marshal the fans through this tunnel and once in
the tunnel the congestion obviously greatly increased.

Now although the tunnel is relatively short it took some time to
actually get through it.   Inside the tunnel there was jostling
and pushing and many people were stumbling.   My son during this
time was being severely crushed and had difficulty in
breathing.  I'm 6ft 2" and weigh 16 stone and had extreme
difficulty in pushing people away from him but fortunately I
managed to hold on to him.

Eventually we moved out of the tunnel but if anything the
situation became worse and the pressure of the crowd behind
became worse, causing many fans to stumble and fall down the
steps only to disappear under the crowd.  Even once through
the tunnel it was impossible to move sideways as the
momentum of the crowd continued to push us forward.  We were
forced to duck under metal barriers or suffer even more
crushing.  Finally we were forced right up against the
barriers which prevent the fans from getting on to the
pitch.  During the match we had to constantly bear the
crushing force of the crowd swaying forward from behind.   It
would not have been so bad if we had been able to move
sideways, away from this central part, but it was so packed,
and the constant pushing, jostling and surging of the fans
made this prospect appear even more dangerous.
During the game some fans actually collapsed or fainted and
were passed over peoples heads towards the front of this
section of the ground.  We were by the gate in the barrier
fence just behind the goal and witnessed the following:-


   Some fans tried to open this gate but it had been
   padlocked. Some fans attracted the attention of a
   policeman or steward, I can't remember which, but he
   appeared to be totally unaware of the situation.  As a
   result these fans became extremely agitated and tried to
   force the gate open but eventually an official obtained a
   key, the padlock was opened together with the gate, and
   the distressed fans passed to safety.

   During the whole of this game we were very concerned for
   the safety of our youngsters but the police were only
   allowing injured fans through the gate.  After the match
   finished we all vowed never to enter the Leppings Lane
   end ever again.

As far as I am concerned, when there is a large crowd
entering this part of the ground, it will always be a death
trap.  It must be on very rare occasions when Sheffield
Wednesday have enough visiting supporters to this part of
the ground sufficiently to fill it completely and I believe
they are not aware of how dangerous it can be.  The whole
layout for entry into the Leppings Lane end of the ground
and the layout inside the ground is a major hazard when
there are lots of fans entering the ground.

Under the circumstances I have described to you and the
additional events which occured at this semi-final - large
crowds, gates being opened to allow more fans in, lack of
police and stewards to act as marshals who would guide and
control the passage of fans into the ground, apparent lack
of police communications, then it is not surprising that
today, innocent people were injured and even more
tragically, lost their lives.

At this semi-final we had tickets for the West Gate stand
which is built up over the Leppings Lane part of the ground
and it was from here that we were to witness the harrowing
and heartbreaking chain of tragic events.

Even more astonishing events were to take place.  It
appeared that when the ambulances eventually arrived they
had difficulty in getting to the dying and injured.  Then
the majority of fans who were on the pitch, who had not been
seriously injured, but obviously suffering from shock, began
to rip down hoardings and use them as stretchers to ferry
the injured, and unknown to us, many dead.  The fans carried
them from one end of the pitch to the other in a seemingly
endless relay.  Again stewards and other people helped but
again so few policemen got involved as they still stood in
groups or in a line across the pitch.

Later, having learned that a gate had been opened, by the
police, to let fans in, it became obvious that this must
have been a major contribution to the tragic disaster that
occured.  These faffs headed for the same tunnel I described
earlier and what was to happen is to me inevitable.   I feel
great sympathy for the policeman who gave the directive for
the gate to be opened, in his opinion, lives were at risk
outside the ground and he took the action he considered the
best under the circumstances known to him.

The factors which have contributed to   what happened as far
as I am concerned are


1)   Police stopping coaches well before the ground so that
     fans had a 20 minute to 30 minute walk to the ground.
     This could be a likely.cause of the Tate arrival of
     fans and the consequent build up outside the ground
     just before kick off.

     We consider ourselves extremely lucky as our coach
     driver dropped us off as near to the ground as possible
     even though police wanted him to turn round and drop us
     off a lot further away from the ground, despite the
     fact this would have resulted in us arriving even later
     at the ground.  We had a 10 minute walk to the ground
     and arrived at Hillsborough at 2.35 p.m.  if we had
     been dropped off where the police wanted them we would
     have been arriving in the ground at the same time as
     those unfortunate supporters who were to be involved in
     those tragic circumstances.


2)   Police not taking immediate control of the fans and
     getting them to line up in an orderly manner.   There
     appeared to be more police on duty miles away from the
     ground than there were directly outside it.   This
     shortage of policeman immediately outside the ground
     must surely have resulted in total lack of crowd
     control.
                            - 5 -




3)   The entrance to the Leppings Lane end and this part of
     the ground itself is a death trap when large numbers of
     fans are trying to gain entrance.


4)   The ultimate responsibility of what happened must lie
     with F.A. Authorities.  For the second year running
     they gave Liverpool fans the smaller part of the
     ground, even though they must have an average of 15,000
     to 20,000 more fans attending their home games.  This
     was despite the fact that Liverpool F.C. appealed to
     the F.A. to either give Liverpool fans the other end of
     the ground and so more tickets or choose an alternative
     ground which would be able to accommodate their fans.
     The F.A. officials with characteristic lack of interest
     in the problems of the fans, coldly dismissed
     Liverpools claims.

     The people who deserve commending are the Liverpool
     supporters who so bravely helped their injured
     colleagues who lay dying and injured on the Pitch.   The
     ambulance men, nurses, stewards and firemen who also
     put in tremendous effort.  The Nottingham Forest fans
     for their behaviour after they became aware of the
     extent of the tragedy unfolding before them.   And last
     but not least those few policemen who did try their
     best and the people of Sheffield for showing such
     generosity and help to those fans in need of it.

     My condolences and heartfelt sympathy goes out to those
     families who have lost their loved ones in such tragic
     circumstances caused by the negligence, incompetence
     and ignorance of the F.A. and other officials.

     From a very sad but very angry Liverpool supporter, who
     stood there and watched, helpless to do anything.  I'm
     not a fanatical or completely biased supporter, what I
     witnessed on both occasions is the truth.


     Yours sincerely,

              HILLSBOROUGH SATURDAY 15TH APRIL 1989
Together with my brother, my 11 year old son and a friendl left
Liverpool at 1030 hours to travel to Hillsborough to attend iSBBWPr
the FA Cup Semi-Final match.
I drove to Sheffield by car along the M62 heading as press reports
advised to join up with the Ml motorway.
On approaching the junction of the M62 and M602 motorway/
road traffic signs advised 'Football Traffic" to follow M602.
This was in fact misinformation as these signs are for football
traffic heading towards Old Trafford, Manchester United's
ground. These signs are for use in conjunction with road works
on the Barton Bridge, and could have been covered up for the day.
Much has been said about the effect of the late.arrival of many
Liverpool fans at the ground, but anyone following the direction
signs on the M62 would have incurred a lengthy and time consuming
diversion resulting in late arrival in Sheffield.
After a trouble free journey with no traffic congestion we arrived
in Sheffield at approx 1230 hours.
He proceeded towards the ground passing numerous Police Officers
who appeared in a pleasant and receptive manner.
He reached the perimeter of the ground at about 1345 hours and
and having ensured my young son and friends safe arrival in the
North Stand my brother and I entered the Leppings Lane terraces
at turnstile B as shown on my ticket. It was then approximately
1355.
He were body searched twice, once as we approached the turnstile
and again as soon as we passed through.
Continuing through the tunnel under the Stand we made our way onto
the terraces. I did not see any Stewards or Police directing people
within the ground nor did there seem to be anybody checking the
build up of spectators in the various pens.
Hhilst I had no complaint regarding the body searches
this activity was given great priority compared to the direction of
spectators within the ground thereafter.
Inside the pen there appeared very little space and we had difficulty
making our way through the crowd to find a space on the right hand
side of the pen; this in fact proved almost impossible as no space
was available. At about 1430 people around me were complaining
that they were having difficulty in breathing as a result of the
intense pressure and heat generated by the crowd.
A gentlemen of middle age who had his son with him was distressed
that the young lad was upset and tried to leave the pen.
This proved impossible as one was unable to turn around
or move in any direction. He lifted the lad on the the gentleman's
shoulders so as to ease his distress. Many people around were by
this time shouting to the Police Officers in front ofthe wire to
take action and relieve some of the pressure by movingyoungsters and
others in distress out of the central pens to the emptier touchline
pens. Requests were also made to the Police at that time to stop any
more fans entering the centre pens.
Regrettably, no action was taken.
As the 3.00pm kick off time approached the situation had already
  reached and passed the condition of acceptability. Everybody
  was shouting at the Police Officers to relieve the situation. In many
  cases these pleas were vehement, and arguably abusive - however when
  you are struggling to survive and unable to move'there is little
  alternative.
  A fan with pain etched on his faced climbed onto the fence
  and appealled to the fans at the back to ease off, but this was an
  impossible request as we could not move in any direction.
  The fan was swiftly pushed back into the crowd by a
  Police Officer who apparently was still unaware of what was
! happening to the fans on the other side of the wire, despite the
  continuing appeals from spectators for the pressure to be relieved.
  The gentleman again climbed onto the fence and shouted towards
  us that fans were dying in front of him.
  The match had still not kicked off.
  Fans all around were trying to move back but were unable to do so as
  others were apparently still entering the pen.
  The situation at that time was horrific.
  The game by now had kicked off but nobody around was watching
  we were trying to breathe and stay upright as the pressure was
  unbearable and the fans a few feet in front of us were screaming
  in terror. Somehow the game was stopped and all hell was let loose.
  Fans were trying to pick other fans up who had slipped down into
  the crush, but this was proving impossible as once you got your
  hands and arms free you were unable to put them back down again.
  Many fans were eventually lifted out of the front of that pen,
  many fans scrambled and were aided upwards into the stand above.
  Only thendid the Police open the gates at the front of the terraces.
  On returning to our car later that afternoon I was sickened and
I found it hard to believe that so many fans had died. I was unware
  that a gate had been opened and so many fans lost the lives in the
  tunnel entrance and the central area of the terrace.
  I never once felt a sudden surge or any more pressure. The poor people
  infront of us 9n the right hand side of the pen were systematically
  crushed to their deaths from about 1415 onwards.
  The pressure had been unbearable from that time and there
  were many instances of crushing before the external gate was opened.
  Some of the fans died in that pen not as a result of that decision
  but because of the steadily increasing pressure in the preceeding
  hour.
  Fans were being crushed to death and many more would have died
  irrespective of whether the external gate was opened or not.
  I can only state in the section of the terrace we were in many would
  still have died as a result of the gross incompetence of
, many people who had the power to act and failed to do so.
  On realising the extentof the tragedy the help then given by
  the Police was exemplary. The people of Sheffield late that
  afternoon surpassed all levels of human kindness and understanding,
  and for that we are extremely grateful.
  The events which lead upto this waste of human life must never
  be.allowed to happen again. A little thought for our fellow human
  beings would have saved the lives of so many friends.

Dear Mrs Wise,,

I have been a Liverpool football fan for many years and,             as a season ticket
holder, attend all home (and 90% of away) matches.

I was at     Hillsborough last Saturday and, like everyone else, was             utterly
appalled,    horrified and outraged at the awful tragedy of it all.                I was
one of the lucky ones.

I am sure there are many lessons to be learned, not least of which must
be the non-starter of the ID Card Section of the Football Supporters’ Bill.
I am convinced this scheme would lead to enormous numbers of fans waiting
to get into matches (with and without cards) and having to go through the
procedures involved in order to gain access to the ground.    We all.saw what
happened at Hillsborough with the crowd outside and the lack of supervision
on the part of police and stewards.    I think the ID Card scheme has other
drawbacks, too, one of which will be to stop the casual visitor going to
matches.

Colin Moynihan appears to be labouring under the impression that there are
problems of hooliganism inside grounds.  In my experience as a very committed
supporter of Liverpool FC, I can honestly say that if the Minister for Sport
is under this impression, then he has very much got ’his wires crossed .
If the scheme should materialise as the Government would wish it to, there
will be trouble outside grounds, not just with the top First Division^Clubs
but with the smaller ones, too.

I would urge you to oppose the above in the strongest terms                possible.      I
know it will not work and create more problems than it solves.

I hope     the   enclosed   list   of my thoughts as   a spectator   at Hillsborough   on
Saturday may be of some help to you.

Yours sincerely,
  0 c S D LEADBETTER


I 'feel that the Hillsborough    disaster was   caused   through   a combination of
circumstances, ie:-

 (1)   Why was Hillsborough chosen as the venue for one of the FA Cup Semi
        Finals? You will recall that the same two teams were involved in last
        ye^r^s semi final and the venue then was Hillsborough. On balance,
        therefore, Liverpool should have had the territorial advantage- and
        the game should have been played at Old Trafford (where the police
        are used to dealing with large crowds every w e e k ! ).

 (2)   Liverpool were allocated the small end of the ground at Hillsborough,
       because the police said that trafficking arrangements necessitated
       this. Therefore, the number of tickets Liverpool received was smaller
       than the number allotted to Nottingham Forest. I am sure you will
       by now know that Liverpool have twice the average weekly attendance
       of Nottingham Forest at matches.

 (3)   I experienced difficulty in obtaining a programme outside the ground.
       The only place (apart from inside the ground) was in the Notts Forest
        section, which defeats the object of segregating, fans in the first
        place. I spoke to several Liverpool fans who had to 'run the gauntlet'
        of the opposing fans to obtain programmes.

 (4)   My friend and I travelled by road to the match, as did a lot of fans.
       Traffic problems caused massive delays in Manchester and Stockport,
       which must have accounted for a lot of t h e .crowd outside the ground
        at 2.50 pm. The police actually advised Liverpool fans to travel by
        the M62 and Ml, but as there were several sets of roadworks on the
        M62, these caused fans (coming both from Liverpool and via Stockport)
        to be late at the ground.

(5)    A member of the police force opened a gate            to ease the crowd
       congestion. There would appear to have been a breakdown in police
        communications, because they surely should have known that the two
       central sections of the Leppings Lane terrace         were then full to
        bu rs t in g . THERE WERE ENOUGH POLICE ON THE GROUND TO HAVE SEEN THIS
       WAS THE C A S E . The space, as I could see from my vantage point, was
        in the two outer parts of the terrace AND NOT IN        THE CENTRE. Fans
        should have been shepherded away from the centre to     the sides of the
        ground AND THE CENTRE PORTIONS BLOCKED O F F .

 (6 ) It would be interesting to know why the terrace at Leppings Lane is
       partitioned when it is always used for 'away' fans and not just at
       'big' matches. If these partitions had not been in place, the crowd
       could have spread sideways.

 (7)   It has been stated that Hillsborough      conforms  to current safety
        legislation regarding doors in the perimeter fence.   In the light of
        experience, it is quite obvious there were not enough gates, and big
        enough gates, in the fence.

 ( 8 ) I would urge that the high perimeter fences are done away with. The
        fence at Hillsborough has spikes on top and that made it even more
        difficult for people to escape.

         are treated worse than cattle being herded to market.

                                                      19th April, 1989



                         THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

The day was Saturday 15th April, 1989, F.A. Cup Semi Final Day.       I
had never been to a Semi Final before. I set off with three members
of my family, one    was my thirteen year old son.   He thought we were
going to have a great day.    Two of us were Forrest Fans and two were
Liverpool Fans.   Two would come back happy and two would be a little
bit dissappointed. That was far from the truth.

What we encountered we had no idea.    We set off   in plenty of time for
Sheffield arriving at 12.30p.m. the match did not start until 3.00p.m.
We had a bite to eat after we had parked about 15 minutes from the
ground.   As we walked towards the ground we were pestered by supporters
asking if we had any spare tickets.       I would not  dream of going to
a football match which was all ticket if I did not have a ticket.

We approached the ground, there was a barrier across one side with
Police patrolling.     We asked the Police which was our entrance, they
pointed about 10 yards beyond but because the barrier was up they would
not let us through, we had to walk all the way round.    Never mind the
exercise will do us good.

We got into the ground and took our seats, it was a magnificent stadium.
The crowd was beginning to build up, our seats were in the South Stand
near the Leppings Lane end, just in line with the         by line.   To our
left, high up, was a Police Observation Post.           Three Officers were
situated with short wave radios and TV monitors.     The camaras positioned
around the ground     and outside the ground. . Allthe time monitoring
the crowd behaviour.    At the Leppings Lane end, this section was split
into four in the standing area.       The centre two sections were quite
full at 2.30p.m. with the end two sections very sparse of spectators.
At 2.50p.m. we observed that therewas quite a lot of swaying in those
two centre sections but the outer two were filling up very very slowly
indeed.    The game started with all spectators oblivious to what was
happening.    After a short time we noticed one ortwo Police running
along the touch line to the goal at the Leppins Lane end. It was obvious
that they thought thatthere was trouble as         spectators were trying
to get out onto the pitch.       The Police at first appeared to try to
deter them from doing this but then the spectators swung quite
dramatically and started to climb up into the main stand and the
spectators there were trying to pull them free.       They were also trying
to climb over the divisional partitions into the outer two sections.
By this time, in between watching the match and observing the Leppings
Lane end the situation became out of hand and eventually the         Police
started to help the spectators over the barrier which was quite high
and difficult to get over.    At this point nobody knew what was happening
or the scale of the problem behind the barriers.      The spectators helped
each other over the barrier onto the pitch and eventually there must
have been about 500 spectators who were on the cinder track behind
the pitch and there was so many in fact they started to go onto the
pitch but tried to keep close to the by line.       At this point in time
a Senior Officer raced across the        field trying to catch the eye of
the Referee.    Play was still going on but obviously it was at the far
end of the pitch.    The referee turned and saw the Police Officer, went
towards him, made conversation and the referee, decided to take the
players off the field.    Once the players were off the field, at least
a hundred Police Officers came into the ground from the far side, from
the Spoin Kop. Totally unaware of what was going on they thought clearly,
that there was going to be a riot so they formed a barrier the full
width of the field along the centre line. Still the fans were coming
over the barrier, by this time they had managed to break free one of
the gates.    The spectators started bringing numerous casualties out
onto the green turf and laying them out.     Some of them immediately sat
up, others laid motionless on the ground.

At this point in time it must be noted that it was only the Liverpool
supporters who were actually carrying the spectators and helping them
to get free from the pressure on the Terrace.          The casualties were
laid on the floor and the spectators started on a number of casualties
to try to resuscitate them, obviously they were unconscious.           There
were two young girls near the corner flag, they tried to revive them
for a long long time and eventually they put a coat over their heads.
There was one boy who was as old as my youngest son ; 10, he was brought
right near the touch line, there was a young Police Cadet and a Lady
Police Officer assisting with mouth to mouth resuscitation.       They tried
for about ten minutes without any success.        Spectators in the stand
where I was, and in the terrace below watched helplessly. A big spectator
ran over, said something to the Police Officers and they moved out
of the way, he obviously must have been a First Aider or a Doctor or
somebody with Medical knowledge.       He tried frantically for another
five minutes or it seemed that long to me, eventually all the people
crowding round let out a great cheer, he had started to breathe.         All
in the grand stand and in the terraces below started to cheer and applaud,
our jubilance was short lived, within a minute the big fellow was down,
mouth to mouth resuscitation again, the little boy had stopped breathing.
He eventually started breathing again, they turned him into the recovery
position, four spectators around    this boy ran for    a stretcher.    They
tried to pull away anotice board around       the perimeter.    Four Police
Officers went across, and at first it looked as if they were trying
to hinder, but after a few words they started to assist and pulled
this notice board away, it was then taken over to the boy, he was put
on and was transported right across to the far side.         While this was
going on an ambulance had turned up behind the goal. A number of bodies
were put inside.     It was still not clear at thispoint in time what
the casualty situation was but it was obvious that there was a number
of fatalities.   Spectators in the front row of the West Stand, started
to dismantle all the notice boards which were beneath them, hand them
down carefully and eventually they found their way onto the pitch.
They were taken to each casualty and then transferred right across
the ground to waiting ambulances that could not really get into the
ground for the situation.

Whilst this was going on the hundred or so Police Officers still on
the centre line, still waiting for trouble, still waiting for a riot,
at this point a number of Nottingham Forrest fans climbed over the
fence at the Spoint Kop and started to dismantle the sign boards behind
their goal and carry them to where they were needed.     They then joined
with the Liverpool fans in conveying the bodies across to the far side.
There were only a few Police Officers helping to carry the stretcher
bound casualties across and help them in reviving the injured spectators.
The control by the Police during this operation was absolutely negative.
No one seemed to be in charge at all, and it was the Liverpool fans
who took the initiative in dealing with the emergency situation.
Eventually a full half of the playing area was covered with distraught
Liverpool fans.   The Manager of Liverpool Football Club, Kenny Dalglish
came to the public address system, appealed for calm, there was no
need, they were completely calm, he asked them to move off the field,
those who were not in need of medical attention, they moved to the
side waiting for further instructions.    It is true there were a couple
of incidents, one involving a News Reporter trying to take photographs
of dead bodies.     Distraught and angry fans seized him.     The Police
protected him and separated him by escorting him away.       They should
have taken his camara away, I would have.

Another incident involving some of the fans near the players tunnel,
they congregated round the BBC Camara as you could see from the News
Report, they were not causing problems.   They were voicing their opinion
at the lack of control, why didit happen, who's fault was it, why was
it not averted?     After a very long time when most of the bodies had
been taken across to the waiting amulances and the terraces were nearly
empty it became evident of the horror of the incident.      Steel barriers
capable of withstanding 50 tons pressure were flattened, it was only
then that the injuries became apparent.      As the fans left the ground
the Police in the centre began to disperse slowly.        Behind the goal
all the personal belongings, shoes, boots, coats, scarves were gathered
in one big heap.   We left the ground at about 4.30p.m. passing spectators
in silence.   The Police outside the ground tried to make their prescence
felt by stopping cars, asking them where they were going, stopping
groups of people, single people, asking them where they were going.
 Still   they were looking for trouble.     There was no trouble, people
were too upset by the situation to think about causing trouble.         It
was not until I got back to the car and switched the radio on that
I heard the horrific number of fatalities, 74.        That must have been
everybody who was carried across the full length of the field.          As
the reasons for this disaster unfold, the responsibility of crowd
observation and crowd control lies fairly an4 squarely with the Police.
 As they were situated in that control tower using the close circuit
monitors and using radios for giving instructions, it was obvious that
opening a gate and letting fans in would result in them getting into
the ground and seeing the game as quickly as possible.     With the centre
two sections of the Leppings Lane end being overfull it would have
been an easy instruction to deploy some of the Police Officers to the
tunnels leading into those two sections and directing the fans into
the end two sections.     Outside the ground at that particular end the
crowd was building up, two Police Horses appeared to be doing very
little to try to relieve the pressure.    I believe those Police Officers
failed in their duty to ensure the safety of those fans in that situation
outside the Leppings Lane end.        I also feel that the observation
controller, overriding and overseeing every action and activity around
the ground failed to recognise the problem in the centre two sections,
and deal with it accordingly by averting fans into the end two sections.
The horrific irony is that we had a situation that the Police had no
idea how to control.      They are just clearly trained in controlling
riot and violence and they were totally unable to control human tragedy.
By being First Aid Trained, they would have been able to make some
contribution to the situation. Very few did.

Because this gate was opened, many who did not have tickets, gained
entry and contributed to the problem unintentionally.  I have been
to many football matches in my life and by being all ticket it is far
quicker to gain entry into the ground than it is being paying cash.
We now look at the consequences of having Membership cards. In a situation
like the 15th April, 1989 entry to the ground would have been much
slower causing terrific build up outside.      It is easy to say that by
being a member and having a membership card you must try to get to
the ground a little bit earlier.      We did because we travelled a long
way.   Not everybody thinks the same way as we do.      People get delayed
in traffic which contributes to late arrivals.      If this game had been
by Membership Card the same situation could have happened, spectators
outside without Membership cars, waiting to get in, the pressure builds
up, the gates are opened to relieve what is anticipated as a dangerous
situation and fans who have had their cards taken away from them gain
entry and cause great problems.

The Government must realise the tragedy caused at Hillsborough on Saturday
15th april, 1989 is due to interference by Government, Local Authority
and Police, in trying to restrict members of the public as spectators
from moving freely and safely around our grounds.       If the divisional
fences and the perimeter fences were not present today this tragedy
would never have arisen, as the spectators would have merely moved
to one side to avert the pressure. Penning in of spectators is a serious
breach of the Health and Safety at Work Act as far as Safe Access and
Safe Egress is concerned, in an emergency evacuation situation. Football
clubs must be left to manage their own business without interference
from outside bodies unless they request specialist advice and assistence.
It will be interesting to see how the Officer in charge of survelance
and deployment of    his   force will allay the blame for this tragedy.
95 passionate fans do not know the cause. Thousands do.

                                                  22nd April 1989

Dear Sir,


     In reply to a few short lines printed in The Guardian today, I have
set out below my first hand experience of the Hillsborough disaster so
it may be used in the police enquiry.
     Having travelled to Sheffield by train that morning, I arrived at
the ground at approximately 1.30pm, entering via Leppings Lane gate B.
Coming through the centre tunnel, I branched to the left and took up
position in a lightly populated area of the enclosure, just to the rear
of centre. At approximately 2.30pm the area became quite crowded but not
uncomfortable and a good atmosphere was built up amongst the fans at
this end. There was much swaying and pushing just before the kick off,
but at the time I thought this would subside once the match got under
way. The match started and the pushing continued, Peter Beardsley
cracked a shot onto the Hottingham Forest crossbar and we all surged
forward, but instead of relaxing and resuming our positions on the
terraces, we found we were unable to push back on the people behind us.
There was a crush barrier about four or five feet in front of me and I
thought to myself that if I was to go anywhere near that then I'd be in
trouble as there wasxalready a lad of about twenty five pinned to it,
possibly whilst trying to climb over as he was a couple of feet above
everyone else. Tears were streaming down his face as he cried out in
agony, he looked right at me and cried "My legs, oh my god, my legs."
That was the last I saw of him as a surge propelled me diagonally
downward onto the corner post of the crush barrier, where I came to a
sudden halt with my back now to the pitch and my right leg trapped on
the barrier post. ¥e were all yelling for the Police to open the gates
but they seemed oblivious to the crush inside.         I was there for
approximately another five minutes, it could have been less, when there
was a slight ease in pressure and I was able to drag my now numbed leg
 free. This was, though, just a pause before another large push, again
diagonally, towards the high fencing at the side of the enclosure. Here
 we had a fairly organised escape, helping the people in front over the
 fence onto a pathway between enclosures, which led to a now opened gate.
 Upon landing in this pathway, I steadied myself and limped off, my leg
 now tingling and aching, towards the gateway. I had got no further than
 a couple of feet when somebody yelled "Help us get the Judy out of
 there." I looked to my right and I was met by a deep penetrating gaze of
 fear in the eyes of a girl of about eighteen. Steadying myself against
 the railings I put my hands together and thrust them through the fence
 so that she could use them as a step up onto the top of the fence. Once
 at the top, she jumped down into my arms, and walked to the far side of
 the passage. I then limped off and out onto the playing area, glancing
 right to see people squashed at the front, screaming and gasping for
 air, with the metal mesh barrier digging into their faces. I staggered
 around the pitch not really taking it all in, before laying on the grass
for a rest. Many people stopped to ask if I was alright, and I waved
them on. Some fans nearby started to take down promotional advertising
boards to use as makeshift stretchers, but were stopped from doing so at
first by police officers who eventually relented, I rested against a
wall and was soon joined by a lad of about fifteen who said that people
were dead at the back. That was at approximately 3.45pm and is the last
I remember from the ground. The train journey home was completed in near
silence and apart from being badly shaken and a few pains in my legs, I
didn't feel too bad.




    Yours Faithfully,
                                                                                                                 MIR.15

points that you have made.

Thank you very much for writing.

            ■ : .. - . •
                                         19 April   1989

Dear Sir,
         Having been a spectator at the Hillsborough ground (Leppings
Lane terraces) on the day of the FA cup match between Liverpool and
Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989 I feel I should write to you
outlining the the areas where I believe serious errors of judgement
were made.

1. After passing through the turnstiles at approximately 14.10. It was
my belief that the only entrance to the terracing was through the
tunnel leading to the enclosure directly behind the goal. There were
no stewards or policemen giving directions to any of the other
entrances and there were no signs on walls to give instruction.

2. The entrance of the tunnel onto the terraces was congested when we
arrived so I moved to the right and ended up against the railing which
ran from the stand at the back to the wire netting at the front of the
goalmouth terrace. The whole terrace filled to capacity very quickly
with many supporters attempting to a spread out along the terrace, not
realising that there was a fence in the way untill they were very
close to it. At this point most supporters gave up, as I had done and
remained by the fence.        ,
By 14.30 the area behind the goal was extremely congested any movement
in the crowd resulting in individuals being squeezed. At no time did I
see any attempt by police officers or stewards to check on the numbers
of fans behind the goal. Nether did I see any attempt being made to
divert fans to the terrace to the right of the fence which was still
relatively uncongested.

4. By 14.35 I was most uncomfortable as a result of the constant
pressure from the crowd. Looking behind me I saw a small gate open at
the top of the railing underneath the stand. I pushed my way to the
gate and entered the enclosure to the right of the goal.  This gate
did not appear to be signposted and could not be seen by anybody apart
from the fans standing right next to the fence.

5. As the disaster unfolded it became obvious that the police force
were acting in a totally disorganised fashion. Officers and fans
worked well as individuals but groups of officers appeared to stand
around doing very little, waiting for orders which were obviously not
forthcoming. This was in complete contrast to the discipline and
organisation of the fire service who moved around the pitch in a
purposeful mannner and who were obviously under the control of a
senior officer. The only time the police force appeared to act in a
coordinated fashion was in arresting the charge of some Liverpoool
fans after taunts from Nottinham Forest supporters obviously unaware
of the gravity of the situation.

6. No attempt was'made to communicate with the crowd.      Except for a


                                PA6E 1
request for fans to leave the pitch.

7. Very few   stretchers seemed to be available for transporting the
injured.



Can I suggest the following changes to the way football   games are
organised:-

        ' - For games to be played on neutral grounds all factors
 should.be carefully weighed when deciding which end a set of
 supporters should be allocated. For example the relative size of crowd
'attending home matches should be given a higher weighting than
 inconvenience in organising the arrival of fans at grounds.

          - On entering grounds fans must be given clear instructions
about where they should go. These instructions should be verbal (given
by police and stewards) and backed up by written notices.This is
espescially important for fans travelling away from home.

          - Police and stewards should constantly monitor crowd
sizes/movements for any sign of developing problems. Police and
stewards should by trained to watch for any tell tale signs; such as
genuine and obvious distress shown by fans etc. Use of television
cameras/computers alone are not sufficient.

          - Both the fencing at the front and at the side of terraces
should be removed from all grounds.

          - All exits should be clearly marked and illuminated.

          - Senior police officers should receive more training       in
coping with and directing their men during major disasters with       large
numbers of dying and injured as opposed to dealing with major
disturbances (eg r i o t s ) .

          - Communications need to be improved, both between police
officers inside and outside the ground and between the authorities and
supporters via a good quality public address system.

          ~ More medical facilities should be made easily available at
grounds. Charitable institutions such as the St.John's Ambulance
Brigade should not be expected to provide all the medical
facilities/expertise neccessary during football matches attended by
large numbers of fans.


                      Yours Faithfully,

points that you have made.

Thank you very much for writing.

                                                          26th April,   1989*


Dear Sir,
             I have supported Liverpool since they were a °nd Division side and
have held a season ticket since 1968. Like many other fans, I have over the years
accquired a lot of experience in attending ’tig' matches. (These include five
Suropean Cup finals and the last sixteen F.A.Cup Semi finals Liverpool have
contested)
             I have enjoyed many happy times, some not so happy and sadly at
Heysel and Hillsborough, two very tragic ones.
             As at Heysel, there was not one reason at Hillsborough which caused
the disaster but many. As an ordinary and responsible supporter, I would like
to relate my view from experiences at this and other matches as to why the
tragedy occurred.
             In my opinion, there were ten reasons which contributed;

(1) CHOIC3 0? V jU'TTTB:- The F.A. said that arrangements for last years semi final
went smoothly   and that this was the basis for selecting Hillsborough again.
Any supporter   in the Leppings Lane centre section last year will tell you thatit
was severely overcrowded -md arrangements far from satisfactory.
In addition, Sheffield geographically is much nearer Nottingham and in fairness
to both Clubs, the F.A. should have selected a ground nearer Liverpool.
If the 7.A. hierachy had stood on the Leppings Lane terracing last year instead
of being given luxury treatment by the Sheffield Wednesday directors, I feel sure
they would have listened to Mr Peter 'Robinson's sug;restion of Old Trafford.

(2 ) TICK3T ALLOCATION?- Any intelligent person could see it makes no sense to
give Liverpool with an average home gate of 38,000, 4,000 fewer tickets than
Nottingham Forest who attract 18,000 on a good day.
Again the F.A. did not listen to Mr 'Robinson.

(3 ) TRAFFIC DBLAYS:-The police advised fans t© travel via the M 62 & M1 to
Sheffield. On this route and the more recognised way via Stockport, there
was congestion and hold ups resulting in a large number of supporters arriving
after 2 .00 pm.

(4 ) POOR 3NTRMCB FACILITIES:- The entrances for the North Stand, the Vfest Stand
and the Lapping Lane Terracing are all congregated together. This means that
all ?5»000 Liverpool supporters enter in the same area.
The signs above the turnstiles are not clearly marked, which leads to confusion,
this is particularly heightened when people arrive late.
(5) LACK 07 Q,TTUTTSS:- If queues would have been properly organised, people
would have been able to pass throiigh the turnstiles much quicker. There was
not enough police to do this and fans massed toother, trying to push thenselves
in the general direction of the turnstiles.

(6) TICKSrPLESS FANS:- There was a number of fans without tickets, not thousands
as some media suggest but perhaps three or four hundred. Some of them unfortunately
were hampering swift access through the turnstiles. Whilst edging my way to the
gates, I noticed several making abortive efforts to pass through the turnstiles.
I witnessed this at close quarters when I eventually reached the turnstile, the
lad immediately in front of myself tried to pass the gate man a £5 note, this was
refused?, the lad pleaded and begged to be let through, he then proceeded to try
and climb over the turnstile. The gate man alerted a policeman at the rear of the
turnstile, on seeing him, the lad retreated, I had to force myself back against
the crowd to let him out. I estimate this abortive effort took between 30 and
35 seconds and in this time, six fans could have been admitted with tickets.
I would only be guessing as to how many of these abortive efforts were made but I
think it would be worthwhile asking the men employed on the turnstiles to asatain
a correct figure. If for example two hundred abortive efforts were made, this
would mean that about 1,200 fans could have been admitted during this wasted time.
I feel the police must accept some of the blame for this. If they would have had
enough men on foot outside the turnstiles, they could have organised the queues
and checked everyone had a ticket before entering the turnstile.
Obviously some blame must be attached to fans who travelled without tickets but
the Police must have expected this and should have made contingency plans.

(7) FANS COHH-REG!-ATINO- IN MIDDLE SECTION:- A lot of Clubs have the terracing
behind one of the goals sectioned off. This is so that during a normal League
game, the visiting supporters can be herded into one of these pens with the
section either side empty.      This is some what different for an F.A.Cup Semi
Final as all the sections are used by the one club's fans. A lot of fans,
particularly the younger ones, prefer to go in the center section. This is because
they are nearer the goal and they wish to experience a more vibrant atmosphere.
At each of the previous two semi finals Liverpool have played, last year also
at Hillsborough and in 1986 at White Hart Lane, the center section was severly
overcrowded, whereas the side sections were a lot less congested. The Sheffield
Wednesday officials and Police should have been wary of this and either issued
tickets for each section or advised stewards to direct fans to the side sections
as soon as the center section was full.

(8) DELAYING THE KICK OFF:- It was quite obvious    to me when I got into the
ground at 2.40pm that a lot of fans would not get   in before kick off. It should
have been a simple task for an officer outside to   relay this information to the
Police control room and ask for a 15 or 30 minute   delay.

(9) 0PSHING THE CONCERTINA GATES:-    I managed to pass through the turnstiles
at 2.40pm, it had taken me~ab«ttt 25 minutes to move ?5 yards. During which time
the crushing progressively increased and I was very relieved when I eventually
entered the ground. The policemen on horses did their best to try and prevent the
crowd from pushing towards the turnstiles but they too became trapped in the crowd.
Later on when I heard that the police had opened the blue concertina gate, I was
fully understanding of their decision and agree that a tragedy was highly likely
outside if this action was not taken.   In saying this, it is almost certain that
opening the gate was directly responsible for the tragedy but it was not the
physical act of opening the gate that was the mistake but allowing the fans to
rush through the tunnel to the middle section which was already by all accounts
over capacity, The Officer who gave the instruction to open the gates has my
sympathy but he should have been fully aware of all aspects relating to any
decisions he made regarding the crowd control at the match. This is why he is in
charge.
                                                                      pto
(10) P3NC3S:- It is my opinion that since the introduction of perimeter fences,
it has been inevitable that a tragedy would occur.    At the 1986 semi final at
^fhite Hart Lane, I was in the middle section behind the goal. I was right at
the front with my two young sons. We had been one of the first ones to enter the
ground and had a perfect view until just before kick off when it became danger-
ously crowded. I was desperate to get thera out but because of the fences, it was
impossible to do so. I wrote to the Chairman and Secretary of Tottenham Hotspur
explaining that because of the crushing, there could have been a tragedy at the
match and that spectators who needed medical treatment could not have been reached
because of the fences.    In their reply they said "although it would be batter for
us to have a number of exit gates, too many would defeat the object", they also
said ’’the reason why the pen became crowded was due to late arrivals”
It is very sad that it has taken the deaths of ninety five people to awaken
Tottenham and other Clubs to the danger of these fences.
(i enclose a copy of the letters referred to above)

             I pray that the enquiry will reveal the truth with no cover up and
that we can then hopefully learn the lessons, football ^rounds must be made
safer and more pleasant places to visit. Treat a man like an animal and he is
more likely to behave like one.
             I hope the information contained in this letter may be of use to you.

Dear Sirs,
           I am writing to you to bring to your attention a serious problem
which could result in a tragedy at White Hart Lane.
           The fences surrounding areas of the pitch are permanent fixtures
and exits on to the perimeter track are few and far between. Ihis means that
in an emergency, spectators who need medical treatment cannot be reached and
because o f the height and shape of the fences, people cannot be passed over
to the St.Johns Ambulance men.
           At Saturday's F.A. Cup semi final, I had my 2 young sons with me, we
arrived very early and stood on the South Terrace at the front just behind the
enclousure for wheelchairs. Because spectators were able to move from section
 to section on the South terrace, the middle section became alarmingly congested
shortly before kick off. Once the match started it was impossible to move and
everytime either side attacked that end, the pressure of the crowd was almost
unbearable. I spent the whole match with my arms outstretched against the fence
using myself as a human crush barrier to prevent serious injury to my own and
other youngsters at the front. It was a very frightening experience and totally
ruined what should have been a great day. If I could have moved or passed the
youngsters over the fence to the St.Johns Ambulance men I would have done so
but it was impossible.
          Fortunately, I don't think anyone was sariously hurt but please under-
              y °°uld have 'been. What is very important is that the crushing
which occured was avoidable. The gates to prevent spectators moving between
sections in the South terrace should have been either locked or manned and the
perimeter fence should be made so that sections of it can be slotted in and out
quickly in emergencys.
          I was very relieved to get my children out of White Hart Lane in one
piece on Saturday and only hope you will take some note of this letter and take
some measures to ensure that all spectators can watch football in reasonable
comfort and safety.



                            Yours Faithfully,
                                                     A

                           Dear Mr. Hughes,

                           Thank you very much for your letter of the 7th April 1986 and
                           I have noted your comments regarding the recent FA Cup semi
                           final here at Tottenham.

                           For your information, we do have suitable exits to the perimeter
                           pitch, which are the number permissible under our Safety
                           Certificate. The penning and barriers on the terraces are a
                           segregation reguirement and, although it would be better for us
                           to have a number of exit gates in these, too many defeat the
                           object. We do, however, move the crowds into alternative
                           sections when another becomes congested. In the case of this
                           particular match, the reason why the pen to which you are
                           referring became crowded was due to late arrivals. We do try
                           to resolve the pressure continually throughout the game.



                           Yours sincerely,

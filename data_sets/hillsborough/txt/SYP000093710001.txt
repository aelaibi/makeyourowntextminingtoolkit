            left an d brougrrtr the           board back.        I then with others                 picked up an

            e ld e rl y gent      from the     right hand goal            post about 2 yards            onto       the

            pitch,       a ■fireman was       trying    to render assistance.



            A c c o r di n g   to the    fireman    the man              then deceased,         a coat was          put
                                                                                                i
            over     his head,      a black     one simi1<          to a parka.           He was an el derly man

            in his fiftiei                                      oty^on collared shirt,                and jean?

            I recollect          there was a girl          fan helping        to carry this           p e r s o n , she was

            on the       right    of the    hoarding and        I was      on the       left.       By the    time we

            got to the m a k e s h i f t mort u a r y       the a c t i v i t y had      increased,       and there

            were more          injured    persons     outside.



            A g a i n after      leaving     I went    back to the         same area,        I think      then      I

            picked up a y o unger           lad from passed the             penalty area about 6-7 yards

            out.       I cannot      recollect much about            him ao'.jther he was            lying on his side,

            and again          there was a coat        over his      hea/fl. / I      d o n ’t know the       colour of

            it or anything,             a ga i n he was wearing          /sans.



            1 do not know the             identity of any of these                three    persons.          Once again,

            I, along with others,              took    him to the ma k e s h i f t mortuary.

We     had      no       delays        on     our     journey mainly                because           we    had       set    off       so

               I was       with      a group            of    lads      who      were          helping          people           up      off       the      f lo o r ,

               we    came      across         a young           lad     on      the       floor          by    us.         Another            man      was       l y i ng

               red    tracksuit              trousers.               I remember                he    had       dark        socks         on     bu t       was    not

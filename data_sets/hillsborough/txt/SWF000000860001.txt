Dear Sirs,

Hillsborough - Ground

Thank you for your letter of 23rd May.

Our concern is twofold. Firstly, to ensure that specific parts of
the ground are available for inspection by the Engineers and,
specifically, barriers are available to carry out the agreed test
programme.  Secondly, we think it vitally important that the trial
Judge is able to visit the ground and view the scene before any
alterations are made.

It seems from your letter that alterations are contemplated before
the starting date of the trial and it would seem to follow that it
would be sensible for the parties jointly to invite the trial Judge
to inspect accompanied by Counsel at some convenient time before
works are to commence. Obviously, we are handicapped in this by
the fact that nobody knows who the trial Judge will be, but we do
have an assurance from Mr. Justice Rose that the parties will be
advised as soon as it has been decided who will try the case.  In
the meantime, we can only ask that no alterations are carried out
without reasonable notice being given to the parties, so that any
necessary representations can be oade.


Yours faithfully,




Davies Arnold Cooper

    Dear Sirs

    Hillsborough - Ground

    We thank you for your letter of 25th May and duly note                                                                                                                                                                          your
    concern in relation to the proposed works to the Leppings                                                                                                                                                                       Lane
    end.

    As stated in our letter of 23rd May, the position should be
    reviewed by the end of July and perhaps by this stage we will
    know the trial Judge allocated to hear the Chapman and Rimmer
    lead actions. We shall ensure that you are kept informed as to
    the Club's intentions to make changes at the Leppings Lane
    end.

    Yours faithfully

Y O U R REF                         BN/HILLSBOROUGH




  Dear Sirs

  Hillsborough

  Thank you for your letter dated 13th June enclosing your
  amended  schedule   of  issues  which have  now  been  cross-
  referenced to the pleadings in accordance with the directions
  given by Mr Justice Rose on 24th May.

 We have, of course, studied the document very carefully but
 regret to say that we are very firmly of the view that it will
 not assist either the trial Judge or any of the parties.    We
 would respectfully repeat the points w h i c h we raised,  and
 which we understood to be agreed, by all concerned, when the
 question of a schedule of issues was first raised before Mr
 Justice Steyn in March.  They are as follows:

   (a)                          Much of the primary evidence of     fact is capable of
                                 agreement in this case and the areas of disagreement
                                 are (or soon will be) "underlined" on the face of a
                                 copy of Lord Justice Taylor's report;

   (b)                          The issues arising on those facts are (or should                                                                                                                                                    be)
                                 fully set out in the pleadings - and nowhere else;

   (c)                          A schedule can only serve a useful purpose    if it sets
                                 out those issues clearly so as to enable    all parties
                                 to record their comments in a tabular form.

 It seems to us that your proposed schedule                                                                                                                                   is           unhelpful                                and
 inappropriate for the following reasons:

  (a)                               It largely disregards                                                              the pleadings                                       in that it                                  raises


                                                                                                                                                                                                            C o n t / d ...

                     issues   which are not pleaded while   ignoring many    that
                     are;

      (b)           It duplicates the careful exercise which has already
                     been done on the report in that it sets out       at
                     inordinate length selected passages from the Report
                     and/or the Green Guide; and

      (c)           It ignores almost all the pleaded   issues   which   relate
                     to your client's responsibility.

       May we illustrate our concern by setting out just one example
       of the way in which we believe that your           schedule deals
       unhelpfully and unfairly with one of the principal issues in
       the case:    who was responsible for mon i to ri ng the terraces?
       You purport to deal with this matter in 9 separate issues
      [which you list under the heading "Taylor Re port Chapter 9". We
      [would remind you that this chapter of the R e po r t concluded
      lwith the summary at paragraphs 183 and 184 which laid the
      •responsibility unequivocally at the door of your clients. Your
      fechedule, however, makes no provision for the question of
       Police responsibility even to be raised.        We cannot accept
       that this is a realistic way of dealing with the matter and
       ret your schedule does not permit either Dr Eastwood or the
       Club to address the real issues with which Lord Justice Taylor
       fend the pleadings were concerned.

      w e would stress that we have no desire to prevent you from
      arguing the case in any way which the pleadings permit but we
      cannot h elpfully respond to a schedule in this form.  All that
      we could do wou ld be to ignore those issues wh ic h presently
      fall outside the ambit of the pleadings and to add the real
      issues to your already lengthy schedule.   We do not think that
      this would help - nor do we think that this is the exercise
      which the Court had in mind.    We are at least confident that
      you will agree that the object of the exercise should be to
      provide something which is manageable, is fair to all the
      parties and is helpful to the Court.     Putting the m atter at
      its lowest, it is clear that we need further guidance from the
      Court and unless you can produce something whi c h does comply
      w ith the spirit of what was intended we will seek further
      directions at the next Pre-Trial Review.

      We look forward to hearing from you.

                rs faithful

Dear Sirs,

Hillsborough

Thank you for your letter of 20th June and your fax of 25th June*

We should by now have received your underlined copy of the Taylor Report
but have not done so*

V»re are now in a position to consolidate the copies as required by the
Order and notwithstanding the short extension of time we can serve
consolidated copies within the time limited by the Order, i.e. by 6th
July, provided that we receive both yours and Eastwoods* copies without
any further delay.

Secondly, we have not heard from you in respect of the amendments to the
First Third Party Notice sent to you on 13th June, v.'e can tell you that
Eastwoods have consented to these amendments without the need for an
order. We await hearing from you*

Yours faithfully,
HAMMOND SUDDARDS

Dear Sirs,

Hillsborough
Second Letter

Thank you for your letter of 27th June.

V/e read this letter with considerable concern.

May we renind you, firstly, that leave was given for service of a
List of Issues by Mr* Justice Steyn on 6th March 1990. This was
without objection on your part and, in any event, if you had not
agreed with it the right course was to appeal.

Secondly, you had received the list and had indeed given careful
consideration to it when the matter was next before the court on 24th
May 1990 which is over one month ago. At that time, you consented to
an Order requiring you to provide comments cross-referenced to the
pleadings before 15th July 1990* Even if you \?ished to reconsider
your consent, the proper course would again have been to appeal*

We do not accept that you are now entitled to ignore the Orders made
by Mr* Justice Steyn and Mr* Justice Rose* V/e expect compliance with
the Orders within the quite generous time limits allowed.

Nor can we agree that, after two hearings before High Court Judges
with in one case Leading and Junior Counsel and in the other case
Junior Counsel present, "further guidance” as you put it is now
heeded from the court, This particularly when tt is borne in mind
that the Directions of 24th May were given by agreement after full

                                                                   3 o
                                                                  2




discussion between Counsel.

Ve have to remind you that there is a fixed timetable for this action
which is due to commence on 2nd October* Even if you maintain the
views which you have expressed, it is not appropriate for you to wait
for the pre-trial review hearing on the basis that "further guidance0
will then be given which presumably will result in new time limits
being set* The inevitable outcome will be the loss of the hearing date
and we are not now prepared to contemplate this* It follows that if
the> Directions given on 24th May are not strictly complied with, we will
have little o$$ion but to apply to strike out your clients Defence at
the pre-trial review hearing*

Yours faithfully,
HAMMOND SUDDARDS

Dear Sirs,

Hillsborough

Now that Judge has been appointed to deal with the hearing of the
main action, we feel that the Judge should have the opportunity of
inspecting the ground and, in particular, the Leppings Lane
terracing before any works of construction are commenced. To this
end, we suggest that Counsel's Clerks be invited to liaise with the
Listing Officer to appoint a suitable date.

Of course, it would be better if this could await the trial, when
the Judge will be seized with all the issues but, presumably, your
clients will wish to get on with the alterations and, if that is
the case, then the Judge should not be denied the opportunity of
seeing the terraces as they are.


Yours faithfully,

    our copy of the Taylor Report.

    We shall respond very shortly by p roviding our copy of the
    Taylor Report underlined in accordance wi t h   the direction
    given at the hearing on the 24th May.      However, we w o u l d

 Dear Sirs,

 Hillsborough

 Thank you for your fax of 3rd July.

 With respect, the Order is perfectly clear.  All parties should
 have completed their underlining by 22nd June, which was extended
 by agreement to 27th June.  Yourselves and Davies Arnold Cooper
 were then to serve copies on us and we were to consolidate and
 serve consolidated copies not.later than 6th July.  We emphasise,
 once again, that this date can still be achieved.

We are not sure what your concern is here.         It is difficult to see
that we are going to gain any advantage by receiving your
underlined reports a day or two in advance of the date for service
of consolidated underlined c o p i e s . • The main priority must be to
keep to the t imetable and, in this respect, it is rather
disappointing to note that you are.still considering the underlining
with Counsel, when the extended date for completion of underlining
was 27th June.

Turning to the question of a ground inspection, we think that
Counsel and Solicitors should be present, if possible, but that.the
parties should not insist on both their Counsel being present if
this causes problems in fixing a date. ■ Indeed, if there were real
problems over fixing a date, we would rather that the Judge
inspected by himself.  At all events, shall we now ask our Counsel's •
Clerk to try'and liaise wit h.the Judge's Clerk to organise a date? .



                                                                                                                                                              /. .. contd

 We have also received notice of the pre-trial review and. have no
 objection to the hearing commencing at 2.00 p.m., if this is •
 convenient to the Judge.  No doubt you will let us know in good
 time if you are seeking any particular di rec tio ns.

 For our part, we are issuing a Summons seeking leave to amend the
 First Third Party Notice, as we have not heard from the Club with
 their consent.  So far as the amendment of the Second Third Party
 Notice is concerned, we are of course agreeable to the usual terms
 on costs as a condition for your consent to the amendment.

We are turning our attention to documentation for the trial.    Are
you able to let us have a list of documents -.vhich you would wish to
see included in the Core Bundle and a list cf photographs and videos
which you would wish to have readily available?


 Yours fai.

 Dear Sirs,

 Hillsborough

 We assume that you have received from the Health & Safety Executive
 a composite bundle of further reports prepared by various persons
 on various engineering and wider aspects of the disaster.

 Our preliminary view is that these documents are not covered by
 paragraph 3.2 of the Order of 24th May, 1990 and, if that were to
 be correct, then the status of the documents has to be considered.

 Are you able to say,                               in respect of each document,                                                                            whether you are
 agreeable:


           1.       To that document being put in ev idence without the
                    maker being called.

           2.       To the content of the document being agreed
                    evidence.

    Dear Sirs

    Hillsborough

    We thank you for your fax                                                                                        letter of the                                               3rd July                       relating                             to
    the Taylor Report.

    We do not agree your interpretation of the direction,                   and
    indeed in your letter of the 21st June you r ai sed the question
    as to w h e t h e r we were ready to exchange u n d e r l i n e d copies of
    the Taylor Reports.

    Accordingly, we enclose herewith our u n d e rl ine d copy of the
    interim report of Lord Justice Taylor.  We have no underlings
    to make in respect of the final report.

    We now look forward to receiving your m a rke d up copies of the
    interim and final reports by return post in accordance with
    the directions.

    Yours .faithfully

Dear Sirs,

Hillsborough

We have still not received your underlined copy of Lord Justice
Taylor's Reports.  We remind you again that the consolidated copies
are due to be served tomorrow, but these cannot be prepared without
your copy.

We have the Engineers' copy of the report and, therefore,                                                                                        only you
are in default in this respect.

The original Order can still be complied w ith if you fax the
document to us.  We are quite content that this should be restricted
to the pages on which there is some underlining.

      YOUR REF                      PCM/PAB



     Dear Sirs,

     Hillsborough

    We refer tc our    telephone    conversation   today and confirm that
    we have received specific instructions from      our Clients that
    the various works currently being undertaken to the Grou nd
    will  in nc way involve the Leppings Lane          terracing. Our
    Clients are well aware of the need to leave     the Leppings Lane
    terracing ir. precisely the same physical state that it is
    currently ir. so that if and when an inspection by the Judge in
    this litigation occurs it will be a meaningful exercise.        The
    only caveat to the above, of which we un derstand you are fully
    aware, is that it is proposed that our ex pert engineers will
    be    carrying out certain tests on a barrier at the Leppings
    Lane end at 8.30    a.m. on Monday of     next week. This will be a
    "test to destruction" however we are told that the barrier
    will not he removed.      This test will be attended by your
    expert.   Shculd any work or further tests of a similar nature
    be carried :ut we will ensure that either you or your experts
    are notified well in advance.

    In   the light of our comments above . we understand that you
    intend to approach the Judge's Clerk and seek to have the
    application currently listed for M onday removed from the List
    on the basis that there is no possible urgency attached to
    this matter and presumably the m a tte r will now proceed along
    the lines suggested in your 2nd July letter.

    We    look forward to hearing from you later    today that                                                                                                                                                                   the
    application has indeed been removed from Monday's list.

Dear Sirs

Re:   Hi lls borough

'We thank you for your facsimile letter of 6th July and as requested
did leave a massage for Hr Kenzies that the application at Teeside
Crown Court on Monday the 9th July was not to proceed.

The background to this particular niatter is that we believed works on
the Leppings   Lane End of the ground were iiiininent, and at the
beginning of this month we therefore wrote to yourselves and Reynolds
Porter C hamberlain  regarding  the p ossibility of   the trial Judge
inspecting the ground prior to such alterations.

Unfortunately, we had not received a reply from you to our letter of
2nd July, although Reynolds Porter C hamberlain agreed that it was
necessary for the trial Judge to see the ground in its present fora,
and it was suggested by them that our Counsel's Clerk should liaise
directly w i t h the trial J u d g e ’3 Clerk to try and organise in the near
future a date for the trial Judge to inspect.

This approach to Mr. Justice Jowitt*s Clerk was, as you know, made on
the raorning of the 6th July and Mr, Justice Jowitt in fact directed
that an application should be made before him at Teeside Crown Court
at 10,30 on the 9th July.         Due to the unavailability of your Messrs,
O ^ a l la gh an and Doyle, Mr. Menzies sent us on the 6th July a facsimile
letter, the contents of which meaning no application was required at
this point.

We trust this clarifies the position.

Yours faithfully
HAMMOND SUDDARDS

Dear Sira

Se:     Hillsborough

We think you for your latter of 2nd July and acknowledge        safe   receipt
of your List of Documents.

With reference to the saue, va vondsr if you did note the consents of
rlr. Justice  i'teyn, deprecating the idea that lists should be served
dealing with docuuentation already disclosed at the Inquiry.

It appears to U3 that eoae of the documents on your list fall vithin
that category, and would ask that you provide us vith a further list
identifying by way of an asterisk those items not already disclosed at
the Inquiry.

            YOUR R E r       BN/PCM/PA3


            Dear Sirs

            Hillsborough

            We  thank yon for your letter dated the        6th July and
            acknowledge safe receipt of the Summons returnable on Tuesday
            24th July before Mr Justice Jowitt*

            We refer you to our letter of the 2nd July confirming our
            consent, to the First Third Party Notice, subject to the usual
            terms as to costs. We also enclosed our liist of Documents
            with that letter and would ask you to acknowledge safe
            receipt.

            With   regard   to  the   other  matters   raised ’in                                                                                      -recent
            correspondence/ we have the following comments to make

             (a)            We disagree with your interpretation of the direction
                            dealing with the Taylor reports, and despite serving our
                            underlined copy by post on the 4th July, we have still
                            not received in exchange your underlined copies of the
                            interim and final reports.    With respect, we consider
                            that your interpretation of the order is incorrect, and
                            would now ask you to provide us with those . u n d e r l i n e d
                            copies as soon as possible*

            (b)             We welcome your suggestion that Mr Justice Jowitt be
                            invited to make an inspection of the ground.  That would
                            be most helpful although we do not readily see the need
                            for Counsel to be in attendance*   This matter should be
                            resolved by agreement at the hearing on the 24th July.

            (c)            We agree that the Health and Safety documents which have
                           recently become available and were not provided to the
                           parties at the Public Inguiry, are not covered by


                                                                                                                                                   Contd.,/..

     We thank you for your letter dated the 9th. July acknowledging
     safe receipt of our List of Documents, and note your comments
     concerning the same.

     We confirm that all the documents referred to in our list were
     submitted to the Public Inquiry either by ourselves direct to
     the inquiry,   or via West Midlands Police save for the
     following

     Section 1

     Items 219, 220, 221, 222. please note that the Club’s safety
     documents   were  submitted   to  the  West   Midlands  Police
     investigation team and from those documents, together with the
     input from Sheffield City Council and other parties, the
     Treasury Solicitors produced a core bundle of documents
     relating to safety*    However, a large number of the Crub's
     safety documents   were not included in the core bundle*   For
     that reason, we have listed the Club's safety documents*    It
     is of course open to.you to simply rely upon the cpre bundle
     of documents if you so wish*

We no w revert t o th e s tate of the ground.                       Our expert has n oted that
two barriers, namely, 140 and 141 (specifically leg 3 of the former
and leg 2 of the latter) s h o w signs of da m a g e p r e - d a t i n g the
disaster.           In the c i r c u m s t a n c e s , we m u s t ask, specifically, that
these b a r riers be r e t a i n e d intact and untouched, so that they can be
v i e w e d by the T r i a l Judge.            Indeed, our expert w o u l d wish these
items to be r e m o v e d from t h e t e r r a c e s so that they can be a v a i l a b l e
to be p r o d u c e d in Court, but we u n d e r s t a n d there m a y be some

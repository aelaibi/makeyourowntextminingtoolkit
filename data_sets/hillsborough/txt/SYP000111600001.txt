           With regard to the incident at Hillsborough Football Ground,                                          I have

           to report my involvement and feelings as follows ~

           I started duty at 6am at E1 as force                                     cover until 8am when I collected

           PC 1594 Allott from his home address and went down to Niagara for the

           briefing.       I was in good spirits looking forward to policing the match

           after the success of last years semi-final                                          between the same two

           clubs, when everything had gone well with just a handful of arrests

■          rrjade,

           On arrival at Niagara we were briefed by senior o f f i c e r ^ | o                                        dur

           duties and who our partners were.                                      My partner w a s PC 1741 S q u ires
                                                                                                                        ■J
           from the    N o t t   in a h a m   s h j ■-p   P n 1 i rg>    f Vn g    R prt.inn   and we were to police the

           Mi dla nd Station pridr to the match,                                   receiving both Liverpool and

           Nottingham Forest supporters.

           We arrived at the station at approximately 1030am and some Liverpool

           fans had already arrived by train and were waiting transport by South

           Yorkshire Transport buses to the ground.                                        Most of them were    in good

           spirits although some had already been drinking and a number of

           arrests were made by the serials in attendance there for drunk and

           disorderly.           A number who had brought drink with them on the train
                                       ( \   12.6   /                              PAGE       £
                                                                                   R89

        had the drink confiscated from them or they poured it down the drain.

        A second train of Liverpool     fans arrived at the station and they w e r e

        a little rowdier than the first and on instruction from Chief

        Inspector King myself and PC Squires took our dogs from the vehicle

        and patrolled the area where the fans were being hfeld until they

        could be put on SYT buses and transferred to the ground.              Some of

        these fans d i d n ’t like this as they stated they had made arrangements

        to meet people in city centre pubs prior to attending the match,                but

        they were still ushered back into the waiting group and taken to the

                        any trouble.         We stayed at the station receiving the

©   7                4 0pm and then on instructions from PS 721 Hill,
        fans until 2.4                                                           we

        attended at West Bar to take an early meal.            Both myself and PC

        Squires remarked generally how well behaved the fans had been apart

        from the odd ones who had been arrested for drunk and disorderly and

        joked that we w o u l d n ’t get much overtime from this match as it would

        be a repeat of last years semi-final.

        We met up with PC 1594 Allott and his partner in the canteen and I

        believe at that time we were all          in good spirits,   laughing and joking

        again about the overtime and how PC Allott and his partner had been

        patrolling town centre, attending several skirmishes at pubs and how

        we had been down at the station,          doing nothing much.    We were still

        monitoring the radio on Channel 29 when we heard control ask PS Hill

        to send all his dog handlers from the town centre to the ground as

        assistance was needed urgently.           We heard PS Hill tell them to ring

        the canteen to inform us as we had gone in for early meal             but we

        managed to get through and tell them that we were already on our way.

        We went downstairs and as we were passing through the station

        sergeants office towards the garage where the vans were parked I

        remember a PC shouting to me ’Denise,           you used to work in Ops Room.

        Whats Operation Support mean?         ’   I h a d n ’t heard this come over the
                                                                                   PAGE       3
                                                                                   R89

radio and asked him what he meant and he said it had come o m                      the

radio that Operation Support was required at the ground.                    I informed

him then that it meant all available personnel was required at the

ground to assist with a serious          incident.       I then went to my van with

my partner and looked at my watch,           seeing that it was only 3.05pm and

saying to myself       ’t h e y ’ve only been playing 5 minutes.          I wonder

whats h a pp ened ?’   We arrived at the ground at 3.12pm and parked on

the central    reservation in Penistone Road outside the Kop end of the

ground.     A number of police vehicles were already there and officers

were stood looking bewildered.           No-one seemed to know what was

happening and what was required from us.                Then a call came from one

of the other handlers that we were to take the dogs                 into the g ro und.

I took my dog and went        into the ground and through gate            *0’ and stood

with the other handles n ear to the police              room at the top of the ramp

which leads down onto the pitch.            People were running around,           some

coming up the ramp with stretchers and people laid on them with coats

or jumpers over their heads.           It then hit me that people had in fact

died in whatever had gone off inside the ground and I remember

thinking,    perhaps selfishly,       I d o n ’t know    ’I hope the bobbies that

are in there are a l r i g h t ’ .   We were then instructed to take our dogs

back to the vans and remain with them until               instructed f u r t h e r .   Once

back at the vans we stood talking amongst ourselves,                  trying to work

out what had happened to result in p eo ple’s deaths.                 I c o uldn ’t make

anything much over the radio, all the transmissions on it seemed to

blurr into one.        Several Notts. Forest fans         came out of the ground

and said it was the Liverpool          fans that had invaded the pitch.

I remember watching       in awe as ambulance after ambulance passed by me

and went into the ground to be followed shortly afterwards by the

fire brigade.      An off duty doctor in his own car pulled up and stated

he had heard the radio message on local             radio and had come to help
                                                    I '(£ ? C / ^               F AGE
                                              ^                                 R89

 In the rear seats were his two young children and he asked if someone

  could look after them.         As I was the only policewoman around I stated

 that I would look out, fnr t.hua-        The children were both about 5 years

 old and were strapped in child safety seats so I left them there as I

 thought it would be safer than trying to keep them with me outside in

 the steady stream of fans that were now beginning to leave the

 ground.          I then saw all the other dog     handlers getting their dogs

 from the vehicles and going into the ground.                 I had to remain with

 the children as there were no other officers either male or female

 around.          At one point I seemed to be the focus of the fans because

 they kept coming up to me in a very aggressive a nd angry manner,

 spitting and occasionally punching me saying it was a l l my fault.

 Some of them were complaining that the gatemen had been letting fans

  in without tickets for a tenner a time and one very irate Liverpool

,f fan who refused to give me his name said he had seen a gateman^let in

  ten at once and his words were        ’He made one hund red pounds while

  people suffered and d i e d '.     The fans were very aggressive and angry

  continually converging on me saying what they had to say before

 making their way off towards city centre.              A number were banging on

 the car which contained the 2          young children and I        began shaking with

 fear thinking that          they might turn the car over so I moved away from

 the car shouting at them to take it out on me and not the children in

 the car.         They came towards me and I thought        ’This is it.     I ’m going

 to get it n o w ’ but       apart from being pushed around and spat on yet

 again and a couple          of punches to my body they went        away.   I went back

 to the car and comforted the children who were beginning to cry and

 got them laughing again talking of all things about                 ’Thomas the tank

 e n g i n e ’.    I again stood away from the vehicle so that the children

 would remain safe if any more irate fans came to me.                  I could hear

 coming from inside the ground cheers,            screaming and booing and began
                                                                                       PAGE        5

          to wonder what could possibly be happening to my colleague inside the

          ground because if I was being subjected to this abuse outside the

          ground, what was happening to them in there.

          The doctor then returned to his vehicle stating that there w a s n ’t
              i ^           'H-
          much more he could do.  I asked him what has happened and he told me

          that people had been crushed and he had seen about 30 people dead.                   I

          saw that he was very white and shaken.         I asked him for his name but

          he said he had given his details to someone inside the ground.                  He

          then drove away and I began to make my way towards the gro und when

          Inspector Phenix   came Out and asked me if I had s e e C ^ C ^ o w d a l T T


r         another of the handlers because he c ould n’t find him.

          all the time I had been stood outside the ground,
                                                                            I saicTT Ttadn't

                                                                     so he asked me to tak


rjr   ^   him round to the Leppings Lane end of the ground in the dog van to see

          if he was there.As we arrived at the Leppings Lane end all             I could see

          was a mass of red and white, Liverpool        fans were everywhere,      most of

          them surrounding what police officers        I could see, arguing with them

          and pushing them around.       Inspector Phenix got out of the van and told

          me to get back to the Kop end as soon as possible and get into the

          ground with other dog handlers.       Liverpool    fans began to come towards

          the van shouting and swearing,      some banging on the front of the van

          and I waited until they had vented their obvious feelings and then

          drove back to Penistone Road.       I went into the ground with my dog

          again through gate    ’O ’.   All I could see was ambulances,        their   crews

          and police officers    running around either to the ambulances or gym

          with people on stretchers.       Once onto the pitch I saw a number of dog

          handlers lined up in front of the Kop and others in the middle of the

          pitch between the Kop and the cordon of police officers that were

          across the pitch near the Leppings Lane end.           I stood in the middle

          of the pitch and looked around.        People and officers were running

          around everywhere with stretchers or just helping people on foot back
                                                                             PAGE     6
                                                                             R89

towards the gym.       Everything just seemed to be chaotic.        I looked

over towards the Leppings Lane end and I could see fans in the stand

above the terrace throwing things down onto the people and officers

below and thought       'Can't they see that people are hurt and we are

trying to help them*.        I was only on the pitch with my dog for about

5 minutes but it seemed like an age.           T h e n PS Dent came around

telling the dog handlers to return to their vans and try to get to

the points we had been given which for my partner and I was Brook

Shaws forecourt, at Shalesmoor.         We arrived there and got out of the

van, watching the steady stream of fans          coming passed.    Quite a few

of them came up asking for the telephone numbers to ring regarding

friends or relatives and I gave them the numbers they needed.

All the Liverpool       fans that I spoke to were well     in drink,   some of

them were even carrying cans or large plastic bottles of beer.                When

the stream of fans had finished we made our way into the town centre

and down to the Midland Station and waited until the fans had been

placed back onto their respective trains.           We were then told to stand

down and return to Niagara, which we did.           As I walked up the steps

into the club,    I    remember seeing amale officer sat crying        and I was

told that he had       been at the front and    had carried some of the

injured    and dead from the crush.        Other officers were just sat

around quietly with looks of sadness and disbelief on their faces and

it wasn't until       speaking to other officers that I realised just how

lucky,    if that's the word to use,     how lucky I was to have been stood

outside the ground with the children.           Then after a de-briefing from

Inspector Phenix we were stood down from duty at the ground and

together with PC       Allott   returned to E1where we went off duty at        8pm.

All   I can say in     closing is that I was    very frightened and upset by

the actions of the majority of Liverpool          fans towards myself and the

other people who were trying to help the injured inside the ground.

         Especially when on my own outside the ground,   the group of

         supporters advanced on me because I honestly feared that I would be

         caused serious injury and that even though I wanted to call for

         assistance   I didn't because I knew people inside the ground needed

         help more than myself so I would suffer the consequences and not add

         to the already large burden inside.

          Report on ay attendance at the incident at Hillsborough
          Football Ground.




With regard to the incident at Hillsborough Football Ground, I have to report
my inTolvment and feelings a6 follows:-


     I started duty at 6am at £1 as force cover until 8am when I collected PC
 1594 Allott from his home address and went down to Niagara for the briefing.
 I was in good spirits looking forward to policing the match after the success
 of last years semi-final between the same two clubs, when everything had gone well
with just a handful of arrests made.


     On arrival at Niagara we were briefed by senior officers as to our duties
 and who our partners were.     My partner was PC 17^1 squires from the Nottingham­
 shire Police Dog Section and we were to police the Midland Station prior to the
match, receiving both Liverpool and Nottingham Forest supporters.


     We arrived at the station at approximately 10350am and rome Liverpool fans
 had already arrived by train and were waiting transport by South Yorkrhire
 Transport buses to the ground.        Most of them were in good rpirits although
 some had already been drinking and a number of arrests were made by the serials
 in attendance there for drunk and disorderly. A number who had brought drink
with them on the train had the drink confiscated from them or they poured it
 down the drain.     A second train of Liverpool fans arrived at the station and
 they were a little rowdier than the first and on instruction from Chief Inspector
King myself and PC squires took our dogs from the vehicle and patrolled the area
where the fans were being held until they could be put on SYT buses and trans­
ferred to the ground.      Some of these fans didn't like this as they stated they
had made arrangements to meet people in city centre -pubs prior to attending the
match, but they were still ushered back into the waiting group and taken to the
ground without any trouble.      We stayed at the station receiving the fans until
2.*t0pm and then on instructions from PS 721 Hilly we attended at West Bar to take
an early meal*      Both myself and PC Squires remarked generally how well behaved
the fans had been apart from the odd ones who had been arrested for drunk and
disorderly and joked that we wouldn't get much overtime from this match as it
would be a repeat of last years semi-final.


                                                              Continue
    tte n t up with PC 159“* Allot: or..-: r if partner In the canteen and I beleive at that
time' we were all in good spirits, laufUue and joking again about the overtime and how PC
Allott Mid his partner had keen patrolling tow centre, attending several skirmishes at
pubs and how we had been down at the station, doing nothing much.      He were still monitoring
L e radio on Channel 29 when we heard control ask PS Hill to send all his dog lumdlers fro.
the town centre to the ground as assistance was needed urgently. Vie heard PS Hill tell
[he* to ring the canteen to inform us as we had gone in for early « H      but we managed to get
through and tell them that we were already on our way.

     lie went downstairs and as we were passing through the station sergeants office towards
the garage where the vans were parked I remember a PC shouting to me • Denise, you used to
work in Ops Boom. Whats Operation Support -ear.?'. I hadn't heard this come over the radio
ind asked hi. what he ..ant and he said that it had come o.er the radio that Operation
L p o r t was required at the ground.   I informed him then that it meant all available
lersonnel was required at the ground at asrirt with a serious incident.      I then went to .y
van with .y partner and looked at my watch, seeing that it was only % 05pm and saying to
myself, 'They've only been playing 5 minutes. I wonder what, happened?'          arrived at the
L u n d at 3.12pm and parked on the central reservation in Penistone Road outride the Kop end
 If the ground. A number of police vehicles were already there and officers were stood look­
 ing bewildered. No one seemed to know -hat was happening and what was required t r m us. Then
 I call cam. from one of the other handlers that we were to take the dogs into the ground.
 I took my dog and went into the ground through gat. 'O' M id stood with the other handlers
 lear to th. police roco at the top of the ramp which leads down onto the pitch.      People were
 Lining around, some coming up the ramp with stretches and people laid on them with coats or
 lumpers over their heads.   It then hit me that people had in fact died in whatever had gone
 Iff inside the ground and I remember thinking, perhaps selfishly, I don't know, • I hope the
 lobbies that are in there sr. alright.' W. were then instructed to take our dogs back to th.
 Vans and remain with them until instructed further. Once back at the vans we stood talking
 amongst ourselves, trying to work out what had happened to result in peoples deaths.          I

 jtouldn't make anything much over the radio, all the transmissions on it seemed to blurr into
 Le.   Several Hotts.Forest fans came out of the ground and said it was the Liverpool fans

 lhat had invaded the pitch.

       I remember watching in aw. as ambulance after ambulance passed by «      and went into the
  Lund to be   followed shortly aft.rwardr by the fire brigade.     An off duty doctor in his
  lwn car pulled up and stated he had heard the radio message on local radio and had come o
  help, in the rear seats were his two young children and he a.ked if -omeone could look after
  them. As I was the only policewoman around I stated that I would look out for them.      The
  Ihildren were both about 5yrs old and w.r. ,trapp.d in child saf.ty r.atr ,o I l.ft th.m
  L r . as I thought it would b. saf.r than trying to k.ep th. with m. out.id. in th. rt.ady
  stream of fans that were now beginning to leave th. ground.     I th.n saw all th. other dog
  landlers getting th.ir dogs from th. v.hicl.s and going into th. ground. I had to rema n
  lith th. children as there were no other officres either male or female around.      At one

      pfcint, I seemed to be the focus of the       fans because they kept cooing up to me in a very
aggressive and angry manner, tpittmg and            occasionally r_iching me saying it was all my             •
       Ip

fault.         Some of them were complaining that the gate men had been letting fanr without tickets          |
•in         for a tenner a time and one very irate Liverpool fan who refused to give me hie name said         :
he              seen a gate man let in ten at once and his words were ' He made £100 while people
suffered and died.'         The fans were very aggressive and angry continually converging on me              !
saying what they had to say before making their way off towrads city centre.             A number were        I
banging on the car which contained the 2 young children and I began shaking with fear thinking                j
that they might turn the car over so I moved away from the car shouting at them to take it out
on me and not the children in the car.            They came towards me and I thought ' This is it. I'm        1
going to get it now. • but apart from being pushed around and spat on yet again and a couple of               ;
punches to my body they went away.          I went back to the car and comforted the children who were
beginning to cry and got them laughing again talking of all things about ’Thomas the tank                     -
engine.'         I again stood away from the vehicle so that the children would remain safe if any­
more irate fans came to me.          I could hear coming from inside the ground cheers, screaming and         j
booing and began to wonder what could possibly be happening to my collegues inside the ground*
because if I was being subjected to this abuse outride the ground, what was happening to them

it there.

            The doctor then returned to his vehicle stating that there wasn't much more he could do.
I asked him what has happenidl and he told me that people had been crushed and he had seen
                                 *                        /

about 30 people dead. I saw that he was very white and rhaken. I asked him for his name but
he said he had given his details to someone inside the ground.            He then drove away and I began
to make my way towards the ground when Inspector Phenix came out and asked me if I had seen PC
Dowdall, another of the handlers because he couldn't find him. I said I hadn't all the time
I had been stood outside the ground, so            he a^ked me to take      him   round to the LeppingsLane
end of the ground in the dog van to see            if he was there.

             As we arrived at the Leppings Lane    end all I could see     wap    a masr of red     ana white
Liverpool fans were everywhere, most of            them surrounding what police officers      I couldsee,
arguing with them and pushing them around.             Inspector Phenix got out of the van and told me
    to get back to the Kop end as soon se possible and get into the ground with the other dog
    handlers.      Liverpool fans began to come towards the van shouting and swearing , some banging
    on the front of the van and I waited until they had vented their obvious feelings and then
    drove back to Penistone Road. I went into the ground with my dog again through gate 'O'. All
    I could see was ambulances, their crews and police officers running around either to the
    ambulances or gym with people on stretches.        Once onto the pitch I saw a number of dog handlers
    lined        in front of the Kop and others in the middle of the pitch between the Kop and the
    cordon of police officers that were across the pitch near the Leppings Lane end.         I stood
    in the middle of the pitch and looked around. People and officers were running around everywhere
    with stretches or just helping people on foot back towards the gym. Everything just seemed to
    be chaotic.      I looked over towards the Leppings Lane end and I could see fans in the stand
    above the terrace throwing things down onto the people and officer? below and thought,          ' Can't   ;
                                                                                                              s
they N e that people are hurt and we are trying to help them* *       I wap only on the pitch with
my dog for about 5 rr.inutes but it seemed like an age         then PS Dent came around telling the
   ‘m
    .

dog handlers to return to their van? and try to get to the points we had been given which for
my partner and I was Brook Shaws forecourt, at Shalenaoor*       We arrived there and got out of
the van,     watching the steady stream of fane coming passed. Quite a few of them came up asking
for the telephone    ntmibers to ringregarding friends or relatives and I gave then the numbers
they needed*


        All the Liverpool fans that I spoke to were well in drink, some of them were even carry­
ing cans     or large plastic bottles    of beer* When the Ftream of fans had finished we made our
way into     the town centre and down to the Midland Station and waited until the fans had been
placed back onto their respective trains.        We were then told to stand down and return to
Niagara, which we did*     As I walked up      the steps intotheclub, I remember seeing a male
officer sat crying and I was told that he had been at       the front and had carried some of the

injured and dead from the crush.        Other officers were just sat around quietly with looks of
sadness and disbelief on their faces and it wasn't until speaking to other officers that I
realised just how lucky, if thats the word to use, how lucky I was to have been stood outside
the ground with the children.     Then after a de-briefing from Inspector Phenix we were stood,
down from duty at the ground and together with PC Allott returned to E1 where we went off
duty at 8pm*

        All I can sfy in closing is that I was very frightened and uppet by the actionr of the
majority of Liverpool fans towards myself and the other people who were trying to help the
injured inside the ground.     Especially when on my own outside the ground, the group of
supporters advanced on me because I honertly feared that I would be caused serious injury and
that even though I wanted to call for assistance I didn't because I knew people inside the
ground needed help more than myeelf soI would suffer        the consequences and not add to the
already large burden inside.

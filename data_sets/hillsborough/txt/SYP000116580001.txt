           POLICE CONSTABLE 1543

           SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE,      HOYLAND




           On Saturday 15 April      1989 I was on duty at Hillsborough Football

           G r o u n d , Sheffield in connection with the FA Cup Semi-Final between

           Nottingham Forest and L i v er po ol .

           I attended at the ground with other officers at 9.45am that date and

           at 10.15am we were briefed in the North Stand by Senior Pol ice

           Officers.

           I was detailed to Serial         15 under the command of PS Burns and

           Inspector W h i t e .

           At 11.15am,    together with Serial        14 we went to the terrace

           immediately in front of the West Stand where both Serials were

           briefed by Inspector Whi t e .         The duty of our Serial was to search

           supporters entering the ground at the Leppings lane end of the grund

           by turnstiles 1-16.       These supporters were to be supporters with

           tickets for the West S t a n d .
                                                                            PAGE
                                                                            R19

The serial took up position at around 11.30am.              The gates were to

open at 12 noon.

On the outside of the turnstiles were another serial who were

searching supporters before they entered the ground.

At 12 noon when the turnstiles opened a small number of spectators

began to make their way into the ground.

By 2.30pm the volume of spectators             increased but even at this time

there was still ample time to search them as they came t h r o u g h .

The fans up until       this point were mostly good natured and in a jovial

mood,   although some had mentioned to me that Liverpool should have

had the other end of the ground,            because they had a bigger following

than Notts.     Forest.

About 2.40pm a fan appeared on top of the turnstiles.               He wasn't

wearing any f oo tb al 1 c o l o u r s .   I shouted to him to get back down to

the other side but he said he c o u l d n ’t because crowds were beginning

to gather o u t s i d e ,   I looked through the turnstiles and saw that the

crowd was beginning to buiId up but even at this stage there did not

appear to be anything out of the o r d i n a r y .       I shouted to the youth on

the roof of the turnstiles again to come down into the ground              (It was

my intention that       if he d i d n ’t have a ticket    to arrest him and take

him to the Police R o o m ) .      If he did have a ticket I would have taken

the ticket off him given him a stern warning and allowed him into the

ground.     One or two more youths then appeared on the roof and I

looked through the turnstiles and saw that there was by now a large

number of supporters gathering and some were complain ,ng of the

crush.    An Inspector then arrived at the scene and went on to the

roof of the turnstiles.           I thought at that time to remove the youths

on the r o o f .   He then went to the edge of the roof and began to help

supporters out of the queue on the other side and over the wall.                 A

number of fans came into the ground by this m e t h o d .         I stopped what
                                                                              PAGE       3]
                                                                              R19         i

fans I could and took the tickets off them because some were                              j

attempting to pass their tickets back through the turnstiles,                             i

obviously for supporters who had not got tickets on the outside.

Around 2.45pm,        the crowd outside was beginning to grow and supporters              :

were complaining.          A number of them were directing abuse at Police                ;

officers again stating that they should have had the other end of the                     :

ground,     calling us "Dickheads" and stating that the organisation                      !

could have been better.          It was obvious by now that large numbers had

gathered outside the turnstiles.           The fans who were now coming in

were being more aggressive towards the Police.               The men on the

turnstiles began having trouble with some of the supporters.                  Some

spectators hd gone to the wrong turnstiles with the wrong t i c k e t s .            I

spoke to one turnstile man who was complaining that a fan with a

ticket for the Spion Kop was attempting to gain entry.               I spoke to

the spectator and told him he would have to go to the other end of

the ground and he wasn't a d m i t t e d .    I told the turnstiles man that

should spectators have standing tickets to allow them through in view

of the crowd that had g at h e r e d .     (I had also heard e a r 1 ier a rumour

that a ticket toat was s e l 1ing tickets at the Leppings Lane end of

the g r o u n d .   They were tickets for the other end of the ground and

that he had gone when approached           by the Pol i c e ).                            i

By this time things were getting           more hectic and fans were still                j

coming over the wall at the turnstiles and we were helping them down                      ,

in case of i n j u r y .    At one stage   the top of a stone pillar had come

loose and I asked the supporters           to pass it down because if it      fell       ’

into the crowd someone would have been k i 1led or seriously injured.                     !

At this stage we were clearing people away from the turnstile area to                    ;

get them into the ground.          People coming     into the ground were now             !

complaining of the crowd o u t s i d e .     Some were breathless.     People            |

outside were shouting for us to open the gates and were waving their
                                                                              PAGE      4
                                                                              R19

tickets saying that they had got tickets and to let them.                Others

were complaining that a lot of them on the outside didn't have

tickets.    I then saw an officer on horseback trying to make his way

to the front of the turnstiles but appeared to be engulfed by

supporters who were still blaming the South Yorkshire Police for

giving them the wrong end of the ground.

A Police Constable then came from somewhere behind us and told one of

the stewards that he had        come to open the gate adjacent to the

turnstiles.     The steward     said that he wouldn't open the gates.          I

spoke with the officer and said that we couldn't open the gates and

that I believed there were a number of supporters outside who did not

have tickets.     He told me that he had come to open the gates because

of the volume of supporters outside and that the other gate had been

opened to ease the situation o u t s i d e .    This gate was then opened and

about two hundred supporters came through and then with PC Ford and

the stewards we closed the g a t e .    This had eased the pressure outside

considerably although there was still several fans outside.                Most    of

the fans that came in by        this gate,   I b e l i e v e , made their way to the

North Section of the t e r r a c e .

Things then got back to normality and I can recall             looking at my

watch at 3.02 and saying to PC Ford "They should have kicked off by

now’   Only a minute or so after this a fan came running from the

tunnel towards us and said that we should get in there because it was

bedlam.

With other officers I ran into the tunnel which was clear apart from

a few spectators making their way o u t .        On arrival at the end of the

tunnel I could see some spectators trying to climb the perimeter

fence but with the amount of spectators          in that section which was the

Centre South Section it was impossible to get near the front.                 With

other officers I began to move spectators at the back requesting them
                                                                             PAGE
                                                                             Rl 9

to go down the tunnel.          Some of them did so without question.        Others

wouldn't move,        telling officers to "Fuck off.       I ’ve got a ticket".

Eventually enough fans were moved and I moved forward to the

perimeter fence and began to help people out who had been injured.

These people were taken to the area of the tunnel and they were sat

against walls until medical attention arrived.              At this stage I do

not believe that anyone had realised the enormity of the disaster.                        I

then went back into the ground.            I then with another officer and

supporters carried out a man who was unconscious and took him to the

back.      I gave him heart      massage but he remained unconscious.       I was

then joined by a man who stated            he was a male nurse.    He examined the

man and stated he had a pulse and that he should be left in the               prone

position.        This I did.     By this   time I saw that a number of St

John's Ambulance Ambulances had arrived at the rear of the t u n n e l .                  I

asked some supporters to          'keep an eye'   on this man and I returned to

the t e r r a c e .   The situation of the terrace by this time was chaotic

and more people were asked to go out of the tunn e1 but still some

took no n o t i c e .    I then began to help people through the gate in the

perimeter f e n c e .     I saw that there were several people crushed

against the wall         just below the perimeter f e n c e .   They were lying in

a pile about four feet h i g h , there appeared to be a large n u m b e r .           It

was obvious that these people were dead and that a major disaster had

occurred.        I assisted in getting people through the gate and on to the

perimeter t r a c k .     A number of people were taken through this way.             I

eventually found myself on the perimeter track and supporters and

Pol ice alike were taking these people on makeshift stretchers to the

other end of the ground.           I went on to the field to assist where I

could.      On the fields I saw some supporters making their way towards

the Spion K o p .       They obviously wanted to vent their anger at the

Notts Forest f a n s .      I persuaded some to return to the other e n d .       A
                                                                             PAGE     6
                                                                             R19

cordon was put up in the middle of the field.             This was short lived

and I decided to make my way back round to the rear of the Leppings

Lane end as I knew that there was not a great number of Police

Officers.      I made my way round to that end again,         helping fans at

that end of the ground as well as other fans.            A lot of uninjured

fans were also in distress and I helped comfort some of them.                A

large number of officers had now arrived at the rear of the West

Stand by this time and I assisted with getting the injured to

ambulances nearby.       Whilst at the rear of the stand I saw a supporter

come round with a man I believe to be the Chairman of Liverpool F.C.

I heard the supporter to say to this man,           t h a t ’s the gate that was

opened, we d i d n ’t break it down,      it's not damaged.     I aaid that no

one had said that the gate had been forced open.              Some fans were

abusing Police Officers,         some called us murderers and some were still

complaining about Liverpool having the wrong end of the g r o u n d .

H o w e v e r , this abuse was taken by the officers and the majority of

Liverpool supporters were sympathetic towards us and kept the angry

element under c o n t r o l .   Several fans came and shook hands with me and

thanked me,     some said that they were sorry for the behaviour of a

small number of their f a n s .

By 4 . 30pm things began to e a s e , most of the crowds had l e f t , the

injured had gone to h o s p i t a l .   The relatives and friends of people

who were missing were directed towards the Pol ice room under the

North S t a n d .   I then returned into the terrace and saw that there was

a lot of d e b r i s , c l o t h e s , shoes etc scattered about on the t er ra ce.

I saw that a crash barrier had broken and Liverpool scarves were

hanging from i t . I then joined other members of my s e r i a l .        We made our

way to the North Stand and there we were d e b r i e f e d .

I also wish to add that w h i 1st on duty at the turnstiles,           just after

the crowd had been let through the gate,          the steward on the gate
                                                                        PAGE
                                                                        R19

         remarked to me that it was the worst crowd he had ever seen in all

         his years at Hillsborough.

          p p p h p t OK   FA CUP SEMI FINAL AT SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY, ON 15TH APRIL 1989

I first noticed that something was wrong more or less immediately after the ball had

hit the Nottingham Forest crossbar for I turned to my left to see the Liverpool

supporters swaying forward, something seen many times at football matches.
It was then that I noticed a spectator inside the perimeter fencing on the pitch and
realised that obviously there were problems at the Liverpool supporters end of the
ground. The Public Address system was very poor in volume although a number of
announcements were made. Later on when the volume was turned up an announcement by
the Liverpool FC Manager, Mr K Dalgleish, was heard without any problems at all.
The main complaint I have received is that the public did not know what was going

on and people felt that they could have been kept more in the picture.

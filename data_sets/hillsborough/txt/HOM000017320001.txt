Dear Mr Hurd

As you will probably be aware, the emergency lines of
communication, and liaison between the local authorities of
Sheffield and Merseyside during the immediate aftermath of the
events at Hillsborough on Saturday, was effected via officers
from the Emergency Planning Unit (EPU) of this Authority, who
have also maintained a considerable input during the ensuing
operation.

The coordination of major emergency planning falls within the
remit of the EPU enabling the Merseyside local authorities to
mitigate the effects of such disasters.

If there is to be a local government emergency planning
dimension to the intended Judicial Inquiry I should be pleased
if you would contact Lord Justice Taylor on my behalf and offer
                                                                                       ,
the assistance of the Chief Emergency Planning Officer
Mr w R Holland and members of his staff in an advisory role or
in any other capacity he may consider appropriate, as I believe
such a contribution would be invaluable.

Yours most sincerely




R

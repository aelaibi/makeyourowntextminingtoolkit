              gym      I saw a bout      ten bodies        lying     in one    section.         The     inju re d man was

              carried b eyond the dead bodies a nd                     placed on the ground,                 the first a id

              people      then took       over.

              We then      r eturned to the          pitch and s ta r te d to make our way acro ss

              towards      the L e p p i n g s Lane      terrace.        We did not          reach the terrace                  but

              think he had t rainers              on.                                                                ^

              i nstructions        of the Police.

              I made my way back             onto    the      pitch and saw a man             lying on the               pitch

              near to the N o r t h S t a n d and S p io n Kop.                I remember a bo ut            five         people

              by this man a nd           I saw one       of the five        shake      his    head as      if to          indicate

              that     the m an was       dead.      I cannot       d e sc ri be   the dead man at all,                    the

             pitch they had all               been    cleared.

Dear Sir,

Hillsborough

We refer to your letter of 16th February;

The civil trial is due to be heard in Manchester commencing on
2nd October with a six week time estimate.

In the nature of such proceedings, allegations of fault will be made
about the performance of various individuals and such allegations
will no doubt be widely reported.

Quite aside from the concern which we have about the presentation
of our client's case, it seems a matter of common sense that the
public hearing of the civil trial would prejudice any criminal
proceedings which might be taken.

We are, therefore, very concerned that the trial date is fast
approaching, without any decision having been reached in respect of
possible prosecutions.

In your letter of 16th February, you indicated that a decision might
be expected within "a reasonable time" after delivery of the Police
report in mid May.  Of course, we appreciate that the report was not
delivered within that timescale but, nevertheless, we shall be glad
if you can indicate whether a firm date for a decision can now be



                                                                                                                      /... contd

                       his    surname         or    address.           We    drove       straight          to S h e f f i e l d          and    there

                       iiiarg fiq      travel       delays      on     the way*             We     p a r k e d at    a pub          1 think       i u was

                       arriving          at    a b out    1 0 3 0 am.        We    had      something           to eat         and w a l k e d      around

                       to    find      a pub open,          but      couldnt          find       one    and     bought         a    cheap       football

                       and     ha d    a game.           I later       bought         one     can of       beer      from          a local        off

                       licence         and     then      found a       chip       shop      and had s o mething                    to    eat,

                       We    eventually            walked       down    to     the      gro u n d .       At    a b out    2       pm    I had s e e n        a

                       my    journey          to   the    ground       I had       seen       a lot       of s u p p o r t e r s         and    i saw a

As    I got       to    the     turnstiles                area        I was       able       to w a l k      straight               through

lot    of    people          waiting         at      the    turnstiles                 but      the r e    was       no    crush,          and

the    queues were              orderly-                I waited            for       just      a couple          of m i n u t e s          m

along       the     tunnel          quite       freely           a n d w h e n we          got     to     the     end we            turned

right        and    entered           pen 3 firs t .                  I had         not    seen any Police                      or S t e w a r d s

in the        tunnel          area and          the        only       sign       I could          see     p r io r    to       entering              the

tunnel        was       for    the     stands.              As     I entered              pen 3        I started            to w a l k          down

towards           the    f r ont      but      it was        full        a n d we         could        see    that        to     our       left       in

nap          At    this       time      it w o u l d        have        been about              1 430      pm.       My mates              went

up     towards          the    back       of      the      pen     but       because            I am      only 5*3             half       I walked

down        towards          the     f r ont     as       I wanted           a good          view.         There        was         still

 plenty       of       room     in this           pen at         this        time.           1 walked         straight               down       to

stand        behind          the     goal       at    grid       reference              K8,       I s a w no          one       drinking             in

mesh.          I was         here     on my          own.        Over         the     next       25 minutes               the       pen

 gradually             filled        up m o r e       and more              and     there was             no s p a c e         at    all

 had    started           to    run       out     onto      the        pitch          I felt       this      terrific               weight

were    these          Police          on the            other       side      of    the     fen c e .        The      c r u s h was

tremendous             and       the        p a i n was        intense.             I was       lucky      that      my       face    was

jammed         against           the        fence        because           I managed         to    breath        but      I knew           I

was    getting            weaker           and         I thought           1 was     going        to    die.        I could          feel

arms     all       over         the    top         of ms.          I remember          realising           that        a gate        to my

about      15- to S O m i n u t e s .                    I saw a Pol ic em an                immediately               in front           of

me    through          the       fence            who    shouted           at me     to k e e p        breathing,             and a f t e r

about      a minute              after            that    a    bloke        b e h i n d me      t o l d me     to      hold      on to

back     and       there         was        more        room       he a n d    I wa s      helped        further          back where

it h a d       seemed           to    clear.             I had        s e e n a lot        of     people       on e i t h e r        side

of me at            the      fence          wh o       were      lying      on the g r o u n d           M/ho a p p e a r e d        to bs

from           the s t a n d s        if     I wanted           to    be    p u l l e d up but           I said          "1    cant, i

cant lift         my arms             u p."         I was        given        a jumper        by         someone          to w i p e the

blood      off        my    f ace          an d    eventually              I walked        back        into      the     tunnel,

M.'hich was           still          full         of    people        but     there     was       enough         room     by this

           fireman       giving       me       oxygen.          I can v a g u e l y          remember        people        a r o u n d me

           but    the    n ext      thing       I can         properly            is b e i n g   in h o s p i t a l .      I had

           been      taken     to    the N o r t h e r n G e n e r a l             Hospital.          I was     treated         but

           discharged          later       that        nig h t -        My    friends        eventually         f o u n d me

           there      and     drove       me    home       that        night.

           I h ave      now    got    the       use      of    everything             back.

           I didnl       see a n y t h i n g         I consider              to    be a c r i m i n a l    offence         that

           day-       I think        that       once       everyone           had     realised        just     what      had

           happened,          did everything                  they      could        to help,         I think        the     cent r e

           ar e as    should        not    be       c a >3 e d a n d    I feel        there      should      be m o r e

           Policemen          inside       with        the     crowd         that     should      be a b l e    to      communicate

           to    others       as    soon       as    there      are      problems.

were      collected               in b e t w e e n       the     turnstile            entrances.                Sticks          from     flags

were      also       confiscated and                     generally           there         were     no     objections              to    these

orders.           It w a s         also       established after                     consultation with Police

also      c o n f i s c a t e d as         it w a s        thought         t ha t     these       could         be    dangerous            when

stood       on due           to    surging          of     the    crowd,          etc.



A    s m al l   group         of y o u t h s        near       to m y      turnstiles             were      seen          to a s k      people

if    they       ha d    tickets           to      sell,       these       were       moved       on,      under          the

supervision              of       Inspector          Booth,          on 2 o c c a s i o n s .




Many      people         of       the 2 0 - 2 8      year        old    region appeared                    to    have        been

drinking,            although            o n l y 2 or 3 s e e m e d               the      worse       for w e a r , t h e s e           were

turnstiles,              explaining                that     they       had      tickets          f\>r the N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t

occurrence.



At    approximately                    3.06pm       (1506)        t hat      date,         I was       approached               by P o l i c e

ordered         me      to    shut       my     turnstile            and     permit         no-one         else       to     enter       the

    I was     wanting            vNs h e l p    but       d i d n ’t k n o w w h a t      to do       for       the    b&s't, so

    together          with Police              Constable           338 Mackay           I made        my w a y        to    the       gate       at

    the    fronvA)f          the L e p p i n g s          Lane     fence,        behind       the     goal.           The       g a t e wa s

    opening          and    people        were       struggling           to     get    out    in the           panic.           I c a n ’t

    rememfcier how,              but     I suddenly             had    hold      of a m a n      from       the       crowd.            With

    Police        Constable            Mackay        I dragged           hi m 2 0 y a r d s N ^ n t o       the       pitch        so as         to

    avoid      other        officers           and    fans,        and    give        the m a n aiSr to           breathe.                 He

    was    put       into    the       recovery           position         by me       and Police           Constable              Mackay

    cleared          anything          in his        mouth.           Once      his    a i r w a y was      cleared             he was

  xX o u g h i n g    and    breathing,              but a l i v e ,       he    started       to m o v e        himself.               I f elt

    tha^N^is           man would           be a l r i g h t        so w i t h P o l i c e      Constable              M a c k a y we           ran

    back     towards         the       gate.         People        were      being      pulled        cl ear      now       but w e r e

    blocking          up    the     gate       area,        so we       pulled        them    further           onto       the     pitch

    away     from      the       trouble.            The     walking         wounded         were     asked       to m o v e          on a n d

    generally           they      did     so,    moving          towards         the m i d d l e      of    the       pitch.            Fans

    were     screaming            and     crying          and    shouting         at    me,    they wan te d               their

lifted above             the       fen c e .        I turned        to      see      if P o l i c e        Constable             Mackay

was    w i t h me       to    help       but    he w a s n ' t ,       there         were       so m a n y        people         around          it

was    impossible             to    see       him    or a n y o n e      else        frohi. m y       se r i a l     or     t ha t     I

•new.        As    I turned             to    the    fence       again        I saw C h i e \ Su pe ri nt e nd en t

Nesbit       make       his w a y        to    the    fe nc e .        He     looked        to       be    t ryi n g       to    help

people       get     over      the       fe nc e,     he    then       turned         and whilst                facih^rne             said,       "

My^God,        th^re         could       be 2 0      dead     he re ".         Somehow           I got          hold       of a y o u n g

gi rl,    may      l o V e a r s , who          was     alive       and       crying        froV^the              fence         area.        I

took     her      onto       the    pitch and           took      hold        of a St J o h n s            Ambulanceman                to

let    him     take      o v er     fro\tne.               I s t a r t e d to t r y             and       find     someone           I knew,

eventually           seeing         P o l i ce c o n s t a b l e       2507        Wilkes.            I was        wet      through

with ^ w e X ^ a n d          had       lost    my     helmet       somewhere.                  I stood           for      a moment

with Police             Constable             Wilkes       whilst        I    got m y       b r eat>\^ba c k , w h e n an

Inspector          too k      horciNqiy         arm and          t o l d me        to j o i n    the       Police          cordon       being

formed       in the m i d d l e              of^thpitch          to stop            any         Liverpool           fans        who were

upset     causing            trouble          with      N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t fans.                   This       I did.          From

this     position            I could          see m i n o r      skirmishes              break        out        in b o t h      sta n d s ,

obviously          between           fans       who    were       upset and vheir                    rival       supporters.                 I

re m a in ed      in the       Police           cordon where                I was t h e n ^join ed               by P o l i c e

 Unstable          2768 Goddard                 from my          serial and soon                 others          arrived         also

from Serial             9.



Shortly        after,         I saw Po>jce              Sergeant             Jessop        come       from        t h ^ Leppings

Lafre s i d e      of    the       pitch       towards        us.        He    was      trying            to     locate         the

remainder          of    the S e r i a l .           The    c r o w d w as         then dispersed                  and      the       cordon
                                                                                                                              C/97
was    stood       down.           We    were       told    to    go     to    the N o r t h ^t^and for                     a d e — br ie f,

where     Superintendent                     Greenwood        spoke          to all        those          p re s e n t .

                                                                                                                            S1863

            A   short     t i me   after        we    went   onto     the      bus   area     of P e n i i t o n R o a d   to

             ensure      tha t     fans    got       straight    on      the    buses    to    t ak e    therri to   the    train

             station.        There        was    no    trouble      at    t h is     location and         everything        was      in

             o rde r .



             Once   the     crowd       h ad    dispersed       we w e r e      stood    down       and wal ke d     to

             Claywheels          Lane     for    transport       b ac k     to W o o d s e a t s    Police      Station.        We

  large      number      of officers           ran down with them              forming a lose             c ordon

accr o s s     the    pi t ch walk i n g       the fans        back    up towards          the Leppi n g s          Lane

w h i c h smelt       heavily of          intoxicants.            They d i r e c t e d their anger              at       the

                 'th verbal         abus e and             insults.      A couple       of the      press

                     rs were ^attacked by a couple of                       the more        drunken -fans,

w hilst      other     fans though only a siiia11                   pr o po ration seemed           i nt ent        on

A t h i ck     cordon was         formed       close       to the half way            line with a 1a r g s

number       of officers.

Though at        this     time     I still         was     unaware     of what        had taken         place

earlier        either     fighting,          pitch         invasion or what.            More    obviously            de

fans were        being     carried         from out          of the    crowd on

the    pitch so along wit h a few other                         officers       we walked up to the                   goa

again     they smelt         heavily         of    intoxicating          liquor.        The m a j o r i t y     of the

casualties           had now been          r emoved        from the      pitch so       I returned to the

cordon along w i t h half w a y                line.        Shortly afterwards              this was        cut      by-

half    and     we spread         out     in a thick          line along       the     pitch.Some         of the

fans    had     started      to     leave the ground,              one    of w h i c h stood

and openly u r i n a t e d         infront         of the      police     line.       M any of the          fans wer

very    e m o t i o n a l ly d i s tr es s e d     though others          were    heav i l y    intoxicated

wit h drink and           continued          to be abus i v e and          insulting         to the Police.

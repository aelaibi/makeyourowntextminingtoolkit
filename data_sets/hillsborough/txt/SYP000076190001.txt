     We    got to the Lejajings Ln entrance about 2 . 5 5 p m                       (1455)         there were        no

      rderly queues             just a mass       of    people.

     I saw two          police    horses who          came through the        crowd by the outer                  gates,

          also    saw a ,few p o liceme n         on foot and one or two stewards                        by the

     outer       gates    but    I received       no directions         from them.

     I e x p er ie nc ed      no d if fi c u l t y finding my entry           point a part from the

     pushi ng and sho ving              of the    crowd.       I ente red the gr ound thro u g h the

     correct       turnstile and gave my ticket up.                       I saw no gates             open other

     than the          turnstiles and w i tn es se d          no u na u t h o r i s e d entry.

     W i t hi n the ground we didn't                  look for signs       showing       us where         to go for

     the    t e r racing      because we knou^^tTe tunnel               giving you access                to

     in order to move             forwards apart          from the      crowds      of people.            I

     had no d i f f i cu lt y finding my first m a t c h viewing                      point        because       1 knew

     where       to go between my entry                point and taking           up place         in the      terraces

    ground, he had no/'shirt on and his jeans was ar o u n d his thighs
    exposing his jrfnderparits. I w ould say that

                                                     I looked at him an d he a p p e a r e d to me to be

    this man up and they w a l k ed                      up the terracing      towards     the tunnel.

    I d o n ’t think        I would          recognise       the man    I saw die again,           he had no

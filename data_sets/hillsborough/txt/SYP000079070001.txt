               I am a Liverpool Fan and I travelled to the Semi-Cup Final at

               Hillsborough on the 15 April           1989 150489 with a number of my friends,

               We travelled down in a p r iva'^»'fy organised coach called Amberline and

               we left from Woodside at           10am that morning.

              We turned off the motorway and went along side roads through hilly

               country.         We didn't stop on route to Sheffield and I c a n ’t remember

               meeting any delays on the way.

               We arrived in Sheffield at about           1pm 1300 and I think the coach was

               parked near to Claywheels Ln and then we walked to the ground from
                                                                                 PAGE      2

there.

It was about a fifteen minute walk to the ground and I didn't see any

fans drinking alcohol and there w a s n ’t any incidents of drunkertess or

fighting outside the ground.

We were not escorted to the ground by any Policemen but they were on

duty on the way to the ground although they were not directing the

crowds as such,    only more on traffic duty.

We went and bought some souvenirs outside and some cigarettes and then

we waited outside and had a smoke before we went                in because we were



When we got outside Leppinay Ln entrance              it was about    1.30pm 1330 at

that time there was a rurfmber of people outside but t h e r o a d was             clear

and there was no pujaning at the turnstiles

There was one         ceman on Horseback when I arrived and there seemed

to be a Policeman on each turnstile entprftce.

I knew my entrance       point and I w a ^ e a r c h e d   by a Policeman before I

went    in through the tur nst i            once inside      I was searched more

thoroughly by anotiher i najjffTe the ground



before.     I went through the terrace turnstiles at the right of the

entrance to the ground.

My ticket was checked and taken at the turnstile and I have kept the

stub,

              had to go back to the coach to take back a flag he had

because they wouldn't       let him into the ground with it.            We waited

outside near to the toilets of the tunnel              entrance.

       came back at about     1.43pm 1345 and we all went          into the ground

through the tunnel,       except for                       who had a ticket for the

Stands.

While    I was waiting    I saw a steward outside the tunnel           but he w a s n ’t
                                                                                 PAGE    3

directing the people he was talking to someone.               We saw the Police

searching people as they came in but they weren't directing either.
           D K l t C n o N  Si         I
I never noticed any signs directing people to either side of the

ground.     I went down the tunnel as I did last year and I went to the

right hand side in Pen 3.

I stopped there about halfway down in the centre of the pert with

                  and we waited there until about 2.30pm 1430 and during

that time there was a lot of pushing going on,               I think people were

coming    in too fast from the back.

We decided to move forward then to go and meet up with the rest of our

group at the front.

We went up with the rest and stopped there talking,                 there seemed to be

plenty of room at that time.

More   people came into the pens and at about 2.40pm 1440 there were

more people around us and I remember having to push people back with

       so that            could tie his shoe laces up.

I thought        it was a normal   crush at that time but I realised something

was wrong just before kick off time,              there were people screaming and

shouting towards the front of me and to my right.
                                    T    >    ©    W      -PiTX-M
I remember the players coming onto the pitch and then the crush

started to get worse.           I remember also that my arm was getting numb

with the pressure.         I managed to get       it free and I held my both arms

above the crowd.

I heard               call out 1              help me."

          was    in front of       and I reached out but there was nothing          I
                               /
could do for him,        thsrpeople     in front were packed too much I couldn't

push f^hem out of jfne way to get to him.

          was facing me and I saw him pass out and his head drop onto

          ho i                 was still facing fowards at this time.        There

was another       lad next to me who      I d i d n ’t know and he was passing
                                                                         PAGE        4

out and falling so I caught him and tried to hold him up and kept

talking to him.

      turned around to me and shouted that              had passed out as well

and he started to panic at this time.

I shouted to him to calm down and I saw           trying to bend over

pulling at           and attempting to keep him from failing

I stopped in this position for some time and theiyrall of a sudden the

crush seemed to stop and I could move siightlj^ again

I moved to my right and managed to cl|mb o ^ r     the fence    into the next

pen a nd I noticed        was behind me       he got into the next pert with

me.

We went    back to the fence looking for          and            I saw

over the crowd and he was    passed over into our pen and                came

over also.    Both of them                 by Policemen onto the pitch,

I kept my eye on                    tim go onto the pitch.      I tried to go

onto the pitch but we were       pped by Police from going on there.

I walked to the back of the pert and I could see               and he looked

as though he was still    breathing but I c oul dn ’t see

After about    10 minutes we went down and was allowed to get onto the

pitch.

          had gone by then and we found                  and he was still

awake and looking for us.

We sat down on the pitch and had a drink of water and then we walked

around to see if we could find anyone else.

We eventually met up with        and         , most of the injured had been

taken away.

I heard a message over the tartoy for everyone to leave the pitch.              We

left them which was after 4pm 1600 and went alongside the North Stand

and into Leppings Ln.

I saw a number of dead people lined up adTtside the goal mouth at one

                time but I d i d n ’t recognise any of them in the crush.

                We went to a house nearby to phone home and then to the coach.

                The only trouble I saw when I was on the pitch was fans pushing

                photographers about who were trying to take         photographs of the dead

                When the crush started I remember seeing about four Policemen at the
TO
J2je.           fencing on the pitch and one of tfarem seemed to be talking into his
TMCi^Gc
S / M T 1/      radio for some time.

O ffic tC S     The fans managed to open          gate at the front to let people out and
     fc«S3
                it was shut again by          Policemen,    it was opened again by policemen

                       they allowed atmut 20 fans to get out before they closed it.          The

                It se>fnsd-<o me that the Police there d i d n ’t know the scale of what

                was going on,      they must have thought    it was just a normal   incident and

                were transferring fans      into other pens.

                In the end the Police helped and tried to get people backwards away

                from the fence.

 CVTT           It wasn't organised a ' / ' a . l l and could have been handled a lot better.

                Last year I went tjr the same area of the ground but there seemed to be
CoMM^kTT,
                more                ear and it appeared to have been Policed last year.

                I think\th€y»^ could have been stewards on duty directing the crowd as

                you got to the tunnel entrance or even at the end of the tunnel.

                If there had have been more first aid people on duty or wire cutters

                to get the fencing down.

                I think fences are needed to keep the fans back because they can ruin

                a match when they get onto the pitch but the must be a way of getting

                them open quickly if need be.

                I w a s n ’t injured in the crush and I d i d n ’t attend hospital or seek

                medical    help.

             About,      7.50       am       on       Saturday,             13th     April           1989,      I     cameon          duty          at.

             Edlington             Office             due    to       commence            duty       at    S . 00   am.

             Together          with          other          Edlington             officers            I travelled            to       Doncaster                DHG

             for       parade       and       briefing                at    S . 43    a m.

             Whilst        there         I was           allotted            to      drive       a    Transit         vanfor      my           serial          to

             Sheffield,             Sgt.          2627       Ashton          being         in    charge.            We     arrived             at       the

             ground        and      attended                at    the       briefing            and       together         with       my       detail          were

            ’i n    position            at    the        junction            of Penistone                  Road     and     Herries             Road          by

             11.10       am.        I    remained                at    that       location            until         shortly       after             3     o ’clock.

             PC     2967      Frost          and       I were          stood         on    the       roundabout,            other          officers                on

             the       detail       being             P C ’s 9 0 0         Dawson,         PC    2804       McFarlane,            PC       174          Welch,

             PC     2903      Greatorex.

             Pedestrian             traffic              built         up    gradually               but    the      majority             of    supporters

             passing          us    were          Nottingham                Forest         suporters            but      I saw        a    number             of

             Liverpool             supporters                shortly           after         the      ccunmencement              of       licensing

             hours       drunk          and       a    good       many       of      them       carrying            cans    of    beer.                 However

             this       was    not       just          Liverpool              supporters              but     Notts        Forest          supporters                   as

             w e 11 .

             Traffic          on    the       road          became          busy      especially              with       coaches           but          began

             quietening             down          after          E.3D       pm.
                                                                                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                                                                                  R155

Approaching                3       o ’ clock           it    was       clearly             evident           that       the    majority           of

Notts       Forest             supporters                   had    arrived                at    the     ground          but    the      Liverpool

supporters             were             still          streaming                down       towards           the    ground           from    the

opposite          side             of    the        roundabout.                      However,           we    were       constantly              being

asked       by    Liverpool                   supporters                   in       cars       where     they       could          park     their

cars    right          up          till       the       last       minute             and       the     fans       were       directed           up    past

Niagara          on    the          main           road.

As    the       time       neared             kick          off,       I was          stood       near        the       Sergeant          and     heard

on    the       radio          about          problems             being             experienced              at    the       Leppings           Lane

end    and       repeated                requests                from       somebody,             I. b e l i e v e       Supt.        Marshall             to

open    the       gates             or       people          were          going          to    get     killed.

I then          heard          a    request             that       all          available             officers           attend        at    the

Leppings          Lane             end       which          I did          together             with     all       my    serial.

On    arrival          the          forecourt                into          the       ground       was        cleared          of    fans     and

there       were       a       number             of    mounted             officers             present           and    numbers           of    police

officers          milling                about.

A    drunken          Liverpool                   supporter                was       stood nearby              and       about       twenty           or

thirty          Liverpool                    supporters            were             in    the near           vicinity          the     majority             of

them    drinking.

We    were       then          instructed                   to    form          a    cordon       and        prevent          any     more

Liverpool             supporters                    into         the       ground          until        further          notice.

The    drunken             supporter                   mentioned                earlier          began        arguing          with       one     of       t he

mounted          officers                    insisting            on       his        r i g h t to      enter       the       ground        and

unfortunately                      he        was       knocked             over      and        I believe          the    horse        stood          o n hirn

After       a    few       minutes                stood          outside,             I saw       Supt.        Marshall             hurry        towards

us    and       told       us       to       go     into         the       ground          as    -our    help       was       needed.            At    that

point       I thought                   that       there          had       been          crowd       trouble           and    on     entering             the

terraces          saw          that          there          were       a    large          number        of    people          on     the    pitch          I

thought          there             had       been       a    pitch          invasion.

However,          I seem                to    remember             that             the    pen    I entered              was       e m p t ^ .and t h a t
                                                                                                                PAGE 3

                                                                                                                R155

one    of the        barriers        inside    the    compound was            twisted and collapsed on the

ground.

I    believe     I     saw    a number        of    shoes     on    the    terracing         but       cannot    be       sure

whether it was then or minutes                       later when I was on the perimeter track.                                I

walked onto           the    perimeter        track through          the      gate which was            open and then

saw a man being carried towards me and it was obvious that he was dead and

I then       saw a further            two    who    were     in the same way which came as a great

shock...      I hurried         towards       the    pen     where      the     people      were       coming    out       and

assisted       with     carrying          two bodies       out,    they had been passed out and they

were both laid on the grass to the left of the goalposts                                           (facing down the

ground) I cannot remember what any of these people looked like or what they

were waering.

However,      whilst         there    it was       obvious     that       there      was    insufficient         room to

lay the people down and I tried together with other officers, including an

Inspector,       to clear more              ground to the left of the goals.                           However,          there

were large numbers              of Liverpool supporters                   wandering about,              again many of

them    drunk     and       continually        getting       in the       way,       some   of them       saying          they

were looking for a friend or relative or acquaintance.

The     scene     was        one     of     total    confusion          and      I    was        not   aware        of     any

organisation,          but     due *to the          fact    that     it had happened               so unexpectedly,

this is not surprising.

By    this    time     numbers       of the        Liverpool       supporters,            including      particularly

youths of 17-25 age group, many of them the worse for drink, began shouting

abuse    at     the    Notts       Forest     supporters          who    they     reckoned were           laughing          at

them.      A number of them began running up the field towards the Notts Forest

end, together with other officers I followed and turned them back.

Once    this     had    been       done     their     rage    was       turned       on    us,    we   formed       a     line

across the field and I was stood on the left hand side together with Police
                                                                                                                n

Constable      Brookshaw    (Al),   Police     Constable    3131   Lewis   (FI?)   and   whilst

there,   was    subject    to quite     an   amount   of abuse,    "You black bastards",        "I

hope you're fucking happy now you bastards", and others.

A lot of it was also aimed towards the F.A.

I remained at this point until about 4.35 p.m. when I returned to my serial

on Herries Road.

Whilst   I had been in the ground I never saw any stewards,                 at the Leppings

Lane end especially on entering the ground.                Throughout the period I was in

the ground I had no idea what was going off as I had become separated from

my serial.

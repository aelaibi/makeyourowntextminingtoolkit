           INQUEST INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER


           Thank you for your le tte r of 18th April to the Attorney General.    I have been
           asked to reply.


           The Attorney General's power under section 13 of the Coroner's Act, only applies
           where a coroner has refused or neglected to hold an inquest (a situation which
           does not apply in this case), or where an inquest held by a coroner has been
           concluded and one of the criteria set out in section 13 applies.   In this instance
           the inquest has not yet been concluded and accordingly the Attorney General has
           no jurisdiction to consider the m atter which you have raised.




           STEPHEN L PARKINSON

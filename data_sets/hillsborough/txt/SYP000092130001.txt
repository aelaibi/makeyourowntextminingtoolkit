There were also a bout                   three others        in our   party who     I d i d n ’t know but

                   w ou ld know their             details.

We made ondv^p-e               stop      prior to getting        to Sheffield,        that    being at a

count ry j f u t i l    just       outside Sheffield.           I can ’t remesfer       the    name of the

pub ac e xactly where                   it was        We had a couple          drinks and something

t/5 eat.       Some of the              lads had a game        of poo,       We were    the only

ninety m inutes and e v en tu al ly             left and carried on into Sheffield.                       I

do not    remember       if there were any traffic                delays       on the       way.



We a r r iv ed    in S h e f f i e l d at about    two o ’clock         (1400)    and     parked up     in a

side    street w hich        ran off    the main        road    leading towards          the ground.

The main     road was        on a hill.



We   left the van and w al k e d towards                the ground.        We split       up    into our

various    groups after         leaving        the van.        I wa lk ed with

                       and                          There were P o l i c e m e n on the way to

the ground,        but w e / d i d n ’t need any d irec^fons             to the ground as we knew

the way.         I a t t e n d e d ITFie cor responding        semi   final     m atch at

Hillsborough         last year.        At the bottom of the main                 road we were

s top pe d by a group of Police who were                   checking       fans for alcohol.             We

d i d n ’t have any and        carried on through some                supporters who did have

cans    of beer were         stopped by the Police and told to either                          leave    them

b ehind or drink them up.               Most     of them just         drank     up.     I did not

witness any disorder            or any fighting,           neither       did I see any

drunkenness.          It was a happy atmosphere.



We a r ri ve d at the        turnstile a rea       in Lepcy^ngs Lane at about                  twenty    five

to three.         (1433)      The   turnstile arejiTin between the t urnstiles and

the outer        perimeter     gates was        packed wit h      people.        There were        no

queues,    just an u n o r g an is ed m^6s         of    people.        There were also a lot of

people    standing a ro u n d       in t n e    area outside          the gates,      probably waiting

to get to the         turnstiles.        We went        thro ug h the     left hand gates and

joined the        rear of the       crowd.       W it h i n a few minutes         it became        crushed

in the    crowd so we         left the     crowd and stood back                from the gates.           I

saw a lot of supporters              sitting      on the walls          next    to the    turnstile

area,    probably getting away from the                   crush.        I could hear        children

                             o l s
          behind us and we were            enclo se d      in Wre turnstile area.                 We made our way

          across      the    rear of the     crowd towards             the    river where      the re was a bit

          more    room.      Bot h sets    of irjsw outer gates were                  closed at      this    time,

          w hich was        probably between quarter              to three       <1445)    and ten to three.

          (1450)       We wa lk ed behind the            crowd and even tu al ly saw a concertina

          type    gate at the        rear of the turnstile               block and to the           right    hand

          side    of the block as you           look from L ep pings Lane.                 We went        towards

          this    gate,     w hich   I now know to be g % & €            ’C ’ , which was         closed.     There

          were a few other           people standij>g in front                 of this    gate as ki ng      the

          concertina gate was            ojadsned from the         inside       I think.       As soon as the
<3f7TT£
          gate    started to q^ren we went            through          it and got       into the ground.            I
CCcW-                                                                   Other    supporters        star te d to walk

          about,/ive        to three.      <1455)        We all        had our tickets         in our hand         ready

          to hand them         in as we went       through the gate,              but there was           nobody

          there     to take them.



          Once    inside      the ground we stood at              the    rear of the tj^ns t ^ l e s         for a

          minute      or two because we had seen a couple                       of J>fe o th er lads from our

          as we     came out of the toilet/.                We    thought       this was the only way to

the terraces,         so we all made for the             tunnel    as well.



I did not see any sort of disorder                     inside    the g r o u n d .     did not       see

any people drinking            or any drunkarffneXs.



We all wa lk ed along          the tamnel       together.        It was     pretty tight       inside

the     tunnel    due to theyfirnount of          people      in there.        However,    we were

still able        to keep VTo v ing a l o n g .       I. did not see any stewards             or

policeme n e ither/at          the entrance        to the tunnel         or a ny wh er e    inside    it,

This was my fi&St            time    in using    the    terraces at Hillsborough,              at the

cor responding m a tc h        last year      I was     in the seats       in the West Stand.



All     the way along        the     fnne1,   I had been along           the    left hand side,        and

at the end of         i t !/:«<=      carried to the, left and            into what        I now know

to be pen numbeiyfour,                I was   c arried/ln there          by the m ov em en t       of the

crowd.



W hen    I entered     pen four       I was still       in company with                                We

had become s e p a ra te d from                 and                            and myself were

carried across         to our       left as we got       into    the    pen.     I d o n ’t know what

time     it was,    but the game        had kicked off an d was            in progress.            I was

carried a few feet            to my    left and then felt myself                being m oved

forwards     down the        pen.     It was very tight          in the    pen and the        crowd

were     slowly    carrying me forwards           down the       pen.     Although     it was       tight,

I wasn't     panicking.            I looked back and saw that                        was still       being

c arried across        the    pen.     I shouted       back   to him but he shouted that               he

c o u l d n ’t move and      I lost sight       of him.       I c o u l d n ’t see m uch of the

pitch as     I was     being       carried forwards        down the      pen.     I could only

really see the top of both goals.                      Whilst    going forwards        down the       pen

1 saw the ball         hit the Forest         crossbar at the other end of the ground,
                                                                                                               PAGE            6b \
                                                                                                               £■>3639

I could not       see who          had struck        the bar,         but    it was obvious             that

Li ye r poo 1 had hit         the       crossbar.        There was a large verbal                      response          to

this,    but no surges             from the crowd,             just    the steady forwards movement.

At    some s t a g e , I caught my             right     leg agai ns t        the upj^gtfiT^stanchi on of

a crush barrier.              This was at about                the time       that L iv erpool           hit the

crossbar,       perhaps       just       before or just after.                  I c a n ’t remember exactly

where    the barrier was,                it was possibly about                half way          down the pen,             or

possibly a bit nearer                   the front of the            pen.      I grabbed the end of the

barrier w h ic h       ran to my          right and       pushed myself             back    s uf fi c i e n t l y to

get my    leg free.           As    I    pulled my       leg free      I turned myself a ro u n d to my

right towards          the    rear       of the pen.        As      I did     so    I saw two           lads doubled

up against       the    crush barrier             v i r t ua ll y   in front        of me.        The    one       lad

was    only about       six    inches a way from me and                     I could see his face                   very

well.     He was       screaming          out and his face             had a look          of    real    horror.

It was obvious          that he was           having extreme            d i ff ic ul ty     in breathing.                He

was    trying    to get his             breath,    but    d i d n ’t appear         to be getting any.

As best     I remember         his face was very white.                       The    lad was          trying       to ask

for help but       really struggling.                    I said       I c o u l d n 9t move at all and

that    I couldn't       help.           I looked at that             lad for a few seconds and he

was    still    in extreme          d i ff ic ul ty when         I last     saw him.            The    first       lad

that    I saw was a white male,                   about     twenty      three years of age.                    He had

dark    hair w hi ch was           covering       the ears and he had a dark moustache.                                   He

was    probably about          five       feet    nine    inches       in height and             of m ed i u m build.

I do not       remember anything about                   his     clothing.          The second          lad that I

saw doub le d up against                 the barrier was            to the     left of the             lad

previously described,                   t h a t ’s as you      look back at the stand.                       The    lad

was well       built and his stomach was                    pressed         right up against             the       bar.

The    top half    of the          lad's     body was ang le d forwards                to such an extent

that    I couldn't see his face.                     I think        he was     still alive,             but    in

great    difficulty.           1 could only describe                   this    lad as white with short

              fair hair.            He wore a white          short       sleeved      "T"    shirt.        I don't know                   if

              it had anything              on the front as          I c o u l d n ’t see.        I only saw these                     lads

              for a m atter          of seconds          before the       crowd turned me a ro u n d so that                          I

              was    facing        towards       the    pitch a ga in and the forwards m ov em en t                     started

              again.        I still        could not       see the       pitch and       could not say what                  the

              time may have           been.        I have mar ke d        the a p p r o x im at e    position that                I

              was    in w hen       I saw these two          lads against          the      barrier,       on the separate

              grid    plan using           the Figure One.



              The    forwards m ov em en t             event ua ll y stopped and            I ended up in a position

              towards       the front        of    pen four.        The    position was about                six   to eight

              feet    from the        front       perimeter       fence and      the exit gate             in the front

              fence was about             six     to seven feet a wa y          to my       right.       I have ma rk ed

              this    position on the separate                    grid    plan using         the figure          two.        It was

              at about       this     time       or very shortly          before      getting       to   position two that

              I reme mb ered         looking down towards                the front       of the      pes/and seeing an

            get out through the gate ana they were                      causing a jam by all        trying       to
                    of-
            get out at the same time.               I m an ag ed to squeeze myseif^-apwards out of

            the     crowd u n t i 1 I was about      chest high above          t>re people aro un d me.

              he/-& was a surge from the rear of the y € x \ and with what I thought was

             Sy last breath I thrust myself forwards and got cjjiE^-r of the crowd.    I

            was     then able      to scramble above        the    crowjakiTn front     of me and get

            through the gate and onto the t r a ^ o u t s i d e ,



            For     the next few minutes          I sat on the grass          fay the side    of the    goal      to

            get my breath back.            There were a number             of other    people already out

            on the     pitch but not a lot.



            Having got myself          up again     I saw a man         laid out on the grass         near to

            the g o a l , just      off the     playing surface.           He was    lying on his side and

            appeared unconscious.               He was unattended.           I started to massage          the

            m a n ’s lungs    from the     rear.     The man       responded to this and          regained

             consciousness.          He appeared to be alright              then.     I d istinctly    remember

             this man because he had burn marks                   to the    right side of his face.



             Some    time   later    I met up with                and          on the    pitch.     It was

             after meeting         up with them that        I saw a P o l ic em an     carrying a young          lad

             in his arms.          The Po li ce ma n was    in the area of the          central    pens.

           There was anot he r man with them.                          I saw the P o l i c e m a n who was          carrying

           the young         boy and the other man walk                   onto    the    playing    surface         from the

           track       in front     of the           pens.    We a p p r o a c h e d them and     I could see that

           the young         lad in the          policeman's arms was             dead

                       One    of us a s ke d the man with them                   if he was the boys*               father.

           I think he replied that he was the boy's uncle.                                   I s s i s t e d              to

           carry the young             boy towards           the far     corner       qfi<tne pitch,        in between

                                          We    carried the fla y without              the use of a stretcher                  or

           hoarding.         One of us sup po rt ed the boy's                    head from underneath,

           although        it was a bit              pointless as        he was    o bv iously dead.          We carried

           the    boy     a l o n gs id e      the N orth Stand,         towards where       there were a number

           of a mbulances.             The P o l i c e m a n who       had been       carrying    the boy o riginally

                           S u b ject;-     Hillsborough Disaster - Letter from Councillor B.J.CUMMINGS


                              I report with reference to the attached letter dated 19th April, 1989,
                              which was received by me on 24th April, 1989. The letter is written
                              by Councillor B.J. CUMMINGS.__________




%     -           .
                              and concerns his attendance at Hillsborough on Saturday 15th April,
                              1989 when he witnessed the unfolding of the tragedy.

                              Councillor CUMMINGS is the Chairman of the Birkenhead Sub Divisional
                              Police/Community Forum. He is most supportive of the Police Service
hJcjf"oA.                     and is a keen football fan.

                              I spoke to Councillor CUMMINGS on the telephone today he being
                              unavailable up to then being absent from home in Lancashire. I
                              discussed the contents of his letter with him. He said that he had
                              been very upset at the time of the incident and afterwards but was
                              starting to feel better. He had written the letter at a time when
                              he felt he "had to get back at someone" because of the remarks
                              made by Mr. Paul MIDDUP of the Sheffield Police Federation. He
                              said that he had also written to several other people who had made
                              comments soon after the incident. He said that he was not in need
                              of personal support as he was part of a close family.

                             Councillor CUMMINGS explained that he was in the North Stand at
              0 |£. .        Hillsborough and that there had been some delay on his arrival
                             for the game due to traffic difficulties. He had a good view of the

    huliu                    scene of the tragedy. I suggested to him that his information may
                             be of use to the West Midlands Police Enquiry teams who had already
    01 OD ^                 started their investigation and provided him with the Contact Team
                           ' number 0800 991199 in order that he may make contact with the
                             Enquiry Team for further investigation.

                              I suggest that this file be transmitted onwards to Chief Superintendent
                              Operations Department, Force Headquarters for whatever action is
                              considered appropriate.

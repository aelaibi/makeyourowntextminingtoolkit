My above constituents and I have written to you
previously regarding the provision of information
following their son's tragic death at Hillsborough.

Since our last correspondence things have changed
radically in that my constituents have secured Legal
Aid.

Essential to our case is to obtain a list of the
names  of the people who formed the Hillsborough
Steering Group/ but frankly/ we have hit obstacle
after obstacle in trying to obtain this; the latest
of  this   is  the  copy  letter  attached which my
constituents have received from the Court Service.

Therefore/ I hope you will not mind me writing to you
personally and stressing the nature of my personal
request for your assistance in obtaining this list.
It is absolutely essential for me and my constituents
to obtain this list in pursuance of what we consider
to be right and just aims.

 I hope you can see your way clear to facilitate this.

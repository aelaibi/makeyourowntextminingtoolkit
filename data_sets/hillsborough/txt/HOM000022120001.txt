                    Dear Sir,

                    Hillsborough Inquiry
                    Our Clients : Trent Regional Health Authority

                    Further to the leave given by Lord Justice Taylor last Friday
                    27th April 1989 at the Preliminary hearing of the above
                    Inquiry, we are m a k i n g wr i t t e n submissions on Leading
                    Counsel's advice to be allowed representation.

                    We act for T rent R e g i o n a l Health Authority (T R H A ) the
                    Authority responsible for the management of South Yorkshire
                    Metropolitan Ambulance Service ("SYMAS").      In making these
                    submissions, we would not wish to detract from Lord Justice
                    Taylor's approbatory remarks as to the part played by SYMAS
                    on 15th April 1989.

                    In summary we respectfully submit that TRHA should be allowed
                    representation for the following reasons

                    1.                  we believe that SYMAS has significant evidence to
                                        produce to the Inquiry which is relevant to both
                                        aspects of its terms of reference.

                    2.                  so far we have taken statements from 98 officers and
                                        staff, all of whom are ready and willing to give
                                        evidence, but each of whom is anxious to be legally
                                        represented when so doing. West Midlands Police have
                                        requested copies of all the statements, our clients'
                                        Control Action Plan in the event of a major incident

                at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Hillsborough,
                t h e i r M a j o r I n c i d e n t Plan, all o t h e r r e l e v a n t
                documents, the original tapes of radio and telephone
                messages to and from SYMAS Control and transcripts of
                t h o s e m e s s ages.       All this e v i d e n c e is c l e a r l y
                considered by West Midlands Police to be relevant and
                the o r i g i n a l tapes, C o n t r o l A c t i o n Plan, Major
                Incident Plan and a list of all staff involved have
                already been supplied to West Midlands Police Officers
                (Superintendent Chidley and Inspector Burrows) who
                have confirmed that their brief includes investigation
                into the role played by the emergency services.

       3.      there ha s already been public criticism about-Jbhe

               efrlmJliveiiess and the a d e quady Of the equipment
               available.    SYMAS are most anxious that its members
               are legally represented throughout the enquiry in
               order to be in a position to assist in responding to
               these issues.

       4.      while we appreciate that the Panel of Inquiry has
                indicated that anyone who is the subject of criticism
                will be given advance notice, our experience of this
                type of Inquiry is such that we are greatly concerned
                that it is often difficult to predict such criticism
                in advance, and in view of the public nature of this
                Inquiry, it is not always easy to balance adverse
                opinions after the event.        Moreover, Counsel of our
                c h o i c e w h o has already been briefed and who has
                a d v i s e d in c o n ference, may not be i m m e d i a t e l y
                available to protect our clients' interests.

        5.     at least two of our clients' officers were present in
                the Hillsborough ground before the match started and
                observed the events leading up to the matters with
                which the Inquiry is concerned.

        6.     SYMAS has strongly held views as to the desirability
                of the Ambulance Services nationally being given power
                to in s i s t on b e i n g consulted by Sports grounds,
                licensing authorities in general before events are
                held which attract large crowds.       At present, Local
                Authorities may grant l i c ences to S p o r t s Sta d i a
                without consultation with the Ambulance Services. We

                believe that this matter is very germane to the second
                part of the Inquiry's task, and we stress that there
                is a history of correspondence between SYMAS and
                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club which is relevant.

        7.      We b e l i e v e that events prior to 15th April 1989
                involving contingency planning for such a disaster as
                this involved the ambulance service as well as three
                other parties all of whom have been granted leave to
                be represented.      The way those plans were carried into
                effect influenced the way the ambulance service was
                able to respond on the day.       To ensure the facts are
                fully ascertained, and in all fairness, the Authority
                should be represented.

        We are prepared to deal with each of the above in more detail
        if required.         We are instructed to e m p h a s i s e that our
        clients' earnest desire is to assist in every way they can,
        but we cannot urge too strongly their real wish to have the
        b e n e f i t of r e p r e s e n t a t i o n of t h e i r choice on such an
        important matter as this Inquiry.

        O u r c l i e n t s ha v e instructed us that they wish leading
        Counsel, Mr M i c h e l K a l l i p e t i s QC to m a k e p e r s o n a l
        representations to Lord Justice Taylor in relation to the
        above.       In view of the fact that the Inquiry is due to
        commence on 15th May we should be grateful if you would
        confirm when and where those representations can be made, as
        a matter of urgency.

        Yours faithfully,

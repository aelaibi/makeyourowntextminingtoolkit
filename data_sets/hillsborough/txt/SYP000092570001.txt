                I live at the a&five address                  I have stayed in this location for the

                last nine months,

               On Saturday 15th j^pril 1989>S<150^489) > I attended the F A Cup Semi

               Final match between Live>*ftpol and Nottingham Forest at Hi 11sborough

                Stadi u m , Sheffield.       I am a LiS^grpooI su ppo rt er.                           I attend about    10

                games a season.       This was the firslS-4emi final                               I had bean to.     I am

                not a merr^ber of any official             supporters                 club.

                I purchased my cjcket on the day of the match from a lad who was in

    —           possession of two s p ^ e       tickets.               He was stood by the outer                 perime'ter

                gates   leading to Le ppi ng^ Jiane, I paid him £25 for the ticket which

                was for the Leppings Lane standing area’
                                                       X nd had a face value of £ 6 .00,

                I travelled to the game by car together with                                                              of
                                                                             PAGE       2
                                                                             S3683

                                                                           He also

purchased a ticket off the same youth for £ 2 5 .

The journey to SheffieldT't'o^ik about 2 hours,        1 had travelled up to

Rochdale on the Friday prior to rke game and so left Rochdale at about

0930 hrs    (0930), arriving at our destitution at 1 1 3 0 / 1 2 0 0   (1130)/

(1200) hours approx.         I drove straight towards the stadium and was

directed to a side road by a police officer,           10 minutes walk from the

ground.     I parked the car and we walked to the ground in an attempt to

purchase a ticket.     I saw fans drinking near to a supermarket,          the pubs

I saw were all     closed.    I saw some   police officers around,      but I did

not pay too much attention I was more         concerned in attempting to get

tickets.      ^eventually managed to pur chashs^ the tickets at about            1440

hours (1440) an&v I then joined the mass of fatjs who were by now
                                                                    L C
milling outside t h eNfcu i\ns ti 1e entrance. I saw aXout'V'our mounted

officers who were attempting to organise the fans irtVo some semblance

of order.     I did not see any foot patrol        officers outside the

turnstiles.     Neither did I see any stewards.         There was no fighting or

disorder of any kind it was a good atmosphere,

I experienced great dif f i culty^ignding my ent ry^point due to the crowd

massing outside.      I did eventually r           a turnstile where    I handed my

 scket over to the operator.         1 did not            gate open or being

o pened   this s t a g e . I did not see any i 1 legShUentry into the ground
                     uncUbth
but there w><e f^ns who were escaping out of the crush by climbing

onto the turnsti       roof

Having gained entry into the ground I was not searched by any Police

officer      I had earlier been separated from              in the crush

outs ide but found him again ins'hle the g ro und ,
               ^ A— " -                       *— -
I saw no di rection signs to show me 1           my viewing position.     The only

entry I saw was a tunnel which led onto C'              r rac i ng behi nd the

Leppings Lane goal.      As 1 waited to go do<          £ tt\nne 1 I saw a large
                                                                                         PAGE        3
                        Soe            c                                                 S3683

      concertina gate being Choeneid I could not see who was responsible for

      opening the gate but a lot cTf fans came through and headed straight

      for the tunnel entrance the time would be about 2 minutes before kick

      off.

      I saw a steward stamij.n>* by the tunnel entrance but there were so many

      fans going down the tunnel he could do nothing about                    it.   I never saw

             police officer at this    location.         There was no fighting or any

      drunkenH^     or disorder at this stage.

      At this stag^sj was joined by                    and together we entered the

      tu nn el.   The tunffrajJwas very full,      slow moving but there was no crush

      as such.

      We emerged from the tunnel and went to our left.                     The terracing was

v *   very, full.    There was a lot of pushing and shoving but I was not too

      c o n c e r n ^ in fact 1 was more concerned when I was              in the crush outside

      the turnsti lVsj. A _____

      I lost sight of             almost immediately we entered the terracing.                   I

      then decided to make my way down to a point marked K4 on the attached

      grid plan (Ex No            ) (Ref No            ).    I arrived at this point at

      about   1502 hours ?X502) as I was aware of tThe game being in progress.

      The pressure around me           tremendous and this                      to the amount

      of fans entering through the tun ne l.                I had no control over where the

      crowd took me and I was pushedN^orwar d to a point                   I have marked L5 on

      the attached grid pla n.       (Ex   No      \    MRef ).  No
                                                         S©£                         ■


      I would estimate t h e t i m e to be about 1505 hours (1505).                 I decided

      the pressure around me w a s \ p o        great and decided to move back in an

      effort to escape out of the penVv            I saw other supporters were climbing
                                     u fK ~ T
      out and over the front perimeter fe^K^e and\also the side fencing

      There we re also fans being pulled up inxN^ tqe Nest Stand seating area_

      and it was to that area that         I decided to go.           As   1 moved back, I came

               his predicament attempted to fnee him by pushing other fans back off

               the barr ier .           We managed to free \ i m

               be 1515 hoursv(1315)                    I was concerned about my friend                           and

               thought if I courd get out and into the West Stand I may be able to

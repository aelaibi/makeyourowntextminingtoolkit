STATEMENT                                                             24.7.89




                           OF

LIVERPOOL      - DOB               ill say as follows




I travelled by coach as did my son and other family and friends.        We

arrived at the match at around 10 to 3.00pm.       We had tickets for

entrance B of Leppings Lane.



I was walked down with my son and his mates and my mates.        We all had

tickets for entrance B of Leppings Lane and we were caught up in the

crush through the tunnell and into the ground.          I was separated from

my son and ended up on the left hand side of Leppings Lane, people

were screaming and distressed all around me.        I was terried and was

trying to locate my son.



There was then a lull in        the crush and the fences were down and Imade

my way on to the ground tdiere I started helping the immediate victims

as I had not been injured myself.       At the same time I was searching

for my son and identifying bodies that were lying on the ground.         I was

very upset by what I saw and spent in all 4 hours at the ground searching

and helping people.



Fortunately all my family and friends on the coach that travelled down

with me were not injured        and we all managed to'get safely back to the

coach although we were very distressed.       My son and myself have been

receiving Counselling since the incident and Mrs ______ the Counsellor

informed me that   I should seek advice from a Solicitor as I am also
/2



undergoing a personal crisis                              as I

cannot cope with my feelings and I cannot explain the things that

I witnessed at the ground on the day in question.



I wish to apply for legal aid.

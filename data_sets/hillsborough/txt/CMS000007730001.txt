          HILLSBOROUGH TRADEGY

          Thank you very much for your letter of 19 April about the response
          of the Mers e y s i d e Probation Service to the H i l l s b o r o u g h tradegy. I
          was glad to hear of all that you and your staff are doing.                   It
          seems to me to represent the very best of p r o b a t i o n service
          response:   quick, generous and human.

          I was very sorry to read that 5 members of your staff have been
          d i r ectly affected by the deaths at Hillsb orough.  If you think it
          would be of any conceivable help, do pl e a s e give them our warmest
          sympathy.

          Thank you again for writing.

 HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY

I thought that the Home Office might like to know something about our
involvement in the aftermath of the Hillsborough tragedy. So much has been
happening that this must inevitably be quite a short and concise note.

 Early last Saturday evening, I made telephone contact with Merseyside Police
 Headquarters and the Director of Social Services, Liverpool - immediately
 to offer the assistance of the Probation Service. I then followed this up
 by speaking with the directors of Liverpool and Sefton Social Services in the
 Cathedral on Sunday afternoon.

 On Monday afternoon, Roy Adams, DCPO, attended two meetings on our behalf - and
 I can report that all the statutory agencies have made a clear commitment to
 coordination and cooperation. Indeed, there is now a daily meeting at 4 pm
 (for some two or three hours) which Roy Adams has been attending and in which
 I will now be taking part.

 There is a 24-hour crisis telephone line - for which we are providing six
 teams of nine members of staff, all of whom are undertaking this task in an
 entirely voluntary capacity. In addition, Roy Adams and Lawrence Singer our
 Training ACPO have been involved in arrangements which will commence tomorrow -
 in respect of training by specialist consultants for middle managers and
 potential counsellors in post-trauma counselling.

 Two young people known to the Merseyside Probation Service were among those who
 died at Hillsborough - and we are obviously now working closely with those two
 families. There is as yet no official list of the injured - but this is
 expected in the very near future. Over the longer term, there will be a much
 larger list of people who witnessed the events at Hillsborough and who are
 consequently traumatised. We may have therefore further involvement with other
 families known to us.

 At this stage I am aware of five members of our Merseyside Probation. stgXf who
 have been directly bereaved - and ^Bvi'OUsTy'^we- are trying to be sensitive to
 their needs in the present circumstances.



                                                                              ___ /

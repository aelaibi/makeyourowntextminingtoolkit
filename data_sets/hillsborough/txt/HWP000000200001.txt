             The Liverpool City Council Hillsborough Working Party welcomes
             the Interim Report of the Inquiry into the Hillsborough Stadium
             Disaster and its clear statement that no blame for the tragedy
              can be attached to the supporters of Liverpool F.C.
             Hoi
        (fe) 'ge-A-recognises'the importance of the recommendations contained in
              chapter 24 of the Interim Report which are described as the
              'minimum'necessary1 to ensure that existing football grounds can
              be safely used. In order to ensure that the supporters of
                Eerfcon and Liverpool can fee] confident that Goodison and Anfield
              remain ayd^will. continue to be safe for spectatorsthe Working
              Party sna_LJ ] ?QCQB»ene on Friday 11th August, 1989: at 10.00 a.m.
              to receive reports from appropriate Chief Officers concerning
              the implementation of Lord Chief Justice Taylors 43 specific
              recommendationsy

         (C) Tgg believe^the Interim Report highlights a series of appalling
             errors by the South Yorkshire Police, Sheffield Wednesday
             Football Club, Sheffield City Council and the Football Association.
             We call upon the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, the Chief
             Executive of the Football Association and those at Sheffield
             Wednesday F.C. and Sheffield City Council responsible for the
             safety certificate for the Hillsborough Stadium to resign
 rt                                 c W s s a i ef O m St
¥
fa          Wa also call for ,„.the resignation of the Chairman of the South
            Yorkshire Police Authority. We believe his actions in seeking
            to defend a Chief Constable who was ultimately responsible for
            the inadequate policing that led to the deaths of the 95 supporters
            and who was ultimately responsible for the presentation of the
            heavily criticised evidence from police officers to the Lord
    .       Chief Justice Taylor Inquiry, are shameful.
C           Me. also believes-that the Executive Commitee of the Football
            Association bears a heavy responsibility for forcing through the
            use of an inadequate stadium. Time and again Liverpool supporters
            protested, well in advance of the day of the tragedy, about the
             inadequacy of the ground and the unfairness of ^J^ej inatch being
             played there. The Executive Committee of the F .A^efjfioulH therefore
             also face up to their responsibilities and resign as well^

              This Working Party also recognises the need to remove all fences at
              football grounds in the interests of spectator safety. We also-
              recognise that the introduction of Identity Cards for football
              supporters will not increase spectator safety - on the contrary,
              it will cause massive safety problems outside football stadiums.
              In addition to the report on ID cards, the Hillsborough Working
              Party research officer be requested, as a matter of urgency, to
              submit a report on the question of fences at football grounds.
        'JluA              Cilao
              Wer notes that the relevant recommendation contained in Lord Justice
              Popplewell's Report covering police procedures, perimeter fence
              gates and stewarding arrangements were absent at Hillsborough.

             This Working Party believes the issues of spectator safety will
             never be resolved unless safety recommendations are backed with
             legal requirements and the footballl clubs and authorities have
             effective supporter representation.

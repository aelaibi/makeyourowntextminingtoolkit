way    directly           down Leppings                  Ln     to     the      ground,           it w a s          also     noticeable

that    a    l a rge      number         of L i v e r p o o l          fans      were          hanging          around        the    area,

especially             in f r o n t      of       the    garage           at    the       beginning             of L e p p i n g s      Ln.

There       did     not a p p e a r          to    be a n y      trouble             among        the      fans       or     between          the

different           factions.                The       majority           of    supporters                1 sa w w e r e       the

Liverpool           fans      walking             down       from P e n i s t o n e            Rd.        Although           they were

boisterous             there     did         not       appear        to    be ajrfy t r o u b l e           from        them.        It w as

noticed          though       that       a    large          n u m b e r that         ware^st               sitting          around           or

walking          about       the re w e r e            all    i n &p/ss e s si^yn off* b e^>r a n d                     that      those

arriving          in the       time          leading          up to        the       kick'-erft           were       hastily        trying             to

finish       their        cans       before            they     reached          the       ground.

One    incident          that        was      reported           to a n O f f i c e r             in our            v i c in i ty was         a

young       lad     reporting            a t h ef t .           Apparently                he    ha d a r r i v e d w i t h o u t          a

ticket,          he was       offered             one    for     sale,          but       when       he    handed          over     the m o n e y

the    seller          ran    off     with         both       ticket           and money.                 This       young     lad was

taken       to    the P o l i c e        Room          within        the       ground          to m a k e       a    complaint.

According           to O f f i c e r s        wh o      attended           the       semi-final             last        yea r ,     they

expected          the m a j o r i t y         of       the    crowd        to    be       in the          ground        just      after

2.00pm       (1400).           Last          year       evidently              the    streets             were       empty after

2.15pm       (1415),          but     this         did       not a p p e a r         to    happen          t hi s     year.         Although

the    coaches          seemed        to      stop       arriving              after       about          2.00pm        (1400),         it was

noticed          that     between about                  2.15pm           (1415)          and     2.30pm            (1430)     large

numbers          of L i v e r p o o l        supporters              started          coming          down Penistone                 Rd       in

droves.           We    did    not       know          where     they were                coming          from,        but    we re w a l k i n g

down    in t h e i r         hundreds             it    se e m e d .       This       seemed          to     carry         on u n t i l       about

2.50pm        <1450).               There       appeared            to     be    no    trouble          from     them,       but       there

was     plenty          of    shouting              and    singing.

It w a s      also       during           this       time       that      all     traffic          was    stopped           from

entering           Leppings              Ln,    I assumed             this       was    due       to    the     number       of

supporters              on the           road.           It w a s     also       noticed          that    even        up to a b o u t

2.45pm        <1445)          private           cars       with Liverpool                   supporters           were       s t ill

arriving           and       expecting              to    find      parking           places       near       the     ground.              It

was    seen        that       a     large       majority            of     the    occupants            were      drinking             from

cans     of    beer          or     lager.

One    incident              that        happened          wa s a        private        hire       car    dropping           off       4

Liverpool           supporters                 at    the     roundabout.                It wa s        obvious         they       h a d all

been     drinking             and        one    of       them    had       to    be    supported          by his           friends.

He    seemed        incapable               of w a l k i n g        on his        own.         They were             all    spoken          to

and advised              regarding              offences            of     trying       to     enter      the        ground       dr u n k.

Later      that         afternoon              after       the      tragedy           occurred,          I again           saw    the       one

that     had       to    be a s s i s t e d          in the         ground,           near     the      gym,     he wa s         being

helped        to a n a m b u l a n c e              with     what        a p p e a r e d to    be a      leg     i n j ur y .         He        had

obviously           got       into        the       ground.

At about           2 . 4 5 pm       <1445)          it wa s      obvious          from a message                 we    heard          on    the

radio      that         there        wa s      problems          at      the L e p p i n g s      Ln     en d    of    the       ground.

The    messages              were        excited          and    everyone             was     speaking          at    once,       but       it

seemed        there          wa s    difficulty                in the       crowd       entering          the        ground       at       this

location.               Even        at    this       time       there       were       st ill      l a rg e     numbers          of

Liverpool           supporters                 walking          down       towards          the L e p p i n g s       Ln    turnstiles.

It w a s      during          this        period          that      we     heard       on the          radio     repeated             request

for    the     gates          to     be     o p e n e d at       the      Leppings           Ln    end,       but we        were       not

was     directed            into       the      ground.               When         it w a s     inside          I sa w       one       person

stream         of    supporters                started           to    le a v e      the       g r o u n d at      this       location.

They      were       all     saying            that     it wa s          bedlam           in ther e ,           that     the       game          had

been      stopped and                 people      were           injured.                We    still       did     not       know what                ha d

happened,            but     t h e n we w e r e             ordered            into       Leppings           Ln    terraces             and       onto

When      we    went        into       the      ground           behind            the    West       Stand,        there       was          a steady

but     some        laid     on the            ground        quite        sti l l .            I,    along        with       other

            from a        l a r ge      number          of L i v e r p o o l       supporters             towards        the P o l i c e         and      the

            club     stewards.                There        was     also       aggression             towards           Notts       Forrest          fans

            at    the     far      end a n d a           number         of    supporters             tried        to    race       to    the     far      en d

            to    confront             them.

            At    this        t i me    there       was      utter          confusion          in the a r e a           between          the     goal

            and     the       terracing,            people         we re      s p i l l i ng       out    and     could       not       help

            tripping           o v er    people          laid      out       on the        gra s s .       It w a s      then       that       the

            first        member         of    the       Fire     Service           arrived          with       resuscitation                 equipment.

            I directed             one       of    them      to a       person with                breathing           difficulties.lt                   was

            obvious           that      the       casualties            would        have      to    be m o v e d       f r om     this

            location,             although          a    lar g e    number           were      dead,       but     there         was     no

            d i r e c t i o n as        to w h e r e       to    take        them.         There         did     not   appear           to    be a n y

            rank     above         Sergeant             on the      pitch and              the      club stewards                ha d    no    idea

            where        to    take      them.           I wa s     aware          the     first         aid     rooiji was        at    the     other

            some     had also            been       brought         and       just       left       lyi n g      on the       ground around

            the     gym.          One    young          boy a ged about                12 y e a r s       ha d    been     left         lyi ng      on    his

I must    state        that      I wa s         surprised          how m a n y      of    the L i v e r p o o l      fans

arrived       so    late    for       the m a t c h .         It was        obvious        that       there       was   no w a y

they    would       all    get    into          the    ground          before      3.00pm       (1500).           I would

never    dream       turning          up    so    late       for       a game      w it h an     obvious          capacity

ground.         It was      also       obvious          that       a    l a rge    number       of    those       arriving

after    2.00pm        (1400)         had       been    drinking.            You        could    see    the       Liverpool

supporters          walking       down          trying       to    drink      from       their       cans    as    q u i c k l y as

possible       so    they were             not    c o n f i s c a t e d at        the    ground.        I remember            when

we    finally       left C l a y w h e e l s          that    evening,            looking       up P e n i s t o n e    Rd

towards       W a d s 1ey B r i d g e       and       seeing       the    walls         covered with          empty       cans

and    bottles       that     had      been       left.

I would also           state      that          although myself              and        other    Officers          received a

torrent       of    verbal       abuse          and    threats          from a      lar g e     number       of L i v e r p o o l

supporters,          whi le      on    the       pitch,       I never         saw             actual        violence

offered       to    the    Police.              Later,       while       in t^fC^area a r o u n d            the     g y m , I saw

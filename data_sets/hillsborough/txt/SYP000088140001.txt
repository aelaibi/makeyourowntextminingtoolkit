               I am a state         registered nurse and             I q ua li f e d    in

               At the      present      t ime    I am work in g    on the accident            and e m e r g e n c y

               d ep ar tm en t at the hospital.

               On S a tu r d a y   15th A p r i 1 1989      (150489),        I started work at 7,45 am on the

               A & E department.                It was a busy day.

               At a r o u n d 3 pm I was          talking   to an a m b u l a n c e m a n whose       identity         I d o n ’t

               k now a nd he       informed me that         the re was        some sort of t rouble at

                                                       thing was wrong and he asked me to

               the       relevant staff         r equired for a major          incident.

               I s tarted to make telephone                 calls and        left messages         for staff to          corns

               to the hos pi tal as soon as              possible.

                                                                                                               S3240

I made my way back to w here                       charge    nurse B a tt y w a s , outside              the

r es u sc i ta ti on     room and he          instructed me to go to the                    plaster       room and

as si st there.           At    this       stage    I became aware           that     there was         somethin^

s e r i o us l y wrong and         that we had         received a lot of               casualties.

I went      straight         to the        plaster    room and saw that               there w e s / three
                                                                                   e^l^o
patients already the re on t r o 11e y s .                     Dr Joh n Glendhnipdf was                  pr esent

a nd at     least      one     policeman.          None     of the       patients were

receiving         r e su sc it at io n they were all               breathing        of their own accord

but one of them was                fitting.          Together w ith the doctor                 I turned the

patient       that was         fitting       onto his side.              Dr Glen de ni ng      inserted an          IV

line and a sked for some                    diazemuls.        There weren't any              in the       plaster

room so       I fetched some               from the main       resus ci ta ti on         room and Dr

G l en d en i ng a d m i n i s t e r e d    the drug and the             patient a pp e a r e d    to stabalise.

To the best of my knowledge                        the other       two    patients       in the     plaster       room

also had        IV lines        inserted by Dr G l en de ni ng               but    I can't     be sure.

More     staff     turned up whose             names      I d o n ’t know,         and a ss i s t e d    in the

treatment and           care of the three              patients.

They were        e vent ua ll y tr an sf er re d onto wards and to the best of my

k n ow le dg e all      three of them              lived.     I d o n ’t know their            identities and

c a n ’t give a very good d es c r i p t i o n apart                     from saying        they were          three

young     lads.

Fr om this        point      I d i d n ’t have any specific                dealings with any              patient.

I a ct ed more as a go betw ee n fetching and                             carrying       drugs and equipment

that was        required by various                 doctors.

At one stage whilst                in t h e piaster          room    I remember a patient                 corning in

on a trolley and being                     tran sf er ed to a table.               He was    being

r es u sc i ta t ed by a number              of people       but    I d i d n ’t know who they were.

After a short            time     it became apparent               that     the    treatment w a s n ’t

wo rk in g and, someone made                 the d ec ision to stop.

              I m ov ed the        patient    into the w ash out           room and he was            later

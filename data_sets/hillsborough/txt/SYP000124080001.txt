 AS LIVERPOOL HAVE A BIGGER SUPPORT THAN FORREST, WE WERE GIVEN THE WRONG

 END AT HILLSBOROUGH.   FORREST HAD THE BIGGER END.   THE SAME THING HAPPENED

 LAST YEAR, ALTHOUGH I WASN'T PRESENT.   THERE WERE NO STEWARDS ABOUT,     I DIDN’T

 SEE ONE STEWARD THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE TIME OF BEING AT THE GROUND.       THE GATES

 PREVENTED PEOPLE GETTING OUT AND THERE WERE INSUFFICIENT GATES.

 THERE WERE A LOT OF POLICE & STEWARDS AROUND THEY SEEMED TO LACK ANY IDEA

 IN MY OPINION THERE WERE    NOT A L(JT\OF PEOPLE THERE WITHOUT TICKETS.      I

 APPROACHED THE GROUND AT    14.30 H0URS\l430) AND WAS ONLY      ASKED A COUPLE

 OF TIMES IF I HAD A TICKET.    I   NEVER SAW'WJY DRUNKENNESS & THEREFORE     I

 D O N ’T THINK THAT DRINK WAS A BIG PROBLEM.   THE POLICING ARRANGEMENTS OUTSIDE

 THE LEPPINGS LANE TURNSTILES WAS TOTALLY INADEQUATE, COMPARED WITH OTHER

 FOOTBALL GROUNDS.   THE DEALING WITH THE INCIDENT BEFORE THE GAME WAS STOPPED

 WAS POOR BY POLICE & STEWARDS.

 YES.

 ^ A P P E A R E D TO BE NO ONE IN CONTROL AT THE TUNNEL. ITSELF.

 TO THE CRUSH.

 7) COMPLETE LACK OF MEDICAL FACILITIES.


Q 19

 054

 IS THERE      ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 MY PERSONAL VIEW IS THAT THE CROWDING OF PEN 4 HAD REACHED SUCH AN EXTENT BY

 ^OPM      <1300) THAT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A CRUSH OF PEOPLE LEADING TO INJURY

 OR DEATH ARISING FROM NORMAL CROWD WAVE MOVEMENT,       IRRESPECTIVE OF ANY SURGE

 THROUGH THE TUNNEL.     THE CROWDING OF PEN 4 MUST HAVE BEEN CLEARLY VISIBLE BY

 AT THE LATEST 2.30PM <1430) TO THE POLICE CONTROL OFFICE AT LEPPINGS LN END AS

 WELL AS TO THE FEW OFFICERS WHO WERE IN THE SEATING SECTION ABOVE THE TERRACE.

 ALTHOUGH THERE WERE MANY ACTS OF COURAGEOUS EFFORT BY THE POLICE TO ASSIST

 CASUALTIES AT THE LEPPINGS LN END,     IT APPEARED TO ME THAT THESE AROSE OUT OF

 THEIR INDIVIDUAL EFFORTS RATHER THAN AS A CONTROLLED AND CO-ORDINATED RESPONSE

 TO THIS INCIDENT.

 I PERSONALLY THINK THAT THE POLICE WERE A BIT SLOW OPENING THE GATE. IF THEY

 HAD OPENED THE GATE EARLIER ON, IT MAY HAVE EASED THE CRUSH. THEY SEEMED TO BE

 MORE CONCERNED ON A PITCH INVASION.

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 AT ABOUT TWENTY TO FIVE (1640) WHEN IT WAS ANNOUNCED THE GAME HAD BEEN

 CANCELLED.

 Q51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A

 STEWARD, A LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 THEY CAME OVER THE LOUDSPEAKER SAYING THE GAME HAD BEEN ABANDONED AND TOLD US

 NOT TO LEAVE IMMEDIATELY, BUT EVERYBODY STARTED TO MOVE TOWARDS THEIR WAY OUT.

 DID Y0$ WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 NO, BY THEN THE POLICE HAD REALISED THAT IT W A S N ’T A PITCH INVASION AND THAT

 PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO GET OVER THE FENCE TO SAVE THEIR LIVES AND THE POLICE

 STARTED TO HELP PEOPLE GET OVER THE FENCE.

 THERE SEEMED TO BE A LONG DELAY BEFORE THEY DID spHETHING TO GET THE FANS OUT

 OF THE CRUSH IN THE PENS. ALSO THE POLICE WERE/SLOW IN REACTING TO THE

 SITUATION,   IN FACT A POLICEMAN WAS ON THE>&^NCE SHOUTING FOR THE CROWD TO MOVE

 BACK, BUT THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDIC1AL. INQUIRY?

 I D O N ’T THINK IT WAS WRONG FOR THE CONCERTINA GATE TO BE^OPENED BUT STEWARDS

       >OLICE SHOULD HAVE DIRECTED FANS TO THE WINGS OF T H E TERRACING ONCE THEY

 WERE INSIDE, AND THE TUNNEL SHOULD HAVE BEEN BLOCKED OFF BECAUSE THERE WERE

 TOO MANY FANS IN PENS 3 & 4.

 THE MAIN CAUSE OF DEATHS IN MY OPINION UAe"THE SLOW REACTION OF POLICE ON THE

 PITCH WHO WERE POLICING THE FENCE, WHO WERE VERY SLOW IN GETTING THE FANS OUT.

 THEY OBVIOUSLY DIDN’T REALISE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION.

 LETTERS WERE SENT THROUGH OFFICIAL CHANNELS STATING THAT THE HILLSBOROUGH

 VENUE WAS AN UNSUITABLE ONE.    I SAW THE DETAILS OF ONE OF THE LETTERS WHICH WAS

 PRINTED IN THE DAILY EXPRESS WRITTEN BY LIVERPOOL CHIEF EXECUTIVE, MR PETER

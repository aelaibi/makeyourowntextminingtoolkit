HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

When we spoke today about Lord Justice Taylor's planned visit to
football matches at Rome and Milan (for which I am most grateful
with your assistance) I said I would send you some of the papers
as background.  I attach copies of the press releases of 17 and
24 April setting up the Inquiry, the Interim Report published on
4 August, and the news releases on behalf of the Inquiry and the
Home Secretary put out the same day, together with the text of a
Home Office Circular commending action on the Interim Report.

The position now is that Lord Justice Taylor has started work on
the second part of his Inquiry, which is a wide ranging study of
crowd control and safety at sports events. As I mentioned, this
does not have the judicial flavour of the Public Inquiry in
Sheffield Town Hall:    it is more concerned with meeting selected
people,   watching how crowds are controlled and managed at sports
events,   and studyingwritten evidence sent in by a number of
groups.Lord Justice Taylor will continue     to be assisted in this
by both his Assessors. On overseas visits, I envisage that both
I and my assistant, Jonathan Sweet, will also attend (so our
party would be five in all).

I look forward to hearing from you when you have been able to
make contact with the stadia concerned and with the Italian
authorities (Government and football)

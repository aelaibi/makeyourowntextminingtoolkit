Dear Chief Inspector Tope

RE: ADAM SPEARETT DECEASED HILLSBOROUGH

As a result of a very long discussion which I have had today with
Edward Spearett I am now instructed to write in the following terms.

In paragraph 5 of the Coroner's Summary it is said that P.C.
went onto the Leppings Lane Terrace shortly after 15.05 andassisted
in the removal of casualties from Pen 3.      The officer recalls Adam
Spearett being passed from Pen 4 to un-identified officers who took
him to gate 3, the suggestion being that it was not P.C.            fh o
himself received Adam but other Police Officers. Mr Spearett does
not understand why his son should have been passed over the lateral
fence when the most obvious route for him to have been taken was either
down the terrace in Pen 4 and onto the pitch via the gate from that
Pen or alteratively up the terrace and through the tunnel to the open
yard at the rear of the West Stand.     Mr Spearett wonders whether it
is possible that P.C.            is mistaken in his recollection and
he would welcome sight of a copy of the full statement from which
this short summary is taken.

Can you please arrange for us to be supplied with a copy of the statement
as soon as possible.

Yours sincerely

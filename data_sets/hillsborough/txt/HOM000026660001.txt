          leading into that terrace was broken.    People without

          tickets and that's why the crush occurred."    \
1513 38   John Motion states that that message should be passed

1524.00   Numerous bodies on the pitch and being brought out of
          the pens clearly all dead.
1525.00   Motson refers to considerable casualties, ambulances on
          the ground.

1525.59   Motson says "... being used as emergency stretchers and
          there are clearly a number of fans seriously injured.
          John Smith, the Liverpool chairman, who witnessed the
          dreadful scenes at Heisel four years ago.      I have to
           say that this was not caused as far as we know by
          misbehaviour except that the reason it happened was
           that one of the outside gates here was broken and nonÂ­
          ticket holders forced their way in and overcrowded the
           section at the Leppings Lane end, occupied by the
           genuine authentic ticket holders.    There was a crush,
           people fell forward and the devastating result you can
           see from that.   There's total confusion down there.
           The police have brought in as many reinforcements as
           they can ... any question at all serious injury to a
           lot of people.    The referee quite rightly took the
           teams off the field instantly.    This happened by the
           way after six minutes of play and the incident occurred
           20 minutes ago as I speak now and if anything it's
           looked worse as every minute has gone by because there
           are far more people hurt it would appear than seemed
           likely when the first overspill occurred.      There has
           not been to my knowledge a loud speaker announcement
           inside the ground about what the people on the pitch
                                 4
                                       N

           who are not hurt should be doing but there is no
           question now that the problem was caused by non-ticket
           holders forcing their way through a broken gate at the
           Leppings Lane of this ground and the FA Cup Semi-Final
           has been suspended in the most serious fashion."

1526. 50   Message finished.
           "... either the Football Association or one of the
           officials down at pitch level and for the moment all we
           can do is report that it looks extremely serious and
           one wouldn't wish to make comparisons with previous
           incidents of this sort, but it's certainly a sensitive
           time in terms of crowd control ..."

1528. 00   The whole of pen 3 now is a sea of police officers
           carrying away the remaining bodies.

1529. 00   "Still no official comment available from down below."
           says John Motson.

1529.,35    Jimmy Hill now speaking "... has changed really because
           the awful thing without any information coming over
            from a loud speaker system was that the Nottingham
            Forest fans at the other end of the ground were not
            really understanding the seriousness of the situation
            and were carrying on with their chants which wasn't
            appreciated by those at the other end in such trouble.
            But I think they understand the situation now and all
            t h o s e fans who are c o m i n g on taking down the
            advertising boardings and carrying people off are being
            warmly applauded, so thank goodness some common sense
1530 .00   has come into the ground ..."

1530 .18   An announcement on the tannoy concerning Kenny Dalglish
            coming out to make an announcement.

1531 .38   St John ambulance only moving off.

1532 .00   "Desmond Lynam says they opened the gates and they were
           virtually letting everybody in at that end and you know
           clearly people have been very seriously hurt and it's a
           disaster and I would think the game is obviously
           abandoned isn't it but it is difficult to comment when
           they don't know the fact but if you just tell them at
           the other end I have tried to do that."

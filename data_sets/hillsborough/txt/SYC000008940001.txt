    applies, it is suggested that one of the following
    forms be adopted:
      C.D. died from natural causes.
                                                                           Re

      C.D. died from want of attention at birth.

      (In any of the above cases, but in no other, it is
      suggested that the following words may, where
      appropriate, be added:

     infanticide or stillbirth, it is suggested that one
     of the following forms be adopted:

      C.D. killed himself/herself (whilst the balance of
      his/her mind was disturbed).

      C.D. died as the result of an attempted/self­

      C.D. was killed lawfully.

      Open verdict, namely, the evidence did not fully or
      further disclose the means whereby the cause of death
      arose.

  c In the case of murder, manslaughter or infanticide
    it is suggested that the following form be adopted.

      C.D. was killed unlawfully.
  d In the case of a stillbirth insert 'stillbirth' and do not
    complete the remainder of the form.

O            Dear Sirs,

             Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


             If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
             of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
             on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
             due course.

              I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
              evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
              coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
              inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

              Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
              under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
              witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
              this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

              Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
              to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
              appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
              consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

              May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
              attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

              I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
              names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
              to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

               I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
               heard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
               submit

               Yours faithfully

Re:       B H m cmS1»W®RMA-'rTHEWS (deceaa9a). & J.22.

As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990*

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not' to restime the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

 I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
 Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
 he may wish to undertake.

 I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
 or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
 matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
 a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
 on this matter further.

 I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
 is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
 fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

 Yours faithfully,



 S.L.Popper,

            Dear Sirs,
                                              •r
            You will be aware that-I do not normally release post mortem
            reports until the resumption of the Inquest, when they axe
            in fact put in as evidence.

            However, in view of the numerous requests which I have received,
            and the obvious distress which delay is causing to your clients,
            I have decided that subject to certain conditions set out below,
            I am prepared to release to you upon request, the post mortem
            report of your client(s).

            The release of these post mortem reports are on the basis that:-

                            They have to be treated as provisional, and therefore
                            subject to amendment or alteration until such time as
                            they are given or produced in evidence at the Inquest.

                    b.     They are to be used only for the purpose of bereavement
Q                          conselling of the deceased's relatives or for proper
                           legitimate purposes in conneerfcion with any legal proceedings
                           in which solicitors may be engaged.

                           Subject to thS'ca-fesyg, they are to be kept confidential until
                           they come into the public domain at the resumed Inquests.

            I have your request for the post mortem report to hand in respect
            of each of the persons listed on the attached sheet, and on the
            assumption that you will confirm that the report in respect of
            each of your respective clients is accepted on the terms set out
            above, and in order to save further delay and upset to your client,
            I enclose a copy of the relevant post mortem report. If for any
            reason you cannot agree to the contents of this letter, please return
            the post mortem report to me, without of course making any use of it.

            The cost for the copy post mortem report(s) is 55p    per Gheet (total £n
                                                                                                               65p

   Dear Sirs,

   RE: BRIAN CHRISTOPHER MATIEEM5 DECEASED - INQUEST


   We have now had an opportunity of going through the Sunmary with our client, and she has advised
   that she wishes Mr Fraser of the Hillsborough Steering Camittee to represent her at the Inquest
   into the death of her husband which is resumed on Tuesday 1st fey 1990 at 11.00 a.m. at the Medico-
   Legal Centre, fetery Street, Sheffield.

   Our client will be in attendance along with her Social Worker and one or two other members of her
   family.

   We trust you have a copy of the Post Mortem Report and of the Summary from Vfest Midlands Police,
   and as to the same, the questions which our client would wish to pose are as follows

   1. Re Paragraph 11 of the Report - Detective Constable Cakes' actions.

      Can it be established why D.C. Oakes assumed that Mr. I&tthews had been vomiting beer? As a
      result of the assumption, did he then cease resuscitation attempts, and leave Mr. ffetthews,
     or did he believe he was already beyond help?

   2. Re Paragraph 12 of the Report

      Can it be established whether Mr. Matthews vas dead at this stage. This paragraph indicates
     P.C. McGuinness as having carried a deceased across the pitch. Paragraph 4 indicates that life
      was not pronounced extinct until 15.55 p.m.

  We have had an addendum to that Report recently farced to us, upon which we are now taking our client's
  instructions, and further matters may be raised when the Addendum has been discussed with our client,
  and if so we will iimiediately return to you to discuss the matter further.

  Yours faithfully

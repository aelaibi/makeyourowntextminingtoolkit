                We were         briefed at Woodall                Police Post arm our             duty was         to   cover   the

                 s o u t h b o u n d exit    slip       road at .junction 26 of the _ _

                At 0 9 0 0      hrs,    we took         up   position on the            grass   verge at the            very top of

                 the     slip       road,   o b se rv in g    traffic,         and stayed       in that      position       until

                a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2.5 5    pm    (1455 hrs),           except      for, a half hour         break w he n we

                 went     to examine a motor                 vehicle    in B a r n s l e y at a p p r o x i m a t e l y   1030 hrs,,

                The     traffic        flow from the m o t o rw a y was m o d e ra t e             until      1115 hrs w h e n          it

                 s ta rt ed to become             h eavy wit h      private       cars an d      coaches,      a lot of w hich

                were     easily        i d en ti fi ed as      football         s upporters.       We stopped           several

                 buses w hi ch were            d is pl a yi n g    'Notts,       F o r e s t 5 signs    in the window,          but

                w hi ch were          taking L i ve rp oo l        supporters.          We    requested that            these   signs

T r af f i c was        never that            heavy that a back-1og                  jown the slip         road was

c a u s e d , and after             1200 hrs        it became       quiet a g a in with a normal

S a t u r d a y traffic            flow.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y       1330 hrs        traffic       became       very    light;    I cannot       remember

any football                coaches        coming       past after       that    time.        I thought       it would

have      been the opposite,                     this    I found very surprising.                  I remember         both

PC B R O W N and myself               making        comments       to each other             regarding      this.

At    1430           hrs,    traffic: was          so    light    that    it was       sug ge st ed over the         radio

that an          early meal               be taken,        but this was deci de d against.

At    1453           hrs we        left    j u n ct i on 36 to travel to W oo l ey S er vi ce s for                  meal.

S h o r t l y a fterwards            the      ’O pe ra ti on al    Support*          message was       passed     for

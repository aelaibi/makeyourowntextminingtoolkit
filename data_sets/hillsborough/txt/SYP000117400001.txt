                               noticeable          that    most       of    the     fans     arriving        had       been

                              wanted      to      urinate      as     they alighted.                They     were          stopped

                      from        doing        so.         Most           of       the      f an s       were      in h i g h       spirits

                      I feel           that       there          would             have        been more               under       arrest

                      that        no    one was            acting              o ut      of      order         and they made                  their

While          crossing           the     road         serial             stopped              by a S u p e r i n t e n d e n t           who       was

listening             on h i s         ra d i o .        There           appeared                to      be    so me        confusion.              We w e r e

ground          via    the       Spion Hop               end and               onto         the         pitch      perimeter,             on       looking

towards          the       Leppings            Lane        end       of        the       pitch,           I saw         a    large       number          of

f ans      on    the       p it c h .        I presumed                  t h at         there          was     some         sort    of    public

order          situation           taking           place.               We        then        started            to    run a l o n g         the    pitch

towards          the L e p p i n g s           Lane        end and                 the      serial            then      became       dispersed.

Myself          and    Police           Constable               2155 Edwards                       stayed          together.              On       our

arrival          at    that       end        of     t he    ground,                 a    large           number         of    fans       were

walking          on    the       pitch.             I was        situated                   a p p r o x i m a t e l y at           the    edge       of

th e      IS y a r d       box    between            the        goal          and        the       West       Stand.            I had         no    idea

what       was    happening               at      that      stage             and was              telling             the    fans       to    get       off

the       pit ch.       A Sergeant                  then        told m ys el f                  and       Police         Constable             Edwards

to       form a       cordon        across           the        pitch,              w h i c h we          did a l o n g         with a         number

of       other    Police          Constables                who         I did            not       know.           I still         at     t h is     stage

had       no    idea what           had        happened              and           was      trying           to    control         the        fans       on

the       pitch       and     tell       them        to     get         off.             I could             see     that       there         was    a

m e lee a t > K e           re ar       of     the       goal.
While       on the        p i t c h at          this       time     I was          becoming            worried          as    one       fan    had

already        run      rewards            th e    Notts       Forest            end     and      if m o r e    were          to    f ol l o w ,

I f el t     there        would        have        b e e n a full             scale         riot.

It w a s     some       minutes            later,          after       1 had        seen         someone       being          carried          on

a    stretcher          and a         number          of L i v e r p o o l         fans      had a p p r o a c h e d          shouting,

"There's          people           dying        in t h e r e       why aren't               you    helping?"                 Most       of    these

people       appeared              under        the    influence              of    alcohol.             I then          decided             that

I ,w a s    serving           no    useful         purpose          where          I was         and    together             with Police

Constable           Edwards,           moved          towards          th e      g o al .        I remember             talking          to

about       six     persons           who       were       lying       on     the       ground,         but    these          were       not

injured,          just        shocked.             I^then          saw a y o u t h a ged                about       20 years,

laying       on     the       floor        who     was       panting          strongly            and    c o u l d n ’t ge t

breath.           1 talked            to    him,       tried        to      calm        him,      whilst       doing          so    I

signalled           fo r a St.             John's          Ambulance             lady       to    come    to    h i m as           well.

The    youth was              still        having          difficulty              breathing            but    was       s t ill

panting,          a stretcher               then arrived,                   he     was      put    onto       the       stretcher             and

was    taken away.                  It w a s       then       t h at     I became            aware       that       a    large          number

of    persons          had     gone        by     on m a k e s h i f t        stretchers,               some    with          coats          over

their       f ace s .         Although            I knew       people            had     been      injured          I was          still

unaware        of      th e    true        scale       of     the      incident.

Myself       and Police               Constable              Edwards          continued            to    help       the       walking

wounded.            There          were     a     l a r ge    number          of w o o d e n       advertising                boards

strewn across                 the     pena lt y area.                  The       fans       with       these    were          told       to    put

them       into     one       pil e    and        to w a i t       for      us     to    call      for    them,          thanking             them

for    their        work       done        already.            By      this        time      m o s t,    if    not       all       of    the

bodies       had       been        removed.            E v e n at        this       time         I did    not       now what             had

occurred          or    the        enormity           of     it.       I had        seen         persons       being          carried          on

makeshift           stretchers              but       thought          that        these         were    injured             persons          not

           Superintendent               Nesbit,             who    t o l d me    to    tell    the      fans     on    the    pitch       that

           the    g a me    was     off      and       to    start       leaving       the    pit ch .      This       I did       until

           about     half        the    number          on    the       pitch    had    left,       I then       joined       other

           colleagues            who    had       formed          a cordon       across       the    pitch       at    the    halfway

           line.

           I was     then        told       by    Police          Sergeant       Taylor       to    go b a c k    to R a w s o n       Spring

           ground.          It    was       only       at    this       late    stage    while       talking          to P o l i c e

           Constables            from       the    serial          that     I learned         of    the    enormity          of    the

           disaster         and     the      number          of    deaths       involved,          which    at    that       stage       was

           about     70.

           After     the     traffic             was    cleared          we m a d e    our    way    to C l a y w h e e l s       Lane,

           where     after        grabbing             a bite       to    eat,    were       transported          to R a w m a r s h      and

           went     of f    duty       at    7.30       p.m.        I did       work    at    the    semi-final            the     previous

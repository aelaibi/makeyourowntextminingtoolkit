               On    the a f t e r n o o n of S a t u r d a y     15th April           1989       (150489),         I was      on duty

               in w a r d           of the    hospital.          The wind o w s            of this war d          look    directly

               F o o t b a 111 Ground,

               I was     situated          near    the windows         of the war d             between       the      times    of      144

               hours a n d       1530 hours and was               looking        out       of them more           or    less all        of

                                                                                                                      S7S 0

             the      time.

             From      this    position        I was    within     hearing      distance        of the      crowds at       the

             g rou nd .

             At a b o u t     1506 hours,        I remember        hearing a        roar   of the      crowd and

             assumed        it was an early goal.

             Within       ten m i n u t e s    of this,    at about           1515 hours,       I   saw a Police         car

             Within       five mi nut es of this           {/saw three a m b u l a n c e s          leave    the A m b u l a n c e

             S t a t i o n and     drive      towards    the    ground,       the A m b ul a n c e S t a t i o n being

              situated        close    to the      hospital       on M i d d e w o o d R d .

             A second         fire    engine     travelled       down M i d d e w o o d Rd w i t h i n a few minutes,

              I also      remember      that w h e n     the    first Police         car       passed at about         1515

              hours,      there were          dozens    of fans      still      walking        down M i d de w o o d Rd

              towards       the    ground,      although       to w h i c h   club they were a l l i e g e d         I cannot

              say.

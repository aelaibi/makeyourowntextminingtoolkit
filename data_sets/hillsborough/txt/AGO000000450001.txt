        As discussed a short time ago by phone we are intending to issue this line prepared by
        Stephen Wooler our Deputy Legal Secretary to Radio 5 Live in response to their request for
        a statement on "No last rights".

        I would be grateful if you could let me know if you are content.


                "This office is concerned only with consideration of an application by Mr & Mrs
                Williams in relation to their son Kevin Williams. We have not seen and would not
                expect to see the report in question. Wider issues such as changes iij^the law and
                inquest procedure are for the Home Office."

        The last line takes into account the questions asked by Radio 5 Live.

    I have just taken a call from Nick Gamey of Radio 5 Live. He is asking if he can have a
    comment from this office on the book/research paper (funded by Liverpool City Council?)
    on Hillsborough entitled "No last rights".

    This apparently asks for changes in the law, in inquest procedure and the inquiry system etc
    and seeks the Hillsborough inquest to be reopened.

    He would be grateful if we can contact him on his radio pager as he is out and about in
    Merseyside at present (0345 333111 ask for 0893300242).

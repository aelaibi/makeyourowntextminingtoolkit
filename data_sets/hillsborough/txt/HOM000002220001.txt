           I am a L i v erpool              F o o tball    C l u b fan.

          On Saturday,               15 April       1989(150489)               I t r a v e l l e d on a    coach owned

           by Barnes         Travel,         C o u n t y Rd,       Walton.         The trip was           independent

           of a n y a g e n t        club.      I a m a S e a s o n Ticket              holder w h i c h was

           p u r c h a s e d from Anfield.                I paid £.& for             the ticket       for standi ng

          area.        I went w i t h my brot h e r -                                                      of

                  Li v e r p o o l    17,    and my brother               in law -                                    of

                                                Li v e r p o o l    13.        The C o a c h was     bo o k e d for

           1045 am       it didn't           leave     u n t i l 1 1 . 1 5 am.        The C o a c h did not stop

           on the way.               We were      d e l a y e d on the M 6 2 M o t o r w a y         for

           a p p r o x i m a t e l y 20 minutes.             There was            no alcohol       taken on board

           the Coach,          in fact L i v e r p o o l           Pol i c e    s e a r c h e d e v e ryone     prior to

           leaving.          We a r r i v e d     in S h e f f i e l d at a p p r o x i m a t e l y       1.30 pm.         We

           were     escorted          into     the m a i n C o a c h P ark w h i c h was             only two

           minutes       away from the ground.                        There was         no escort         from the

           C o a c h to the ground.                Myself,          Brother & Brother              in La w went to

           a S u p e r m a r k e t w h i c h was       only five minu t e s              from the gr o u n d and

           we bought         beer.          We drank       10 cans of beer b e t w e e n the three of
us on the grass              verge      by the S u p e r m a r k e t .

About 2.20          pm we w a l k e d         d own the         ground and a r r i v e d at appro x

2-30     pm-      T here was a few fans                    singing-            On a r r i v a l        at the

ground       there was a lot of                    people       at the t u r n s t i l e          but       they

were m a k i n g      their wa y through.                      There were P o l i c e             Officers

a bout      but no a p p a r e n t      d i r e c tions.           At this        time      it was          just

busy as y o u w o u l d expect,                    I di d n ' t    feel      un e a s y at        this      time.

I e n t e r e d the      ground       via a turnstile.                    There were              s t e wards

inside-         I saw two          together-              All     other gates w e r e at this

time     closed.         I w ent      forward          into       the    terraces.            I d i d n ’t see

an y gates        opened.          I did see           fans       in a    constant          stream

climbing        over     the walls            to    left of the t u r n s t i l e s               as    I

entered-          There appeared               to be one           suitable          f o o t h o l d w h i c h the

fans     used one        after      another.              My    ticket was           ha n d e d    in.       I

d i d n ’t see an y signs             to di r e c t me            in a n y     particular

d i rection.          I had been to                last years           game    so    I k n e w where              to

go.    I went       into     the    tunnel          directly          be h i n d the goal.               At this

time     I had a free           passage            through,        there were           no P o l i c e       or

Stewards        there.        No    problems           were       evid e n t at       this        time,      there

was    adequate        space a r o u n d me.               It was        now a p p r o x i m a t e l y

2.40     pm-      I e n t e r e d the         pens a n d        I went       to the back               of the

left     goal     post.       The     pen was          approximately              three      quarters

full.        With     refence       to a t t a c h e d         grid     r e f e r e n c e ’i was at L4.                 I

was    not     in the v a c i n i t y         of a barrier.               I had       lost        contact w i t h

my brother a n d           brother       in law but               I w a s n ’t p a r t i c u l a r y

bothered about             this.        The        rest    of     the    fans were          just        singing

but    no    rowdy behaviour.

At 2 . 5 0     pm a p p r o x i m a t e l y    there was           swaying        in the          crowd,         it

felt     full at       this     timeto         capacity-              Shortly        before        the Kick
off    I felt a surge               from b e h i n d       pushing me over a crash barrier

to a point w i t h            r e f erence        to the a t t a c h e d gri d        ref e r e n c e M6.

I was       s u s p e n d e d over       the    b a r r i e r w i t h my hea d       facing        the

ground,        the     force was           such     that     it caused me           to vomit.             I had

no    idea wh y        there was           such a surge-               I was      suspended        over the

b arr i e r    for     a bout a 1         1/2 m i n utes.            I managed       to get

underneath           the barrier an d              could see          that    the P o l i c e      had

o p e n e d a gate at          the front           of the         s e c u r i t y fence.     So     I wanted

to m a k e my wa y towards                  it but of         course e v e r y o n e       e lse    could

see    the     gate was        open and they w ere                   fall i n g   overtrying         to get

to    it-      There were more                 people     fall i n g     by the     gate w h i c h           is

p o s i t i o n e d at grid         ref e r e n c e NS.           I was a ware       of    people

underfoot.            I saw what            I thou g h t were          people      unconscious               in

the area         i n d i c a t e d on the        grid     r e ference L + M 7 +8.                I was

still       in c o n s i d e r a b l e    pain m y s e l f an d         I had to be         p u l l e d out

by a P o l i c e m a n      because         I w ent     underfoot myself              but    I was           only

a few yards           from the gate.                 I d o n ’t know w h y this             crush

happened.            I saw about            three      people        on the ground,          they were

all m y sort          of age,        c e r t a i n l y no     c h i l d r e n or e l d e r l y     just

o r d i n a r y sort      of fans.             I d i d n ’t see a n y t h i n g      w h i c h may       help

to    i d e ntify a n y o n e       in p a r t i c u l a r    onl y arms a n d        legs a n d 'parts

of bodies.            A fter     being         took out       I was      on the      pitch and           I

v o m i t e d again-          I d i d n ’t see m u c h of what was                   going       on then

because        of feeling           so    ill.       I c e r t a i n l y d i d n ’t see any

p r o p e r t y being       took     from a n y        c a s u a l t y at a n y time-            I was

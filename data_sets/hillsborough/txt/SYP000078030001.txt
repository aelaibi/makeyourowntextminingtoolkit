            On Saturday 15 April        1989 (150489)        I was on duty in company with other

            offi cers i n vo 1ved in dut ies at the F.A. Semi Final football match at

            the Hillsborough Football Stadium,               between L i v e r p o o l , F.C. anct

            Nottingham Forest FC.                                   *

            I was part of serial 34 under the supervision of PS 2248 S H E R R A T T .

            At 1000am w e all attended a briefing in the grounds North Stand a rea.

            At 1100am serial 34 & 35 were briefed by our Commander                        Inspector

            TOWNEND.

            At 1115am we all took up our positions on CJaywheels Ln,                           I was

            allocated the duty of recording the details of all the buses w h ich

            were     parking in this location.            Each bus that arrived was met by

            officers     in our two serials,       they were directed to drive to the end of

            this     particular road and there turn around and return to park
                                                                           PAGE         2
                                                                           S2229

alongside our serials.       An officer from our serial greeted each coach

and they were all directed towards the football stadium.           These buses

contained a wide cross section in ages of Liverpool supporters and I

can state that from this section of supporters, whilst they were             in

this location,    they appeared to be well   behaved and in good spirits.

At 1345 hours Claywheels Ln was completely full of supporters buses.

I recorded a total of 52 buses and 2 mini buses at this location.

At 1425 hours we were further deployed to the junction of Ciavwheels

Ln with Penistone Rd North.       We were positioned outside a public house

named the GATE a nd our duties were defined as supervising the arriving

fans who were walking down Halifax Rd towards us.       We were     instructed

to form a filter lane of officers and to inform the supporters that

all alcoholic drinks would be left at this location.           From this

position you can see a good distance up this Halifax Rd and as far as

the eye could see I saw that there was a continuous flow of Liverpool

supporters    in groups approx.   10 abreast on both sides of the

carriageway.     The majority of these were males    in the lower age

bracket,   it was very apparent to me that a large amount of alcohol              had

been consumed by the vast majority of these men.       A large number of

them were still drinking on their way towards the ground and a large

number of them were halted and asked to leave their intoxicants at

this location.     Some of them left their drinks,    others    insisted on

consuming them at this location.

Generally they were all of good behaviour,      they were drunk but not

incapable or disorderly.

From me and the other officers taking up this position the thing that

became most apparent to me other than their drunken states was how

late thousands of them had left it to go to into the ground.           This

heavy mass of persons    continued without any significant gaps appearing

until about    1510 hours.

                                                                                 S2229
Around |455 hours I observed of/fcers from my serial go into the GATE

public house and then e j e c t n u m b e r    of Liverpool fans w ho had

obviously consumed a l a r / f e amount of alcohol.

Our serial then returned from the public house to our point.

About   1510 I weny'with other officers into this same public ho-tTse as a

request for assistance from PS S H E R R A T T , inside the public house I saw

there were A p p r o x i m a t e l y 15 persons inside these/gfpeiTiises still    in the

process 16f finishing their drinks.           These    Qj^fsons were ejected from

these/premises and we then went to ti-jp/^oint we had been allocated.

About   1515 hours w e were able t o ^ f ^ ^ i d e r   resuming from this location

due to the street now being                of supporters.                            v

Inspector TOWNEND then ^ F o r m e d us that the radio was containing

messages of an incident       inside the ground requiring ajKambulance to be
                                                           m&e
brought onto the sA tch.       We were then informed i^y^PC GOSS that all

available staf/     had to proceed to the groi

Our serial /Xr\en proceeded to the groun^/entering via the large gates

adjacent/to turnstiles 77 to 88.           Lfcwas there that I saw an

ambulance,    parked in the corner close to the Spion Kop.             I saw that

two persons were deposited beside them at this location who had their

faces covered and were obviously dead.

We received instructions from Inspector TOWNEND to go into the walkway

besides this location and attempt to prevent Forest fans seeing the

deceased persons.

I was then approached by two Forest fans with a medical              background who

offered their assistance.         I then liaised with PS SHERRATT who went

for further    information.      PS SHERRATT returned almost       immediately and

shouted for all of our serial and any medics to come and join him.                       We

then went to the top of the walkway between the North Stand and the

Hop Stand.

It was at this time that        I saw large numbers of Liverpool        fans and the
                                                                       PAGE     i

emergency services carrying from the pitch persons who were either

dead or badly injured.     They were being carried out on advertisement

hoarding boards.

I was then instructed to go onto the pitch and assist       in any way I

could.   As I did so it was then that I saw the full extent of the

incident,   there were   literally hundreds of people littering the

playing surface, there were numerous bodies of persons on the g r o u n d ,

who were requiring assistance.

I then went to a number of these injured persons and helped a s best I

was able, along with a number of other officers, we were then

instructed to form a cordon across the halfway line a n d to prevent

anyone coming through.     This proved to be difficult as persons were

being brought through it who were requiring assistance.         This   cordon

remained in position until an announcement was made that the game was

to be abandoned.

With Inspector TOWNEND we then left the ground and returned to

C l a y w h e e 1s Ln and there we visited each bus and informed the drivers

of the emergency telephone number.

Liverpool fans returning to this location were on the whole very

subdued but a number of them were venting their anger towards the

police officers present with me.

Gradually the buses be.gan to disperse and we continued to get

enquiries from worried supporters.      We gave them the emergency number

and indicated them to the location of nearby telephones.

Eventually we were left with approximately four buses at this location

so we returned to Claywheels Police garage for standby duties.

I took no further part    in this incident.

While at the junction of Claywheels Ln and Penistone Rd I noted a lot

of Liverpool   supporters asking for spare tickets.

After       the        briefing           I made           my    way       to    gangway             S of J*f\e S o u t h           Stand           ready

normal          .      AT a b o u t Jg.30             pit/ I was           approached                by a L i v e r p o o l         supporter

who    had      got         into       the   Soiyth S t a n d              with      a    ticket.             He    asked        my advice

about       moving           from       the jj&outh S t a n d               to      the    Leppings            Lane        en d w i t h         the

rest       of   the L i v e r p o o l / s u p p o r t e r s ,               I asked            him      how    he w a s        in    possession

of a       south          stand        til/ket        if    he wa s          a Liverpool                 supporter             and       he

I could           see       that    there          was       a     build              of L i v e r p o o l         fans       inside            t he

The     youth          seemed       satisfied                with        this        and     I directed             him       to a         seat        in

of    gangway           S./

From       where        I was       positioned                   I could         see       the     Leppings             Lane      e nd      of     the

At    no     time       prior       to     the       start          of    the        match        did    1 see          any      fans       with

alcohol           or    cans       inside          the       grounds.

As    the     match           began      I made          my        way     to    a seat^n               the     stand which happened

to    be d i r e c t l y      behind          th e    Liverpool                  supporter              I mentioned.

Within a           f ew m i n u t e s         of     the         rna t c h tygg i n n i n g        I looked             over      towards              the

tunnel        at       Leppings          Lane        and         s aw VChe       crowd        towards          the       left         of    th e

as    it       s e e m e d just         like       t lie f o r m a l          acUons          of    a football,               crowd within                   a

short          p e r i o d of      time        1 again             look^ra          over      towards          the      Leppings Lane                   e nd

and     I s aw         two    youths          c 1 imbi n g / o v e r           the      perimater             fencing            behind          the

goal       posts        and       onto     the       p:i.\t/m„           Almost         at    the       same       time       the      crowd

again        surged          forward          but       on       this     occasion            seemed          to    be     in the           middle

of    the      pens.          It    seemed           after          this       everyone            seemed          to    be      climbing

towards           the       fences       as     if      to       get     out    of      the       crowd and             o nt o    the       pitch,,

I then        sensed          something              was         seriously            wrong        and       I could          see      people

who     had m a n a g e d          to    get       over          the     f e nc e     were        either       staggering                  on    the

pitch        or w e r e       receiving              medical             treatment            from       either          t h e .P u l i c e        or

the     St    Johns          ambulance.                 I did          not     assist         any       of    the       dead      or       injured,

myself         in a n y w a y       but       it     did a pp ea r             from where               I stood          that         everyone

              aiding        the    emergency       services       by m a k i n g    stretchers.

              I did     not       witness       any actions       by a n y     of   t he    supporters       which    I would

              consider        to    be a    criminal       offence.

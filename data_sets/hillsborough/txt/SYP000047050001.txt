  Suicide of

       B y R o n a ld F a u x        k
    VFOOTBALL supporter who
    vitnessed jthe Hillsborough
   lisaster and \«as later coun­
   selled for depression by the
  Hillsborough Help Group was
  found hanged days after
  watching a television docu­
  mentary on the tragedy, an
j inquest in Liverpool was told
  yesterday.
      On February 6, Mr Duane
  Riley, aged 25, a labourer and
  Liverpool fan o f Wenlock
  Road, Anfield, watched the
  Yorkshire Television First
  Tuesday programme about
  the tragedy in which 95 people ;
  died. The following day he
   disappeared arid four days j
   later was found hanged in his {
   garden shed.                      £
  , Mr Roy Barter, the Liv- |
   erpool coroner, recorded a •
   verdict of suicide; He said
   there seemed little doubt that
   the television documentary
   was a precipitating factor. “It
   seems to have been that which
   triggered off his subsequent
   behaviour,” he said.
       Mr Riley who lived with his
 ; girl friend, Anne Mussell, and ;
 : their son aged two, went to j
   every Liverpool game up to |
   the disaster. Miss Mussell said
    that since then her husband
 f would sit Quietly, not talking.
    He had gone for counselling
    by the Hillsborough Help
    Group but that did not seem
    to help.          v.y y .
       Mr Gerrard Flanagan, a
    social worker with the group,
    said in a statement that Mr
    Riley had been angry at the
    police and other people who,
    he felt, did not appreciate how
    upset he was. His anger caused
    some disquiet at group ses­
    sions. He had felt kinship with
    those who died. Friends had
    taken Mr Riley to the Royal
     Liverpool Hospital where h e
     had agreed to receive treat­
     ment as an O ut-patient but he
     had riot kept his appointment.
        Mr Chris Bryer, co-pro-
     ducer of the YTV ; docu­
     mentary, said: “We would like
     to offer our condolences to the
     family but asyetiwe have been
     unable to consider the coro­
     ner’s findings.”

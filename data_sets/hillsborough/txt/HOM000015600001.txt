          As you can appreciate the examination of the west stand, terraces,
          turnstiles and gates at the Leppings Lane end of the ground is of vital
          importance to Lord Justice Taylor's enquiry. Health and Safety
          Executive personnel have been briefed to carry out a thorough
          examination of these areas of the ground. Consequently, for the time
          being, these areas of the ground cannot be released for use by the
          public. This means that all areas from the gates in Leppings Lane to
          the track immediately in front of the west end terraces and on a line
          extended to the ground's boundaries, both north and south (see shaded
          area on attached map), are required for enquiry purposes until further
          notice. I hope the notification of this arrangement is helpful to you
          and South Yorkshire Police in determining how you will proceed with
          forthcoming matches.

          Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of further assistance.
          As soon as I am in a position to release these areas of the ground on
          the instructions of Judge Taylor, I will notify you accordingly.

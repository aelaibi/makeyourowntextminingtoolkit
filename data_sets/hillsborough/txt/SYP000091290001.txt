                 At 6.00 am, Saturday 13th April                        1989 (150489)       I commenced duty at

                 Hackenthorpe Police Station, Sheffield in the capacity of Acting

                 Inspector.           My tour of duty was 6 am to 6 pm on Divisional                     cover.

                 At approximately 3.10 pm that day I was called to the control                                 room at

                 Hackenthorpe Police Station and as a result of information received I

                 arranged for a number of officers,                         including a Sergeant to rendesvous

                 at Hackenthorpe Police Station.

                 Together with these officers                         1 travelled by means of a marked Police

                 transit led by the Divisional                        response car to the Sheffield Wej^esday

                 Football Ground,              Hillsborough, S h e f f i e l d . I remained

                 contact with the Divisional                      control      room so that times of arrival and

                 deployment could be added to the Command and Control                              incident.     The

                 numbers of officers attending besides myself were a substantive
                                                                                PAGE     2
                                                                                S3555
    Sergeant and 8 Police Constables.

    We attended at the Leppings Lane end of tfoe sta4^uny,^irS|d walked under

    the Worth Stand towards the Police    rooa r.   As a   Ve su l t cff conversations

    with other officers,    I took my officers on to       the footilball   pitch.

    On entering the playing area there was a chaotic s c e n e \with large

    numbers of people milling around and I saw several          persons     laying on

    the pitch,   none apparently serious hurt.        I saw some persons being

    stretchered off the pitch and numbers of others who were            in evident

    distress.    I saw many Police officers assisting the stretcher bearers

    and comforting those distressed.

    Towards the Leppings Lane end it was difficult to approach the

    perimeter track due to the large crowd. A number of the persons on the

    pitch were distressed, agitated and excitable and it was particularly

    evident that many were under the influence of          alcohol.   Iattempted to

    nove quite a few of these towards the side of          the playing area but

    the majority simply refused to move.

    I became aware that a number of youths and young men on the pitch were

    becoming engrossed by the Nottingham Forest supporters and not a few

    were becoming agitated and aggressive.          I had only been on the pitch

    for a couple of minutes when a number of these men, Liverpool              fans,

    started towards the Nottingham Forest side of the ground.

    It was evident that they were intent on attacking the Nottingham

    Forest supporters and I, together with many other officers ran towards

    the kop in an effort to stop the fans meeting.

•   A cordon was hastily formed across the pitch and the Liverpool              fans

    pushed back beyond the halfway line. The Liverpool fans facing us were

    very aggressive and the situation was very volatile and necessitated a

    strong Police barrier.

    As far as I could see all    injured persons had been taken away and a

    decision was awaited as to whether the game was abandoned.
                                                                          PAGE     3
                                                                          S3555

    The mood inside the stadium continued to be tense and I assisted a

    number of officers   in transferring Liverpool fans from the Nottingham

    Forest enclosure of the uncovered seating of the south stand,        due to

    aggressive exchanges between the fans. These fans were taken towards

    the Liverpool section of the ground.

    Following the announcement that the match was to be abandoned I

    remained inside until there was no liklihood of a confrontation and

    then gathering to ge the r /'the E1 officers,   I received instructions to

    patrol the area adjacent fyo jmy juncti^p^of Penistone Road North a n d

    Leppings Lane.

    On arrival the situation was well under control with other officers

    present and receiving a report of fighting        in Hillsborough Park we

    made our way to the Police Transit near by and attended at the Park.
¥
VOn arrival     the situation was quiet and on requesting^fresh

    instructions we were directed to the Leppings Lane Xe/^ra^id area where
                                               --------77// —
    we assisted other officers in security and searcljn.nijjyfoijr valuables and

    personal effects.    The whole area smelled

    intoxicating   liquor.

    At approximately &-50 pm (1850) we were s tood down and we returned to

    Hackenthorpe Police Station,    Sheffield.

    Following arrival at Hillsborough football stadium and entering the

    playing area I did not take a note of the time of specific incidents

    due to the fact I had no involvement with particular persons or

    events.   My pocket book entry was made by means of recollection at

    Hackenthorpe Police Station and although events and places were

    recollected clearly I could not attribute specific times.

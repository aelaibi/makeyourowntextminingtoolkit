        Dear
        NOTTINGHAM FOREST V LIVERPOOL - FA CUP SEMI-FINAL
        HILLSBOROUGH, SHEFFIELD - SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989 - KD 1500 HOURS

        In connection with the above fixture, it would be greatly appreciated if
        the following details could be given the widest possible circulation within
        your area.
        All vehicular traffic from Nottingham should approach Sheffield along the
        Ml motorway, leaving it at Junction 34 and taking the A630 towards
        Sheffield. Coaches and transit vans will park in Berries Road where they
        will set down their passengers and pick them up again after the match.
        Cars will be allowed to park on the numerous side roads in the Rutland Road
        area (please see attached maps).
        The route will be adequately signed by the AA and police officers will be
        on duty throughout the route and in the parking areas to assist in the
        arrangements.
        All supporters should time their journey to arrive at Sheffield between
        1030 and 1400 hours to ensure that they are in the ground for kick off at
        1500 hours.

        Gates will be open from 1100 hours and pre-match entertainment and
        refreshments will be available inside the ground.

        Supporters may expect to be searched at the turnstiles and will not be
        allowed in the ground if they are in possession of bottles, cans or any
        articles likely to cause injury. A copy of Sheffield Wednesday's Ground
        Regulations is enclosed.
        There will be a strict segregation policy enforced on the day. Liverpool
        supporters will occupy the north and west side of the ground. Nottingham
        supporters will occupy the spion kop and south side of the ground. Any
- 2 -


supporter or group of supporters occupying other than their designated area
will be ejected under the ground regulations.

This is an all ticket fixture. Tickets will NOT be on sale at the ground
and any person not having a ticket should refrain from making the journey.

Your assistance is greatly appreciated.

Yours sincerely

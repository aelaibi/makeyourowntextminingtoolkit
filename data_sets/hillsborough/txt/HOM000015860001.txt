CHARGES FOR POLICING FOOTBALL MATCHES IN LONDON

Lord Ferrers discussed Mr Boys Smith's submission of 20 July
with Mr Townsend and Mr Smith yesterday and agreed with the
proposals at paragraph 15.

Aware of the likely protests from the clubs Lord Ferrers has
suggested that once we have the agreement of the Minister for
Sport the Met should contact the Football Authorities
informally advising them of the changes rather than at a later
stage simply present them with the fait accompli.

F i reman                         and F i reman            were also on duty with us.                   The

engine was/the water L a d d e r ^ B 5 ^ ? u W B .           As   I recall    the extent      of the

me s s a g e w/s that there was a major disaster at H i l l s b o ro ug h Football

Ground.         If I remember           correctly the me ssa ge also          said that      there were

people        trapped.        We    carrying      cutting gear     on the fire a p p l i a n c e as

normal        so there was          no neces sit y to collect        this equipment.          At

1 5 . 16hr s we       left the S t a t i o n to go to H i l l s b o r o u g h.    On route      to the

g r o u n d our s t at ion officer              instructed us on       what equipment we

w a n t e d getting off the a pp lia nce              on our arrival.        He   instructed us to
                                           /

get   together          the   cutting y£ear wh ic h       consists     of the following.            A

cenger        saw,    a ripper gut/, airlines,            f l e x i — force and the   resuscitator

which      is a maximan,            on arrival at the ground.

As far as        I am aware          t he \s t a t i o n officer did not     receive any further

u p da te s    on the si t u at io n at the ground.

We a p p r o a c h e d the grou nd from M i d d l e w o o d Rd and         into Le pp in gs Ln.          The

s t a t i o n officer w o u ld have             in structed the driver       on y hi ch way to go

and what        part of the grou nd to approach.                   I do notyftnow where         the

in f o r m a t io n     came from w h i c h di rected us to Lep pin^s Ln end.

As we a p pr o a c h e d the L e p p i n g s Ln entrance           I noticed a large amount               of

s u p p o r t e r s who were        standing      by the blue wrough t       iron gates,      w hi ch are

the   ou termost          gates there.          I could not say how many there were                but

there w here a lot.                 Some   policemen were also         by the gates,        I d o n ’t

know how ma ny. The               driver   turned    right towards      the entrance and stopped

the   vehicle at a point                I have ma r k e d on the     plan of the grou nd at A1.

I now produce             this     plans as exhibit       reference No.

Our S t a t i o n Offic er S WAI N             left the vehicle and went to find so mebody

who   could tell           us where we were          needed.      We all   got out of the vehicle

exc ep t      for the driver,           Fireman             who   remains with the      vehicle.              We

got all        the    cutting       gear and the      re su scitator    from the vehicle and

                                                                                                     S 18 7 2

I saw that          there were       two a mb ul an ce s      parked along       the   pathway wh ic h

runs     past gate C m a r k e d on the              plan.      I saw that       in the    rearmost

am b u l a n c e   of the two,        I think there were two but                 I ’m not sure,      a

patient was          being     treated.        I d i d n ’t see who he was or what he                looked

like.        I was told by leading F i r e m a n ____________ later that                     it was a

young      lad but        I d o n ’t know.

The a m b u l a n ce      crew either        requested       it or one of my colleagues              took

the    re su scitator        to the a m bu la nce         for them to use.

S t a t i o n Offic er S WAI N        came    back to us and said he              c o u l d n ’t find out

where we were wanted,                 so S.O.      S WA IN sent F i r e m a n              along    the

pa thw ay w h i ch        runs at     the side of Gate C.             We   could see that          there

were a lot of P o l i c e m e n a lo ng             the    pathway.     He told him to find the

most     senior P o l i c e m a n he      could and find out wh er e we were                 needed.

I no tic ed while we were waiting                        that there was no immediate access

into     the West St and at all.                   The    gates w hi ch are mark ed B and C on the

plan were          both shut.         I believe Gate A was also                 shut but    I w o u l d n ’t be

certai n about            that.

I d o n ’t know how           long F i r e m a n              was gone     but he came       back and

said that the most                senior P o l i c e m a n he    could find was a Se rg e a n t and

he    c o u l d n ’t tell    him where we were needed.

All    the time Fi re m a n                    was       gone there was     nothing hap pe ni ng where

we were.           None    of the     gates A, B or C were             opened and the only

cas ualty was the            person      in the ambulance.

At a r o u n d the same time as F i r e m a n                         came back to us,        some       people

came out of Gate B.                 I d o n ’t know who they were               or how man y there

were.        The gate was shut            imm ediately after           they had passed t h r o u g h        it.

Wh en we saw this S t a t i o n O f fi ce r SWAIN told myself Leading F i r e m a n

                   and F i reman                   to go down to the        pitch to find out what

was happening.              We went      to the blue gate m a r k e d B on the              plan and

ban ge d on it.            S o m e b o d y opened the gate        for us but Leading F i r e m a n

                                                                                                    S 1872

                  was ah ea d of us and went throu gh first so                        I d i d n ’t see who

it was.           I believe     it was       probably a stewar d but             I ’m not sure.       Once

inside      the gate there were               some     stewards and P o l i c e m e n by the gate           but

I d o n ’t know who          they were or how many there were.

Le ad in g F i re man                        was a he ad of me so         I d o n ’t know whethe r

a n y t h i n g was    said to him        regarding w h i c h way to go,              but   I fo ll ow ed him

along wi th F ir e m a n                     who was also sl ig ht ly ah ea d of me.

We w a l k e d to the        right towards a gap               in a wall w hi ch        is ma r k e d on the

plan as C1          on the     plan.

As we w a l k e d throu gh the gap               in the wall          the area at the back of the

stand was          packed wi t h     people and there was total                  confusion.       Fo otball

fans were wa n d er i ng a r o u nd           in shock.         There were       some fans who were

o b v i ou s ly    injured.      There were also              fans    lying    on the floor     being

treated          by other    fans,     St.    Johns Ambu la nce and others.

As we a p p r o a c h e d the tunnel           I saw that there were              between six and

twelve       bodies on the ground.                A number       of them,       I d o n ’t know how many,

were de ce a s e d and were            lying at a point              I have mar ke d D1      on the   plan.

There were a co nsiderable                   number     of    people who were very distressed;

some were wa n d e r i ng         round.       Others        had congrega ted at the tunnel

entrance.           I was    not a p p r o a c h e d   before    I got     to the tunnel       by an yb o d y

requesting assistance.

As   I got        to the tunnel        I saw that        there were about             twelve Police

Of f i c e r s    standing     in the tunnel           entrance       stopping a n y b o d y from going

along      the tunnel.          The s up po rt er s who had congreg at ed there were

obviously          co ncerned for friends and                 relatives       still   on the terracing.

There were quite a few hea te d ar g um en ts                        be twe en the Off ice rs and the

s u p p o r t e r s who were     o b v i o u sl y worried.

I m m e d i a t e l y wh e n the O f fi ce rs     saw us they          let us throu gh the        cordon

and we went           into the f u n n e l .

I saw,      once      in the    tunnel,       that there were           probably at the most          six
                                                                                               PAGE         5
                                                                                               S1872

people       in the tunnel         itself.      I c a n ’t say whether      they were        injured or

not.        There were       some,    sat down against          the side wall      of the tunnel,

and some were just w a n d e r i n g about.               All   of the    people    in the tunnel

were    br eathing a n d not          in any    immediate       need of attention.

None    re quested a n y help at all as we w a l k e d through.

We got to t h e y 4 n d       of the tunnel and veer ed to the              right,    entering        the

rear of P            3.     I saw that there        were a lot of fans still           in Pens 3

and S t . / s o     much    so that     it was with some dif fi cu lt y       that we walke d

thro u g h the       crowd,    down the terracing           towards the frontage         fencing.

Due to the fact             that    there was a     lot of able      people still      in     the   pens,

it was diff ic ul t          to see what was        going on.       I could see that          there

were    people       on the    pitch but other         than that     I c o u l d n ’t see.

As we w a l k e d down the te rracing              I saw that a barrier had been forced

in some way.              I c o u l d n ’t see to what extent exactly.

The    people on the ter racing were                just wande rin g aro un d and wat chi ng

what was going on.                 I c a n ’t recall   seeing any     injured by the          broken

barrier.

As we got towards the fence at                    the front      I saw that at      intervals,

sections       of    it had been       prised away and          ripped.    There was one        large

s e c t i o n near    to the dividing          fence   b e twe ep ^pe ns 3 and 4 so we went

towards       that.        I cannot    recall    seeinjg^the gate si tuated          in the front

fencing       in pen 3 open at all.

We    climbed up throug h the fencing onto                   the area of the        pitch behind

the goal.           I could then       imme di ate ly see the extent         of what had

happened.           The    pitch area     in front of the goal and either              side of        it

was    littered with a mass of               people.      There were      some o b v i ou sl y dead on

the ground.           There were       others     being    treat ed and others w a n de ri ng

a r ou nd    in shock.

As we got throu gh the fence                 I saw that there were          some    bodies who were

dead,       behind the goal.           I could not        put a number     on this at all,          nor
                                                                                                  PAGE        6
                                                                                                  S1872

could    I describe         any of them.         It is diff ic ult      to   pinpoint any thi ng

e x a c t l y as there      was   so much going on,          it was difficult        to    take    in.

F r o m then on the         three of us split up an d just              tried to do what we

could.      I wa lk e d     a l o n g the back of the goal        in    the general d i r ec ti on

of the N or th Stand.

I set about walki ng           to bodies       on the grou nd and        looking to see           if

there was any sign of               life at all,      an y   colour    in their      cheeks.       It

became ap par en t         that some     of them were        ob v i o us ly dead and nothing

could be done.             I cannot     remember the specific           bodies or where           they

were    led down,         because    there were       so many.     I w ou ld say that the              vast

m a j o r i t y of the dead bodies were fully clothed,                   none a p p e a r e d to have

lost    their      clothing at any stage.

I saw that         some    suppo rt er s were    being ten de d to by St. Johns

Ambula nce ;       other    supporters,       a n y b o d y who was able-bodied,           was helping

out.     I formed the         i mpr ess io n that as the         ipjured and dead were

fet ch e d out from behind the goal,                  thei ry injuries were being assessed.

If they were o b v i o u s l y dead they hajj/'been placed                 in the go al mou th

area.      If there we re some           s i gns^ff    life they were        carried to a spot on

the    pitch,     awa y from the area          behind the goal where           they could be

w o r k e d on.     The    vast m a j o r i t y of dead bodies were          in the go a l m o u t h

area.

I saw that all            of the bodies       I looked at who were           not being       t r ea te d by

other    people had no signs             of   life at all.        I went     from body to body,

walking     round     in a circle        until   I had got       to the area      in front        of

the    go a l mo ut h again.        I cannot describe any of the dead Jbodies                     I saw

at all     or     recall what       they were wearing;         there w e r e ^ W o    many.

Once    in front of the goal             I saw S t a t i o n Offic er                who    is ba sed at

R i n g i n g l o w Fire Station.        He   instructed me toygo          back out to the

out to be used as a central                    control     from where the        incident      can be co­

ordinated.             I learned that the vehicle                I had a r r i v e d on was being used

as the      control       point.

I s t ar te d back the way             I had enter ed the terracing.                 I got back onto

it throu gh the hole                in the fence at Pen 3, where             I had gone        through

previously.             I d o n ’t know whether          the gate    in the fenci ng to Pen 3 was

open or not,            I ’d just made my mind up to go out the same wa y                       I had

come      in.

There was still a large                  number    of suppo rt ers      in the    pen.    The    odd one

or two were            getting      out onto     the    playing area through the hole             in the

fence      I had got through.              They were       being helped by Police Officers,

the vast m a j o r i t y were          st anding aw a y from the front fencing and                    there

were      still    a lot t h er eo n towards            the back of the       pen.     There d i d n ’t

appe ar     to be a n y       injured     in the       pen at all.

I went back            up the tunnel       wh ich ap p e a r e d the same as         it had

previously,            just the odd       person       in there.

The Police Of fi c er s were              still at       the ent rance      to the tunnel       whe n     I

got      there and they were             still    having    problems with supporters wanting

to go back down the tunnel                     to the    pens.

Th e y    let me through st ra ig ht away and                I saw that there were             still a

lot of people            in the area betwee n the tunnel an d the turnstiles.                             The

dead bodies were              still    in the same        position as       I had seen them

previ o u s l y .

Due      to the amou nt        of    people    there     I c o u l d n ’t see whethe r Gate C was

open or not.            But    in an y    case    I had de cid ed to        go back out the        way I

came      in.     I wal ke d th ro ug h the gap           in the wall       towards Gate B wh ich

was      open.      I w a l k e d t hr oug h    it and outside.

I saw that there were about                    the same amou nt        of   people outside.           I

w a l k e d towards our a p p l i an ce and             I saw that     other a pp li an ce s    had

arrived,         but    I c a n ’t recall who          or how many.

that S.O.                   was   requesting      it.

Our    res ucitator was n't a v ai la ble          to take      back     so once     I had    passed on

the messa ge        I starte d to go         back to the       pitch.

I w a l k e d back throu gh Gate B and just then a fan stopped me.                               He said

his mate was         injured up       in the stand.           I a s k e d him    if he looked

alright.          He said he did.           I decid ed that          his mate    c o u l d n ’t have   been

that      badly    injured to need a t t e n t i o n       like the others         did down on the

pitch.       I told him that          I w o ul d get to him wh e n I could an d he went

back.

I carried on             throu gh the gap     in the wall       to the tunnel and t he reo n to

the terrace,             throu gh Pen 3 a n d onto the         pitch.      I went to S.O. ________

an d told him            his me ss ag e had been passed on.

By this time             I saw that the dead bodies whicl>-were ge ne ral ly                    in     the

g o a l mo u th area were         being    put onto adv^-fxisirig boards and               carried

towards      the gy m n a s iu m by fans.         ^.^tfelped put some of the dead

bodies      onto the boards          but    ^ ^ o u l d n ’t de scribe any of them.             All    of

the bodies were            out ont*f^the boards and taken away,                   those a r o u n d

the g o a l mo ut h area that         is.

A fte r    this had been done,             I came across L e ad in g Fi rem an                          and

F i reman                   We d ec ide d that     nothing       further    could be done and

to go back to the appliance.                  We went back t h rou gh the hole               in the

fence of Pen 3 th rou gh the tunnel an d                    into that area.            I saw that       the

dead bodies         I had seen       previo usl y at       point D1 on the          plan had

been moved.          I don't know wh ic h gate we went                  out of,    either B or C.

I seem to         remember     that Gate C was open at that                point.       We went back

to the appliance.             W h e n we got    back there S.O.           S WA IN told us we

were      needed    in the gym,       so myself,        Fi re ma n              and Leadi ng Fi re m a n

                  went    back t hr oug h the West S t a n d via the tunnel a nd acro ss

the    pitch to the gym.

    When    I went     into the gym I saw that              it had been s e ct io ned off           into

    three sections.              All    the dead people were          in the first secti on as you

    went    in.     None    of them were          covered up.       I don't     know how many there

    were    but the area was             full.

    I went t hr ou gh to the sec on d secti on where                  there were about          fifte en

    casualties who          needed help.

    The    first     ca sualty I went         to was a man who was          lying on the floor             next

    to the wall        of the gym at a point              I have ma rk e d F 1 on the        plan.     He

    was    being given oxy gen an d a doctor                had gone to him.             I c a n ’t describe

    him but L e ad in g F i r e m a n                     stayed with him.

    I m o v e d on to a young             lad who was sitting         propped up again st           the wall

    near    to the f i rac             man at a point     I have m a rk ed El   on the      plan.     The

    lad was abcu*i 18 years               of age.      He had a mate wi t h him who was              talking

    to him;        he was   calling him by his name             but    I c a n ’t remember what         it
&
    was.     The     injured lad just kept opening an d                  closing his eyes

    p e r i o d i c a l l y ; he was    brea th ing    but he just w a s n ’t responding at all.

    He was weari ng         jeans aj>er a grey top.            He    looked quite thin.

    I looked around] fa// a re su scitator                 but all     of them were        being used.

    There was a lady doctor                nea rb y who was t e nd in g to so me bo dy else so               I

    a s k e d her when she had fi ni she d              if she w ou ld   look at this        lad.     She

    came    over an d ex am i n e d him,          checked his       blood pressure.         She just said

    he was        in shock.       I found out         later that he had carried his mate                in

    who was dead.

    S t a t i o n O ff ic er FL E T C H E R who    is at Central      S t at i o n was    rounding up the

    f i re me n    in the gym an d telli ng us to find the equipment                       that w a s n ’t

    being    used a n d     collect       it up to take       it back to the appliance.               There

    was    nothing     further we         could do.       We also     had to check the         pitch area

    to make sure we h a d n ’t left a ny equ ipment                   on the    pitch.

    I check ed the gym                 for equipment a nd the pitch area and went                back to

    our machines.           On         the pitch area all      of the    casualties had gone.              When

                                                                                                                S187S

              we got        back we sor te d out        what     equipment was ours,          loaded up       and

              w a i t e d to be    cleared     from the ground.              After a period of time,            I d o n ’t

              know how long,         some of the         fans were        let out of the ground.

              When      the fans    came out they were             very hostile         towards the Police

              Of fi ce rs who were st anding             in Lep pin gs Ln.            They were    b a si ca lly sayi ng

               it was their        fault what       had hap pen ed and they were               ver^rfbusive,

              swe ar in g at them.          I did not see any as sa ult s at

              Just      before the fans        were let out a man              came Inwards       us.    He   was a

              short      plump man.        He said,    "My name        is Sip/'fHarry L I V E R M O R E " .    He then
A -
-rlvr         went      on to ask    us what     had happened.                  are    instructed to say nothing

              so we did so.          His    breath \smelt s t j ^ n g l y of          intoxicating      liquor as he

  ,f'-         spoke and his words were               s 1ijrr-r€?cl.   I formed the opinio n he was             drunk.

              La te r    that   night   I saw this man on the tel ev is io n and he                     identified

               himsel f as the solic ito r            repres ent ing       the fans      in the Hesel S t a d i u m

               t rial.

               We    left the ground after            this and a r r i v e d      back at our S t at io n at about

              5.40      pm (1740).

              At     about       2.55pm          (1455)      t hat     day a     call       was    received        by      the    Dog

              As     we    reached          the     gates      on P e n i s t o n e    Road       giving     access         to    the    Kop          it

              was     seen       that       a    large      number       of    dog    vans    were       p a r k e d at    thaT.—         cl ^   X ifon

                                                                                                 R284

and    it a p p e a r e d that Dog Handlers were         just    coming   from the       ground

from a pair of large           sliding doors at that            location.

We    parked our vehicle           and awaited further       instructions.

At about 3. 2 0 p m      (1520)     that day the Dog Handlers were a s k e d to go

into the ground and we took up position on the                      perimeter       track        in

front    of the Hop at the Penistone Road end of the ground.

We m a i n t ai ne d this    position then until         it had been a n n o u n c e d     to the

crowd that       the game had been postponed and a large                   p roportion of the

crowd had      left the     ground.

We    then returned       to our vehicles       but due to the amount           of traffic we

were    unable to move       them.      So at this time we travelled on foot and

took up a position at Penistone R o a d / H e r r i e s Road              roundabout       to

monitor     the movement       of the fans      back    in the direction of Wads ley

Bridge R a i 1way S t a t,i o n ,,

A short     time      .'Later another message was        received that Dog Handlers

having duties          in the town     centre and      railway station areas were                 to

return to vehicles and make                their way to their       positions as         best as

p o ss i b 1e and t h i s wa s d o n e .

Duties were          then a gain    carried out   in the Midl a n d S t a t i o n area

monitoring      the arrival         of fans   back at the station until             6. 0 U p m

(1800)    that day when we were             stood down and       returned    to N i a g a r a for

de-briefi n g .

O BS ER VA TI ON S

After    the event       the thing     that   remains    in the mind       is what appeared

to be t,lie lack of         communications.       As    in my   case   from a r r iving at the

ground,     through being          deployed   inside    the ground,       through     returning

to vehicles and back           to town centre       I was    unaware of what         had

h a p pened at the Leppings Lane end of the ground and from snatches                                   of

conversation          picked up the fact there might            have   been a    "bit of a

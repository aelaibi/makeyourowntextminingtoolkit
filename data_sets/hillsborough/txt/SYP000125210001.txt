 OF THE PEN AND OVER THE FENCE.          HE WAS THEN CARRIED BY OTHER SUPPORTERS AND

 PLACED BY THE RIGHT HAND GOAL POST, ON THE PLAYING AREA ON THE SIX YARD LINE.

 I THEN SAW A MAN APPROACH HIM AND LOOK AT THIS LAD.           HE THEN COVERED THE LADS

 DALGLISH FIRST USED THE GROUND TANNOY, HE COULDN'T BE HEARD.           THE GATES AT

 THE FRONT   OF THE PENS WERE^TOO SMALL.          I FEEL THAT THE FRENCH STYLE

    GS3

     DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ONjAHE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

    AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

     I DIDN’T THINK THAT THE POLICE HANDUED THE INCIDENT VERY W£LL.     THEY DIDN’T

     SEEM TO REALISE WHAT WAS HAPPENl{$/AND BECAUSE OF THIS THEY CAUSED PEOPLE

     TO REMAIN IN THE PENS LONGER THAN NECESSARY.    BY STOPPING THEM COMING OVER
                                                      s
     THE FENCE ETC.

     IT SEEMED THAT IT TOOK THEM A LONG TIME TO HEALISE HOW SERIOUS THE INCIDENT

           SURELY THEY HAD THE BEST VIEW STANDIMjT AT THE FRONT OF THE PENS.

    HOWEVER, SAYING THAT ONCE THEY DID R^ALjfc THEY APPEARED TO HELP AS BEST

     THEY COULD.


    Q2Q

     054

     IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

     JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

     ALTHOUGH I GOT INTO THE GROUND EARLY AND WASN’T^INVOLVED IN ANY CRUSH ETC.

     I HAVE SEEN VIA THE PRESS, THE ENORMOUS CROW d / t HAT WAS ALLOWED TO BUILD UP

     OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES, THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE# BEEN ALLOWED TO TAKE PLACE.
                                                                               PAGE   9

THE POLICE SHOULD HAVE ANTICIPATED LARGE CROWDS AND PEOPLE TURNING UP WITHOUT

TICKETS AND THEY SHOULD HAVE CATERED FOR IT BY FORMING QUEUES FROM AN EARLY

STAGE.   ONCE THE CROWD HAD BEEN ALLOWED   ID   BUILD UP AND AS A RESULT THE

DECISION MADE TO OPEN THE GATE THERE SHOULD- HAVE BEEN FORSIGHT INTO WHAT

WOULD HAPPEN.   THE TUNNEL SHOULD HAVEjr 3EEN BLOCKED OFF AND THE SUPPORTERS

DIRECTED TO THE SIDE PENS.   THERE   DN'T SEEM TO BE ANY COMMUNICATION

BETWEEN THE POLICE OUTSIDE THE TjUfNSTILES AND THOSE INSIDE THE GROUND.

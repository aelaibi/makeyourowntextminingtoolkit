        Dear Mr Bone

        Further to our recent telephone conversation I would confirm that
        Ian paines, Assistant Chief Constable, South Yorkshire Police has
        provided me with a copy of a letter to him from your office dated
        30 July 1997. That letter contains an acknowledgment of receipt
        of a report on the disaster by David Phillips, then Deputy Chief
        Constable of Devon and Cornwall Constabulary. I should be
        grateful if you would supply me with a copy of this report.

        In addition, the former Home Secretary Michael Howard asked the
        Chief Constable of South Yorkshire to provide him with a detailed
        report of all the points raised in the Hillsborough programme.
        Are you able to furnish me with a copy of the report?

        Finally, please find enclosed copies of my written requests to
        South Yorkshire Police asking them to forward statements made by
        Roger Houldsworth and Dr Ed Walker. As discussed I am extremely
        concerned at their delaying tactics and would ask you to bring
        this matter to the attention of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.
                                                                                                J
        I thank you for your assistance.

         M iss Donna Cailik:




           j^ C w   A          ( c*v£vXt

         lhank you very much for your letters about the tragic events at Hillsborough in which you
         called for ilic inquiry to be reopened. J would like to say first of all how saddened 1 was by
         this letrible disasier and I fully understand your desire to reach a better understanding oi
         how it was thill, your brother Haul met his death. 1 found your leuer in which you described
         Paul's cheerfulness and joy o f life deeply moving.


         When the H illsborough disaster was discussed in the H ouse o f Com m ons on 17 December.
         1 gave an undertaking to consider carefully the representations that have been made to
         reopen die public inquiry. 1 emphasised that J would not take the decision to reopen (he
         inquiry lightly: J would need to be convinced that it would be in the public interest to do
         so.


     J explained ttuii in com ing to a decision, 1 would consider whether there is any new
     evidence, and if so, whether that evidence appeared to lie o f such significance that had u
     been pui before Lord Taylor or before the coroner, either the outcome o f the Taylor
     inquiry or the verdict o f the jury would have been different.


      1 h e .television programme "Hillsborough” made a specific allegation that a video camera
     framed on the. central enclose was working when the Tavlor i nqtjjyy w as tqlff     tl.ijs.was
     not the case. It was further suggesieo diat this liim might have represented vital evidence.
     The C hief Constable o f South Yorkshire lias informed me that both the video tape and the
     iran.sci ij« ui that tape were made available to the Taylor inquiry. This is a matter that I
     have promised to look into. 1 have specifically asked that the South Yorkshire Police
     should provide me with a copy o f this videotape.
The C hief Constable o f South Yorkshire has also undertaken to provide me with a detailed
report o f all lhc points raised by the programme. 1 will consider his report carefully. 1 fear
that there may remain matters about which we will never be certain. In a tragedy ol such a
magnitude, 1 feel that it is sadly inevitable, though deeply distressing, that there will be
confusion about som e aspects o f what occurred. What I must consider is whether a lurihcr
inquiry, if it were to lake place, would be able to provide greater certainly about what
Happened than -,w hove at pm sent.

1 shall reach a decision on any further action to be taken as soon as 1 have been able to
com iiler all those issues. M eanwhile 1 would like to offer you my deepest condolences foi
your sad loss and the knowledge that my thoughts are with you and all the bereaved
 families

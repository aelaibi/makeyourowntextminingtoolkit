        Feasibility Study
 to examine the proposition that
The Scottish Football Association
                and
   The Scottish Football League
  should be more closely united
   and should be served jointly
      by one Chief Executive

               Unification of the Two Organisations



       For    as    long    as   anyone           interested       in    the     affairs
of Scottish football can remember it has been a frequently
heard complaint that it is impractical to have two bodies
appearing      to    control     Scottish          football       and     that      it   is
uneconomical        to     have twoseparate           office       headquarters
and administrations.


       The     charge that there             are     two    organisations            seen
to control the game has no basis in fact.                                The Scottish
F.A.   has         never been slow           to    assert        its    dominant role
and the       suggestion that           it    is    in     some way subservient
to the Scottish F.L.             is made only by those commentators
who    have    no     close      understanding             of    the     workings        of
football      in Scotland.          Neither can it be said that the
Scottish      League       has   ever    seriously          attempted          to   usurp
the Association's authority.


       That        there have been            many       occasions        during their
long histories when there has been friction between the
two bodies is quite certain and                       it would be surprising
were   it otherwise.             An     examination             of the    differences
which have arisen from time to time would probably reveal
that they reflected the               likes,        dislikes,          jealousies and
other emotions of key individuals on both sides rather
than    that        they     were     caused         by     any        insurmountable
difficulties.          This friction is not peculiar to Scotland
but is seen all over the world, both in those countries
where the Association and the League are seen as separate
entities,      as    in     Scotland,        and     in    countries       where         the
two bodies are more closely linked in one way or another,
under one roof.
       It    would        be     wrong        to     make       too       much       of     these
differences.          For a relatively long period of years now
there have been few occasions when the harmony of Scottish
football      life has been              seriously disturbed,                       but having
said that it should be made clear that given the quite
different       basic          functions        of       the       two     bodies          it    is
inevitable       that      there       will        be     clashes         of    interest         on
occasion.        To      understand           the       situation         clearly,          these
basic functions have to be appreciated.


       The S.F.A. 's purpose in life is to foster the game
of    football      at    all     levels,          from       the     schools'            playing
fields and the amateur and other minor ranks up through
the    semi-professional               football         of     the       Junior      F.A.       and
the    'non-league'            clubs     to     the       top      professional             level
represented by the S.F.L.                  clubs.             This fostering of the
game includes such things as youth coaching, the training
of    coaches,      the    recruitment              and       training         of    referees,
maintaining discipline                 throughout             the game          at    both the
administrative            and          playing           levels,           ensuring             and
controlling         Scotland's            involvement                in        international
competitions,         and representing Scotland                          in the European
and World political               and    legislative arenas.                         In short,
its    function       covers       all        aspects         of     football         and       the
protection of its wellbeing, at every level.


       The S.F.L.'s function is, of course, much narrower,
in that it is limited to the interests of its 38 member
clubs,      on whose behalf it organises League Championship
and League Cup competitions.                         Within that framework its
problems      and     responsibilities                  are    many       and       varied      but
they all relate to the welfare of the 38 clubs and do
not      flow    over           into     the         more          general           areas       of
responsibility covered by the S.F.A.




                                          -2-
        It    is not        difficult,          on    occasion,       for     an outside
observer       to    form        the    impression          that    on     the    one    hand
there       stands     the       Association          and    on     the     other,      poles
apart,       there    is the League and                 its 38 clubs,             but this
overlooks       the       fact that        each of these             clubs       is itself
a full member of the Association and that such membership
is a prerequisite for League membership.


       Another            interesting           feature       of      the        historical
relationship between the two entities,                               and one that          is
not    always understood,                is that        the       League,    as a body,
is not a member of the Association in the sense that,
to    use names           as examples,          Partick Thistle F.C.                 or the
Scottish Junior F.A. are members.                            Instead, the S.F.A.rs
Articles       of     Association           confer          upon     it     the      special
entitlement to send a representative to the A.G.M.                                        and
to    appoint       the members           of     its Management             Committee      on
to    the     Association's             Council.            The    curious        situation
prevails        that        despite        being        granted           various       other
entitlements          and    privileges          throughout          the     Articles      of
Association          it     is    not     suggested         anywhere        therein      that
the    League       is a "member",              a title       conferred only upon
clubs and associations.


        Theoretically,                 therefore,           and       excepting           the
privileges mentioned, the status of the S.F.L. vis-a-vis
the    S.F.A.        is    the     same    as,        for   example,        the East       of
Scotland       League,       the       South     of     Scotland         League,     or the
Highland       League.           The overwhelming difference                       to these
organisations, of course, is that the S.F.L.'s membership
comprises the biggest clubs in terms of grounds and public
support,       a fact which has enabled the                          League to be           in
a     financial           position         to     maintain           its     own        office
headquarters and its own full time administration,                                       quite
separate       from the S.F.A.                   It    is the public             perception




                                           -3-
of          these         separate             headquarters               and         separate
administrations, each headed by a President and Secretary
who,    historically,               have       tended to have             relatively high
profiles,          which has created the feeling that there are
'two ruling bodies'.


        It does seem that                   so long as there               is a Scottish
League            organisation             running            the      dominant           weekly
competition          in       Scottish         football        there      is    going to be
a high public awareness of its existence and activities,
and    the        resultant         confusion          of     its   role with         that     of
the     S.F.A.             No       matter       how        close    together         the     two
organisations             may       come,       that        situation      will       prevail,
but    the        puhlic      misconception              is    scarcely        of    paramount
importance provided that it is only a public misconception
and that those most closely involved do not confuse the
respective functions in their minds.


        If    there       are       advantages          to be       gained by bringing
both    organisations                more      closely        together,         these       would
seem        not     to     lie       in     the       area     of      public        image     or
understanding.


        Presumably there are two ways in which there could
be a coming together of the Association and the League.
Firstly,          there       could       be     a    complete        integration,           with
the League becoming a department within the Association.
It     is    probably           something            along     these      lines      which     is
envisaged           by        those        whose         voices          are     heard        not
infrequently,            calling for an end to the present set-up.
Perhaps,          however,          they have           not    thought         out   all     that
would be involved.


        As    things          stand,       the       League       owns    its       own   office
headquarters             in     a    prestigious            and     relatively        valuable




                                                  -4-
        city centre              location.         It has      its own           independent      and
        quite        separate          financial       structure,         not     linked     to   the
        S.F.A.        in         any way.       For more       than       30    years past        its
        principal          source of funding has been the copyright fees
        paid by the Pool Promoters' Association for the privilege
        of reproducing Scottish League fixtures on football pool
        coupons.This             source    of          revenue will             continue      to be
        available in the years ahead but                            its prime position in
        the funding ranks has now been                          taken over by the fees
        paid by television                 conpanies.           Sponsorships           of varying
        kinds and values represent another funding source.


                The    League's          policy over          the     years      of    passing on
        almost       its        entire    income       to    the    member        clubs without
        retaining                anything         of significance               for        financial
        consolidation purposes has meant that with the exception
        of    its      office          building     no substantial              capital      assets
        appear in the balance sheet.


                If    integration with              the      S.F.A.       were    to mean that
        the     League's          financial        resources,          both       existing        and
        anticipated, were to be submerged in the greater financial
        reservoir of the S.F.A.                   it is difficult to imagine that
        the 38 clubs would view the                          idea with enthusiasm.                As
        these    clubs          are    allin    full      membership            of    the    S.F.A.
        and   are entitled to               share       in all of the Association's
        financial          disbursements          of    whatever          kind,       in    addition
        to    receiving           various       S.F.L. subsidies           of        one sort     or
        another, there is no financial benefit for them in sinking
        the   League's resources in the                            S.F.A.        Ratherthereverse.

I;      The   only possible amalgamation acceptable to the 38 clubs
        would    be        one    which     guaranteed          the       separate         financial
!;      integrity          of    the     League's      assets       and    resources         and as
        soon as that is admitted there is little point in pursuing
? '

  •••   the theory of integration.




                                                       -5-
        From the political                 and    administrative            standpoints,
the     idea of an amalgamation of both organisations would
appear       to be      fundamentally flawed.                      The    League     is not
the Association and the Association is not the League.
The     League     is a part          of    the       Association          and     like   all
of     the    other     constituent          parts          it    is     subject     to   the
Association's rule.                 If it were not to have a separate
identity but were instead to be an integral part of the
Association,         no more than an administrative department,
how is the Association's authority to be applied in cases
of     dispute?         Is    the    Association to                discipline        itself?
The Association represents the                         last court of appeal                in
Scottish football.             How is it to sit in judgment on League
matters if the League is the S.F.A?                          The concept is false.


        It would seem then that from the financial, political
and     administrative          points       of       view        the     philosophy       of
complete integration is ill founded and that the separate
identity of the two bodies should be maintained.


        A    second,     simpler       method          of        developing      a    closer
relationship between the Association and the League would
be to have them housed under one roof,                                   sharing various
common       services.         Few would          disagree          that    the      present
system       of   separate      offices,          which          inevitably       leads    to
a great deal of duplication of a number of administrative
functions,         is    financially             wasteful          and     unnecessarily
burdensome        on    the    member        clubs      who        have    to    meet     the
administrative          requirements             of    two bureaucracies.                 The
physical details of creating a new set-up where the two
bodies would operate side by side under the same roof,
whilst       each retaining          its     separate            identity,       should be
relatively simple but the benefits would be considerable,
e.g.     the      following         services          and    facilities          could     be
shared:-
     (1)     Reception

     (2)     Switchboard

     (3)     Computer

     (4)     Registration

     (5)     Printing and copying

     (6)     Mailing

     (7)     Refereeing Dept, work could be integrated

     (8)     Security Dept, work could include League affairs

     (9)     Commercial Dept, work could include League
              affairs

    (10)     Technical and Coaching Dept, work could include
              League affairs

    (11)     Meeting rooms would be used more frequently


     If    the    League       administration       were    moved      to   Park
Gardens,   space        to accommodate them could be created by
shifting     Scotball        Travel     and     Leisure    to   West    Regent
Street.      Other S.F.A.        departments may have to be moved
to West Regent Street also but this would be the subject
of a separate study.             The advantages of having Scotball
situated nearer the city centre are obvious.


     There       is      little       purpose     in elaborating       on    the
advantages       to       Scottish        football generally           if both
organisations         shared    one    roof.      That     it   would   be    an
improvement      on    the     existing    circumstances        goes without
saying.
        The Appointment of a Chief Executive to Act as
          Administrative Head of Both Organisations




       With two organisations sharing a building and sharing
the    services        of    a     number       of    departments          within     that
building,    it is quite evident that unless one individual
is identified as having absolute authority in all matters
related     to      the      building,          such        as    its      maintenance,
security,     cleaning,            opening        and       closing      hours,      etc.,
there is going to be friction.


       No   matter          whether       it     is     decided         that     a   Chief
Executive with authority over both administrations should
be    appointed       or whether the              traditional           system of two
Secretaries       is      retained,        only       one    individual         can have
the last word on all matters                         relating to the building.
In the      latter event the Secretary of the S.F.A.                                 would
clearly have that authority.


       It   is not unusual               around the world               for    the Chief
Executive     of       the    National          Football         Association         to   be
at least the titular administrative head of the National
League.      In practice,            such individuals tend to be known
as    the   Secretary         of    the West          German,      French       or Dutch
F.A.s, for example.                They are never referred to as League
Secretaries although they also fill that role, in theory.
In each      case      the    National          League's         affairs      are    looked
after by a Secretary who works under the general loose
authority        of     the        Chief        Executive.               These       League
Secretaries        frequently            have    quite       a    high     profile        and
in some cases would appear to be as well known nationally
and    internationally              as    are        the     National         Association
Secretaries.




                                            -8-
       No matter what the set-up might be it is probably
inevitable       in    Scotland,          as     elsewhere,         that      a    Chief
Executive      controlling         both        bodies     would     be     identified
as the S.F.A. boss and whoever handled the daily affairs
of the League would become known as the League Secretary.
That in itself is not particularly important.


       If the current Secretary elect of the S.F.A.                                 were
to     be     appointed       as     a Chief           Executive          over       both
organisations it would still be imperative that the League
should      appoint    a    capable       individual         to    look    after      its
daily affairs.             It will    not       be     sufficient        to     look to
a clerk to perform this function.                         The person concerned
will have to have the ability, authority and personality
to     administer       the      functions           of           the    League      andits
Management Committee,            deal with the member clubs, handle
the staff and be capable of representing the League                                   'up
front'      before the public and the media,                       notwithstanding
that all of these activities will be carried out under
the    general       umbrella      of the        authority          of    the      Chief
Executive.


       More often than not, in the frantic bustle of modern
day    football       legislation, such           a Chief         Executive         will
not be available to attend to the League's daily round
of problems,         meetings,     and     sundry chores.                For matters
of major policy and significance of course his services
would require to be forthcoming,                       but   it would be naive
and a serious miscalculation to imagine that any one person
could give close detailed attention to all of the affairs
of    the League,      or     indeed of the S.F.A., if he                         is the
principal officer of both bodies.


       The    concept       of     one         Chief      Executive        could      be
unworkable      in    practice       if    both        organisations          were    to
seek    to exercise        an employer's          rightful      authority over
him.      He has to be            answerable to          someone.       There has
to be one ultimate            authority to whom he               must    account.
There    cannot     be     two.      Obviously,      that      authority would
be the Council of the S.F.A.                   represented in the person
of its President.           That being the case, what is to happen
when the President of the S.F.A. requires that the Chief
Executive should accompany him to, let us say, a meeting
abroad, when at the same time the President of the S.F.L.
wants    his     services     for     some     important       League    purpose?
The answer as to what would happen is that he would travel
abroad and the           League's top administrator would                  attend
to whatever League business was on hand.                       It is difficult
to imagine that these circumstances or something similar
would    not     arise     repeatedly,       and very quickly,            as   soon
as the concept of a Chief Executive were adopted.


        In all      probability the Chief Executive would                      soon
become identified as the S.F.A.'s man and the other person
as the League's man.                There would be a danger              too that
before       long   the     Chief    Executive might           feelresentful
that    he    was    being    'excluded'          from    League     affairs    and
that     League     officials       were     turning      to   his   subordinate
rather than to him in matters where he would prefer to
be involved.


        The other side of the coin might be that the S.F.A.
people could feel that the Chief Executive was spending
too much time on League matters at the expense of S.F.A.
affairs.


        People      being     people,        it   is improbable         that both
sides would         feel     satisfied to be sharing the                 top man.
Even given the unlikely situation that the top officials
of both organisations were completely selfless individuals




                                        -10-
whose        only       motivation             was       the    general           fostering          and
improvement             of     Scottish            football,         it     is     difficult          to
imagine that they would not harbour resentment over the
Chief Executive's leanings towards one side or another,
real or imaginary.


        If one considers the position in which such a Chief
Executive          would          find       himself       whenever          the     clashes          of
interest          which       have       already          been       mentioned           arise,       it
does seem that,                   quite frequently,               he will be perplexed
to     put        it    no        stronger.               When       either        of     the        two
organisations                is    pursuing          a        course        of    action           whose
successful             conclusion will               not necessarily work to the
benefit of the other, or on some occasions might actually
work     to        the        disadvantage               of     the        other,        and        such
circumstances do arise from time to time, it is essential,
if    the     desired          objective            is    to be        achieved,          that       its
administrative                leader           should          apply        himself           to     his
organisation's               cause with             enthusiasm,            determination             and
vigour.           No other attitude will do.                                Lofty notions of
seeking only those                      conclusions which are acceptable                              to
all    sections          of       the    game would             appear       to    be     in grave
danger of being found to be no more than mere notions
and    quite           unworkable             in    the       real     world        of    football
administration and politics.


       It would be wrong to paint too negative a picture
of     the        problems              which        would        confront              one        joint
administrative                boss       even       although          it     would       certainly
not    be     difficult            to        list    many      particular           areas          where
difficulties would surely lie.                                 It is possible that the
theory       could           work       given        that        the        subject       had        the
sensitivity             and       deftness          of    touch        to    avoid        the       main
pitfalls          and    to       at     least       convince          enough       people          that
he    was     a     defender            of    all        interests.              What     would       be
achieved by embarking on a course which is fraught with
such uncertainties is difficult to imagine.

                                  Recommendat ions



        To sum up        the results of this examination into the
basic    proposal        that       the     S.F.A.       and the         S.F.L.       should
be brought more           closely together and perhaps be                             served
jointly by        one    Chief Executive,                and to          translate      that
summary into recommendations would give the following:-


(1)     The     idea     that        there           could     be        a     complete
        integration          of     the        two     bodies,        politically,
        administratively            and        financially          is       unworkable
        and is not worthy of pursuit.


(2)     The     two     bodies       should          retain        their       separate
        identities, with the S.F.L. continuing to function
        under    the     general          umbrella           of the      S.F.A.,        in
        the privileged            situation          afforded       to it by the
        S.F.A.1s Articles of Association.


(3)     It would be advantageous to both bodies and to
        their    various          members       if    they     were      to     operate
        side by       side    under       one        roof,    at    Park Gardens,
        at least for the immediate future.                          For the longer
        term,    a    more        suitable       location would               be     joint
        headquarters on the site of the national stadium,
        wherever       that may turn             out     to be.              That    is a
        problem for another day, perhaps not so far away,
        and does not          detract from the advantages to be
        won     immediately         by     a    coming       together          at     Park
        Gardens,        notwithstanding                the     chronic          parking
        difficulties          there        which        confront             staff     and
        visitors.
        (4)    Scotball Travel and Leisure Limited                            should move
               from    Park       Gardens     to    the        League       H.Q.     at    West
               Regent       Street.          Other        S.F.A.       departments          may
               have    to    do     likewise,       but       all     of the        logistics
               of     the    transfer        of     personnel          and     departments
               would have to be worked out by the Secretaries
               of the S.F.A. and the S.F.L.


        (5)    Complete       authority       for        all    matters        related        to
               the    building        at    Park        Gardens       would        rest    with

    #          the Secretary of the S.F.A.


        (6)    The    League       should     not       dispose        of    its    building
               at West       Regent        Street       but    should retain              it as
               a valuable and tangible asset.


        (7)    Complete       authority       for        all    matters        related        to
               the    building       at West        Regent           Street    would       rest
               with the       Secretary of the S.F.L.,                       but     on-site,
               secondary          authority         and        responsibility             would
               have    to be        conferred on one person,                       presumably
               the Manager of Scotball.


        (8)    Financial           arrangements              covering        the     use      of
               accommodation          at    Park        Gardens       and     West        Regent
               Street       will    require        to    be worked out              by     joint
               consent.


        (9)    The    proposition           that    a        Chief    Executive           should
               be     appointed       to     act        as    administrative              leader
               of both organisations should not be adopted.

■
        (10)   The S.F.L. should take immediate steps to appoint
               a    suitable       person to        replace          its    Secretary who
               will    assume       the position              of Secretary elect of



                                                   -13-
       the    S.F.A.    on    8th    January,     1990.     As   soon   as
       an appointment is made, the party concerned would
       have the advantage            of being able        to work with
       the    present    Secretary        until    his    departure     on
       the date mentioned.


(11)   Work    should    begin       immediately     to   organise      the
       League's move         to    Park Gardens and the transfer
       of    Scotball    to       West   Regent   Street.        Ideally,
       the new    League      Secretary      should be on hand to
       participate in the setting-up of his new domain.

                                                   of Strathclyde

       To the Police Authority for Strathclyde Region.
       Mr. Convener, Ladies and Gentlemen,
       I have the honour to submit my Report on Policing in Strathclyde during 1988.
         The public of Strathclyde rightly expect their police to continue to display high standards of care and
      professionalism in carrying out their duties in the service of the community. This is achieved by formal and
      informal consultation with the community and its elected representatives whereby the police enjoy not only
      full support from these quarters but also their active assistance. It is acceptance of this mutual responsibility
      that can make the greatest improvement in the quality of life in all areas of Strathclyde and help reconcile
      the problem of rising workloads and public expectation.
        M y Report is a comprehensive account of the work of the Force during the year and I wish to highlight
      certain features of special interest.                                                                6

      Resources
      The Force continues to carry a shortfall of some 194 officers which must have an influence on its capability

              Z ™ lr isatJ°” Programme commenced in 1987 should produce 90 extra police officers on operational
      duties by the end of this financial year. I have identified 60 further posts which could be civilianised in the
      m x t financial year as I consider this to be one of the most economical ways to enhance the police presence
      on the streets. I expect this programme to be an important part of the Force's re-organisation for a number
      o/ years. 1 am grateful for the additional financial provision made by the Regional Council in this important

     day-to-day work of dealing with accidents, less serious crime, fires, sudden deaths, suicides, complaints,
     disturbances, traffic duties and many more miscellaneous tasks which fall under the ever-widening remit of
     the police.
        On a high note the Glasgow Garden Festival, because of its national and international significance, made
     extra demands oft the Force, oiitwith that which is normally experienced. Good planning/ thorough
     preparation, and a sense of pride in being associated with this major spectator attraction helped to ensure
     that the Force made an important contribution to the success of the Festival. A full section on the policing
     arrangements is included in m y Report.
        Conversely, the Lockerbie incident On 21 December was a tragic reminder of the vulnerability of society in
     the face of terrorism, creating demands for well trained and equipped Police Forces to deal zvith the
     consequences. It also emphasised the capabilities of Police Forces to render immediate support to each other
     w ith manpower and equipment as the need arises. Strathclyde Police responded immediately assistance was
     requested by the Chief Constable of Dumfries and Gallotvay and at its height 500 officers, uniform and
     C lD , from this Force were involved together xvith specialist and technical equipment.    ;
        Officers from this Force continue to be involved in the painstaking investigation being carried out to
     id en tify those responsible for this dreadful crtme.

    \ Crime
     <TM impact of crime and the consequences for the individual has always been a source of concern for the
     general public, and in recognition of this a large proportion of police time and activity is channelled into
      crime prevention, detection and related issues.
        Movements in crime trends are important indicators for police management purposes and are closely
      monitored throughout the year. While considerable fluctuations occurred over the twelve month period and
      between classified crime groups, the final total has evened out to less than one per cent above the 1987
      level. Detailed statistics and analyses are produced in appropriate sections of my Report and a brief synopsis
    I will highlight the prominent features.
        While crimes throughout Strathclyde totalled 259,666 (+0.8%) the prevalence of violent crime dropped by
      3.7%. Eighteen fewer lives were lost through violence resulting in a welcome reduction in the number of
      time-consuming murder enquiries which had to be conducted by the Force. Fifty-three of the 54 Murders
;   ^ and Culpable Homicides investigated during the year were cleared up together with two outstanding from
      the previous year.
        Other crimes which returned final figures lower than the previous year were Serious Assault (down ^
      1.8%): Rohheni and Assault with intent to Rob (8 1%less): Assault with intent to Ravish (down 35

      crimes (-7 % ). This latter figure is particularly encouraging, meaning that over    m u fewer houses and
      outbuildings were violated.
        These favourable influences were partially offset bu the upturn in classifications such as Attempted
      Murder (up by five cases); Rape (increase of 21 cases); and Theft of Motor Vehicle (up 4.1%). However the
      main impact on crime figures was a further large increase in forced entry to motor cars. A n additional
      9,688 crimes of this nature were reported representing a 24.8% increase on top of the 19.4% rise in 1987.
      Vehicle crime is widespread and rising unchecked despite considerable police success in detecting offenders.
      This is one area in which the public could do much more to protect their vehicles and property through
      basic crime prevention measures offering greater security and removing the opportunity for spontaneous
      crime.
         Another worrying feature noticeable in 1988 was the increased readiness to carry firearms with intent to
      injure or commit crime, resulting in 77 cases reported compared to 56 in 1987. This pattern emerged
      despite the very productive firearms amnesty during September which resulted in the surrender of 1,658
      firearms and 51,953 rounds of ammunition. It is too early to assess the impact on crime involving firearms
      but the 1988 figures indicate firearms are being carried more frequently than in the past.
        Similarly, Bail Act offences continued to climb steeply reaching an unprecedented level of 4,025 (+79%)
      indicating serious deterioration in observance of bail conditions set by courts.
        The abuse of drugs continues to be a matter of concern with an increase of 15% being experienced in the
      number of drug offences dealt with by the police. While our priority is to restrict supplies by concentrating
      on traffickers, considerable attention must also be devoted to users whose behaviour causes concern in other
      areas.


                                                                                                                       3
    ■■■A W      .V .'A V A V .1. FOREWORD W A W W W W W W


         It is recognised that the fight against crime cannot be carried on by the police alone, and that the public
       and many other agencies and organisations can make an effective contribution in this respect.
         With the continued growth in Neighbourhood Watch Schemes, Crime Prevention Panels, and other
       community-based initiatives, I am hopeful the potential for opportunist crime can be greatly reduced and
       that Strathclyde can be made a safer and more secure area in which to live and work.

        Violence
       Analysis of 54 Murders and Culpable Homicides committed during the year shows that the majority (59%)
       were committed within dwelling houses and 19% in the street. The knife was the most common weapon
       used in these cases (44%) followed in frequency by strangulation or suffocation (19%). Sixteen crimes of
       murder (30%) occurred within the family unit and 14 of these were committed within the home.
         A n analysis of other serious crime recorded during January to September shows that knives again featured
       prominently in cases of Attempted Murder, being used in 42% of cases surveyed. Most Attempted Murders
       occurred over weekends (73%) with three out of four taking place in the late evening to early morning time
       span. It is of particular note that 17% occurred between 3am and 6am.
          A separate study of Serious Assault cases made known in the period July to September revealed that
       knives were used in 21%, other types of weapons/instruments in 45%, while 33% were caused by direct
       physical attack involving punching or kicking. Again 75% occurred at weekends with three-quarters of the
       total occurring between 7pm and 2am. Fifty-three per cent of Serious Assaults analysed occurred in the
       street.
          This general pattern of violent attack is common to all areas of the Force with the exception of Glasgow
       city centre where a higher percentage of such crime occurred in the 3am to 6am time band.

       Public Order
       The number of street parades and processions increased during the year to 1,319 which is 68 more than in
       1987. The rise which goes against the trend of recent years is mainly due to an escalation in the number of
       parades held by the West of Scotland Band Alliance (+90%) and the Apprentice Boys of Derry (+10%).
       Police involvement with parades showed a consequential increase with 22,724 hours of police time, an
       increase of 8%, consumed by these events. A total of 172 persons were arrested during parades which is 38
       less than in 1987. In view of the strong potential for serious public disorder the Regional Council took
       action to prohibit nine marches and imposed conditions on six others in exercise of their powers under the
       Civic Government (Scotland) A ct 1982.
          While Strathclyde has not experienced the rural disorder occurring elsewhere, there is still too high an
       incidence of smaller group disorders in cities and towns due in many instances to over-consumption of
       alcohol or mere hooliganism by young people. Offences relating to public disorder and drunkenness decreased
       during the year with 29,431 cases of Breach of the Peace, and 6,777 of Drunk and Incapable reported.
         I am pleased to note that Licensing Boards in some Districts are taking a stronger stance in curbing the
       hours applying to Regular Extensions indicating a willingness to tackle the problems experienced in their
       areas. Reports from divisions indicate an upsurge of opinion from the public in favour of measures to
       prohibit the consumption of alcohol in public places. There is no easy solution to this issue and it is hoped
       an answer can be found to alleviate the problem in communities.

       The Community
       Policing in Strathclyde has always been based on partnership with the community, recognising that
       complete integration is essential if a fruitful and successful relationship is to endure. In furthering this aim
       during the year the number of officers dedicated to designated Community Policing Areas increased to over
       250. Community Police Officers quickly become fully accepted in the communities they serve and work
       closely with residents, occupiers and other agencies to improve the quality of life.

       Race Relations
       I am pleased to report that considerable progress continues to be made to build on the positive advances
       made in recent years to develop and extend our dialogue ivith ethnic minority communities. More specific
       accounts of achievement can be found in relevant sections of my Report and I would draw particular
       attention to the progress made in the joint approach which was started at the end of 1987 to co-ordinate
       response to racial incidents and establish inter-agency working practices.

V .W A V W A 'A S 'A                        FOREWORD


     The Multi-Agency Racial Incident Group in Govan has made significant advances in refining the service
   provided to the victims of racial abuse and a similar project has been started in Govanhill. The acceptance of
   the value of this approach both by the ethnic minority communities and participating agencies has paved
   the way for further schemes in suitable areas.
      The number of racial incidents made known in Strathclyde has dropped slightly from the total of 217
   recorded in 1987, which was the first full year of the monitoring system, to 197 in 1988. All incidents
   were thoroughly investigated by the police and I am pleased to report that the detection rate for these
   offences has increased from 61% to 71.5%.
     These figures reveal a continuing willingness on the part of ethnic minority communities to report
   matters of concern to the police and are a sign of sustained confidence in the police and indicative of better
   communication fostered by closer involvement with ethnic minority groups and individuals. A full statistical
   breakdown of racial incidents is given in Appendix ‘K ’.

   Child Abuse
   In recognition of the special training, facilities and accommodation required to ensure sympathetic handling
   of offences relating to women and children, this Force has employed dedicated units of women police officers
   in every Division since 1984. The staff of Female and Child Units have developed expertise and skill in
   dealing with offences against women and children.
     Special mention must be made of the close co-operation existing between the police and Social Work
   Department in producing mutually compatible child abuse working practices which has allowed for
   commencement of an examination of possible joint investigation approaches.

   Road Accidents
   The Force has continued to devote much time and effort in the: interests of saving life and preventing injury
   on the mads. This policy has contributed to a reduction of 2.6% in fatal and serious road accidents.
     While the downward trend is welcome, there were still 202 persons killed and 2,761 seriously injured on
   Strathclyde's roads in the past year.
     The practice of breath-testing drivers involved in accidents and the heightened awareness of the public to
   the drink-driving campaign is reflected in the reduction in the number of drivers who were charged over the
   Christmas and New Year holiday period. However, there is still too much selfish and inconsiderate driving
   on our roads which will continue to be given police attention as resources allow.

   Policy Development
   M y Policy Statement for 1989 appears in my Report together with a review of progress towards
   achievement of the goals set for 1988.
     The broad objectives first enunciated two years ago continue to comprise the foundations of successive
   Statements which are developed in the light of new priorities and adapted to variations in the changing
   policing environment. A ll divisions and departments of the Force set objectives within the scope of my
   annual Statement designed to apply the local dimension to policy attainment. Results are monitored and
   evaluated as part of the annual review process which is a precursor to development of the succeeding year's
   priorities.

   Into 1989
   With the help and support of the community and its elected representatives the Force looks forward with
   confidence to the challenges of the future.

        The list of people who were of assistance to the Force during 1988 is
       too long to reproduce on an individual basis in this Report. M any and
       varied are the valuable contributions worthy of acknowledgement and I
       therefore extend my special thanks to the following for their sustained
       support and help during another busy and demanding year.

       in a vacuum, success relies on positive and meaningful involvement of
       the public. I take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to
       everyone in Strathclyde who assisted my officers in their often difficult
       and trying work during the year under review.

»                                     POLICY REVIEW 1988 W A W Af f l m


                                   The policy form ulated for 1988 w as built on the foundations of the
                                   long-term strategy for the Force first laid dow n two years ago.
                                   Divisional and departm ental objectives were again based on the
                                   principles of the Policy Statem ent.
                                        Progress tow ards objectives is described in this section under
                                    subject headings and a rem inder of the approved policy aims.
                                       The 1989 Policy Statem ent which follows in the next section of
                                   the Report has developed from this review of achievements.




    M ANAGEM ENT
         The prim e objective of m aintaining as m any officers as possible on operational duties,
         requires continuing review of organisational structures, m ethods and procedures to
         streamline adm inistration and identify opportunities for civilianisation and the introduction
         of new technology.

    Local reviews are actively examining administrative procedures to look for new ways in which staff
    roles can be combined, extended, and refined as a prelude to releasing m ore officers for operational
    duties. This is com plem ented by reappraisal of tim e-consum ing paperw ork which included overhaul of
    prisoner recording processes and involved setting up pilot Divisional Adm inistration Units in certain
    divisions. More Com m unity Policing Areas were instituted and foot patrols concentrated on high
    crime areas. The use of scarce resources w ithin divisions requires constant study to achieve most
    effective deploym ent.
        Phase O ne of the civilianisation program m e identified 55 posts for transfer to civilian staff and 49
    of these have been filled. Phase Two of the program m e is on target for finalisation by the end of the
    current financial year, involving transfer of a further 35 posts.
         Schemes for the application of new technology continue to develop w ith a start being m ade to
    upgrading the com m unications netw ork which includes installation of m odern telephone equipm ent
    providing advanced and m ore efficient user facilities. The Com m and and Control Replacement project
    is at contract stage and on schedule for com pletion during 1990/91.
        The office autom ation pilot project brought com puter-based w ord-processing and sophisticated
    technology to the Typing Centre at Force H eadquarters w ith early signs of progress tow ards achieving
    increased efficiency of work output.
       Phases Two and Three of the project w hich are at advanced planning stage will further develop
    and expand the system to tw o territorial divisions in 1989.
        A lthough determ ined and resourceful m easures continue to be sought to maximise the use of
    m anpow er, the requirem ent to rem ain under-strength is a considerable handicap to endeavours to
    deliver the style and extent of policing w hich com m unities clearly prefer and desire.


    THE COM M UNITY
         Policing m ust actively involve all sections of the comm unity.
             The continuing process of consultation and interaction w ith the com m unity and its
         elected representatives is intended to enhance public confidence in the service particularly
         through the expansion of:—
                      (i)   Com m unity Policing Areas;
                     (ii)   Crime Prevention Panels;
                    (iii)   Victim Support Schemes.

     There are clear signs across the Force of continuing efforts to strengthen links with comm unities
     through close involvem ent w ith local groups and by originating new opportunities to enhance
     relationships.
         Regular contact w ith elected representatives is central to the broad philosophy of multi-lateral
     participation, consultation and exchange of views on com m unity issues.
         More m anpow er was devoted to com m unity policing initiatives taking the num ber of officers
     em ployed on these duties over the 250 mark. Considerable scope and public dem and for further
     expansion is evident. As such schem es are expensive in m anpow er term s it is difficult to extend the
     concept while the Force rem ains underm anned w ithout incurring a corresponding reduction in service
     elsewhere.
         N ine new Victim Support Schemes w ere started in various areas with a further twelve nearing
     inception. A n additional nine Junior Crime Prevention Panels came into being. These complement
     m ainstream crime prevention efforts under which thematic cam paigns and exhibitions placed particular
     em phasis on reaching the more vulnerable m em bers of the comm unity, the very young; the elderly
     and the disabled.
         In a profitable spin-off from the Strathclyde International Police Tattoo, increased public interest in
     the w ork of specialised departm ents has prom pted even m ore requests for police displays and
     dem onstrations at fetes, fairs and other events as well as involvem ent w ith local groups, clubs and
     institutes.
         A ttem pts to attract suitable people to become Special Constables in divisions m et w ith mixed
     success. Training program m es w ere reviewed to ensure existing Special Constables receive broad
     experience in police work.



     ETHNIC M INORITIES
          In a multi-racial society, it is essential the police understand the different cultures, traditions
          and expectations of ethnic minority groups living w ithin the community. The Force intends
          to re-inforce the efforts already m ade through greater contact, supported by:
                      (i)    Ethnic Aw areness Seminars;
                     (ii)    In-Service Training;
                     (iii)   Vigorous investigation of racial incidents;
                     (iv)    Encouraging m em bers of ethnic m inority groups to join Regular and
                             Special Constabulary.


     Im portance continues to be placed on extending police understanding of the special needs of the
     ethnic com m unity. This includes dissem inating material which provides a clearer insight to aspects of
     ethnic culture. Appreciation of Ethnic Aw areness is now incorporated in syllabuses of various police
     training courses at the Force Training Centre.
         At local level, m em bers of the ethnic com m unity are involved in formal initiatives prom oted by the
     police and are particularly active in the work of Crime Prevention Panels. The appointm ent of a
     policewom an as Ethnic Liaison Officer in '¥ ' Division to supplem ent h er male colleague has been well
     received by the local community.
         To encourage m em bers of the ethnic com m unity to consider careers in either the Regular Police or
     Special Constabulary, publicity m aterial in U rdu and Punjabi has been distributed w ithin ethnic
     comm unities. W here necessary, counselling is available to applicants from ethnic m inorities w ho wish
     to enhance their prospects of em ploym ent in the service. D uring 1988, five persons w ith ethnic
     backgrounds w ere recruited to the Force.
        A multi-lingual approach has also been featured in crime prevention literature and an inform ation
     pack on the police service produced to help communities learn m ore about the police.
          The M ulti-agency Racial Incident G roup in Govan has now been in operation for a full year and
     its success has stim ulated a similar venture in Govanhill w ith others likely to follow.

     Ethnic com m unities now seem more willing to report incidents to the police. Appendix 'K ' to this
  Report show s that 197 incidents were m ade know n, in comparison with 217 in 1987. These reports
  were treated seriously and rigorously investigated. It is pleasing to note that the Strathclyde
  Com m unity Relations Council in its A nnual Report com m ended Strathclyde Police for our pioneering
  work in this regard and their endorsem ent is appreciated.




  CRIME AN D PUBLIC ORDER
       The Force will w ork with the com m unity to prevent and detect crime and preserve the
       peace. Crime trends will continue to be closely m onitored to identify any emerging patterns
       of criminal activity which m ight be counteracted by the flexible and co-ordinated
       deploym ent of resources. Com m unity-based crime prevention initiatives such as
       N eighbourhood W atch Schemes will be encouraged.

  This objective is being pursued w ithin the lim itations of available m anpow er. W henever resources
  allowed uniform and plainclothes officers were devoted to special operations in response to emerging
  crime patterns.
      Involvem ent of beat constables in the investigation of crime continues to expand and police officers
  generally are trained to obtain more detailed inform ation from victims on initial contact to reduce
  duplication of work. This also allows CID resources to concentrate on more serious crimes. Close co­
  operation betw een CID and uniform ed officers h as enabled priority to be given to crimes w ith highest
  potential for detection.
      In m any areas crime trends dem and special initiatives w ith strong inter-divisional and inter­
  departm ental co-operation. For example, CID and uniform units from 'N ', 'P ' and 'Q ' Divisions
  combined w ith Traffic D epartm ent resources to provide flexible and highly mobile team s capable of
  responding to a wide variety of operational dem ands.
      There has been a m arked increase in the num ber of N eighbourhood W atch Schemes in operation
  with the total now standing at 473.
      The degree of police involvem ent in the Safer Cities initiative, w hich will focus on Castlemilk and
  Easterhouse, is currently the subject of discussion. "Safe N eighbourhood” schem es exist in four areas
  with special input to the Secure Com m unity Project in Govan.




  ROAD SAFETY
       The central them e of the joint approach to road safety w ith the Director of Roads is the
       protection of life. Police enforcem ent will therefore principally be directed at those
       individuals w hose actions on the roads are most likely to cause injury or death. Emphasis
       will continue to be placed on educating m em bers of the com m unity considered to be at
       greatest risk, particularly:
                   (i)    The very young;
                  (ii)    The elderly;
                  (iii)   The disabled.

  There is im proved liaison betw een traffic and divisional personnel leading to a m ore productive
  exchange of inform ation on aspects affecting road safety. This cross-flow of expertise is also prom oted
  by regular briefing sessions during which traffic officers im part specialist know ledge and m utual
  appreciation of roles and responsibilities is developed.
      N ew opportunities are continually sought to expound broadly-based road safety advice and this is
  reinforced by Traffic G roups conveying m ore specific advice to those considered most at risk while


                                                                                                              13

     m easures are being taken to deal w ith particular aspects of bad driving w hich place the com m unity at
     risk.



     CONTINGENCY PLAN N IN G
          The capacity to respond and deal effectively w ith any contingency is an essential elem ent of
          police operations and the Force will m aintain its proficiency in this area through.
                      (i)    A continuous review of em ergency plans;
                     (ii)    Exercising emergency procedures;
                     (iii)   Training program mes;
                     (iv)    Regular liaison w ith the emergency services.

     Review of existing plans is paralleled w ith assessm ent of the need for new plans to cover w ider
     contingencies. Training exercises to provide practice in dealing w ith major emergencies produce direct
     benefits to those involved as well as indirect value to others from inform ation im parted by
     participating officers on return to their stations.
         Im portance is attached to ensuring that appropriate experience and expertise are developed in the
     handling of major incidents. Training in ground search and building search techniques and for the
     security of Royal and VIP visitors is on-going.
         There is close liaison w ith other emergency services w ho are regularly included in exercises and
     review and testing of plans. In addition, an officer in each division has been nom inated Emergencies
     Planning Liaison Officer to take special interest in local requirem ents and assess the need for training
     and dissem ination of related plans.




     M ED IA
           It is acknowledged that the police have an obligation to keep the public inform ed on m atters
           of general interest. This will be achieved through existing links w ith the m edia and w here
           possible these will be strengthened.

     Excellent liaison exists betw een the police and the press which provides invaluable opportunities to
     publicise local crime trends, crime prevention advice, road safety m essages and m any other issues
     which are of concern or interest to the com m unity. In the broader sense favourable relationships
     continue w ith all branches of the media.



      PERSONNEL
           Internal lines of com m unication in the Force will be consolidated and, w here necessary,
           extended to facilitate the early identification of factors w hich cause difficulty or stress for
           police or civilian personnel in order that these m ight be alleviated.

      These issues are addressed through regular divisional personnel panels, appropriate divisional rotation
      and review of training program m es for probationary constables. Specific briefing sessions provide
      opportunities for enhancing com m unication and w here appropriate local specialists are invited to
      participate. The W orking Group on Stress m et on several occasions during the year to keep pace w ith
      new developm ents and consider the implications for Force Policy.

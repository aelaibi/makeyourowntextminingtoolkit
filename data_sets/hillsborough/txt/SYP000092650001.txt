                 Inquiry          which          I completed             in    early           May        1989       (000589)         I wish          to    add

                 further          details             of    people       1 heloed              carry            from    the     -football            pi ten,

                 While       I was          still          in    the    Leppings             Lane         terrace         and      the     game       had

                 s t a r t s d , 1 saw            a youth          late       teens,           early            t w e nt ie s fae i ng      passed          over

                 the       heads       of       the    crowd       towards          the        pitch.              I helped          to    pass       this     youth

                 overhead             he    was       very       pale    coloured              and        I thought           he     had    fainted.              I

                 remember             he    was       wearing          blue    jeans           which            were    faded        1 saw       they       were

                 wet       and    it       appeared             that    he    had        urinated.                 I do    not       remember          anything

                 further          about          the       youth       and    would          not         recognise         him       again.

                 Later       I climbed                onto       the    pitch       and        met        my     friend                                      who

                 was       near       to    the       North       Stand       sitting               on    a wall.          The       game       had    stopped

                 the       players          had       left       the    field       we       wandered              around       and       saw    several

              situation            was          so    serious.              We       walked          off    the       pitch        into       the       Gym        area.

              In    this         area       I saw          a young          lad       laid       on    a    stretcher              he- h a d       a    coat          over

              anything            further             about       the       lad,        only         that       he    was     pretty          small,             he     did

              at    this         stage          that       I realised                that     people            had    died,        and       we       became

              upset         and    started                to    cry.

              We    walked         back          towards          the       pitch          and       saw    people           carrying          people              on

              stretchers               and       hoardings             this          upset                           even     further.                 We    walked

              back         towards          Leppings             La ne end             and       we    split          up near       to     the         half        way

              L i ne                             joined a             group          c ar ry x ng      h o a r ui n g s anci          1 joined               a n o the r

              group         carrying             hoardings,                I did        not      see                         again       until          we       were

              ready         to    leave          the       ground.

              On    joining            a    group          of    lads       carrying             a    hoarding           there        were         about           six       of

              us,      a    very       heavy          lad       aged       late       twenties             was       already        on     the         stretcher.

              This         youth       was       wearing          a    red       Liverpool             top       which        was     pulled            up       over
v e t W   n

              his      head       leaving             his       stomach          exposed,             he    had.      long     dark        coloured                hair

              and      I think             he    had       a    beard       but       am    not       sure       about        tni                  c 0 .h n o

              remember            his       trousers             but       he    was       wet       and    had       peed     himself,                I would

              recognise            the          man       again       and       he    was     definately               dead.          We      c a r r i.e d        this

              man      across          the       pitch          from       the       Leppings          Lane          penalty        area       to       the        gym

              door         area    where             we    left       him       on    the     hoarding               there     were        people            in       t he

              area         but    we       did       not       leave       the       man    with       anyone           in    particular.

              I then         made          my    way       back       to    the       Leppings             Lane       end     and     I joined               another

              group         of    lads          but       there       was       only       five       of    us       no w.     A    person             had       been

              placed         on    a       hoarding             and    we       picked        him      up       and    started           to     run         across

              the      pitch.              As    we       were    passing             the     line         of    Policemen            the       lad         on     trie

              hoarding            almost             fell       off    the       hoarding,             his       head        fell     away         to       o ne      side
ot    the    hoarding              and    his       feet       off       the      opposite           side.        We     dxd       not       drop

the    hoarding              but     pulled         him       back       straight            on    the     hoarding           and       carried

on    to    the        gym    area.           As    we       neared        the        gym    we    saw     an    ambulance              parked

and    the    driver            told      us       to    put     him       in     the       ambulance           w hich       we    di d .         I

thought       that           this     person            was    dead.             I would          describe        this        lad       as    mid

twenties,              with     short         ginger          hair,        clean         shaven,         he     was    wearing              Jeans

and    white           training          shoes,          an    old       style         red      Liverpool         shirt,           I    would

recognise              him    again.

L    again    went           back     into         the       pitch       w j-£        g A P, i^lj^e^q,^ a n d         into        the

    eppings       Lane        penalty          area,          which        by     now       was    covered        in     people             lying

    round.        j.    saw     an    a a) d u 1 a n c e      pa r k e d     nea •       th e     q oa l t ai i n g      u sje     ^e r r ce .

     saw    someone           standing             in    the     rear        of       the    ambulance           and     as       it    moved

off    this       person           fell       out.

By    this    time           the     penalty            area     was       covered           by    people        but     the       dead       and

seriously              injured        had      been          taken       away.           1 went         and     sat    down        in       front

'of t h e    South           Stand       with       a    drink       of      water          which       was     being        handed          out       by

stewards.               At    this       point          I met       up     with

We    sat    there           in a     daze         for       some    time         and       then    walked        back        to       the

Leppings          Lane        area       to    try       and     find        my watch             which       I had      lost          and    we

were       also        l o o k inn    for      another           friend                                                  I did          not       find

my    watch       or      friend,         I do          not    wish        to     describe           the      watch      I    lost          and       do

not    want       it      back       even      if       it    has    been         found.

              and         myself         climbed             into    the         Leppxngs          Lane       terrace         and       oack          up

the    tunnel           and     out      of    the       ground.             I dxd          not    see     any    injured              or    dead

people au tne rear of the tunne1 .

We    made    o ur        way      back       to    our       car    and         met                                         there,          1 do

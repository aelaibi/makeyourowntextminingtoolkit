Our    allotted          duty was            to    attend         at    Midland Station and                     escort           the

Notts.       Forest        fa ns     and Liverpool                 f an s     who     would       be a r r i v i n g       by        train,

separate          t h e m at      the     station and              put       them     on a n u m b e r         of    double

decked P S V s           provided            by S o u t h Y o r k s h i r e         Transport.                After       the        f a ns

were    placed        in t h e i r        respective              buses       they were           transported              to        the

Hillsborough             Stadium          being         escorted         by 2 P C ' s           per PSV.            Then

marshalled           off    the      buses         and     into        the    stadium.            The     P C ’s w o u l d           then

return       to    the     Midland           Station.             We    attended           at    the M i d l a n d        Station

and    commenced           our     duties          at    10 a m        that    date.

My    serial       remained          at      the     station           all    the     time,       not     travelling                 with

any    of    the     football           f an s     on the         PSV s.

All    the    f ans      who      arrived          at    the      station were              w el l    behaved and                co­

operated with              ou r    requests.              All      appeared           to    be d e c e n t ,        genuine

football          fans     from      both         tea ms.         There       were     exceptions              when       on e       or    two

of    the    younger        element            from      both Notts            Forest           and L iv erpool            tried           to

get    through        the      cordon and               into      the    City and           using        all    sorts        of

reasons.           The     snooker           tournament            being       one     of       them.

Each    of    these        were      searched and when                       football           tickets        were       found           on

them    they were           s en t      to     their      r e s p e c t i v e P S V "s . w i t h o u t          putting              up

much argument.                 This       was      the w a y       in w h i c h      my     se r i a l    dealt          with        the

fans    filtering           the      non-fans            through         the       station        gate s,       but       the        vast

majority          did what         they were             requested            to    do.         There     were       no    unpleasant

situations          at     the     station          everything               was    good        humoured        having           a    laugh

At    about £.25                  pm we       were       informed          by       the    British Transport                  Police          that

all     the        expected             football          f a ns     who were             travelling             by t rain       ha d

a r r i v e d at M i d l a n d               Station and             t h at      they were            not    aware        of a n y      l a rge

groups        of        f an s     s t i ll       being       in the       rail          system.

In v i e w         of    this my             serial       along          with       other       officers          froirn o t h e r

the H i l l s b o r u g h              Stadium.

The     r ou t e        taken          by the       driver          of    the       PSV    in w h i c h we w e r e           travelling

took      us a l o n g            Middlewood             Road       passed H i l l s b o r o u g h Park               and     r i gh t     into

‘L e p p i n g s    L a n e.           I noticed          t ha t     there          were    lar g e        crowds      of    people

walking            along          Leppings          Lane       towards           the      football          ground.          These

people        were           walking          on    the       pavements             and    into       th e r o a d     on    both       s i d es

of L e p p i n g s           Lane.           As    we    neared          the     corner         of    the     r o ad w h e r e     the

entrance             r oad        is to       the       turnstiles             at    Leppings          Lane.         The     area       was

completely               swamped             with       football          fans.           I could          only     see     Inspector

Sykes       who         was       standing          on the          co r n e r      to    the    entrance          and      he was

totally            surrounded with Liverpool                               f a ns .        It was          like a s e a       of     faces

in t ha t          area       stretching                from       halfway along                the    pavement           from     the

junction with Vere                           R o a d and well             past       gate       C at       the L e p p i n g s     Lane

turnstile.                   This       area       of    the       turnstiles             was    w al l     to w a l l      people       wh o

seemed        to        be    packed          into       t h at     area.           I could          see    several         fans

climbing             o ver        the     top      of    the       gate.         I did      not       see a n y P o l i c e        Officers

in t hi s          a r ea ,       unless          they were          lost        in the         sea    of     p eo ple .      I could

see     two        mounted             officers          who were          completely                surrounded           also     an d were

quite       obviously                  struggling             to    control          this       crowd       of    fans.       It w o u l d

be    fair         to    say       that       t h is     a r e a at       t hi s     time       was    totally         congested with

fans      trying             to    get       into       the    g r o u n d at        these       turnstiles            and    still        more

large       numbers               of    fans       were       converging             on L e p p i n g s       Lane     from      the

direction               of P e n i s t o n e        R o a d a n d M i d d l e w o o d R o ad .

With      difficulty                   the    driver          of    the    bus       in w h i c h we w e r e           travelling             i
managed        to w o r k        a way        through               the    fa ns      making       their w ay         along

Leppings        Lane       from        th e      direction                of P e n i s t o n e     R o ad,     towards          the

turnstiles           at    the        rear       of    the W e s t            Stand.          I could hear            on     other

officers        radios           t ha t     officers                at    the      Leppings        Lane      turnstiles              were

sho-uting       for a s s i s t a n c e .              I couldn't                  make     out a n y     specific          request

only     calls       for     assistance                and m o r e            mounted         officers         to a t t e n d        at    this

lo cat ion.

I have w o r k e d         football              d u t y at          Hillsborough Stadium                      on m o r e       than

several        occasions              during          my    service             including          a number          of    semi

f inals,       but     I h av e        never          seen          such a          l a r g e ^number     of    fans       at       the

Leppings        Lane       e n d at         th at      time          of    day,       the     area was         totally          over-

run.      This w o u l d          h av e      b e e n at 2 . 3 0              pm.

At   about      2.55       pm we           arrived          outside             the       gates    to    the    North Stand                in

Penistone         Road and             debused.                 My       serial       went     straight         into       the

gymnasium         where          we    were       to       be       held      on     standby       as a      reserve         serial.                We

managed        to get        a    hot       drink          and were             just       about    to    eat     our      packed

lunches,        having           only       been       seated             for      a matter        of a m i n u t e        when       Sgt.

Swift      told      us we        had       to    l e a ve          because          we w e r e    required          on    the       track

in f r o n t    of     the       West       Stand.              We       immediately           left      the    g ym na si u m and

went     into     the      playing            area         of       the    stadium.            T hi s    was    before          3    pm

because        as we       entered            the      playing             area       I saw       players       from       both       teams

on the      football             pitch warming                      up.

We w a l k e d a l o n g         the       track       in f r o n t           of     the    North Stand           towards            the

West     Stand and when                    passing          s o me        fans       in    the N o r t h S t a n d        I heard          some

of   them      "hissing".                  As we. m a d e            o ur w a y a l o n g         the    tra c k ,    there         was        no

indication           to    us,        at    t hi s     t i me        t ha t     anything          was    wrong       in the          West

Stand     of    th e      stadium.

My   serial       at,this             time,       including                myself          consisted         of P S S w i f t ,           PC

We     reached        the       corner       of      the       track       between            the N o r t h S t a n d              and    the

West     Stand and without                      looking           too      carefully             I got         the       impression

that     the a r e a           was    not as         full       as     the W e s t        Stand appeared                     to     be.        As       we

began walking                  along      the      track        in f r o n t       of      the W e s t S t a n d             the     noise

was     deafening.               The     whole        stadium           seemed           to    be    shouting               bu t    I d i d n ’t

take     any     particular               notice          at    this       ti me,        this       sort       of     behaviour            not

being      unusual             for    a game         of    t h is      importance.                  PC P a c k e r          was     in f r o n t

of me at         t hi s        time.        As we m a d e            our    way        further           along        the      track

towards         the S o u t h         Side      I began           to    sense          something              was     not      quite

rig ht .      I could           se e at      t hi s       time       that       there         were already                  three        other

Policemen           standing            on the        track          in f r o n t        of    us.        As       I neared Gate                4       I

realised         that          the     people        in the W e s t             Stand         were       not       shouting          but w e r e

screaming.                j    realised         then       that        something              was    seriously wrong                      and       I

heard      people             in the      crowd       screaming             "let         us    out",          "Oh G o d        help       us".

I. l o o k e d at         the    people         in the          crowd an d             I could           see       by t h e i r      f aces

and     that     people          were       crushed            up a g a i n s t        the     fencing             t h at    they were

clearly         in a d e s p e r a t e          situation.                 I immediately                  grabbed            the     officer

on the        track           and asked         him       to    get     some       assistance                 to    us,        I knew          that

I had      to    open          the    gate      to    get       people          ou t     even       if    it m e a n t         getting          a

bollocking.                   I can     remember           thinking             "If y o u ’ re w r o n g              Phil         lad,

you'll        get     a       right     bollocking              for     this."             I then went                straight            to

gate     4 at       th e       fence      behind          the     goal      posts         and       shouted           to S gt.           Swift

who     was     a number             of y a r d s     away       from my          position               to m y       rights         "I'm

opening         the       gate"       and    I opened            the       gate.          PC 3 1 9 8 A k r e d w a s                w i t h me

O n opening           the       ga te,      t he     crush was             so    gre at,        th at         the     people         behind

th e    safety        fencing           in this           stand        could      no t m o v e           to    free         themselves.

With     PC 3 1 9 8 A k r e d           I immediately                  began      pulling            people          out       from       the

crowd and           through           the    gate         and    Onto       the        tr a c k .     Most          of      the     people

that     we     pulled          out     initially were                  able      to w a l k         and       did       not       have    any          .

from     pen 4 t o ok              a great             deal          of    physical          effort.                Not       on e    of       them

came     out       easy.           Each          one w a s           trapped          in o n e       w a y or a n o t h e r               by v a r i o u s

parts        of    their          body.

After        a short             white       at       gats      4 we        were       joined          by Sgt.            Swift           and we

continued              to    pull       these          people- f ree.                  On more            than       several              occasions

jackets,           pullovers,                shirts             etc,       were       ripped         on    peoples             backs           in the

effort        to       free       them.

There        was       no    doubt          that       the       people          in the        stand were                 desperate              for

their        lives.              The    best          description would                      be      to s a y        that        people          were

drOwning           in a          sea    of       people.              All       the    faces         that       I    sa w at          the       front

were     pale,          grey,          white          or    blue          all    with       p an i c      and       p a in w r i t t e n         all

stare,        screaming                at    you with                their       ey es.        There         were         many whose                 e y es

were     closed.

Whilst        we       were       standing             at       the       gate,       1 could          see      two       men        on    the       f l oo r

at     the    g a te        opening,             we w e r e          frantically             pulling            people           out       as    fast

as we        could          to    try and             get       to    the       people       at      the     front,            but        as    s o o n as

I got        down       on m y         hands          and       knees       and       grabbed          hold         of    one        of    the       men

passing        more       and more            officers             were       arriving           at     the       sc ene ,      t h i s was

quite       obviously within                   minutes             of    opening          the       gates         even       t h o u g h we

seemed       to    have         been     there           a hell         of a       long        t im e     before         anyone

actually          came,         but     it was           only minutes.

The    main       problem was             t hat      no m a t t e r           how m a ny were                pulled          from       the

fro n t ,    the       c r u s h w as     so       great       from          the    back       we     c o u l d n ’t r e l i e v e         any

pressure          to    get     to    the      people          at       the    very       front         or    sides          who     were       in

serious        trouble.

It    became       obvious           t ha t    pressure             needed          to    be     released           from        the      rear

where       there       was     now     space        appearing.                    Officers           were        telling          or

shouting          to    people        to m o v e         back awa y            from       the       front         but    they        w o u l d n ’t

so    the    situation           continued.

I made^a          request        to     one        Inspector             who       was    standing            on    the       grass        to

get a s e r i a l         in t h r o u g h         the    back          to    pull       the     people           out.        Whether           he

did    or    not       I d o n ’t know,             he    seemed a             little          no n     plussed and                walked

away.        I have        no    i de a w h o        he was.

I can       remember          pulling          a    boy       of    about          16 y rs       from        the    crowd who              ha d a

b r o k e n arm.         By     that     I mean           I could             clearly          see      t hat      the       bone       in his

right       f o r e a r m was        broken.             He    ha d      somehow          managed            to    pull       himself

above       the    people        in th e           crowd an d            shouted          to     us t h a t        he    had       broken

his    arm,       with another                officer          we       managed          to g r a b       him and            pull       hi m

through           the    gate       and       onto    the      track.               He    j u st        thanked           us a n d w a l k e d

off.

Most     of       the    ones       who       were        pulled       out,         who       were         able       thanked          us a n d

were     cr y i n g ,     thanking             god        t h at     they       had      got out.

As    more        and more          officers          arrived             at    the       sc ene ,          they, b e g a n       to     te ar

down     th e      fencing          with       their        b a re    h a n d s , trying                  to    get       to    the     people        in

the    pen.          Some      even       tried           to k i c k       it    down.         Some            officers          were

hanging           o'/er the         fencing          and     pulling            p e o p l e o ver              quite        c l e a r l y in

some     danger          of    falling          into        the      pen       themselves.

At    t h is      time    i moved away                from         the     gate          and       started           checking           the

people         laid      down       o n the         gra ss ,       I cannot              remember              how m an y were             laid

on    the      grass' at           this       time    but      my     estimation                   would        be       in the       r e g i o n of

about        30    to 40.           Other       Police         Officers              were          engaged           in a t t e m p t s       to

revive         p eop le.

I made         several         attempts             to     revive         people          with artificial

resuscitation and whenever                                I thought             I f el t           a    pul s e      I would          shout        any

medical           personnel             who    were       near       at    hand.              I seemed              to    have    found more

dead     than alive.

The    situation              in    this       a re a was          quite        chaotic,                bodies           all    o ver    the

p la c e ,     people         wandering             about      crying,              screaming,                 shouting,          Police

Officers           and what             few medical            personnel                 were          there        trying       frantically

to    revive         peo ple .

After        s ome      time       at    checking           bodies         and making                   several           hopeless

attempts           to    revive          people          it b e c a m e        obvious             to me        that       there        was

nothing           more    that          I could       do.          I was        feeling                absolutely              physically

shattered.               By    this       time       all     the      people             in    pe n 4 h a d              been    pulled        out

and    there         only      remained             the     dead      bodies             in    pen 3            a    large       number        of

which        had     been      taken          out    and     placed            on    the       fie ld .

During         the      most       frantic          moments          of    trying             to       re v i v e    the       people      on the;

              COPY OF LETTER RECEIVED FROM THE FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION




                                                              2 9 th November 1977


     To All Football league Cluba


     Dear Sira,

          At a recent joint meeting with The'^Football League considerable
     concern was expressed at the increasing disturbances that occur after
     matches« often putting the safety of Referees and Linesmen at risk.

          It is essential that arrangements are made by Clubs to ensure
     that the police and stewards do make every effort to liaise with v h o
     Referee and Linesmen and conduct the officials safely from the pxcch
     and it is important that there are general safeguards in the vicinity
     of the tunnel.

          There are various possibilities for shielding the tunnel frcn the
     Dressing Rooms to the pitch and this can either be a fixed c a g o or an
     extending cage that is pushed out only when the toam and officials are
     going onto or leaving the pitch. It cannot be stressed too strongly
     that Cluba are responsible for safety in all areas of the ground and
     every care must be taken to safeguard match officials.

          If you have any particular .comments on this difficult subject, or
     there is any further information you require, please lot me know.


                                         Yours faithfully,

                                          E.A. CROKER

           Dear Sir,


                 I am writing to let you know that the Football League has
           recently asked all Football League Clubs to keep the police fully
           informed whenever a match is postponed or abandoned following a
           referee*s inspection of the pitch.

                 This is the somewhat belated result of the Chief Constable of
           Northumbria having written to Mr. Hardaker, the Football
           Secretary, in December last year about the problems his officers were
           caused when a match between Newcastle United and Ipswich was abandoned
           without the police having been informed ot forewarned of the possibility.

                 The Football League have requested that the information in their
           letter to Clubs be circulated to Chief Constables and I attach a copy
           accordingly.



                                                        Tours faithfully,




                                                        General Secretary

                              yp '
              You wrote on 30 Ma r c h sugge sting that Hillsborough Stadium, the
        ground of Sheffield Wednesday F.C ., should be designated under the
        Act.

        2.    As you know the basis of the present range of designation is
        that it should cover all First Division grounds plus those regarded
        as "international" grounds, i.e. regularly used for international
        matches.  Although Hillsborough is not of course in the First Division
        and does not technically fall under the second category either there
        seemed to us to be a case for regarding it as of comparable status by
        reason of its regular use as the venue for semi-finals of the F.A.
        Cup and for Cup Final replays.    In accordance therefore, with the
        requirements of s. 18(4) of the Act we have consulted the interested
        bodies, including the Football League and the Football Association.
        The latter have however made the point that there is at present no
        certainty that Sheffield Wednesday will be invited to stage a semi­
        final of the F.A. Cup in the next year or two, and that in these
        circumstances it is questionable whether it would be justifiable to
        insist on bringing the club within the ambit of the general require­
        ments of the safety certificate procedures.    The Club itself is averse
        to being designated.   While the latter is not, of course, in itself a
        sufficient reason not to designate their ground, the point made by the
        Football Association is a fair one:    the case for designation is not
        overwhelming.  In these circumstances therefore we are not minded for
        the time being to press for^’
                                    d esignation in the face of the reservations
        expressed by the Association.

        3.    We shall however have an opportunity to^Look at the matter again
        next year w hen we are likely to be considering the extension of
        designations to the grounds of the Second Division.        In the meantime
        of course the local authority will always have power under 9.10 of
SOUTH               aPPly to a magistrates' court for an order prohibiting or
                     the admission of spectators to any part of the ground.

Dear Mr

Thank you for your letter of 11 October 1977.

Since you visited me at Police Headquarters X have takenthe
opportunity to speak to the secretary of the Sheffield United
Football Club.

I understand from him that funds may soon be available for the
improvement of safety measures at football grounds generally and
also that he would wish to perpetuate the money of your supporters
club in some way at the Bramall Lane ground.

He has suggested that perhaps you and some of your colleagueswould
care to meet him and the chairman of the club to discuss theway in
which the money which you have available might best be used.
Perhaps if you would get in touch with him the matter may now be
satisfactorily resolved.

Thank you once again for your keen interest in safety arrangements
at football grounds.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr

Thank you for your letter of the 24 September, 1977, in respect of
money which you have available and wish to use for the benefit of
spectators at Bramall Lane.

It is refreshing to see such a positive effort to aid the comfort of
those spectators who attend football matches to see the game rather
than to cause trouble. Whilst I am most appreciative of your kind
offer of help, I think it is really a matter which you should discuss
with the secretary of the Sheffield United Football Club. We do work
very closely with Club officials to ensure the safety of spectators
and certainly the piece of equipment to which you refer will be a
matter we shall consider in liaison with the Club after you h a w made
your approach to them.

Once again, very many thanks for your kind offer.

Yours sincerely

Your letter of 29 September, bearing John Harris's

I believe, through some staff changes at your end.
We discussed it some two weeks or so ago, so there

Having read with interest the somewhat uncompromising

correspondence to say that I have learned an
invaluable lesson.

Dear Mr. Barratt,

Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975

Thankyou for your letter of 23rd September. I have looked at the letter
of 24th August to which you refer and see no indication on it at allthat
this is a personal letter to you. Certainly when it was sent to m e there
was no indication given that itrepresented anything other than the official
view of the H o m e Office.

I will be writing officially to the Ho m e Office on behalf of the County Council
who have the responsibility for the Safety of Sports Ground Act - you will
recall that we have exchanged some correspondence on this already and it
would be interesting to see whether there is any difference in the answer I
receive to the one that you have received.

Dear Mr Mallett

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

I was somewhat disturbed in perusing the papers for
the Policy Co:"uittee on Tuesday 20 September 1977/
to s.'- ; a facsimile copy of the Horae Office letter
     1


aated 24 August 1377 addressed to me about Hillsborough
Stao.iui-j. The paper was rubber stamped "iiot for
publication until after Committee meeting'1. I have
endeavoured to keep your office infonaed of developments
on the issue of safety of sports grounds, and X would
have thought that a member of your staff would have had
the courtesy to ask me if I had any objection to a .
personal letter being reproduced in this way. I do not
think it appropriate for copies of Home Office
correspondence! to be Bade available to the Press without
careful consideration of the implications.

Yours sincerely

Dear Sir

FA CUP SHMI-FINAL, HILLSBOROUGH, SHEFFIELD •» SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUND
ACT 1975

Thank you for your memorandum of 20 May %977 in connection wttR the
above, and particularly the letter which you have received from the
Administration and Legal Department of the City of Sheffield Metro**
politan District. I note that you have written to the head of the
department concerned in connection with the designation of the
Hillsborough Stadium under the Safety of Sports Ground (Designation)
Order 1976.

To deal with the other matters in the letter, the penning of spectators
would no doubt prevent the surging movement which occasionally occurs
at the Spion Kop end of the Hillsborough ground, and should go towards
lessening disturbances on the terraces. As you will be aware, however,
considerable reconstruction work would need to be done, particularly
with regard to access points being created in respect of each pea, It
may be difficult to persuade a Club not covered by the Designation
Order to carry out major construction work when the average gate on a
normal day is about 10,000.
                                            ...                    ’
I agree entirely that complete segregation of rival supporters over-
comes many of the difficulties in the ground itself, but, of course,
this can only be achieved if the match is an *all ticket * affair, and
the two Clubs ensure that tickets only go to their own supporters.
This is a matter entirely out of the handft of the Police arid, as you
will know, something went sadly wrong with the sale of tickets for the
Semifinal in question, and Manchester United supporters in excess of
2,000 obtained tickets for that part of the ground to be used by the
Leeds supporters. This posed very considerable problems for thft Police.
It is impossible to achieve segregation for a normal match which is not
♦all ticket*. It might be thought possible to deal with the segregation
aspect by identifying supporters by the colour of the favours they wear.
Experience shows, however, that those *fans* bent on trouble wear the
opposing team’s favours, or none at all, in order that they may be
amongst supporters of the other Club.

                                                          Continued .....
    2
    Chief Executive
    29 June 1977


    So far as dispersal is concerned after the game, it is always the aim
    of the Police to keep opposing fans apart so far as is possible, but
    this is not always easily achieved, Bxperience shows that to attempt
    to stagger the dispersal can cause as many problems as it solves.
    Usually on the final whistle spectators turn to the exits to leave as
    quickly as they can. If these exits were not open, then bunching would
    occur with people at the back of the crowd pressing forward unaware that
    the exits are not available to them. It might be thought posiible to
    make announcements over the tannoy systems operating at grounds, that
    certain parts of the crowd will be held back. This has only a limited
    success. Some people do not listen to the tannoy system, others cannot
    hear it, and some ignore it believing that they have the right to leave
    when they wish.

    I am sorry if this reply appears unhelpful and 1 am, of course, grateful
    to the City of Sheffield Metropolitan District for taking such a keen
    interest in this matter.

    Yours faithfully




    Chief

FA CUP SHMI-FIN/U. AT HILLSBOROUGH

Thank you for your letter of 27 May 1977 in connection with th« PA Cup
Semi-Final at Hillsborough on 23 April.

In ray report on the Semi-Final, I mentioned that I was disappointed
with the response from Mr, Croker to my letter which dealt with the
breakdown of the ticket allocation, resulting in theManchsster United
supporters being in that part of the ground reserved for supporters of
the opposing Club. Mr. Croker said that he would write to me again
and I was reserving judgement on what had happened until X received a
further communication from him. To date, Mr. Croker has not been in
touch with me again.

I am satisfied that the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club acted quite
properly in the allocation of tickets to the two Clubs involved but it
is abundantly clear that something went sadly wrong at the              :
It is not. good enough from my point of view to say'that supporters of
Manchester United had travelled widely     obtain tickets from whatever
source they could. These tickets ware to have been sold at Leeds on a
voucher system and quite clearly that was not (tons. As you know from
ray report, the presence of the Manchester United fans at the wrong end
of the ground caused very considerable problems for the Police and it
is really not good enough forMr. Croker to say that enquiries had
failed to disclose any improper behaviour by the Clubs.

As to the points made in ay second recommendation, X fully appreciate,
so far as scheduled services are concerned, British Rail cannot refuse
to carry passengers who have paid their fare and have a valid ticket.
There is, however, in my opinion no reason at all why, so far as special
football trains are concerned, the two points of my reccHanaendation could
not be implemented, it should not be too difficult to exclude intoxica­
ting liquor from the service which is provided by buffet cars. Neither
should it be difficult to make a condition of travel on those trains
the fact that the person purchasing a railway ticket had an entrance
ticket to the ground. (Provided, of course, that the match was *all
ticket', or as has recently been decreed in the case of troublesome
supporters, that they must have ground entrance tickets).
                                                            Continued

Mr J F Halliday
29 Jtrne 1977


I mentioned in my report that the Manchester United Football
Supporters* Club has a licence in respect of coaches which are run
under their auspices to away games. A condition of that licence is
that persons without tickets for the game are not carried, and neither
are intoxicants. Once again, it would surely not be too difficult for
the Football Association to deal with this matter of transport as far
as other Clubs are concerned.

It is quite clear to me that if the recommendations Iraade were
implemented, the problems for the Police and the p u b H e would be
considerably lessened and I firmly believe that the Clubs and the
Football Association have to take the Initiative in making sure that
travelling supporters do not cause problems when they arrive at the
town in which the match is to be played. I note that Mr. Croker was
recently quoted as saying that Clubs have a responsibility for segrega­
tion arrangements. I hope that his words will be followed by action
before we all have to start worrying about football hooliganism next
season.

       FA CUP SEMI-FINAL AT HILLSBOROUGH

       I have read with interest your reports of the match at Hillsborough on 23 April,
       and thought you would like to know of some of the points which were made at the
       meeting chaired by the Home Secretary on 13 May with the police, the football
       organisations and transport operators. I have in mind particularly the two
       recommendations on page 12 of your report of 12 May.

       The Home Secretary asked Sir Harold Thompson and Mr Croker of the Football
       Association whether they had discovered how the 2,000 Manchester United supporters
       had obtained tickets for the part of the ground reserved for supporters of Leeds
       United. They replied that their enquiries had failed to disclose any improper
       behaviour by the clubs. They thought it likely that supporters of Manchester
       United had travelled widely to obtain the tickets from whatever sources they
       could. The general control over the sale and distribution of tickets is
       likely to be discussed further at the next meeting of the Working Party on Crowd
       Behaviour (which is chaired by the Minister for Sport, and whose meetings we
       attend) and I think that the ACPO representatives intend to keep in touch with
       developments.

       As to drinking on trains and coaches, I think all are agreed that it should be
       controlled as far as possible, but there would be real difficulties in attempting
       to design and enforce a blanket prohibition. British Rail said at the meeting
       that they did co-operate in controlling the sale of drink on trains, and - when
       necessary - at station bars. They could/nRowever, prevent passengers from carrying
       drink. The Secretary of State for Transport said he had considered the possibility
       of seeking to create powers to control the carriage of drink on coaches but had ,
       concluded that it could not be done effectively. Individual coach operators may,
       of course, make their own requirements in relation to particular hirings. As to
       supporters travelling without a ticket for the match, British Rail said they could
       not refuse to carry passengers who had paid their fare and had a valid ticket.

       These problems, too, are likely to be discussed further at the next meeting of
       the Working Party on Crowd Behaviour. Because of ACPO's general interest I am
       sending a copy of this letter to Peter Matthews.

    Dear Sir,

    F. A. Cup Semi Finals - Hillsborough, Sheffield
    Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975

    I am aware that the above mentioned matter has been brought to your
    attention by Councillor Thwaites, and that he has forwarded to you and
    other interested parties, a copy of a Resolution passed at a Meeting of
    Householders resident in the immediate area of the Sheffield Wednesay
    Football Club, Hillsborough.

    I have now written back to Councillor Thwaites pointing out that I dc not
    feel there is any easy solution to this problem and indicating to him that
    I would take up with you the question of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
^   1975.

    I am aware that such Act is concerned primarily with safety within a Sports
    Ground, and, moreover, that the Sports Ground with which we are now concerned
    was not designated in the Safety of Sports Ground (Designation) Order 1976
    and, accordingly, is not at present subject to the provisions of the Act.
    Notwithstanding that this is the situation I thought it would be useful if
    I were to write to you in connection with this matter as your Authority
    will ultimately be responsible for enforcing the Act should the Sports
    Ground in question be subsequently designated and in this connection,
    I would be obliged if you would inform me whether you have received any
    indication as to whether the ground is likely to be so designated in the
    near future.   On ths question of the Ac^ as indicated, whilst I appreciate
    it is directed primarily at safety within the Spores Ground I feel that
    even within its existing framework it might be possible by taking steps
    such as penning within the Stadium, restricting the numbers admitted,
    and complete segregation of rival factions to avoid certain of the present
    difficulties, particularly if it were possible for different sections of
    the Sports Ground to be released at different intervals with the Police
    ensuring that each group was well dispersed before the rest were released.-




                                                                                                                  Cont./,.,
                          For telephone enquiries on this matter please ring   . . .7 .3 4 .0 6 1    (STDCods 0742)
                                                                                  Mr. Webster
                                                    Telex 54243 (Administration & Legal)
                                 - 2 -

Clearly, whilst such proposals are not a complete answer they may go a
portion of the way towards eradicating certain of the present problems
and I look forward to receiving your views upon such proposals on the
■basis, that the Sports Ground in question will ultimately be designated*
and it will ultimately be your responsibility to issue the safety
certificate.


As you are aware Section 2 of the Act provides for a safety certificate
to specify certain items and I feel that it is under these provisions
that my suggestions could be implemented, but as indicated I would
welcome any comments and views you may have upon this aspect of the matter
and any further suggestions you may have at all that say alleviate some
of the difficulties that have arisen.   I appreciate that it may well
be at this stage a matter of some conjecture as to whether the Sports
Ground will ultimately be designated, but I feel that it is likely
that it will be, and in the fairly near future,and that it will be
useful for discussions of this type to be carried out at this stage
rather than wait till such later date.   Indeed, if you agree with
me that the Act could be used as indicated then it may well be useful
for our Authorities to bring pressure to bear to get the Ground
designated without further delay.

  ars faithfully,




Head of Department.

                 Penning of Spectators

                 This feature would no doubt prevent the surging movement which
                 occurrs particularly on the Spion Kop at the Hillsborough Ground,
                 but it is not possible to achieve without major reconstruction work
                 as access points would have to be created in respect of each pen
                 underneath the Spion Kop.

                 Crowd Capacity

                 The present capacity for the ground is not excessive and even on
                 occasions of maximum attendances ample room is available for
                 spectators provided that the crowd is properly directed by sufficient
                 ©umbers of competent Stewards.

                 Provision of an additional exit point from Spion Kop directly on to
                 the South Stand Car Park could assist in eliminating any congestion which
                 has occurred on infrequent occasions.

                 Segregation of Spectators

                 Complete segregation is difficult to achieve particularly when the
                 two teams concerned have identical colour favours.

                 A large degree of segregation is possible when admission is by
                 ticket only, but it has been found in practice that even in these cases
            I    it is difficult to ensure that all tickets are sold as allocated to the
                 respective Clubs.

                 In order to achieve maximum segregation the co-operation of the
                 participating clubs is necessary and in the past this has on occasions
                 been found to be less than expected so far as implementing the Police
                 recommendation is concerned regarding allocation of tickets.

                 Dispersing of Supporters

                 It is not practicable to retain supporters within the ground once
                 the game has been completed.   Any attempt to do so would cause considerable
                 danger due to the congestion which would undoubtedly occur at those
                 points where exits were temporarily closed.

0ear Sir,

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT, 1975
HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM

Thank you for your memorandum of 3rd May, 1977.

In my letter to the Home Office, to which you refer, I took
particular care to mention only that part of Section 1 of the
Act which relates to the powers of the Secretary of State. The
powers of the Cotinty Council were not touched upon. A point
of principle is involved which goes beyond the boundaries 6 f
South Yorkshire, a situation recognised by Hone Office in their
reply to me. Chief Officers of Police, individually and
collectively, raise issues direct with Home Office and I saw no
reason, as I was not touching upon any local powers, to pursue
the issue via the County Council. My letter clearly sets out
a personal view point and is not binding in any way on anyone
else.

I shall, of course, always refer matters concerning the County
Council's powers under the Act to the appropriate committee
unless there are issues in Whibh the Chief Constable has a
personal standing in accordance with the Act'd provisions, e.g.
Sections 5<3) and 10(4).

The attitude of the Working Party to the Section 10 procedure
is one I wholeheartedly endorse. To attempt to use the procedure
for Hillsborough would, I suspect, expose us to some ridicule
having regard to the many capacity crowds which have attended
theta over the years without great risk to spectators.

Yours faithfully,

          Thank you for ending m e a copy of your tetter to the H o m e Office onthis
          subject, the contents of which are in accord with m y own view#.

          I wonder, however, whether it might nothave been poJit#f®,stER3® theFire

          us to have put the Matter to them with a view to obtaining their support for the
          approach to the H o m e Office.

          I was also a      surprised % the totter, since if w e #i» ©oncemed aboBtf^sflMbe
          dangers at the ground, albeit only on special occasions, w e could have taken action
          under Section 10 of the Act, but such a course has been consistently closed in the
          past at Working Party meetings bothby yourrepresentative® and byrepresefttatives
          of the Fir® Service and Sheffield City Council.

          H yew feel it desirable that further consideration should now be givento the (gm sttm
          of Action 10 action, pending designation at the stadium underSeotiafi 3bef i$ti»Act,
          perhaps you would let m e know.

          From:         Assistant Chief Constable (Operations)                             6.5.77

          The rather belated observations of Mr Harris to your letter of
          30 March 1977 demonstrate^ that he has missed the point of that
          letter entirely.

          I am not surprised that our representatives, at Working Party
          meetings have consistently opposed the use of Section 10 in
          respect of the Hillsborough ground. That Section sets out an
          emergency procedure and Sub-Section 1 reads as follows
                 "If the court is satisfied, on the application of the
                  local authority, that the risk to spectators at a sports
                  ground is so great that, until steps have been taken to
                  reduce it to a reasonable level,'their admission ought to
                  be prohibited or restricted, the court may by order prohibit
                  or restrict, to the extent that the court considers
                  appropriate in the circumstances of the case, the admission
      of spectators to the whole or any part of the ground, ,
      until such steps have been taken as, in the opinion
      of the court, are necessary to reduce the risk to a
      reasonable level.”
                         r£ - t   ■t'l'**-   y\Ji
Such a Section in^ijiy'view could never be applicable to a ground
like Hillsborough*which was used as a World Cup ground the last
t^me that tournament was played in England.

   Dear Mr Barratt,

   SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

         Thank you for your letter of 30 March about Hillsborough Stadium,
   the ground of Sheffield Wednesday F C .

         We are looking into your suggestion that Hillsborough should be
   designated under the 1975 Act as requiring a safety certificate and
   will write to you as soon as a decision on this matter is reached. At
   this stage I would wish only to make the point that in so far as
   Hillsborough Stadium is not alone in being a ground that is occasionally
   used for important games, although the clubs is not itself in the
   First Division, we shall have to look rather carefully at any case for
   exceptional treatment.

                                          Yours sincerely,




                                                 (MISS) G M B OWEN

R. T. Armstrong, Esq., C.B., C.V.Q.,
Deputy Under Secretary of State,
Home Office,
Whitehall,
LONDON. SV/1A 2AP




Thank you for your letter of 31st March, 1977.           As you
say, we already, have our p l a n n i n g .for the F.A. Cup Semi-
Final well iii hand but I will gladly uake the contacts
you suggest. I will also keep John Halliday informed of
developments and send a full report for the 'Home S e c r e t a r y ’s
information .after the match.

The Home -Office ’nay rest assured that the South Yorkshire
Police will endeavour to ensure- that things j»o off smoothly,
although you will appreciate that.we shall have our hands
full on the day.

May I make one short comment on Mr. Crol.er's letter. So
far as 1 am concerned every r-iajor football natch at
Hillsborough is a special exer,cise and we shall plan
accordingly.  Our inter.tior. is to play it calmly and coolly
in the best tradition of the Service, hut we shall be ready
to prevent and where necessary respond to deal with any
undesirable conduct.

I shall, of course, be delighted to meet the Home Secretary
on the morning of the .Hillsborough same to explain (and
demonstrate on the ground if he wishes) our policing
arrangements.      No doubt his P.A. will he in touch with ;ae
nearer the day so that we can make suitable arrangenents to
receive M r . R e e s .

Just as a matter of interest, although this does not affect
the operational side of things, I have already written to
the Howe Office on the implementation of the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act, 197 5,  Because Sheffield Wednesday



                                                                 cont *<3
happen to play in the Third Division they will not, at
ieaSn * some tine, be required to obtain a certificate
tor Hillsborough.        Already this season we have staged the
replay of the League Cup Final and not; we have the^Seni-
Final, both with maximum gates and attendant crowd and
safety p r o b l e m s . It is hardly logical that Clubs like
utOKe City, who rarely attract sizeable crowds or
important matches, are soon to be subject to the Act,
whereas Sheffield Wednesday are not.

The position here can be compared with the International
Rugby Grounds who will require certificates despite the
fact tliat they generally only have two capacity crowds in
the season.   fnis is not an uncommon occurrence at
Hillsborough because of the propensity of the Football
Association and football League to stage major games there
due to the financial rewards.    The principle which the
Home Office have adopted to determine the Association
Football Clubs required to have certificates in my view
needs to be reviewed to cater for special cases like
Hillsborough,

With all good wishes, on your new appointment which has
brought immense pleasure to vour many supporters in the
Police Service.                           *

For the attention of

Dear Sir

HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO.130/76

I refer to the above Circular which was issued on 26 August 1976 ii\
connection with the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975, and also to
SI 1976 No.1264 which designated under the Act, with effect from
1 January 1977, the International Association of Rugby Union Football
Grounds and those of the Clubs in the First Division of the Football
League.

As you will be aware, the replay of the final of the Football League
Cup was staged at Hillsborough Stadium, the home of Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club currently playing in the Third Division. As
you will also know, the FA Cup semi-final between Manchester United
and Leeds United is to be staged at the same venue on the afternoon
of 23 April 1977. Indeed, for many ye airs it has been customary to
stage important games of this nature at the Hillsborough Stadium.
For the League Cup Final there was a crowd of 55,000 and it is
expected that the same number of persons will attend the match on
23 April.

Whilst I understand the reasons at this stage for only designating
grounds in the First Division of the Football League, it does seem to
me that consideration ought to be given to designating other grounds
haying regard to the nature of the matches which are likely to be
played there rather than the Division of the Football League in which
a Club currently plays.

perhaps you will be kind enough to take into account my observations
when the extension of the general safety certificate requirements are
being considered.

I am sending a copy of this letter to the Chief Executive of the South
Yorkshire County Council.

Yours faithfully

Bear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

Further to m y letter of the 28th October, our Working Party has now met, and
considered the revised draft Certificate enclosed with your letter of the
25th October* Their comments are as follow

(a) Part 1

       (i)    ft was considered that the Interpretations should also include
              "The Authority” and ’'Chief Fire Officer".

       (Li)   The last word "Authority" should be deleted from the definition of
              "The Chief Constable".

       flii) la the definition of "Specified Activity", the times before a match
             should be extended from two hours to three hours, as gates are
             sometimes opened that period of time before the start of the game.

    Past 2
       Para. 2

              ft was considered that this was unduly restrictive, as on a literal
              interpretation it would preclude the Chairman or Managetrof a Club
              from inviting visitors to witness a training session etc. Possibly
              it could be relaxed by putting a limited ceiling on such spectators -
              say 50/100?

       Para. 3(a)

              ft was felt that "a Local Authority" should be "the Local Authority".

       Para. 4

       I     ft was felt impracticable to require applicants to obtain written.
            approval at least fourteen days before the occurrence, as they have
             no control over the time taken by the Local Authority to consider an
             application. As an alternative, it is suggested that applicants

                     should be required to submit their application at least 21 days before
                     the occurrence.

                  Para. 5

                     It was considered that the words " and specifications attached” should
                     be inserted after the word "Plans" in the third line, and the remainder
                     of the paragraph deleted.

                  Para. 7

                     It -was considered that the requirements of this paragraph should be
                     marie subject to the satisfaction of the Local Authority.

                  Para, lid)

                      B was considered that hose reels and fire extinguishers should be
                      included in the equipment specified, and that there should be a requirement
                      to supply periodic certificates to the local Authority that the items
                      mentioned are in satisfactory order.

                  Para. 12

                      This also should contain a requirement for the supply of periodic
                      certificates that the items mentioned are in satisfactory order.

                   Para. 13

                      The word "cable" in line 2 should of course read "capable".

                   Pars. 140.)

                      The words "to be" should be inserted after the word "action" in the
                      second line.

                   Para. 15fei)

                       tt was considered that the words "stairs and steps comprising part of
                       a" should be deleted from the first line. The existing wording would
                       exclude from the requirement even a steeply sloping passageway.

                    Para. 18

                       Line 1 should be amended to read "No flammable gases, liquids or
                       explosives shall be......... .      and the words " for the time being
                       of the Local Authority" can be deleted     "Chief Fire Officer Is
                       defined in the interpretations in Part 1 as suggested.

                    Para. 19 111)

                        Suggest deletion of words " for the time being of the local Authority"
                          ’’Chief Fire Officer" is defined in Part 1.
G. M. T idesw ell E sq , „                 -3 -


                P ara 19 (ill)

                   Suggest sew sub. paragraph, requiring ground to be cleared of
                   rubbish and any articles which could be used as missiles, prior to
                   any Specified Activity taking place.

                P a ra . 20

                   Spelling error in second line - only on® "t" in *'allotted".

                Para. 21

                   It was Hit unnecessary to restrict numbers of vehicles provided
                   parking areas are defined. Suggest, therefore, deletion of "those
                   numbers and in" in second line, and amendment of "spaces" in third
                   line to read "areas".

                Para. 26

                   Suggest deletion of words " or the Building Authority". It was
                   considered that any communication with the holder of a certificate
                   should be by "the Local Authority" as the issuer erf that certificate.

                Notes for Guidance of Holders of Safety Certificates

                It was considered that the words "officer" and "officers" in paragraphs
                2(d) and 4 respectively should be amended to read "person" and "persons",
                since Election 11 of the Act refers to "A person authorised by-"

With regard to the question of insurance cover in respect of any claim arising from a person
injured at a certified stadium, and in respect of no or inadequate action under Sectioning,
the County Treasurer has discussed this with the County Council's insurers, and has been
assured that we are covered by our existing policies, and that no &Ktira premium would
be payable.

Cta the question of fees, our Working Party have had two long discussions on this, and
decided, almost unanimously, that they would favour a standard fee of about £700, based
on the salary of a P.0.1(c) officer for 17 man/$ays. In recommending this, they were
fully cognisant of the likelihood that it would take considerably more time than this. The
County Treasurer, however, somewhat predictably, takes the view that we should charge
In full for actual work done. However, as we have no grounds in South Yorkshire which
are within the first Designation Order, the Treasurer seems inclined to keep his options
open by deferring a report to the appropriate Committee until some firm decisions have
been made by Local Authorities who have First Division grounds in their areas.

Are you anyihearer a Committee decision on this ?

       s t a g s of an application f o r a s p e c i a l s a f e t y certificate* - ' I t i s appreciated that
this may well give rise to difficulties.

6. In the light of the foregoing considerations, clubs, stadium authorities and
local authorities will no doubt consider that the need for special safety
certificates should as far as possible be reduced by widening the scope of the
general safety certificate on the basis suggested in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the
annex to the Home Office letter of 26 August, but that, where they continue to be
required, applications should normally be made by the holder of the general
safety certificate (rather than the independent promoter of the special event),
giving as much notice as possible.

7. Once a general safety certificate is in being, all the requirements relating
to- special safety certificates including the requirement of at least 3 months'
notice automatically have effect*    Clubs and stadium authorities will wish to
bear in mind the possible difficulties that could arise if a special event were
scheduled to be held at the ground within 3 months of the. grant of the general
certificate.    Local authorities should therefore be made aware of any such event
which has already been arranged or which is arranged within the next 6 months or
so, so that they may, as far as possible, provide for the requirements for that
event to be covered in the general safety certificate.    Otherwise there could be
insufficient time remaining for a special certificate to be considered.

8. A copy of the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football) will be forwarded
as goon as it becomes available*

9* A copy of this letter has been sent to the Chief Executive of the County
Council for your area.

                                               Yours faithfully

 SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

 PROCEDURE REGARDING APPLICATIONS FOR SPECIAL SAFETY CERTIFICATES


 1.  The regulations provide that any application for a safety certificate shall
                      COf l t nai i n the Schedule to the Regulations or a form to the
luce ©iiect. Copies of the fora were enclosed with the Home Office letter of
          1976 to         and stadium authorities. Part II of the form and its
frontispiece should be completed in tha case of applications for special safety
certificates. In any case where an application for a special safety certificate
is not made by the holder of the general safety certificate, it should be
accompanied by evidence of the applicant*s status. Details of any planned changes
to the normal standing and seating arrangements for spectators should be provided,
together with such further information in support of the application as is
          TrneCeSSa2T t? enable tho loeal authority to discharge its functions under
the Act. However, it is open to a local authority, under section 3(4) of the Act
   squire, by notice in writing, any further information of this kind which they*
may think it necessary to have to enable them to determine the terms and conditions
to be included m the special safety certificate.

2.   A major difference in the grant of general and special safety certificates is
that, once the local authority has determined that an applicant is a qualified
person, the issue of a general safety certificate becomes mandatory, whereas the
issue or a special safety certificate remains at its discretion. But an applicant
has a right of appeal to the Secretary of State against a refusal (see following
paragraphs for details).                                                       s

3.   An application for a special safety certificate should normally be made at
least 3 months before the date of the proposed event, but a local authority has
discretion to permit an application within a lesser period if it is satisfied that
the procedures (including appeals procedures) required under the Act and
Regulations can, in the particular case, be carried out within that lesser period
eg when the applicant is known to be a qualified person. On receipt of an
application for a special safety certificate, the local authority must first
determine whether the applicant is a qualified person, ie a person likely to be in
a position^to prevent contravention of the terms and conditions to be imposed in
the certificate. The local authority is required by regulation 5 to make this
determination within 14 days of receiving the application. There is a right of
appeal against a determination by a local authority that an applicant is not a
qualified person (see paragraph 9), and, under regulation 5, the applicant must be
lurmahea with the reasons for such a determination.

4.   It nest requires to be considered whether the application should be refused
on grounds other than that the applicant is not a qualified person. This decision
must, m accordance with regulation 6, be made within 28 days of the receipt of the
application, not only in cases where the local authority has determined that the
applicant is a qualified person but also in those where it has determined that he
           311 aPPeal has been lodged and remains to be considered. There is also a
right of appeal against a refusal on grounds other than a determination that the
applicant is not a qualified person (see paragraph 9). In the event of such a
retusal, therefore, the local authority is again required, voider regulation 6, to
give the applicant the reasons for its decision.
5.   When the f i r s t two sta g es have been completed, should i t have been decided
that a s p e c ia l s a f e t y c e r t i f i c a t e should be issued, the lo c a l authority is
required, by section 3(3) of the Act, to send a copy of the application to the
chief officer of police and to the building authority and to consult them about
the terms ana con d ition s to be included in the-certificate. The special safety
certificate must, in accordance with regulation 6(2), then be issued not less
than 28 days befoi*e the proposed event is dwe to take place.

6*   The form and content of a special safety certificate is likely to vary
according to the circumstances of each individual case and a standard form of
certificate would not be appropriate, ( in su ita b le c a s e s, however, regard may
be had to the guide lir .e s s e t out in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
(Football) on the b a sis in d icated in paragraph 3 of the paper relating to the
'"Procedure Regard!rig. A p p lication s fo r General S afety Certificates”.) Any special
safety certificate must, however, contain full details o f the terms and conditions
imposed, including in p a rticu la r the m atters referred to in section 2(2) of the
Act, and as required by se c tio n 2(4) should be framed where appropriate by
reference to the plan attached to the general safety certificate.

7*   Once a special safety certificate has been issued, subject to the determina­
tion of any appeal, the terms and conditions can be varied only by formal amend­
ment of the certificate® This may be on the application of the holder of the
certificate or at the discretion o f the local authority (see section 4(2) of the
Act). This seems an unlikely eventuality in the case of a special safety
certificates otherwise than in the exceptional case where the'certificate -has been
issued well in advance of the event to which it relates. Any such amendment must,
however, be publicised as in paragraph 10 below,

8,   Considerations'©f time render the transfer of a special safety certificate
to another person an eq u a lly u n lik e ly contingency. Any possible difficulties in
this connection are likely to be obviated, however, if the holder of the general
safety certificate applies for the special certificate. Nevertheless, should an
application fo r transfer be made, the local authority must decide within 14 days
if the proposed transferee is a q u a lifie d person and, if it decides to the
contrary, the procedure la id down in the regulations relating to giving notice of,
and the reasons for, the determination will apply, as w i l l the appropriate appeals
procedure, should the need arise. In the case of an application for transfer
before a special safety certificate has actually been issued, there is no reason
why the local authority should not treat the application in all respects as a new
application in the terss of the original and process it from the point already
reached.

9.      Reference has already been made to the rights of appeal against a determina­
tion that the applicant is not a q u a lifie d person (paragraph 3) and against the
r e fu sa l of an a p p lica tio n on other grounds (paragraph 4 ) . In addition the Act
provides (in section 5(3)) a right of appeal to any "interested party* against the
in c lu s io n of anything in or the omission of anything from a safety certificate or

10* As in the case of a general safety certificate, regulation 7 requires a
local authority, on issuing or amending a safety certificate or refusing so to amend
it, to give notice to certain specified "interested parties” and also to
advertise its action in the press. A similar obligation falls on an appellant
(under regulation 8(7)) to advertise his intention to appeal, and a person wishing
to appear before a person appointed by the Secretary of State under section 5(4)
of the Act is required to give notice within 7 days of such advertisement. (The
reasons underlying these requirements are set out in paragraph 11 of the paper
relating to the ‘Procedure Regarding Applications for General Safety
Certificates'.)

11. Any appellant is required (by regulation 8(5)) to give the local authority
notice of appeal, accompanied by the relevant documents appertaining to the appeal.
It will then be for the local authority, in accordance with regulation 8(9), to
inform the Secretary of State in writing within 7 days whether it wishes to
oppose the appeal. With any such notice, the local authority is required to*
submit its reasons and any relevant supporting documents and to state whether it
wishes a hearing under section 5(4) of the Act. (The procedure governing the
conduct of all such hearings is set out in regulation 10).

12. It is also open to the Secretary of State, if he considers it necessary, to
order a public inquiry under section 5(6) of the Act in relation to any appeal.
In such a case, the procedure to be followed is laid down in regulation 12.

SAFETY OF SPOSTS GfiOOKDS ACT 1975:
SPECIAL       SAFETY C E R T IF IC A T E S

1.. Home O ffice Circular No. 130/76 of 26 August 1976 advised l o c a l a u th o r itie s of
the procedure to ba follow ed in d ealin g with a p p lica tio n s fo r the general sa fe ty
c e r t i f i c a t e s which, are required when a ground i s designated under the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act 1975. Paragraph k o f that cir cu la r in d icated that guidance on the
procedures regarding s p e c ia l s a fe ty c e r t i f i c a t e s would ba deferred until nearer the
time when the need for such c e r t i f i c a t e s sig h t arise* i© when general s a fe ty c e r t i f i c a t e s
were in operation.
2.     The designation order becomes e f f e c t iv e os 1 January 1977. By that tioe all the
clubs and stadium a u th o r itie s concerned should have applied for general sa fe ty
certificates in resp ect* of th e ir grounds. Where a lo c a l authority d ecid es, in
accordance with paragraph 5 of Hoae O ffice Circular No. 1JO/76, that the maximum
advantage.is t o be gained by d eferrin g tha iss u e of a general sa fe ty c e r t i f i c a t e u n t il
the beginning o f the 1977/78 f o o tb a ll season, the need for a-special c e r t i f i c a t e cannot
a r ise-b efo r e that' time. In other c a se s, however* it cay be decided that a general
sa fe ty certificate can u se fu lly be issu ed at an earlier stage, as can be done at any
time a fte r an a p p lica tio n has been received and the terms and conditions have been
determined*' and th e rea fte r a s p e c ia l sa fe ty c e r t i f i c a t e w i l l be required for any event
which i s not covered by the general c e r t i f i c a t e . I t ha® accordingly been thought
d esirable to issu e guidance now on the procedure to be followed in such c a s e s. Such
guidance i s contained in the annex to t h is c ir c u la r .
 3*      It should bs borne in mind that * except with the permission of the local authority,
 an a p p lica tio n for a special s a f e t y c e r t i f i c a t e mast* in accordance with regu lation 5
 o f the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976, be Bade at least 3 months before the
 event.' S his period i s necessary to ensure that no person will be deprived of his
 r ig h ts o f appeal under the Act, in cases where the full procedure fox* which the Act and
 Regulations provide requires to bs accommodated. The period can theretore be relaxed
 only in ca ses where i t i s apparent that in d ividu al stages of the procedure will not be
 required, eg where the applicant has already been accepted as a.qualified person.
 4.   It has a lso been necessary, in order to keep the length of the required n o tice do*m
 to an acceptable l e v e l , t o apply a s t r i c t lim it to tha time a v a ila b le for each stage of

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

PROCEDURE REGARDING APPLICATIONS FOR SPECIAL SAFETY CERTIFICATES


t.   The regulations provide that any application for a safety certificate shall
be made in the fora contained in the Schedule to the Regulations or a form to the
like effect. Copies of the form were enclosed with the Home Office letter of
26 August 1976 to clubs and stadium authorities. Part II of the form and its
frontispiece should be completed in tha case of applications for special safety
certificates. In any case where an application for a special safety certificate
is not made by the holder of the general safety certificate, it should be
accompanied by evidence of the applicant's status. Details of any planned changes
to the normal s ta n d in g and seating arrangements for spectators should be provided,
together with such further information in support of the application as is
considered necessary to enable the local authority to discharge its functions tinder
the Act. However, it is open to a local authority, under section 3(4) of the Act,
to require, by notice in writing, any further information of this kind which they
may think it necessary to have to enable them to determine the terms and conditions
to be included in the special safety certificate.

2.   A major difference in the grant of general and special safety certificates is
that, once the local authority has determined that an applicant is a qualified
person, the issue of a general safety certificate becomes mandatory, whereas the
issue of a special safety certificate remains at its discretion. But an applicant
has a right of appeal to the Secretary of State against a refusal (see following
paragraphs for details).

3.   An application.for a special safety certificate should normally be made at
least 3 months before the date of the proposed event, but a local authority has
discretion to permit an application within a lesser period if it is satisfied that
the procedures (including appeals procedures) required under the Act and
Regulations can, in the particular case? be carried out within that lesser period
eg when the applicant is known to be a qualified person. On receipt of an
application for a special safety certificate, the local authority must first
determine whether the applicant is a qualified person, ie a person likely to be in
a position to prevent contravention of the terms and conditions to be imposed in
the certificate. The local authority is required by regulation 5 to make this
determination within 14 days of receiving the application. There is a right of
appeal against a determination by a local authority that an applicant is not a
qualified person (see paragraph 9)» and, under regulation 5, the applicant must be
furnished with the reasons for such a determination.

4.   It next requires to be considered whether the application should be refused
on grounds other than that the applicant is not a qualified person. This decision
must, in accordance with regulation 6, be made within 28 days of the receipt of the
application, not only in cases where the local authority has determined that the
applicant is a qualified person but also in those where it has determined that he
is not and an appeal has been lodged and remains to be considered. There is also a
right of appeal against a refusal on grounds other than a determination that the
applicant is not a qualified person (see paragraph 9). In the event of such a
refusal, therefore, the local authority is again required, under regulation 6, to
give the applicant the reasons for its decision.
5*       When the f i r s t two- stages have been, completed; should i t have been decided
th a t a s p e c ia l s a f e t y c e r t i f i c a t e should be issu e d , the lo c a l a u th ority is
required, by section 3(3) o f the Act* to send a copy of the a p p lic a tio n to the
chief o f f i c e r of police and to the building 'authority arid to consult them about
the terms and conditions to bo included in the c e r t i f i c a t e . The s p e c ia l sa fe ty .
c e r t i f i c a t e must, in accordance vith regulation 6 ( 2 ), then be issued not less
than 28 days before the proposed event i s &va to take place.

6#       The fora and content o f a s p e c ia l s a fe ty c e r t i f i c a t e i s l i k e l y to vary
according to the circumstances of each individual case and a standard form of
c e r t i f i c a t e would not be appropriate, ( i n su ita b le c a se s, however, regard may
be had to the guide l i n e s set out in the Guido to S a fety at Sports Grounds
(F o o tb a ll) on the b a sis in d icated i n paragraph 3 o f the paper relating to the
“Procedure Regarding Applications for General S afety C ertificates" -,) Any sp e c ia l
s a fe ty c e r t i f i c a t e must, however, contain f u l l d e t a ils of the terms and conditions
imposed, including in p a rticu la r the m atters referred to in section 2(2) of the
Act, and as required by section 2(4) should be framed where appropriate by
referen ce to the plan attached'               the general s a fe ty c e r t i f i c a t e .

7*     Once a          s p e c ia l s a fe ty c e r t i f i c a t e has been issued, subject to the determina­
tion of any            appeal, the terms end con d ition s can be varied on ly by formal amend­
ment of the            c e r t i f i c a t e . This may be on the application of the holder of the
certificate            cr a t the d is c r e tio n o f the l o c a l authority (see section 4(2) of the
A c t). -'This         seems an unlikely ev e n tu a lity in the case o f a special safety
c e r t i f i c a t e , otherwise than in the excep tion al case where the c e r t i f i c a t e has been
issued x*ell in advance of the event to which it relates. Any such amendment must,
however, be p u b licised as in paragraph 10 below.

8.       Consideration# o f time render the tr a n sfer of a special s a f e t y certificate
to another person an eq u ally u n lik e ly contingency. Any possible d i f f i c u l t i e s in
t h i s connection are l i k e l y to be ' obviated, however, if the holder o f the general
sa f e t y c e r t i f i c a t e a p p lies fo r the s p e c ia l c e r t i f i c a t e . Nevertheless, should an
application fo r tr a n sfer be made, the lo c a l au th ority must decide within 14 days
i f the proposed tra n sferee i s a qualified'person' and,' if it decides to the
contrary, the procedure la i d down in the reg u la tio n s r e la tin g to giv in g n o tic e of,
and the reasons f o r , the determination will apply, as w i l l the appropriate appeals
procedure, should the need a r i s e . In the case o f an application fo r transfer
before a sp e c ia l s a f e t y c e r t i f i c a t e has actually been issu ed , there is no reason
why the l o c a l au th ority should not treat the application in all r e sp e cts as a new
a p p lic a tio n i n th© terms o f the o r ig in a l and process i t from the point already
reached.

9,      Reference has already been ma.de to the rights of appeal against a determina­
tion that th e applicant i s not a q u a lifie d person (paragraph 3) and against the
r e fu sa l o f an a p p lica tio n on other grounds ( paragraph 4 ) . In addition the Act
provides (in se c tio n 5 (3 )) a r ig h t o f appeal to any "interested party” against the
inclusion o f anything i n or the em ission o f anything from a safety certificate or
again st a refusal to amend or rep lace a s a fe ty c e r t i f i c a t e . The reg u la tio n s
provide th a t, in the case o f a s p e c ia l s a fe ty c e r t i f i c a t e , n o tic e o f any such
appeal shall be given within ? days following receipt of a notice of the lo c a l
a u th o r ity 's decision, cr, i n the case of persons who are not n o t if ie d , the
publication by the lo c a l authority of the decision in a newspaper circulating in
the l o c a l i t y .                         •
10. As In tha case of a general safety certificate, regulation 7 requires a
local authority, on issuing or amending a safety certificate or refusing so to
it, to give notice to certain specified "interested parties41 and also to
advertise its action in the press. A similar obligation falls on an appellant
(under regulation 8(7)) to advertise his intention to appeal, and a person wishing
to appear before a person appointed by the Secretary of State under section 5(4)
o f the Act is required to give notice within 7 days of such advertisement. (.The
reasons underlying these requirements are set out in paragraph 11 of the paper
relating to the 'Procedure Regarding Applications for General Safety
Certificates'.)

11. Any appellant is required (by regulation 8(5)) to give the local authority
notice of appeal, accompanied by the relevant documents appertaining to the appeal.
It will then be for the local authority, in accordance with regulation 8(9), to
inform the Secretary of State in writing within 7 days whether it wishes to ^
oppose the appeal. With any such notice, the local authority is required to
submit its reasons and any relevantsupporting documents and to state whether it
wishes a hearing under section 5(4)   of the Act. (Theprocedure governing the
conduct of all such hearings is set out in regulation10).

12. It is also open to the Secretary of State, if he considers it necessary, to
order a public inquiry under section 5(6) of the Act in relation to any appeal.
In such a case, the procedure to be followed is laid down in regulation 12.

Subject       Safety in Sports Ground Regulations 1976                          Date      1 Nov 1976


             With regard to the recent discussions, between Messrs Fox and Monks, of
             your Department, and M r Kelly, of m y Department, in respect of the above,
             I set out below an estimated unit cost for services to be provided, and m y
             reservations, from a financial viewpoint, on the further action required before
             the regulations are enforced in this area.

             The charge for an A P T & C officer of your Department should be 8. 9p per
             hour per £100 salary. The built in overhead's element of this payment has
             been based on the 1976/77 Revenue Estimates for Department of Administration,
             and while the salary/overheads ratio remains constant then the above
             formula will automatically take account of each year's inflation. This figure
             should not be regarded as firm at this stage in the light of further aspects which
             need to be considered.                                                 ^
             An example of the charge to be made under this formula would be:-

             Grade POl (c) - say £6,369 per annum
             charge per hour     8.9p x 6,369 = £5.67
                                         100
             charge for 17 man/days work
             £5.67 x (37 x 17) =                  £713
                      5                                                           \   ,




             It should be noted that the basic 8. 9p does not include any element of
             clerical support or supervisory staff; therefore, time spent by these persons
             would need to be separately costed in addition to the main charge, if stadium
             authorities are to be charged on an economic basis.

             I feel, however, that, before any costs can be finalised, a policy decision
             should be taken by County Council as to whether it should be on an economic
             basis or that this function be treated as a "service" and an appropriate fixed
             charge decided. At this point, may I draw your attention to paragraph 14 of
             SI 1263, which states that the charge should not be in excess of the work
             actually done. Furthermore, as an example of past policy, the County Council
             makes an economic charge for Fire Brigade Special Services, other than those
             on humanitarian ground. In addition, in making a decision, the County Council
             should be aware of the district councils' requirements, from a financial
             viewpoint, as otherwise the County Council could possibly recoup from the
             stadium authorities less than that sum required by the district councils.

Dear Sir,

                        Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1973


You will recall at the last meeting of Metropolitan County
Secretaries held in Newcastle, I distributed copies of a
draft Certificate which had been prepared in m y Department.
I have now had further thoughts about the form of the^draft
and have amended it slightly.    A copy of the amended draft
is enclosed.    Do you have any observations about the new
form of -draft?

You will notice that one alteration removes the disclaimer and
the new certificate n o w certifies that the Stadium is reasonably
safe for spectators provided that the terms and conditions
imposed are complied with.    I am making sure that the G M C ’s
insurers either confirm that the existing policies cover the
GMC in respect of any claim arising from a person injured
at a certified stadium and at which stadium certain precautions
are found to be inadequate.    If any additional premium is
thought to be payable as a result of providing such insurance
cover, I feel that such annual premium in respect of each stadium
should be capitalised and added to the application fee.      Do
you have any observations about this point?

 I also feel that there should be insurance cover to meet claims
 by any persons injured in. sports grounds in circumstances
 where the Authority knew there was a risk of danger but took
«a* no action or inadequate action under Section 10 of the Act.

Do your Authority have any further views about fees? The current
view of Officers in the GMC is that each application will require
29 man-days to deal with.  Tyne & Wear are of the opinion that
each application will require 60 man-days.

Please let me know if you have any comments to make about the above
or any other matters concerning the enforcement of the Act.


                                               Yours faithfully,

  • •     -*-s important that' you should knov/ all the provisionsof
 the Safety of_Sports Grounds Act 1975. This Act does not
 specify v/nat is required at your Stadium..This information will
  , .„       '*'n booklet "Guide to Safety of Sports Grounds
 Act" (as amended) obtainavle from HMSO.' This'booklet is not
 a. legal document, but the type of Safety Certificate issued
 to you will be determined by the Local Authority with
 reference to it. Unless, therefore, your Stadium meets
 the requirements of the booklet for the number of spectators
 which you wish to admit, the Certificate will only permit a
 lesser number to be admitted.
 2.        The Act creates several offences:-

           (a)   contravening any term or condition of a
                 Safety Certificate;

           (b)   admitting spectators to a Stadium when a
                 Safety Certificate is not in force or has
      v.         not been applied for or in contravention of
                 a Court Order;           -

           (c)   failing to give notice of alterations or
                 extensions to a Stadium;

           (d)   obstructing an authorised officer.
     All offences carry a maximum penalty of £400 fine (on
summary conviction. The first two offences also carry penalties
ox either a fine or a maximum of two years imprisonment
on conviction by indictment.

3.   Note that, in addition to the requirements of the
Safety Certificate you are also required to comply with
general statutory provisions. For example, although the
Safety Certificate permits collections as an ancillary activity
to lootball matches, you may also need the consent of the
District Authority in accordance with regulations before
collections. You will also need Justices Licences for the
      -Ti?t0X^cating drinks» Planning consent and consent under
the Building Regulations.
       Changes of Conditions

     Authorised officers have power to inspect premises to which
The Act applies to see whether conditions therein have changed
xo yne extent that the safety measures for spectators are
diminished.             .

5*   Regardless of this, however, you must inform the Local
Authority in advance if you are proposing to make alterations or
extensions to the Stadium and any of its installations which
may aliect the safety of spectators and obtain all necessary
planning consents etc.

 SUBJECT:    SAFETY IN SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

I have to report that on 27 September 1976 I attended a meeting
in connection with the above matter called at the instruction of
Mr. Fox of the South Yorkshire County Counci}., regarding the
proposed charges to be made in connection with the issue of safety
certificates.

Mr. Fox stated that enquiries of Greater Manchester and Merseyside
councils showed that two different types of charges were intended
by those councils, viz:

1) Greater Manchester - a sliding scale of fee for various grounds,
depending on the Football League division of the club concerned:
First Division, £900 to £1100, Second Division, £700 to £900,
Third and Fourth Divisions, £500 to £700,

2)    Merseyside - one fee of £500,

The fees had been apparently calculated from the work undertaken
by the various departments involved in preparing safety certificates
as follows:

Fire service - 17 man/days.
District council - 10 man/days
Administration - 2 man/days
Police - 2 hours.

Following the discussion, the County Council representatives
present intimated that a recommendation would be made for a charge
in this area of 17 mari/days at POl rate for any certificate which
may be issued under the Act.

Mr. Fox stated that further discussion would be necessary with
the Treasurer and Committees of the involved bodies to determine
how the fee would be ultimately divided between County and District
Councils, although at the present time no football ground in the
South Yorkshire area comes within the scope of the Act, which only
applies to First Division soccer clubs.

1.   It is important that you should know all the provisions of
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.   This Act does not
specify what is required at your Stadium..This information will
be found in the booklet ’’Guide to Safety of Sports Grounds ^
Act" (as amended) obtainavle from HMSO.   This booklet is not
a legal document, but the type of Safety Certificate issued
to you will be determined by the Local Authority with
reference to it. -Unless, therefore, your Stadium meets
the requirements of the booklet for the number of spectators
which you wish to admit, the Certificate will only permit a
lesser number to be admitted. ,

2.    The Act creates several offences

      (a)   contravening any term or condition of a
            Safety Certificate;

      (b)   admitting spectators to a Stadium when a
            Safety Certificate is not in force or has
            not been applied for or in contravention of
            a Court Order;

      (c)   failing to give notice of alterations .or
            extensions to a Stadium;

      (d)   obstructing an authorised officer.

     All offences carry a maximum penalty of £400 fine (on
summary conviction. The first two offences also^carry penalties
of either a fine or a maximum of two years imprisonment
on conviction by indictment.         ,

3.   Note that, in addition to the requirements of 'the
Safety Certificate you are also required to comply with
general statutory provisions.  For example, although the
Safety Certificate permits collections as an ancillary activity
to football matches, you may also need the consent of the
District Authority in accordance with regulations before
collections.  You will also need Justices Licences for
sale of intoxicating drinks, planning consent and consent under
the Building Regulations.

 4.   Changes of Conditions

      Authorised officers have power to inspect premises to which
 the Act applies to see whether conditions therein have changed
 to the extent that the safety measures for spectators are
 diminished.

 5.   Regardless of this, hov/ever, you must inform the Local
 Authority in advance if you are proposing to make alterations or
 extensions to the Stadium and any of its installations which
 may affect the safety of spectators and obtain all necessary
 planning consents etc.
6.   The Act gives rights of appeal against decision,;3 of the
Local Authority or the inclusion of a n y o i tne ternis cr
conditions in the Certificate.  The perioas w i t n m w*ji.ch Appeal
must be lodged and the procedures to be f o l l o w e d aie laid down

Dear Sir

HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO. 130/76

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975:
FIRST DESIGNATION ORDER AND ACCOMPANYING REGULATIONS

1. The intention was expressed in Home Office Circular No. 150/1975 of issuing, in
due course, further guidance on the procedure to be followed when a ground is designated
under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 as requiring a safety certificate. As
will be seen from the enclosed copy, an order has now been made (SI 1976 No. 126*0
designating under the Act, with effect from 1 January 1977* the international association
and rugby union football grounds and those of the clubs in the first division of the
football league.                                      '      '         ’----     “.

2. It is an offence under section 12(1) of the Act to admit spectators to a designated
stadium after the date on which the designation order relating to it comes into
operation, unless an application for a general safety certificate has been made and not
subsequently withdrawn or deemed to have been withdrawn. In consequence, therefore,
of this order, the local authorities for the areas in which the grounds are situated
may expect to receive by the date of operation applications for the grant of general
safety certificates under the Act, which will thereupon fall to be dealt with in
accordance with the Act and the regulations, also enclosed made under section 6(1) of
the Act (SI 1976 No. 1263).

3* Guidance as to the procedure to be followed, in conformity with the regulations,
in dealing with applications for general safety certificates is set out in the annex
to this circular.

    It is not proposed at this stage to issue guidance as to the procedure to be
followed in connection with the grant of special safety certificates, since, under
section 3(2) of the Act, such certificates are not required until general safety
certificates are in operation. Further guidance for this purpose will accordingly be
deferred until nearer the date when a need for special safety certificates may arise.
There is, however, one lactor regarding the issue of such certificates which may have
a bearing on the date of|the introduction of a general safety certificate and to which
regard should accordingly be paid. Once a general safety certificate has been issued,
a person wishing to conduct an activity calling for the issue of a special safety
certificate must comply with all the requirements relating to such certificates laid
dowr in the regulations. Where, therefore, such an event has already been arranged,
local*authorities may wish to consider, where appropriate, the desirability of not
issuing a general certificate until after the event has taken place*

5. The regulations provide specific time limits for the determination of applications
for speaial safety certificates, but this is not the case as regards general safety
certificates. Although local authorities and the clubs and other organisations operating
stadia will no doubt have done as much pre-planning as possible, it is assumed that the
surveys and consultations involved in determining suitable terms and conditions will,
lxx many cases, still extend over several weeks, so that it v/ill not be practicable,
jspecially should appellate proceedings arise, to bring certificates into eifeet
significantly in advance of the end of the 1976/77 season* In these circumstances,
m d where a club or stadium company wishes to take advantage of the close season to
;arry out structural v/ork which will have the effect of significantly altering the
cerms and conditions which would otherwise have applied, local authorities may feel that,
iepending on the condition of the stadium and having regard to the powers already
available to deal with cases of severe risk, the maximum advantage is to be gained by
deferring the issue of a certificate until the beginning of the 1977/78 season so as
to enable as much work as possible to be done# In this way, it is hoped that it will
normally be possible for a sufficient measure of agreement to be reached between the
interested parties to obviate the need for appeals against the terms and conditions
Imposed®

b« It is suggested in paragraph 3 of the annex that local, authorities will wish to keep
in mind tne guidelines set out in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds when framing the
conditions which they consider should be included in the safety certificate. Some of
these recommendations have been revised in the light of the experience gained in applying
the guidelines during the past year or so* The Guide is being reprinted and should be
available well before the first designation order becomes effective? a copy will be sent
to you. as soon as it becomes available. A list of the proposed amendments to the Guide
is attached for reference in the meantime.

7* Section 6(1)(b) of the Act enables the Secretary of State to make regulations
authorising local authorities to determine the fees which may be charged in respect of
applications for safety certificates. In the discharge of this power, Regulation 1h
provides that such charges may be made in respect cf applications for the issue or
amendment of safety certificates, tout that they shall not exceed an amount commensurate
with the work actually mid reasonably done. As regards the issue of a general safety
certificate it is hoped that, by affording stadium authorities an opportunity to co-operate
to the full, by eg preparing plans, checking crush barriers, etc, local authorities should,
in the normal course, not find it necessary to charge fees representing more than 17
man/days’ work.

8. The clubs and stadium authorities whose sports grounds are named in the designation
order have been advised about their j>osition. A copy of that letter is enclosed ±or^
your information* The note appended to the letter and cc/ering the procedure regarding
applications for general safety certificates is in the same terms as the annex to this
circular*

9» A further copy of this circular is enclosed for the information of the Chief
Financial Officer.

                                                     Yours faithfully

ANNEX

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

PROCEDURE REGARDING APPLICATIONS FOR GENERAL SAFETY CERTIFICATES

1.   The Regulations provide that any application for a safety certificate shall be
made in the form contained in the Schedule to the Regulations or a form to the like
effect. Copies of the form are being made available to potential applicants and they
are being advised of the need to provide such information in support of their applica­
tion as will enable the local authority to discharge its functions under the Act. In
particular, the application should be accompanied by detailed information as to the
structure, capacity, etc of the stadium, including plans of the stadium, certificates
relating to the testing of crush barriers and evidence of the applicant’s status. It
is, however, open to a local authority, under section 3(^) of the Act, to require, by
notice in writing, such further information of this kind as it may consider necessary
to enable it to determine the terms and conditions to be included in the certificate.

2.   On receipt of an application for a general safety certificate, the local authority
must first determine whether the applicant is a qualified person, ie a person likely
to be in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and conditions to be imposed
in the certificate. If it considers him to be such a person the authority is then
under a duty to issue a general safety certificate to him. In the case of a general
safety certificate, where considerations of time are not paramount, the regulations
impose no specific time limit for such a determination. In any event, it seems
facie unlikely that an application for a general safety certificate would be made by
^unqualified person. There is, however, a right of appeal against a determination
by a local authority that an applicant is not. a qualified person (see paragraph 10;.

3.   The local authority is required, by section 3(3) of the Act, to send a copy of _
any application for a safety certificate (general or special) to the appropriate Chief
Officer of Police and building authority, and must consult them about the terms and
conditions to be included in the certificate. In gaming sueh^ conditions, J-°cal
authorities will no doubt wish to keep in mind the principles or guide lines set out in
the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds. In this connection local authorities are
reminded that, as was pointed out in paragraph 6 of the Annex to Home Office Jorcuar
No.150/1975, this non-statutory document is not a set of requirements to be rig ly
applied regardless of individual circumstances. The maximum fiexibility ehould be
maintained to take account of the different circumstances at individual grounds deriv
ing from differences in such matters as age, size and mode of construction. In this
regard, it should also be noted that the Act provides that the terms and conditions
 should be such as "necessary or expedient to secure reasonable safety and it would be
unreasonable, even if it were practicable, to seek the absolute safety of everyone
 attending the sports stadium.
      It is envisaged that there will be a good deal of consultation between the local
 authority and the stadium representatives in the process of drawing up ^certificate
 conditions. In this way, if evidence is advanced that a ground is r a r e l y filled to
 capacity? the local authority may consider it proper to base its requirements on actual
 levels of attendance over a given period rather than on maximum capacity. Ontherare
 occasions on which a capacity crowd could be expected, separate provision might be made
 for this contingency on the lines indicated in paragraph 7 below. Again, if a stand
 were found to b® structurally weak, the local authority might, in consultation with the
 stadium representatives, offer the choice of having any necessary remedial ^rks
 carried out or of restricting admission to the stand until it had.been strengthened.

 %     As will be apparent from the foregoing paragraphs, the form and content o f a
 safety certificate is likely to vary according to the circumstances of the indivi ual
 case. Accordingly, a standard form of certificate would not be appropriate. It must
 however contain full details of the terms and conditions imposed including, in
 particular, the matters referred to in section 2(2) of the Act and have^anne. ed to it
 f pl an of the stadium by reference to which the terms and conditions will be f r a m e d .


                                          1
The certificate when first issued may contain restrictive conditions which can then be
relaxed or deleted by amendment of the certificate. The local authority may find it
convenient to list, in a covering letter to the certificate, such modifications as
will be subsequently permitted, eg in the form of a statement of the increased spectator
activities to be allowed for the separate sections of the ground when the various
stages are completed, of any future works programme for the ground which has been
agreed with the stadium authorities. This arrangement, by excluding from the certif-'
icate itself proposed conditions which would apply only to future works, should serve
to obviate confusion. At the same time, however, care must be taken not to exclude
from the certificate any restriction germane to current conditions, since section 5(3)
of the Act provides for an interested party to appeal to the Secretary of State against
the inclusion of anything in, or the omission of anything from, a safety certificate,
and these rights must not be prejudiced in any way in consequence of the form cf the
certificate.

6.   As regards the scope of a general safety certificate, section 2(5) of the Act
provides that different terms and conditions may be included for different activities.
Although, therefore, a stadium may be in regular use only as a football ground, in
cases where it is also used from time to time to stageother events it would be desir­
able, and in many cases obviate the need for special safety certificates, if the terms
and conditions appropriate to those events were to be included in the general certif­
icate. It is suggested that any such events for which      itis considered desirable to
provide might conveniently be divided into 2 classes:

     (1)   those sufficiently similar in character to the main purpose of the
           stadium for the normal terms and conditions to be equally applicable;

     (2)   Those of a fundamentally different character, eg boxing matches, pop
           concerts, etc which may involve all or part of the playing area being
           given over to spectator accommodation and for which separate terms and
           conditions will have to be devised. It is not, of course, necessary to
           provide for these contingencies in cases where no clear need is foreseen
           by the stadium authorities.

7.   There may also be circumstances in which the terms and conditions applicable to
the normal activity of the stadium may be found to be inappropriate, eg when a special
event, such as a cup tie or a "local Derby", is expected to attract significantly more
than the usual attendance. In the case especially of cup replays these special events
may arise with only a few days' notice, within which it would not be possible to
accommodate the whole of the statutory procedure appropriate to the grant of a special
safety certificate. In order to overcome this difficulty, it would seem desirable for
the local authorities and stadium authorities to seek to work out in advance the
modifications to the normal terms and conditions which might be appropriate to such
occasions, eg the admission of increased numbers to certain areas on the condition
that extra stewards and police are employed, that notice is given to the local
authority, and so on, and to provide for their incorporation in the general safety
certificate.

8.   Once a general safety certificate has been issued, subject to the determination of
any appeal, the terms and conditions can be varied only by formal amendment o f the
certificate, which may be at the initiative either of the holder of the certificate or
of the local authority (see section k ( 2 ) of the Act) and will presumably reflect
changes in circumstances occurring since the grant of the original certificate. It
will thus be to the mutual benefit of local authorities and clubs/stadium authorities
for a close liaison to be maintained after the issue of the certificate and certainly
while any further works of safety measures are being carried out. It is likely to be
in the stadium operators' finanicai interest to get the safety certificate amended as
soon as possible after work has been completed, and they should accordingly ensure that
the local authority is kept informed of progress. For its part the local authority
will no doubt wish to co-operate by arranging matters so that, following completion
of the work, the certificate can be amended without delay.



                                         2
9.    After a certificate has been granted, an application may be made for the transfer       f
of the certificate to another person. Similarly, while a local authority is considering
an application for a certificate and before the certificate has been granted, it may be
asked to substitute some person other than the original applicant as the person to whom
the certificate should be granted. These are, however, likely to be rare occurrences
in the case of general safety certificates, where an application will normally be made
on behalf of a club or a stadium organisation by an authorised official of the club
or representative of the organisation. However, if it does happen, the local authority
w i n be required in both cases to determine whether the substituted nominee is a
qualified person. Thereafter, in the first case, the procedure laid down in the
regulations relating to giving notice of, and the reasons fort the determination will
apply together with any necessary appeals procedure. In the second case, there is no
reason why the local authority should not treat the application in all respects as a
new application in the terms of the original one and process it from the point it had
already reached.
10. In addition to the right of appeal by an applicant for a general safety certificate
against the determination that he is not a qualified person (see paragraph 2 above),
which, of course, applies also in the case of a proposed transfer of a certificate, the
Act provf8.es a further right of appeal to any "interested party” (which term includes
the holder of the safety certificate) against the inclusion of anything in or the
omission of" anything from a safety certificate or against a refusal to amend or replace
a safety certificate. The regulations provide that, in the case of a general safety
certificate, notice of any such appeal shall be given within 28 days following receipt
of a notice of the local authority's decision, or, in the case of persons who are not      j
notified, the publication by the local authority of its decision in a newspaper
circulating in the locality.                                                             j

11. In this connection, Regulation 7 requires a local authority, on issuing or amending
a safety certificate or refusing to do so, to give notice to certain specified
"interested parties" and also to advertise their action in the press. It is regretted
that it has been necessary to incur the trouble and expense of advertising, but, since
Section 5(5) of the Act is not specific in the definition which it provides of
"interested party", no other means could be found of ensuring that all persons who mxg
validly claim to be "interested parties" within the meaning of the Act should be able
to acquaint themselves with the local authority’s decision, and failure to bring the
decision to their notice could result in a denial of their rights of appeal or of a
hearing by the Secretary of State. For the same reason a similar obligation has been
imposed on an appellant (by Regulation 8(?)) to advertise his intention to appeal, and
a person wishing to appear before a person appointed by the Secretary of State under ^
section 5 ( k ) of the Act is required to give notice within 28 days of such advertisement.

 12. Any appellant is required (by Regulation 8(5)) to give the local authority notice
 of appeal, accompanied by the relevant documents appertaining to the appeal. It will
 then be for the local authority, in accordance with Regulation 8(9) t to inform the
 Secretary of State in writing within 28 days whether it wishes to oppose the appeal.
 With any such notice, the local authority is required to submit its reasons and any
 relevant supporting documents and to state whether it wishes a hearing under section
 of the Act. (The procedure governing the conduct of all such hearings is set ou
 Regulation 10.)
 13. It is also open to the Secretary of State, if he considers it necessary, to order
 a public inquiry under section 5(6) of the Act in relation to any appeal. In such a
 case, the procedure to be followed is laid down in Regulation 12.

THE GUIDE TO SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS

AMENDMENTS TO THE GUIDE

The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds was published in 1973 and is based on the

*achnical Appendix to Lord Wheatley’s Report of the Inquiry into Ground Safety

at Sports Grounds.       Since its publication, its use on a voluntary basis has

brought to notice the need for some amendments to be made to the guidelines

when applied to football grounds.


2.    During consideration of the Safety of Sports Grounds Bill, Ministers mentioned

that if the provisions of the Act were applied to sports grounds other than

football grounds, separate guides would be compiled for the different classes of

sports grounds.       The existing Guide will accordingly be revised and re-printed

as the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football).        The amendments which will

be made for this purpose are, in the meantime, attached as an appendix to this

note.


3.    These amendments include a new chapter covering the recommendations of the

Minister for Sport’s Working Party on Crowd Behaviour which was established in

 1974 to look into means of combating hooliganism at football grounds.        Matters

 of crowd control inevitably have a bearing on safety at sports grounds and it

 has accordingly been thought right to incorporate the Working Party's

 recommendations for the general convenience of clubs and other stadium authorities


 4.    The main amendments in the attached list are as follows:

       a.    Exits' from each area of spectator accommodation should enable the

             spectators to leave .that area in 8 minutes or less.

       b.    Every spectator on the terrace should be within 12 metres of a

             gangway or exit.

        c.   Railings and fences dividing sections of the ground should be of

             the same strength as handrails.

        d.   Depending on the condition of the individual stand, the time

             specified for the evacuation may lie between the prescribed

             maximum and minimum.
                                                                                                                         *


                                                                                                                         #

                 dation the crowd flow tends to become turbulent. In

Recommendations of the Working Party on Crowd. Behaviour

Crowd movement on terraces should be severely limited in
order to give the Police the fullest opportunity for crowd
control. Less problems occur where the terraces are
divided as far as possible into sections by the use of'
railings or barriers, both radial and lateral. Ideally,
each section should be self-contained and should be
serviced by its own entrance/exits, refreshment facilities
and toilets, (see para. 7 »7 »)

"Home" and visiting supporters should be segregated. It
should not be possible for spectators to transfer from one
end of the ground to the other.

Access to playing pitches must be made as difficult as
possible in normal circumstances while, at the same time,
providing the Police with proper access to the terraces for
the purposes of crowd control and enabling the pitch to be
used in the event of serious emergency. One alternative
to fencing is the construction around the pitch of a wall
with a smooth surface which should be not less than 4 feet
in height on the terrace side. This boundary wall should
have gates or access points to the pitch which could be
manned by the Police or stewards. A walkway between the
boundary wall and the terraces, which would be solely
occupied by Police, First Aid and official club personnel,
has been found to be effective as regards safety and
security. In order to achieve this, it might be necessary
to remove one or two rows of terracing and to protect the
walkway from the terrace by a continuous line of barriers,
so designed as to discourage access to the walkway except
at authorised points. The access points from terrace to
walkway should be reasonably near the access points from
walkway to the pitch, (see para 7»10). Where a walkway
system is in use, sliding gates may be installed at the
access points from the walkway to the pitch, ie where there
can be no crowd pressure against them, (see para 6 .14»2
regarding use of sliding gates elsewhere). A barrier to
the pitch is unnecessary where seating extends to the level
of the playing area.

Clubs should carefully consider their arrangements for the
sale of alcohol. In any case all refreshments should be
served in plastic containers.

Home clubs should consider, in conjunction with the Police,
each of the matches and determine which should be all-ticket,
and the allocation of tickets to the visiting club. So far
as the terraces are concerned, any allocation should have
regard to the manner in which the terraces are divided so
that policing arrangements can be effective.

The home club should, as a general rule, make it their
policy not to issue tickets for announced all-ticket matches
to away supporters on the day of the game» However, the
local Police will be best able to assess the situation and
their advice should be followed, but it is important where-
ever possible to discourage supporters from travelling to
all-ticket matches without tickets.

        SUBJECT:   SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975



          On Thursday, 8 April 1976, I attended a meeting at the Sheffield
          Town Hall arranged by the South Yorkshire County Council, in
          connection with the above Act - Senior officers r epr esenting
          other Divisions of the South Yorkshire Police were also in
          attendance.

          Following a discussion, the details on the attached schedule
          were suggested as a working basis for the degree of involvement
          of the various bodies at any inspection of sports grounds.

          In order to avoid duplication and division of responsibility,
          the responsible authorities shown on the schedule are suggested
          for the carrying out of inspections, re-inspections and making
          final technical decisions necessary.  The headings given are
          included in the contents summary of the nGuide to Safety at
          Sports Grounds", with some additions. Where there is an
          overlap of the spheres of control, the primary authority
          will consult the other authorities concerned before any
          final decision is made.

          A final draft will be completed and forwarded for approval to
          the chief officers of the involved bodies.

                 Dear Sir,

                       With reference to the attached copy letter forwarded by the Superintendents
                 Association to the Secretary of the Football Association (with copies to the
                 Minister of Sport and the media) regarding the following resolution unanimously
                 passed by the Executive Committee of the Superintendents' Association

                              "That representations be made to the Football Association
                              to consider imposing a bc.n on all persons under the age of
                              16 from attending selected professional football matches
                              unless accompanied by an adult throughout the match".

                 this matter was considered by the Association of Chief Police Officers at a =
                 recent meeting when it was;agreed "To write to the Minister oT Sport,through
                 Home Office, disassociating A.C.P.O. from the Superintendents1 views".

                      Whilst Chief Police Officers share the concern of the Superintendents'
                Association, and indeed of all police officers, about the behaviour of the
                younger hooligan element and appreciate that such a suggestion is a genuine
                attempt to make a contribution in dealing with a National problem, it is
                considered that it is impracticable.

                      Firstly, there is the difficulty of determining age within the strict terms
                laid down. The present experience with regard to drinking offences and
                admission to cinemas affecting certain types of films clearly indicate the
                impossibility of effective control. Any attempt to segregate outside
                football grounds would possibly lead to further disorder than at present
                experienced. However, even if achieved, once inside the ground it would be
                virtually impossible to ensure that an adult and a person under 16 yearn of age
                remained together. It has to be remembered too, that a 17 year old is now
                regarded as an adult in respect of legal accountability and soccer hooliganism
                is not entirely confined to persons under 16. It-would also seem that the
                majority would- suffer for the few.

                      Secondly, vhilst the Superintendents' Association acknowledge that
                there will be difficulties, such a siiggestion, if implemented would also place
                a very heavy demand upon an already overburdened and depleted Police Service
                not to mention the possible additional cost to"the Football Clubs.

                      It will be noted that the Superintendents* Association aver that their
                "members almost invariably tales command of police arrangements at football matche
                but they do not mention that Chief Constables are still responsible for all
                that happens at matches insofar as police arrangements are concerned. Therefore,
                it would be for the Chief Constables to decide whether to instruct their Forces
                to co-operate in'any such ban.
      A3 has already been stated the concern of the Superintendents* Association
in this matter is appreciated but it is regarded as regrettable that an
approach was not made to the Association of Chief Pol.ioc Officers in the f.ir3t
instance becaurc the Superintendents' suggestion is not a concensus of the
Police Service view.

      It Js v/ell k n o w that Chief Police Officers have thin matter constantly
under review, invariably consult their Senior Operational Officers ond have, and
are participating in many discussions, seminars, etc. covering Hooliganism and
Safety at' Sports Grounds.

      Further, a booklet has been produced and circulated to all Chief Constables
shoving Force Liaison Officers .from whom intelligence may be obtained in
connection with visiting Football terms of the four Football .beaguc Divisions.  .
The northern Area Traffic Commissioners, have of their own volition, imposed
certain conditions for a trial period which it. is hoped will: assist in the
prevention of hooliganism. Chief Police Officers are at present considering
these conditions with a view to their adoption on a permanent and national basis;

      It is requested that you would please be good enough to inform :4ho
Minister-of Sport accordingly.


                                    Yours-, sincerely,
                                       / /

Dear

      At a recent meeting of the Executive Committee of this Association
the following resolution was passed unanimously: "That representations
be made to the Football Association to consider imposing a ban on all
persons under the age of 16 from attending selected professional
football matches unless accompanied by an adult throughout the match".

       This Association has, as you are no doubt aware, been concerned at
the d e g r e e of violence and damage occasioned in and around football
grounds for a number of years. We highlighted the problem at our 1974
Annual General Meeting of Districts held at Eastbourne, when we made a
plea for byelaws to be provided v/hich would, among other things, give
police powers to remove people from the playing area and eject
undesirables from the ground. Such natters would, we suggested, become
criminal offences for which the police should be provided with a power
of arrest. Unfortunately these suggestions have not been taken ujr arid
no legal powers are possessed by police at the present time to eject
people from football grounds or to remove them from the playing area.

      What ve now have in nind by the terms of our resolution i3 to
categorise selected football matches rather in the way in which film3
are given an appropriate rating. In those instances where the club or
clubs involved had a past record of misbehaviour by their fans they
would have the terms of the resolution applied to them.

      We appreciate this will create difficulties, innocent clubs will
suffer and there will obviously be difficulties in adminstration and
enforcement which would include the categorisation of matches, the
period of notice of categorisation, the age of juveniles, and the
possibility of trouble arising outside the ground from those not
admitted. Despite such obvious difficulties we believe that these
steps will have the effect of keeping come of the undesirable element
away, thereby reducing the hooliganism at football matches and will in
the long term bring back onto the terraces the traditional attendance
of father and eon which was for so long a part of the heritage of this
nation.

      This Association, whose members almost invariably take command of
police arrangements at football matches, believe that proper legislation
with adequate powers given to police, together with the categorisation
of selected matches, would do much to reduce the trouble which now
beset3 so many league football grounds in this country.

      Wo would of course be delighted to discuss these matters further
with you at any time0

      For your information copies of this letter are being forwarded to.
the Minister of Sport and the media.

             SUBJECT:    SAFETY IN SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975



                I have to report that on Friday, 16 January 1976, I attended
                a meeting at Fire Brigade Headqusorters, Division Street, in
                connection with the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.

                The meeting had been arranged by Mr. King, a member of the
                Legal Department of the South Yorkshire County Council, who
                was accompanied by Mr. Fox of the same Department. Divisional
                Officer Skelton of the Fire Brigade was also present.

                Although at the present time no sports stadia have been
                designated in the Act, it is anticipated that only First and
                Second Division football club grounds will be initially concerned.

                Section 10 of the Act gives power to a local authority in a
                situation where there is a risk to spectators to apply to the
                Court for an Order restricting or prohibiting spectators until
                such steps have been taken to reduce the risk to a reasonable
                level.  In order to ascertain the places within the South
                Yorkshire area where such a situation may apply* Mr. King
                requested that a list of all stadiums where Police presence
                is normally required due to crowd attendance be supplied to
                him.

                I have arranged for Chief Superintendents of each Division to
                supply me with the details of places which would fall within
                this category in order that the necessary information can be
                forwarded to Barnsley.

                There was no further discussion as to the involvement of the
                Police or Fire Service but having seen a copy of the Act it
                would appear that Section 2 gives some indications as to how
                the Police will be concerned.

                A further meeting has not been arranged at this time but it is
                anticipated that Mr. King will ask for further consultation with
                the Police and Fire Service with a view to receiving their
                recommendations as to what should be incorporated in the form
                of the Safety Certificate to be issued in due course in respect
                of those grounds to which they may be applicable.

REPORT OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE                             FIRE SERVICE COMMITTEE
                                                          8TH JANUARY 1976


              SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT, 1975


With reference to my report to this Committee on the 6th November, 1975, further
consideration has been given to the detailed arrangements which it will be necessary
to implement once the Secretary of State has begun to designate sports stadia as
requiring safety certificates under Section 1 of the Act. Discussions have taken
place between representatives of the Administration Department, the Police, and
the Fire Service, when it was agreed that because of the considerable amount of
liaison work which will be necessary between the respective specialist departm ents,
i . e . , Police, F ire, and Building Inspectors of D istrict Councils, it is desirable
that the work of co-ordination should be undertaken by the Administration
Department.

From initial consultations which have taken place, it would appear that the Secretary of
State, in his first designation order, will not, apart from certain international
grounds, go beyond 1st and 2nd Division football grounds, and therefore the only
one with which the County Council will be concerned in the first instance will be the
Sheffield United ground. Presumably it is intended, at a later date, to designate
the grounds of clubs in lower Divisions, and there would appear to be no reason
why the County Council should not, in due course, if they think it desirable, ask the
Secretary of State to include other sports stadia in subsequent O rders.

Because of the County Council's limited initial involvement, it is still my opinion
that no increase in staff will be required, but this must be qualified by the proviso
that the situation will need to be kept under observation, and a further report will
be made if it is necessary to revise this opinion as a result of the designation of
further sports stadia by the Secretary of State.

It has become obvious from initial discussions, that safety certificates will necessarily
be lengthy and complex documents, containing many conditions, and it is accordingly
proposed to set up working parties of officers from the Administration Department,
Police, Fire Service, and the D istrict Council, in each D istrict, to meet when the
various disciplines concerned have carried out their inspections and formulated
their recommendations, in order to settle the form of the safety certificate to be
submitted to Committee.

The Act provides that the County Council have a duty, when an application for a safety
certificate is received to determine whether the applicant is a person likely to be in
a position to prevent contraventions of the term s and conditions of the certificate.
Your officers are of the opinion that, certainly so far as football grounds are
concerned, applications should be submitted by the person in beneficial occupation
of the prem ises concerned.


                                -   1   -
After a safety certificate has been issued, it will be necessary, from time to time,
to carry out inspections to ensure that the conditions are being complied with.
The frequency of these inspections will obviously have a bearing on the staffing
situation, but it is suggested that a detailed check should be made at the end of each
season, followed by another about a month before the sta rt of the next season
to ensure that any departures from the requirements of the certificate found on the
form er inspection have been rectified. Apart from this, it is felt that a couple
of more general checks during the season should be adequate.

The County Council, the appropriate D istrict Council and the Chief Constable are
empowered to authorise entry of their officers to sports stadia for the purpose
of making inspections. A further report on this and on the question of fixing *fees
(if any) to be charged for applications will be submitted at a later date.

In an emergency situation, where there is a risk to spectators, the County Council
has the power to apply to a Magistrates* Court for an O rder prohibiting o r restricting
the admission of spectators until steps have been taken to reduce the risk to a
reasonable level. Even with very careful monitoring of all sporting activities
taking place in the County, it will not be possible to predict every potentially
dangerous situation, which may become apparent at short notice, and too late to
perm it the making o f an application to the M agistrates to lim it the gate (e .g ., if
Barnsley played on a Saturday at Leeds in the F. A. Cup and drew, and the replay
was on the following Tuesday). It will be necessary, therefore, for your officers
to examine the situation in an endeavour to identify all potentially dangerous
sports grounds, and if necessary, make applications in respect of them as they are
identified.

To sum m arise, therefore, the Committee are asked to adopt the following
recommendations:-


1.    That the work of co-ordination be undertaken by the Administration
      Department.

2.    That working parties of officers be constituted for each D istrict, as
      outlined in this report.

3.    That the suggested frequency of inspections be approved.

           With reference to the recent’meeting at the F ire Service Headquarters between your
           representative and representatives of the Fire Service and the Administration
           Department to discuss the provisions of the above-mentioned Act, you will be aware
           that, under Section 3, when an application for a safety certificate is received, the
           County Council are required to consult you and the appropriate D istrict Council
           thereon. I am endeavouring to establish proper procedures before we reach the
           stage of receiving applications, and would be glad if you would be prepared, at this
           stage, to nominate a specific officer with whom consultations may be undertaken.
           In this connection, you may consider it desirattfi I to nominate a senior officer in
           each Police Division, especially as it is proposed to establish a working party in
           each D istrict, to meet when the various disciplines concerned have carried twit
           their inspections and formulated their recommendations, in order to discuss and
           agree the final form of the safety certificate to be submitted to Committee iop
           ratification.                                                                /

           Section 3 of the Act also enables us to require an applicant to furnish us with such
           information and plans as we consider necessary, and accordingly I propose to
           draft some brief notes for the guidance of applicants. To enable me to do this, I

          Dear Chief Constable,

                                        Safety of Sportfi Grounds Bill

               I enclose herewith for your information correspondence received
          from Fred Pennington's office giving details of seminars which are
          being held in connection with the above.

               The General Purposes Committee have already nominated two members
          (Mr. A. Rennie, Chief Constable,   West Mercia and Mr. W. Gibson, Metro­
          politan Police), to attend the seminar being held on27th - 28th August
          and whilst I have asked members to indicate whether they wish to attend
          any of the subsequent seminars, the Committee felt that an invitation
          might be extended to those Chief   Officers of larger forces with first
          division football clubs in their area.

               Should you wish to attend, I shall be pleased if you will advise
          me of the date(s) suitable to you as soon as possible. If we are over­
          subscribed we may have to draw lots!

                                                              Yours sincerely,

Dear


INQUESTS: HILLSBOROUGH AND

Thank you for your letter of 23 April advising me that the
Attorney General had received a formal application under
section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988 from the families of six
Hillsborough victims for his consent to the making of an
application to the High Court for an order to quash the
inquisitions in these cases. We have informed our Ministers
and I am grateful to you for supplying the additional
information requested by Mr Wardle.  Please could you let me
know the Attorney General's decision in due course as we have
undertaken to keep our Ministers informed.




Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.


                              Yours sincerely



                              G HARRISON(MISS)
                              E Division

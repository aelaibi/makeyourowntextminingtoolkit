Dear Sir

Further to my telephone conversation of 10 October 1989, with your Deputy Chief
Metropolitan Ambulance Officer, Mr Hopkins, concerning the re-interviewing/showing
of video and photographic evidence to selected ambulance crews for the purpose of
trying to establish continuity between Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and
Hospitals in respect of a number of those that died in the Hillsborough Disaster on
15 April 1989. Enclosed please find a list of those Ambulance Officers that we
would like to see, together with their Ambulance Stations according to our records.

Subject to your agreement I would propose that my Inspector Layton, who is in charge
of the Video and Photographic Unit dealing with the Hillsborough Disaster, contacts
one of your staff who could act as a Liaison Officer, with a view to arranging
mutually'convenient times and dates for your ambulance officers to be seen.

Given their present level of commitments, I do not anticipate Inspector Layton and
his team will be in a position to start this aspect of our enquiry until some time
in the week commencing Monday, 23 October 1989, if this is convenient to you.

May I take this opportunity of thanking you for your co-operation and assistance in
this matter. If you have any queries please do not hesitate to contact me at
Nechells Green Police Station.

Youas faithfully




R. Taylor
Detective Superintendent
(Hillsborough Inquiry)

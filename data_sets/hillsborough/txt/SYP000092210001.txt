               I am a season ticket holder at Liverpool /c o o t b a 11 Club, and have been

               a supporter all my life.           )ot a ticket for the FA Cup Semi Final

               between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest to be played at Hillsborough

               Stadium in Sheffield on 13th April            1989 (150489)    from the club,   it was

               a £6 terrace ticket for the Leppings Lane end of the ground,

               I travelled to Sheffield in my own car with 4 friends.                We started

               from home at about     10.0 am and went to Sheffield via the Snake Pass.

               We had no delays but the trip was slow due to traffic on Snake Pass.

               We arrived at Sheffield at about          12.30 pm (1230) and I parked the car

               near a park close to the ground.              I saw no police at the point I

               parked my car,.

               All of us then walked down to the ground as one of the lads had not

                                                                                             S3647

             got a ticket.        We walked about asking for and being asked for tickets.

             My mate eventually got a ticket from another f a n , he just paid face

             value for it.

             No pubs or off licences near the jjH^ound seemed to be open so we bought
                              O K 1
             some cans of beer from the Gafteway Supermarket and just sat on the

             ground near the pub dr irffki ng them.

            At no time as we walked around near the ground did I made any

             contact with the police or was I stopped or searched,                I. did not see

            any bad behaviour by any fans,           I did see some drinking from cans and I

             did see one older man who was drunk but he caused no trouble.

            We eventual ly went to the Leppin^^'Cane end of the ground at about 2.

             time.     There were fans standing sitting on walls opposite obviously

            waiting to go in later.           I was not checked by the police as I

            approached the turnstiles and             I c a n ’tremember seeing any police.

            There were about 5/10 fans in            a small queue in front of me.      I

             joined on the       end and I got into the ground quits easily.         I presented

            my ticket and        it was taken by the turnstile       operator.    I do not

             remember seeing any police inside the turnst^fes but there may have

             been some there.         1 bought a programme warn a seller standing by the

             toilets,      but I did not see any s ig ns yt e11ing me where to go nor was I

             given any verbal       instructions.

             I did not see       any fans getting    in the ground other than through         the

             turnstile and I did not see any            other>£ates open.

             slightly to the right.          Even^hen    there were a lot of fans in the

             pen.     I got to the centre off the pen about half way down and got by a

             barrier which was in frortt of me.           It just started to get more and

            more     packed and it was uncomfortable on the barrier so I managed to

                                                                                       S3647

              get to the front of it fay getting underneath it.         The pressure just

              built up as I got     pushed further and further towards the front.         My

              mates were around     but I can't fae sure where they were as I was      just

              looking after myself.        At about the time the game kicked off I had

              been pushed right down to the front,        I realised that   it was not a

              normal   football   crush.    You just could not push back.    As I got to the

O H TO        front    X put my foot up on the wall and this combined with the
 ^I
              pressure from the     back pushed me up and above the other fans.        I tried

              to pull myself up     and out but I could not.     Fans al 1/around me   were

              shouting at a Police Officer who was standing fay«^a smal 1 gate at the

M             front,   they were asking for the gate to l>er‘ opened.     At first he was

              just    looking around as if he did        know what to do,   but then

    _         eventually he must have open*ra the gate as I saw fans were getting
    ^ •   6   --------------------------
              out.   As the crowd moved^I was pushed closer and clesser to the gate

              and eventually got lyut onto the pitch.       The only? injury 1 sustained

              was bruising tq/'fny chest but I did not re q u ^ e medi/cal treatment.

              When I got yfito the pitch I was just ve/y confused about what had

              happened/     I just walked around not knowing what to do.       I did not

              jnave any contact with any of the dead or injured fans.

              Eventually I just sat at the side of the pitch,         till the game had been

              called off then I just left,       by this time I had met up with my mate,

              we went back to the car and drove home.          The one point I would like

              to make is that 1 cannot understand why there were not sufficient

              stewards to ensure that the two centre pens were not allowed to take

              further fans after it became obvious they were full.          This could

              quite eas ily have been done by putting stewards at the end of the

              tunnel    to send the fans round to the sides.

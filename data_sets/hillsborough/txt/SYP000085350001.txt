                Ln,     a ppr o x i m a t e l y 250 yards        from the ground,              preventing          passing

                supporters         going    down these            roads.     Odd ones m a n a g e d to get              down them?

                ob v i o u s l y for     'toilet'          purposes.      This     duty     c o m menced at a p p r o x i m a t e l y

                1 1am    (1100)     that morning.             Myself,      Police S e r g e a n t          R E Y N O L D S and seven

                other Officers.            At   this        time and for the            remainder           of the    day,

                Police       Sergeant      R E Y N O L D S was     the only one wit h a personal                      radio.        From

                about m i d d a y onwards          there was a steady                 flow of supporters                passing       the

                road junctions where               I was        on duty w ith other Officers.                      It was      evident

                even at this           early stage           that a large          number      of supporters            had
                                                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                                                       S2961

    been drinking.              Also a fair        number were              either       carrying       plastic

    c arriers with beer and                  lager      in,    or    drinking           from    cans,    or    plastic

    bottles.        At one       point     there were more                people        passing    us drinking             than

    not.    This     having       been said,         there was            not     too muc h      rowdy b e haviour at

    this    point.       From this         point in time             right        thro u g h until       after 3pm

    < 1 5 0 0 ) a large         number     of / u p p o r t e r s    having        gone    to the       g r o u n d , were

    returning along Le p ^iri^sLane asking                             queueing          s upporters      for     'spare *

    tickets.        So   it was      easy as       of this          time     to form the opin i o n that a

    large     number       of    people were         drunk       to some          degree,       and an unknown

    number     of    people were           not    in p o ssession of tickets.                     A bout £ pm       (1400)

    t ra i n h ad a r r i v e d    b r i n g i n g i n suppo rt e r s a n d t h e s e w e r e ac: compani e d t

    the    ground by Police O f f i c e r s              (the only group                 that were).          Moun t e d

    Officers,        and a dog van,              made    occasional             patrols        past our       position.

    The    fact     that there was            this amount            of d r i nking        (and drunkenness)

    seemed to make              it a pointless           exercise           that    other O f f icers          in other

“   locations        were       s e arching      coaches       etc.,        and    confiscating alcohol.

    B e t w e e n 2pm    (1400)      and 3 pin (1500)            the      road     (Leppings Ln)          became        choke

    with    people,        even as 3pm           (1500)       a p p r o a c h e d and     it was    evident         that a

    large     number       of    people w o u l d       not make          it for the 3pm           (1500)        kick      off,

    notwithstanding              that    some     of them did not                 have    official       tickets.

    At about 3pm           (15QQ),       Police      Sergeant R E Y N O L D S            instructed us to a t t e n d

    at    the Leppings           Ln end of the gro/fnd,                   believed assistance                 required

    c ontrolling         the     crowd outside           1/hat end's            turnstiles.        Fro m our origina

    positions we           could see a lartf4 mass                   of     people milling about.                 We

    attended        that    location and /as we a r r i v e d , we                      caught    the    tail     end of

    the    large     group of        p e o p l y who     had f l o o d e d        in thro u g h the turns t i l e s

    and    opened gates,           we were        i n structed         to    remove       the    remaining        people

    t rying    to get       in,    until      the s i t u a t i o n had           cleared.       The a rea w a s

    cleared and the              perimeter        gates       closed temporarily.                 A certain amount

    of    rowdiness among            the    crowd       left outside              was    evident at        this     time.

Having      been at the            location a short            time,       memb e r s      of my serial

a t t e m p t e d to go       into the       ground.      At that,_.time it was                 thought        because

of a public          order       situation,        some     cpr as were            p r evented from doing so

by an     Inspector           and told to         p e p f c i rm crowd control             i mmediately outside

the ground.          We did this,            h jyi were unaware            for      some     considerable            time

of the      sit u a t i o n    i^sid^the          ground.      The     only        inform a t i o n we got was

gleaned       from the         intermittent           ?tannoy'       messages          from the         l oudspeaker

system.       For    the next         one and a half           hours       the trickle            of    people

d r u n k , a large amount             dazed and        in shock,          some were          "walking w o u n d e d 5

who    refused       further assistance.                Those      of us outside              the      ground did not

find    out    for at         least    half hour what,             if a n y t h i n g      had h a p p e n e d on the

terraces.

As    it became        obvious        what      had happened         those         of us a t t e m p t i n g    to keep

some sort       of order          outside       the ground and keep the way                         clear for

emergency        vehicles,          were     s u b jected    to a non-stop               torrent        of vehement

verbal     abuse and threats                 from a good         p roportion           of the       crowd by now

leaving       the    ground,        this was a f r i g h t e n i n g        s i t u a t i o n as we were             by now

vastly o u t - n u m b e r e d      fay a p o t e n tially hostile mass                    of d i s t r e s s e d

people.       We were         defle c t i n g   the    insults,        threats and abuse,                 still       being

unaware       of what         exactly      had happened.           Radio m e s sages            being

passed were more               difficul t       to u n d e r s t a n d all         tj^/ciugh this        time.

E v e n t u a l l y the   crowd       cleared,        we were      d e - b r i/4 f e d in the around.               Went

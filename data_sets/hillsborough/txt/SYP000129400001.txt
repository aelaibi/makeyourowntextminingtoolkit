  r,or the attention of Mr.' K. Jones



  Dear Sirs,
                                         Sheffield Wednesday Footba11 C1ub
                                             South Stand Emergency Lighting
                         Following our recent meetings , we now confirm the proposals
  which have been discussed and agreed with Mr. K. Jones.
                         We enclose a coloured up copy of our drawing 1610/41B,
  together with the corresponding circuit identification sheet
 which indicate the proposed circuit arrangements and additional
  light fittings to be installed.                                                                           The red coloured areas are
  those where the predominant illumination is provided by the
 battery-supported circuits, the yellow and unooloured areas are
  those where the predominant lighting is served from mains-only
  circuits.
                         Either system on its own, we believe will provide adequate
  illumination on all escape routes to satisfy the provisions of
 B.S.5266.                              Normally both systems are in operationffed by mains
 power to provide the required level of normal illumination.
 In the event of mains failure the emergency system is automatically
 transferred to the battery supply.
                         The two main exits El and S2 from, the upper access level will
 be-checked for•illumination level under failed emergency circuit
 and two additional mains fed lights will be added if necessary to
                                                                     SHEET



EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




  meet the required illumination level.
         We understand that the above proposals will be acceptable
   only for the duration of the existing battery life.      When the
   time comes for battery replacement, we would propose further
  modifications which, in addition to reducing the battery
   load, wo^ld remedy the shortcomings of the existing installation
   in regard to physical separation of the cable routes and
   switchgear between the normal and emergency systems.      These
  modifications would achieve compliance with B.S.5266 by locating
  switch or fuse gear in separate fire protected zones and by
   cabling with MICC or in steel conduit where normal and
  emergency circuits run parallel.
         Work is now in progress to implement the present proposals,
  and we anticipate that this will be completed by the Christmas
  break or shortly after.


                                   Yours faithfully,

I.     Purpose of Meeting

The original intention of the visit had been to check that the outstanding Matters
referred to in the Note of the meeting held on 12th November had been completed
or were in the course of completion prior to the anticipated issue of the Certificate
by the County Council this week.

2.     Minor Matters

An inspection of the ground showed that a number of minor matters still required
attention, but the Club undertook to ensure that these were attended to in the ne xt
few days.

3.     Major Matters

A.     Emergency Lighting - South Stand

 The meetings which had taken place between the County Fire Service and M essrs.
 Eastwood and Partners since 12th November on the South Stand Emergency Lighting
 had produced agreement on an interim arrangemeit which would be regarded as
                                                                                           ■tip

acceptable for the duration of the existing battery life . Further modifications at
that time would remedy the shortcomings of the existing Installation. Details were
contained In the letter dated 12th December which M essrs. Eastwood and Partners t
had addressed to the Fire Service.
     /

B.       South Stand Construction

The Building Authority expressed concern as to what they saw as a lack of structural
Integrity In the South Stand. In their opinion, corrosion was contributing to the
progressive deterioration of the Stand which, It was felt, could only be properly
determined by a full structural survey. The report forwarded by M essrs. Eastwood
and Partners In the la st week was not considered to be sufficiently comprehensive
to provide the required information, and the basis of calculation used could not be
agreed as appropriate. Whilst It was agreed that there had not been & specific
written request for such a full structural survey of the South Stand, the Building
Authority felt that It had been Inherent In the detailed discussions which had taken         •
place that such a report would be fbrthcomlng. The Building Authority were
concerned at the possibility that the requirements of the Building Regulations and
the Code of Practice Safety Factors could not be met; In particular the Structural
stability o f the South Stand In conditions of gale force winds and heavy snowfall
 was mentioned.

For the Club, Dr. Eastwood agreed that the Stand would obviously not be built to the
same specification or the same construction standards nowadays, but pointed out
that, for Instaa ce, none of the buildings In Sheffield built before 1970 could m eet
the latest wind pressure requirements. Even the Building Research Station was \
evidently thinking In term s that these requirements were u n r e a l Istlcally high. In
his professional bplnlon, the Stand was structurally safe and able In practice to meet
the loadings demanded. In any case, the conditions which had been described as
being possibly dangerous would mean In practice that a match could not be played
and consequently no spectators would be present.
                                                                                       , i
 Experience of the corrosion of Indoors steel In the Sheffield area showed this to be
 minimal, and the Stand was regularly test loaded by spectators. Structures such
 as this would show obvious external signs, such as cracks, well before there was
 any possibility of collapse, and would be readily apparent on even a superficial
 visual Inspection. Even though he did not consider It essential, plftitng of the
 front steel columns had been carried out as a compromise to try and m eet the
 Building Authority’s concern. He agreed there might well be a continuing
 maintenance problem with the stand, but this was a different matter to saying there
 was a structural problem. Reference was made to the Guide’s advice that when
 assessin g whether existing situations provided adequately for the safety of spectators,
 the criterion to be used Is that of a reasonable degree of safety. In Dr. Eastwood’s
 view, It would be unreasonable and unnecessary to Insist to a fall structural survey
 of the South Stand or to delay the Issue of the Certificate. It was his professional
 opinion (which he was m ost jealous of and vtould not put in jeopardy) that the Sraith
  Stand was structurally safe and that the basis of the calculations provided was
 appropriate. He was prepared to advise the Club to use the appeal procedure open
 to them should this be necessary.


                                        2   .
IT WAS AGREED that:

(a)   as there was no obvious deterioration in the South Stand structure of such
       a nature as to be of immediate concern, no objection would be raised to the
       continuance o f the derby game with Sheffield United on Boxing Day morning
       provided that no extrem e weather conditions occurred in the intervening
       period, and

(b)   a further meeting should be held as a matter of urgency between the Building
        Authority and Dr. W. Eastwood to discuss the structural integrity of the
       South Stand and the appropriateness of the calculations used (Mr. D. Vaughan
       to be present at Dr. Eastwood’s request).

NOTE As the discussions cm the South Stand Construction hinged on structural
     theories and practices, the F ire Service and Police representatives felt
     there was little they could contribute and left the meeting prior to its
     termination.

The Building Authority expressed concern as to what they saw as a lack of structural
Integrity In the South Stand. In their opinion, corrosion was contributing to the
progressive deterioration of the Stand which, It was felt, could only be properly
determined by a foil structural survey. The report forwarded by M essrs. Eastwood
and Partners In the la st week was not considered to be sufficiently comprehensive
to provide tte required Information, and the basis of calculation used could not be
agreed as appropriate. Whilst It was agreed that there had not been a specific

 as this would show obvious external signs, such as cracks, well before there was
 any possibility of collapse, and would be readily apparent on even a superficial

 front steel columns had been carried out as a compromise to try and m eet the
 Building Authority's concern. He agreed there might well be a continuing
 maintenance problem with the stand, but this was a different matter to saying there
 was a structural problem. Beference was made to the Guide's advice that when

Mr. Whitehead welcomed the representatives and explained that delays caused primarily
by the wet weather, had meant that all of the required work had not been completed by
today's meeting as the Club had originally envisaged.

The Schedule of Matters requiring attention (dated 8th June, 1979) was considered, with
the following results (after site inspection where necessa ry ):-

A.          Spion Kop


*           Work carried out.                                      '

4.         Except for one or two areas on the steps, all of the concrete terracing had been
            made good.
5.          The future of the score-board building was still undecided but, if a decision
             to be made shortly was to retain it, supporting calculations would be forwarded
             to the Building .Authority.

C .____ North West Terrace

1.          To prevent local damage to the sheeting, particularly at the joints and to
            spread the anticipated load over a larger area than at present, it was agreed
            that a continuous horizontal timber member should be ‘fixed to the front of the
            sheets at a height about one metre from terrace level.

2.          Work carried out.

D.          West Stand                                     -

            It was agreed that, whilst the only positive way of proving the adequacy of the
        .   joint between the new and existing construction was by means of a test load,
            the calculations provided would be regarded as acceptable.

E .____ West Terrace

1.          Work carried out.

2.          Work carried out.

F.          South Stand (Rear)

(i)         It was agreed that, provided seat no. 26 was replaced by a flush fitting type

1 &      It was obvious that there was adifference of opinion as to what could be                   '
2        regarded as acceptable as regards the em ergency lighting in the South
         Stand. It was agreed that a trial should be conducted during the hours of
          d a rk n e ss attended by re p re se n ta tiv e s of the Club and the F ir e Service so
          as to identify the danger a rea s. Consideration would then be given to
          possibly installing an extra battery and additional wiring to those particular
          areas not covered by the emergency lighting covering other parts of the
          ground.

L_____ Fire Warning System

         The problems with the public address system s eem ed to be mainly ones of
         diction and correct volume le v e l. It was agreed that the police would monitor the
         position at the next home match and, pending the new police control post being
         erected, would arrange for an officer to sit alongside the Disc Jockey in the
         meantime.
                                                                    vJAewwffc ■
         It was also agreed that the monitoring point for the fire d&tacthm equipment
         should be in the tower between the South and West Stands, and would proceed
         once the electrical work was completed.

       It was agreed that the Fire Service would supply the Club with details of the
       n ecessa ry wording.

0.    A ccess for Emergency Vehicles

1.    It was agreed that whilst no real problems haci occurred in the past, the Club
       would (in consultation with the Fire Service and the Police) mark out a lane,
       from the main gate to the South Stand in which parking would not be allowed.
       It was also agreed that the hydrant outside the South Stand would have to be
       kept clear.

P.    Public Address System

       Already discussed under "Fire Warning System"

Q.    P olice F acilites and R. F ir st Aid Facilities

       As agreed, a suitable permanent Police Room would be provided in the 1980
       closed season.

       The Club explained that it would be preferable from a building point of view
       for boththe police and fir st aid facilities to be in the same overall building
       although physically separated. The police representatives reserved their
       position on this point, pending the outcome of detailed discussions with the
       Club.

       The question of parking for both police and St. John's personnel purposes
       would also need to be looked at in detail.

S.____ Ground Capacity

       Provided the outstanding points were satisfactorily resolved, it was agreed
       that the crowd capacity would be as shown, i . e . a total of 50,174.
T,          Issue of Certificate

The Club were anxious that the Certificate should be in force by the derby game
with Sheffield United on Boxing Day morning, and they were assured that providing
the outstanding points were satisfactorily resolved, it was still the intention to
issue the Certificate at the beginning of December.

 (a)        that the existing purely wooden furniture in the P r e s s Box was not replaced
            by modern plastic/foam type,

 (b)        that a member of staff was present in the Bar throughout all of the period
            it was open to the public and also whilst a match was being played, and

 (c)        that the use of the luncheon room was confined as at present to use over
             the lunch-time period on other than match days and was kept locked at all
             other tim es.

 For the attention of M r . D. Vaughan

 Dear Sirs,

                                     Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975
                           Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd
                                              Certificate of Ground Safety

                  Difficulties with existing site levels and the loose nature of
 the fill which made it difficult to found retaining walls on it,
 have forced changes in the arrangement of the staircase leading
 from the top of the Spion Kop.
                  Once these difficulties were realised the Contractor had to be
 instructed immediately to continue with excavation to suit the new
 arrangement. Otherwise we would have been faced with additional
 costs for delays.
                  We now enclose three copies of our drawing 1.610/49 showing the
 rei/zsed layout, and would be pleased to have your comments as soon
 as possible.
                  It is not easy to visualise the work from the plan on the
 drawing because of the steep embankment and we suggest that your
representative might care to make a visit to site to see the
excavation in progress.                                                                          In the next few days the positions of the
landings and flights should be clearly discernable.



                                                                                                                         Yours faithfully

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

Thank you for                     your letter of the 21st August, and X apologise
for the delay                     in replying, but we have been very carefully
into the work                     schedule with Eastwood & Partners with
regard to the                     completion of all the necessary work.

It is expected that all work will be completed by early
December. A lot of progress has been made andmany areas
have been completed., Apart from the new staircase at the
back of Spion Kop all outside work is finished, and this
new exit along with work in the South Stand we hope to
complete by the end of October„ I understand that the
electrical scheme is the one that may be a little tight
in completing but, nevertheless, all being well December
seems to be the right date for completion.

I am asked to suggest to you the 7th, 9th or 12th
November as possible dates for a meeting and inspection
at which perhaps any contentious points could be dis­
cussed.

May I on behalf of my Directors thank you for your
sympathetic consideration re the issue of the safety
certificate, and I do assure you that all efforts
have been made and will continue to be so to meet
all the requirements that have been put to us „

Yours faithfully,




Secretary.

  For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


  Dear Sirs,
                                                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
                                                    Emergency Lighting Installation
                 Further to our discussions with Mr. K. Jones, we would
   like to set down in detail our proposals for the upgrading of
  the emergency lighting facilities at the above Club.
                 At present there is a large central battery system
  providing 240 volts D.C. which is arranged to serve the West
  and South Stands, and adjacent areas.                                                               This is achieved by an
  automatic changeover on mains failure, from AC mains to the
  DC battery supply for those circuits providing the essential
  tungsten lighting.                                                For the North Stand and adjacent areas,
  there is available a second YEB supply to act as a back up in
  the event of a loss of the normal supply.
                 We are proposing at this stage that new emergency circuits
  and fittings be installed to serve the Penistone Road exits,
  Spion Kop, the North Stand, the North-West Terrace, the West
  Stand, the South-West Terrace and the Leppings Lane exit.
  The existing normal lighting for the West Stand will be excluded
  from the battery load, and the spare battery capacity made
  available will serve the new emergency installation.

                                                                        Registered in England - No. 1134531
EASTWOOD it PARTNERS




           The duration of the battery supply will be substantially
   unchanged by this redistribution of load, and will give more
   than adequate time for clearing the ground.      As these are
   existing grounds, we would not recommend to the Club that
   their installations should comply in all respects with the
   standards set for new premises, especially as the 3-hour
   duration recommended for emergency battery capacity is quite
   inappropriate to the particular needs of safety.
           We are not proposing at this stage to recommend improvements
   to the South Stand emergency lighting.      Subject to approval,
   we would suggest that the system be reviewed when the time
   comes for replacement of the central battery.      At thi&iutime
    the load reduction which could be achieved with a new emergency
    lighting layout would permit a considerable saving in the battery
    replacement cost, and this would offset the cost to the Club of
   the new emergency lighting installation.
           We are enclosing a set of drawings corresponding to
    these proposals (1610/101 to 106) for which we are now seeking
    tenders.     We would look forward to your comments and suggest
   that it may be appropriate to arrange a meeting with the Fire
   Prevention Officers concerned if further discussions are required.
           We would also wish to have their comments on the proposed
    locations for the Fire Alarm call points shown on the drawings.

  For the attention of Mr. P. Vaughan


  Dear Sirs,
                                                       Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
                                                           Emergency Lighting Installation
                    Further to our discussions with Mr. K. Jones, we would
  like to set down in detail our proposals for the upgrading of
  the emergency lighting facilities at the above Club.
                    At present there is a large central battery system
 providing 240 volts D.C. which is arranged to serve the West
  and South Stands, and adjacent areas.                                                                          This is achieved by an
 automatic changeover on mains failure, from AC mains to the
 DC battery supply for those circuits providing the essential
 tungsten lighting.                                                         For the North Stand and adjacent areas,
 there is available a second YEB supply to act as a back up in
 the event of a loss of the normal supply.
                    We are proposing at this stage that new emergency circuits
 and fittings be installed to serve the Penistone Road exits,
 Spion Kop, the North Stand, the North-West Terrace, the West
 Stand', the South-West Terrace and the Leppings Lane exit.
The existing normal lighting for the West Stand will be excluded
 from the battery load, and the spare battery capacity made
available will serve the new emergency installation.

                                                                                Registered in England -   No. 1134531
                                                                    SHEET   2.


EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




           The duration of the battery supply will be substantially
   unchanged by this redistribution of load, and will give more
   than adequate time for clearing the ground.      As these are
   existing grounds, we would not recommend to the Club that
   their installations should comply in all respects with the
   standards set for new premises, especially as the 3-hour
   duration recommended for emergency battery capacity is quite
    inappropriate to the particular needs of safety.
           We are not proposing at this stage to recommend improvements
   to the South Stand emergency lighting.      Subject to approval,
   we would suggest that the system be reviewed when the time
    comes for replacement of the central battery.      At th<fcj* time
    the load reduction which could be achieved with a new emergency
    lighting layout would permit a considerable saving in the battery
    replacement cost, and this would offset the cost to the Club of
    the new emergency lighting installation.
           We are enclosing a set of drawings corresponding to
    these proposals (1610/101 to 106) for which we are now seeking
    tenders.     We would look forward to your comments and suggest
    that it may be appropriate to arrange a meeting with the Fire
    Prevention Officers concerned if further discussions are required.
           We would also wish to have their comments on the proposed
    locations for the Fire Alarm call points shown on the drawings.


                                        Yours faithfully,

                   Note of a Meeting of the Officer Working party
                                 (Sheffield D istrict)

        Sheffield United Football Ground

The Working Party considered Preliminary Drawings nos. 1917/1, 2, 3 and 4 forwarded
by M essrs. Eastwood and Partners relating to the Club’s proposals to erect a new
security fence around three sides of the pitch at Bramall Lane.

Superintendents Gavins and Johnson confirmed that the proposals followed recommendations
which they had made to the d u b on security grounds.

IT WAS AGREED that the proposals were generally acceptable, provided that the security
gates In the fence were not regarded as means of escape and that the necessary stress
calculations were supplied and were acceptable.

As they were primarily concerned with only the Bramall Lane ground, Superintendents
Ga vins and Johnson left after this item.

2.      Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground

The Working Party considered the progress of work at the Ground since their last
meeting on 12th July.

Whilst it was agreed that the d u b had done much of the outside work referred to in the
Schedule of Matters Requiring Attention (dated 8th June), the Building Authority
expressed particular concern about the possible stresses on the extensions at each end
of the West btaircase to link with the sim ple steel construction emergency staircases
to be erected. It was also pointed out that, at the present time, flo strengthening of the
corrugated sheeting on the North West Terrace had been carried out and that the Fire
Prevention Works and Structural and Rectification Works in the South Stand had not
yet been commenced. The urgent need to carry out the South Stand work was stressed .

It was noted that M essrs. Eastwood & Partners had by letter dated 10th August received by
the County Council yesterday sent revised drawings, calculations for the steel staircase
and cantilever slabs on the West Stand, and details of the prep osed works to upgrade fire
resistance.   Comments had been requested by 3rd September.

Whilst many detailed preliminary plans had been provided by M essrs. Eastwood and Partners
these were not suitable for including as part of the Certificate. The conditions and
date of issue of the Certificate vveie also discussed, as was the provision of the
First-A id F acilities recommended by the Area Health Authority.

A letter had also been received that morning from M essrs. Eastwood and Partners
requesting alterations to the previously agreed barrier arrangements in the North
Stand.

IT WAS ACREED.-

(a)   that the aim be to issue the Certificate at the beginning of December; that the
       Club be advised of this aim and asked to state their programme for the
       completion of the required works, any works not completed by that date to
       be included in a Schedule of Crowd Capacity Limitation to be incorporated in
       the Certificate;

(b)   that particular emphasis be placed on the necessity of carrying out the required
       works to the South Stand as soon as possible and that provided that it is feasible
       the Building Authority and the Fire Service be requested to let the County Council
       have their observations on the structural and fire resistance aspects for
       incorporation into a reply by 3rd September as requested by M essrs. Eastwood
       and Partners’ letter dated 1 Oth August;

(c)   that the question of plans to form part of the Certificate be re-considered when
       all the preliminary detailed plans being submitted have been agreed;

(d)   that, as with the proposed Police permanent structure, the Club be requested
       to provide the proposed First-A id permanent structure in the 1980 close season,
       subject to the d u b agreeing to provide the recommended equipment immediately;

(e)   that M essrs. Eastwood and Partners be advised that the alterations to the
 |    previously agreed barrier arrangement in the North Stand set out in their letter
       dated 14th August cannot be agreed, the alternative to their suggestions being
      the retention of the 1.1 metre height (as recommended by the Guide) in line

 Dear Sirs,
                                                        Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
                                                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club L t d .
                                                        Certificate of Ground Safety
                    Further to yesterday's telephone conversation with
Mr. Sherriffwe have pleasure in enclosing a sketch showing
 the proposed alterations to the landings and barriers in the
North Stand.
                    We have found that the arrangement previously discussed
 and agreed obscures the vision of too many spectators and so
                                                      J
 severely restricts access to one row for it to be acceptable.
 It is now the intention to install a much simpler barrier, with
 no returns and with the top of the rail 900itun above the landing.
                    You will of course appreciate the urgency attached to
 resolving this detail.                                                               Your earliest canments would be
welcomed, preferably over the telephone.


                                                                                               Yours faithfully,

 Dear Sir,
                                             Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
                                             Sheffield United Football Club Ltd
                We are presently invdived in the design of a new security
 fence around three sides of the pitch at Bramall Lane.                                                                                        We
 have today received a copy of your letter dated 10 May 1979
 addressed to the Club Secretary suggesting we consult with you
 on proposed improvements.
                For this purpose we have pleasure in enclosing four copies
 of our preliminary drawings 1917/1, 2, 3 and 4.                                                                                     Perhaps you
 would be kind enough to add any comments to one set of the
 prints and return them to this office.
                We will of course be pleased to discuss our proposals
 preferably at the ground if you so wish.
                Our client has stipulated that the fence should be erected
 by mid December 1979.                                                             The site work will probably take eight
 weeks and we would therefore expect to issue tender documents

          E arlier in the year I wrote to the South Yorkshire Football Clubs pointing out
          the desirability of consulting the County Council on any ground alterations or
          improvements in an effort to obviate the possibility of such alterations or
          improvements needing further work to m eet the requirements of the A ct when
          their grounds are designated. I would add that it was str esse d that this procedure
          would be additional to any planning or building bye-law approvals which it might
          be n ecessary for the Clubs to seek .

          I have sent under separate cover copy of a letter dated 25th July and plans
          received from M essrs. Eastwood and Partners acting as Consulting Engineers
          to the Sheffield United Football Club L td ., relating to a new security fence around
          three sides of the pitch at Bram all Lane.

          As d iscussed with A ssistan t Divisional Officer Seaman of your office, a meeting
          of the Officer Working Party for the Sheffield D istrict has been arranged for
          10.00 a .m . on Wednesday, 15th August at the Town Hall, Sheffield, to discuss
          the proposals.

          As we are approaching >eertifi cation, I would also suggest that the opportunity be
          taken to review the position relating to the Sheffield Wednesday ground.

2.      The use of a double pole switch connecting the emergency lighting
         system to some essential lighting circuit e .g . bar lights is strongly
         recommended thereby ensuring that the emergency lighting is always
         switched on.
Fire Warning System

The suitability and type of system to be decided when further discussions have
taken place.

Fire Extinguishers

Fire fighting hand appliances are to be installed where indicated by a triangle
on the attached plan. The colour of the triangle determines the type of
appliance required. (Please see attached legend). It may be that equipment
is already provided in the building, and the plan shows the final complement
of appliances.

Two gallon water extinguishers to be wall mounted so that the handle is
approximately one metre from floor lev el. The 5lb. dry powder extinguishers
and glass fibre blanket to be wall mounted, the extinguishers being mounted at
approximately light switch lev el.

General Fire Precautions

      the point adjacent to the escape route from the counter area.

3.    Quantities of waste paper were discovered under the seating In the
      stand. This should be removed and placed in a satisfactory storage
      area.

Training of Safety Stewards and Staff

precautions they will be expected to administer, a meeting should be arranged
with the Fire Service, suitable to all parties.

Notices - Exit Signs

1.     These signs to have suitable sized white lettering on a green background,
       the size of lettering to be agreed on site.

       The position of the exit signs are indicated on the plans by a green
       rectangle containing the letter 'E'.

2.     If the proposed rewiring of the emergency lighting system Is adopted
       as discussed by Mr. Clough and Divisional Officer Jones then, with the
        reduced lighting output, It may be necessary to provide a number of
       illuminated exit boxes.
Emergency Procedure

Emergency procedure notices should be placed at strategic points throughout
the ground.

A ccess for Emergency Vehicles

1.       Adequate roads should be provided to ensure that speedy and direct
         access can be obtained by emergency vehicles to all exterior parts of
         the stadium.

2.       Ensure that parked vehicles will not obstruct emergency vehicles on
         these access roads.

Public Address System

The existing public address system to be upgraded, with the P olice having an
over-ride facility from their P olice Room.

P olice Facilities

A suitable permanent Police Room (with facilities as shown on the sketch plan
marked AA ) to be provided in the 1980 close season.

F irst Aid Facilities

(i)      Structure

         The existing facilities are considered to be below an acceptable standard
         and it is suggested the Club consider providing a more permanent
         structure which is not likely to require up-grading for a very long tim e.
         The internal finish, particularly of the Treatment area, should be of an
         impervious nature so that it can be easily cleaned and rendered fairly
         sterile and require no decoration. This can be achieved by the use of
         tiles or formica type finish e t c .. . .

 (ii)    Waiting Area

          The Waiting Area could be arranged within corridor space to minimise
          the cost, where sitting cases could wait for attention on chairs.

 (iii)   Treatment Area

          The Treatment Area should be sufficient to accommodate two or three
          patients at any one tim e, and consideration should be given to the needs
          for privacy within the treatment area, bearing in mind that the three
          patients may well be lying on couches.
(iv)     Lighting

         Good lighting is essential and strip lighting would be satisfactory. The
         provision of a power point would also be a basic requirement.

(v)      Water

         A supply of hot and cold water is essential; the cold water suitable
         for drinking. A hand basin and a large Belfast type sink should also
         be provided. The Club might consider whether it would be cheaper in
         the long run to provide stainless steel basins which are not subject to
         chipping.

(vi)     Toilet Requirements

         The Club should provide at least one male and one female toilet, for
         the use of the public, and should consider whether they should provide
         an additional toilet for the use of the staff.

(vii)    Storage

         Storage facilities are required for six stretchers, and for two sets of
         wheels for stretchers, blankets and other bed linen. This storage should
         be lockable.

(viii)   Equipment

         The following is a minimum lis t to provide a basic service

         Treatment couches with lift up ends, two or three in number depending
         on space available and/or number of cubicles, if the accommodation is
         cubicled.

         Six Stretchers.
         Two sets of stretcher w heels.
         20 Blankets .
         Six P illow s.
         One Minute-Man Resuscitator.

(ix)     Telephone F acilities

         A telephone facility would appear to be basic in 1979. This could be
         achieved by an extension from the main switch, or by sharing with
         police.
✓
 *

          (x)       Car Parking

                    The Club might also consider what facilities could be extended to the
                    St. John’s personnel for the parking of staff cars.

     S.   Crowd Capacity

          The following numbers will be considered to be satisfactory, provided that the
          recommended work as detailed above is carried out:-

                 Spion Kop                      16,850
                 South Stand Upper               5, 567
                 South Stand Lower               3, 310
                 West Stand                      4,465
                 West Terrace                    7, 200
                 North West Terrace              2, 900
                 North Stand                     9,882

                    Total Crowd Capacity        50,174

         duration emergency lighting system conforming to BS 5266 Part 1 1975 -
         'The Emergency Lighting of P rem ises'.

2.      The use of a double pole switch connecting the emergency lighting
         system to some essential lighting circuit e .g . bar lights is strongly
         recommended thereby ensuring that the emergency lighting is always
         switched on.
Fire Warning System

The suitability and type of system to be decided when further discussions have
taken place.

F ire Extinguishers

Fire fighting hand appliances are to be installed where indicated by a triangle
on the attached plan. The colour of the triangle determines the type of
appliance required. (Please see attached legend). It may be that equipment
is already provided in the building, and the plan shows the final complement
of appliances.

Two gallon water extinguishers to be wall mounted so that the handle is
approximately one metre from floor level. The 5lb. dry powder extinguishers
and glass fibre blanket to be wall mounted, the extinguishers being mounted at
approximately light switch level.

General Fire Precautions

1.     All w alls and ceilings inside the stands and along escape routes to be
       class 'O'surface spread of flame.

2.     Provide isolating valves on the pipeline leading to the gas cookers at
       the point adjacent to the escape route from the counter area.

3.     Quantities of waste paper w ere discovered under the seating in the
       stand. This should be removed and placed in a satisfactory storage
       area.

Training of Safety Stewards and Staff

To ensure that the Safety Stewards and Staff are conversant with the safety
precautions they will be expected to administer, a meeting should be arranged
with the Fire Service, suitable to all parties.

Notices - Exit Signs

1.     These signs to have suitable sized white lettering on a green background,
       the siz e of lettering to be agreed on site.

       The position of the exit signs are indicated on the plans by a green
       rectangle containing the le tte r 'E '.

2.     If the proposed rewiring of the emergency lighting system is adopted
       as discussed by Mr. Clough and Divisional Officer Jones then, with the
        reduced lighting output, it may be necessary to provide a number of
       illuminated exit boxes.
Emergency Procedure

Emergency procedure notices should be placed at strategic points throughout
the ground.

A ccess for Emergency Vehicles

1.      Adequate roads should be provided to ensure that speedy and direct
        access can be obtained by emergency vehicles to all exterior parts of
        the stadium.

2.      Ensure that parked vehicles will not obstruct emergency vehicles on
        these access roads.

Public Address System

The existing public address system to be upgraded, with the Police having an
over-ride facility from their P olice Room.

P olice Facilities

A suitable permanent Police Room (with facilities as shown on the sketch plan
marked AA ) to be provided in the 1980 close season.

F irst Aid Facilities

(i)     Structure

        The existing facilities are considered to be below an acceptable standard
        and it is suggested the Club consider providing a more permanent
        structure which is not likely to require up-grading for a very long tim e.
        The internal finish, particularly of the Treatment area, should be of an
        impervious nature so that it can be easily cleaned and rendered fairly
        sterile and require no decoration. This can be achieved by the use of
        tiles or formica type finish e t c .. . .

(ii)    Waiting Area

        The Waiting Area could be arranged within corridor space to minimise
        the cost, where sitting cases could wait for attention on chairs.

(iii)   Treatment Area

        The Treatment Area should be sufficient to accommodate two or three
        patients at any one tim e, and consideration should be given to the needs
        for privacy within the treatment area, bearing in mind that the three
        patients may well be lying on couches.
(iv)     Lighting

         Good lighting is essential and strip lighting would be satisfactory. The
         provision of a power point would also be a basic requirement.

(v)      Water

         A supply of hot and cold water is essential; the cold water suitable
         for drinking. A hand basin and a large Belfast type sink should also
         be provided. The Club might consider whether it would be cheaper in
         the long run to provide stainless steel basins which are not subject to
         chipping.

(v0      Toilet Requirements

         The Club should provide at least one male and one female toilet, for
         the use of the public, and should consider whether they should provide
         an additional toilet for the use of the staff.

(vii)    Storage

         Storage facilities are required for six stretchers, and for two sets of
         wheels for stretchers, blankets and other bed linen. This storage should
         be lockable.

(viii)   Equipment

         The following is a minimum list to provide a basic service

         Treatment couches with lift up ends, two or three in number depending
         on space available and/or number of cubicles, if the accommodation is
         cubicled.

         Six Stretchers.
         Two sets of stretcher wheels.
         20 Blankets.
         Six P illow s.
         One Minute-Man Resuscitator.

(ix)     Telephone F acilities

         A telephone facility would appear to be basic in 1979. This could be
         achieved by an extension from the main switch, or by sharing with
         police.
(x )   Car Parking

       The Club might also consider what facilities could be extended to the
       St. John's personnel for the parking of staff cars.

Crowd Capacity

1.     P ro g ress

It was recalled that following the meeting with the Club on 18th April,
1979, the detailed comments of all of the disciplines represented on
the Working Party had been collated into a schedule and forwarded
form ally to the Club by letter dated 8th June, 1979. A copy of this
schedule had also been forwarded to each Member of the Working
Party for information.

This had been followed by a letter dated 21st June, 1979 from the
Club's Consultants (M essrs. Eastwood and Partners) requesting the
views of the Working Party on drawings n o s. 1610/1XD, 2XB, 4, 5,
7C, 12XA, 13B, 14B and 16-41 inclu sive. The letter also stated
that work installing new crush barriers was progressing, and that
tenders had been invited for the construction of new em ergency exits,
alterations to existing sta ircases and repairs to existing reinforced
concrete m em bers and terracing.

2.     Purpose of Meeting

In order to ensure consistency of views the Working Party considered
the drawings forwarded by Eastwood and P artn ers.

3.     Conclusions

IT WAS AGREED:-

(a)    that, subject to satisfactory standards of workmanship and
and structural and stability checks, the proposals w ere
generally acceptable;

that the Building Authority, the F ire Service and the P olice
would make a site inspection later in the day to check on the
following specific matters -

(i)     the strength and number of hinges on the exit gate
        on the south side of the Spion Kop, which should open
        outwards under the supervision of a steward and be
        kept c le a r on its outside;

(ii)    the step arrangement on the vom itories to the North
        Stand;

(iii)   the possibility of inserting two steps before the bend
        on the new escape at the southern end of the West
        Stand to obviate the apparent headroom problem;
                                                3 n
that, as an alternative to Superlux m aterial, /^" plasterboard
with 3 /ie " skim on both sid es be regarded as acceptable as
nominal 1 hour fire resistance in view of the actual use made of
the area below the South Stand;

that the comments of the Working Party on the proposals be
forwarded to the Consultants by means of marked plans with
any more detailed comment to be contained in the covering
le tte r from the County Council.

Dear Sirs,
                                     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club L t d .
                                                             Certificate of Ground Safety
               We have been very concerned to find that the length of
wall in the South stand for which you have requested 'one
hour fire resistance' is considerably greater than we had been
led to believe would be requested.                                                                        This is particularly serious
for the Club because we find the Superlux material which was
proposed as the external leaf on each side of the existing
walls is enormously expensive.                                                            It is therefore going to be
necessary to demolish all these walls and rebuild.
               This is embarrassing both to us and to the Club because
estimates of cost on which their application for a grant was
based are now likely to be exceeded and extra grant may not
be forthcoming.
               We are preparing detailed proposals and a cost estimate
for the Club's consideration at the end of next week but in
the meantime, I thought you should know the serious concern
which has been expressed and that the Club is highly likely to
wish to have the whole matter re-opened.


                                                                                         Yours faithfully,

             Attached for your use is a Note of the further meeting held with the Sheffield
             Wednesday Football Club Ltd. on 18th April, 1979.

             Whilst informal meetings c h i technical points must obviously take place la the
             first instance, I feel we must bear in mind that we are approaching the stage
             when the County Council (as Certifying Authority) w ill have to pat formaHf to
             the Club in writing detai Is of the requirements to be imposed.

             With this in mind, no doubt you w ill let me have as soon as practicable details
             of the requirements which you would wish to see imposed, J w ill then
             circulate these to the other members of the Working Party, following whteh
             it may w ell be necessary to call a meeting of the Working Party to finalise
             the detailed requirements.

             Once the exact form of the certificate and the requirements have been
             determined, it will, of course, be necessary to seek the approval of the Fire
             Service Committee to them before the certificate can be issued.

Note of a meeting between the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) and the
                  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.

           Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield: 18th April, 1979

PRESENT:      Representing the Club

              Dr. W. Eastwood (Consultant)
              E. England (Secretary)
              H. E. McGee (Chairman)
              R. Whitehead (Director)

               Representing the Working Party

              F.   Davis (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
              D.   Hurst (South Yorkshire Police)
              K.   Jones (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
              A.   Mills (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
              W.   O'Neill (South Yorkshire Police)
              D.   Sherriff(City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
              D.   J. Shirtcliffe (South Yorkshire County Council - Admin. Dept.)
              D.   I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council - Admin. Dept.)

Apologies for absence were received from Dr. H. Bailey (Sheffield Area Health
Authority) and H. E. Wright (South Yorkshire County Fire Service).

The Note (previously circulated) of the meeting held on 2ndApril, 1979, was considered
in conjunction with a Note (circulated at the meeting) of a meeting between Eastwood
and Partners, the South Yorkshire County Fire Service and the City of Sheffield
Metropolitan D istrict Council Building Surveyor’s Department held on 13th April, 1979.

The Note of the meeting held on 2nd April, 1979, was agreed, subject to the following
amendments and additions in the light of the further investigations and discussions

2A     Spion Kop

Paras. 1 & 2 - Revised copies of drawing no. 1610/IX were circulated at the meeting
showing the proposed new crush barrier layout, including the two lines of radial
barriers. This was AGREED in principle.

Para. 3 - A 16, 850 crowd capacity on the Kop a s existing would mean an unacceptable
evacuation time of some 1 2 i minutes. Larger and re-aligned gates in the barrier
and improvement of the existing upper exit could reduce this time to some 10 minutes,
but 8 minutes could only be achieved by installing a new exit of 3 metre overall width.
This could be integrated into the proposed future scheme for enlarging and roofing the
Kop. The Club AGREED to give consideration to the proposals.
Para. 4 - The exploratory work regarding the improvement of the headroom had
still to be carried out, but was not expected to be a major item.

Para. 5 - Because of the difficulty in devising a suitable method of testing in places
(such as the top of the Kop), it was AGREED that proposals should be formulated
after further discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

Para. 6 - The Club accepted that the concrete required attention and that the scoreboard
structure should be looked at. It was AGEEED that the question of the height of some
of the crush barriers be considered again after it was seen which of them failed on
testing.                                                                     >

Para. 7 - The Club stressed that their proposals for the improvement of the means of
eg ress would hopefully be carried out in the shorter rather than the longer term future.

Para. 8 - The Club hoped that the testing of the existing crush barriers, together with
the installation of the new crush barrier layout and alteration of the gates in the existi^ ^
barrier, eould all be carried out in the close season. Their aim was to achieve a
16, 850 crowd capacity.

2B     West Terrace

Para. 2 - The Club accepted that in view of the cro ss-fall on the north.-west corner
exit, the steps should be re-built. It was AGEEED that the other matters would be
considered again after it was seen which of the crush barriers failed on testing.

2C     North West Corner Terrace

Para. 2 - Whilst accepting the need for the improvement or replacement of the
existing corrugated sheeting, the Club felt they wished to consider whether to carry
out more extensive works so as to bring the existing unused area into use for an
additional 250/300 spectators.

3.     North Stand

Para. 1 - Dr. Eastwood, the Building Surveyors and the Fire Service had reached
agreement on a scheme which could be recommended to the Club. This would
involve the removal of 10 seats from each of the 9 gangways and 4 seats from in
front of each of the 9 upper exits. The result would mean a loss of 126 seats
compared to the 225 in the original proposals. The Club AGREED to give
consideration to the proposal.

Para. 2 - The word at the end of the first line should have been 'Tea' and not 'Team'.
It w as AGREED that Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service would discuss in detail any
fire protection works considered to be necessary.
4.     West Stand

The Club AGREED that additional exits o f simple steel construction should be
provided from each end of the upper stand.

5.     South Stand

Para. 1 - The bases of two stanchions had been exposed by removing floor timber.
Whilst rusting was not excessive, it was AGREED that all bases would be exposed for
inspection and, if necessary, steel plating will be welded to any corroded parts before
encasing in concrete for permanent protection. Because of the apparent accumulation
of waste paper, wood shavings and cigarette ends beneath the floor boards, the
Club also AGREED that the space beneath the timber floor should be cleaned out.

Para. 2 - Provided the penning barriers were removed entirely, it was AGREED that
it would not be necessary to remove any seats for escape purposes in the upper part
of the stand (the covered area).

Para. 3 - It was AGREED that timber handrails should be provided down each of the
outer edges of the main stairGaffiey that the existing iron centre railing shoild remain,
and that a new handrail down the centre of each side of the stairway should be installed.
It was also AGREED that the brick staircase walls should be buttressed where crowd
surge pressure could be generated.

Para. 4 - So far as the front open air part of the stand was concerned, it was AGREED
that on the west side a new exit through a new 1 .2 metre wide door adjacent to the existing
snack bar should be provided, with appropriate fire resistance m easures in the
surrounding area. On the east side, consideration was given to an extension of the
footway at the front of the stand and the removal of the wall, provided the new exit was
isolated from the Kop exit. It was AGREED that Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service
should consider precisely what m easures could be considered satisfactory so as to
avoid any loss of seats.

6.     Ground Exits

The 1:500 site plan was in the process of being circulated.

7.      Communications

The Club stressed they were thinking in terms of an upgrading of the existing public
address sy stem . It was AGREED that the Police should have an over-ride facility
from their Police Room, and Dr. Eastwood undertook to look into the possibility of
achieving this through radio, rather than wire, means.

8*      Police and F irst A id Facilities

P aras. 1 & 2 - The Police stressed that it was essential that there was no gap in
the provision of Police Facilities when the temporary structure was replaced by
the permanent structure. With this in mind, they were happy for the safety aspects
to receive first priority and to wait for the 1980 close season for the work to be
carried out. It was understood that Dr. Eailey had not yet completed his investigations
Into the first-aid and medical facilities.

9*     Any other Topics

The evening of the 27th April was agreed as mutually convenient to test the existing
emergency lighting equipment.

10.    Future Action

Mr, McGee stressed that it was essential for decisions to be taken urgently if the
Club were to complete their plans, both from a. financial and practical point of view.

The Club were to make application for financial assistance under the Football
Association's Ground Improvement Scheme, and had to have over 50, 000 crowd
capacity if the aim of attracting international matches was to be achieved. The la te sW i
proposals, if implemented, appeared to give a-capacity of some 50,750.

So that they could be noted and returned for agreement, the Working Party asked for
2 copies of all plans (as revised) to be supplied by Dr. Eastwood, especially to the
Fire Service and the Building Surveyor.

Mr. McGee requested that he be advised if it appeared that any undue delay was
occurring as the Club wished to ensure that the certification procedure proceeded without
delay.                                                                     •

                  South Stand

    1.                  The fire-services officer proposed a new exit from the
                  front terracing under the stand and through a new 1.2m wide
                  door adjacent to the existing snack bar.                                                   Wall surrounding
                  this area to have 1 hour fire resistance.                                                  Existing doors
                  to be self closing with 1 hour fire resistance.
    2   .               The fire officers requested that all walls enclosing
                  offices, lounges, bars and the press box have 1 hours fire
                  resistance.                         It was agreed by Building Surveyors representatives
                  that the existing construction could be upgraded by forming
                  a sandwich using *Supertex’ or a similar product.

                        Mr. Jones is to send to Eastwood and Partners a copy
                  of South Stand seating plan showing his proposals for removing
                  seats to increase the capacity of gangways after dividing
                  barriers are removed.

EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




            Mr. Mills requested that the brick staircase walls be
      buttressed where crowd surge pressure could be generated.
       (At a later inspection the location of these buttresses
      was agreed). Handrails to be added as was agreed at the
      meeting on 2 April.

           Prior to the meeting the bases of two stanchions had
      been exposed by removing floor timber.     Rusting is not
      excessive.    All bases will be exposed for inspection.     If
      necessary steel plating will be welded to any corroded parts
      before encasing in concrete for permanent protection.
           In inspecting the two bases,waste paper, and shavings
      of wood together with cigarette ends were found in considerable
      quantities beneath the floor boards.    The club to be advised
      that the space beneath the timber floor should be cleaned out.

      North Stand
6*         It was agreed to recommend to the club that 10 seats
      would be removed from each of the 9 gangways and 4 seats
      from in front of each of the 9 upper exits.    The total
      number of seats lost is therefore 126 compared with 225
      in the original proposals.


      Spion Kop
T.         Eastwood and Partners to send revised copies of drawing
      number 1610/1X showing the new crush barrier layout including
      two lines of radial barriers to Mr. Mills and Mr. Jones
      for their comments.
8*         Eastwood's proposals for improving the existing upper
     Exit from Spion Kop agreed in principle as shown on drawing
      1610/12.    The dividing handrail on the ramp will be taken
     past the whole of the first staircase.
9.        The Building Surveyors representative asked that the
     scoreboard structure be surveyed with particular reference
     to stability under wind loading.

1.    Scope and Objectives of Discussions

Mr. H. E. McGee welcomed the representatives, and stressed that the Club were
ambitious and wanted to make the Stadium the best in Europe, Crowds had been
averaging 11,000 this season and, viewed purely as a football operation, the Club
had been losing money since 1967. Commercial ventures had made the Club
viable, and it was hoped to expand this side of the Club’s activities. The Club’s
eventual ambitions obviously had to be tempered by practical considerations.

IT WAS AGREED-

1.    That, whilst Designating Orders did not specify time lim its for the issue of
General Safety Certificates, it was essential to aim for the Certificate to be issued
by the start of the 1979/80 Season.
2.    That, a s the Club wanted to attract representative gam es, the aim should
be for the Stadium to be certificated for maximum crowds.

3.    That as much work a s possible should be carried out in the close season,
bearing in mind that because of the recent continuous spell of bad weather, this
will be more restricted than usual. The Annual Jehovah's Witness Rally had
also to be borne in mind.

2.    Discussion on Standing Areas

A.    Spion Kop

IT WAS AGREED-

1.    That the siting and angle of the new barriers to be installed be the subject
of detailed discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

2.    That the Club consider the installation of simple lateral barriers (not of the
climb proof type) for crowd control purposes in the blocks on either side of the
central block (but not so a s to obstruct the gangways).

3.     That, in view of the clearance time of I l f minutes compared with the
8 minutes specified in the Guide, the means of escape be discussed in detail
between Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service (including the re-siting of the gates
in the existing barriers and, possibly the widening of the existing gates and/or
an increase in their number).

4.   That the headroom at the North end under the bridge be increased to the
maximum possible without going to the extent of underpinning.

5.    That representative parts of the concrete wall and boundary posts and fences
be tested to the appropriate standards.

6.    That the condition, of the concrete at the lower end, the height of some of the
crush barriers and the scoreboard structure be the subject of detailed discussions
between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

7.   That the Club's longer term proposals for the Improvement of the means of
egress be unanimously welcomed.

8.    That the maximum capacity of the Spion Kop be determined after the foregoing
points have been resolved.
        B.    West Terrace

        IT WAS AGREED -

        1.    That the Club’s proposals for the installation of additional barriers and the
        reduction in capacity to 7,200 spectators without the need for additional gangways
        should be implemented.

        2.     That the question of the cro ss-fa ll on the steps on the north-west corner
        exit, the height of some of the existing crush barriers, as well as their corrosion
        and sharp edges in places, be the subject of detailed discussion between
        Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

        C.    North West Corner Terrace

        IT WAS AGREED -

        1.    That the Clubs proposals to bring the crush barriers up to standard and
        supplemented by new barriers with a consequent capacity of 2,900 spectators should
        be implemented.

        2.    That the improvement or replacement of the existing corrugated sheeting be
        the subject of detailed discussion between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

        3.    North Stand

        IT WAS AGREED -

        1.     That, in view of the obvious difference of opinion between the Club and the
        Working Party as to the appropriate steps (if any) to be taken over the width of the
    s
        existing gangways, both sides be requested to consider all the points made, and
        to re-consider the matter at the next meeting.

        2.    That the question of fire protection works to the Store Room and to the Team
        Room be the subject of detailed discussions between Dr, Eastwood and the
        Fire Service.

        3.     That the replacement (from a fire hazard point of view) of the existing Police
        and First-Aid Temporary Structures under the Stand be accepted in principle, and
        that the facilities required in the new permanent structures be considered later in
        the Agenda.

        4.    That the existing Wire Mesh barriers under the Stand be the subject of
v
        discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service.

        5.   That the question of the provision of handrails be the subject of discussions
        between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.
                                                 3.
4.   West Stand

IT WAS AGREED -

That, whilst the upper level of the Stand can be emptied in the required time,
consideration be given to reducing the congestion which may occur in the lower
level by examining the possibility of erecting an additional stairway at each
end of the Stand (possibly of the Fire Escape type for emergency use, rather
than for normal use).

5.    South Stand

IT WAS AGREED -

1.     That Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor discuss in detail the apparent
spaiiing of the concrete frame at high levels, apparent corrosion of the main
steelwork columns, removal of the timber casing at base level for inspection (2
only as representative sample), and load testing of a representative sample of
single and double skin walls.

2.    That, to overcome the means of escape problems in the upper part of the
Stand (the covered area), the existing barriers be removed altogether, the Club
to deal with any problems about different admission charges by way of coloured
seats or some such alternative.

3.    That Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service discuss the methods of upgrading the
fire resistance in the central area, protected escape routes, and the provision of
handrails down the stairways.

4.    That the means of escape problems in the front open air part of the stand
be dealt with on the West side by making an additional exit for emergency use only
through the Tea Bar wall to the foot of the existing stairway, and that on the east
side consideration be given to providing an addi tional gangway to exit on to the
derelict land adjoining the Spion Kop. j

5.    That no immediate answer seemed to be available with regard to a possible
limitation on the use of the car park behind the Stand by entitled persons immediately
before a match, even though police had control of its use after a match.

6.    Ground Exits

Dr. Eastwood apologised that the 1:500 site plan had, unknown to him, not been
already supplied some time ago. He undertook to ensure that copies were
circulated without delay.
7.     Communications

IT WAS AGREED That consideration would be given to the Installation of an
improved public address system, with the Police having a ccess to its control
from their Control Room, together with its use as a fire alarm system, subject
to an emergency back-up system in the event of failure.

8.     Police and F irst Aid F acilities

IT WAS AGREED -

1.     That the Club accept the principle of permanently contructed Police and
F irst Aid Facilities.

2.     That the Police would supply the Club Secretary with a copy of their Initial
sketch plan showing the facilities they wished to see, and that Dr. Bailey would
Inspect the existing first-aid and medical facilities and then discuss future
facilities with Dr. Eastwood.

9.     Any other Topics

IT WAS AGREED That Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service discuss the existing
and any proposed emergency generating and fire-fighting equipment.
                                           )
10.    Future Action

The Club stressed that they wished to carry out as much work as possible before
the issue of the Certificate by the start of the 1979/80 Season. If this was to be done,
it was essential that any points for discussion between the various representatives
of the Working Party and Dr. Eastwood had to be cleared without delay.

 11.   Date of Next Meeting

 IT WAS AGREED That the next meeting should be held at 2.30 p .m . on
 Wednesday, 18th April, 1979, at the Stadium.

1.       Purpose of Meeting

Following the postponement of the meeting with the Club because of adverse
weather and the difficulty in agreeing a mutually convenient alternative
date, the purpose of the meeting was to review the position since 12th February,
1979, prior to the re-arranged meeting with the Club which was now to take
place on 2nd April, 1979.

2.       Plans

The plans at 1:500 scale and indicating all site fixtures were, it was still understood,
to be supplied by Eastwood & Partners at the meeting with the Club.

3.       Report
(a)      General

The County Council had contacted the Home Office, but had been given little
information additional to that contained in their various Circulars. Basically,
they had said that any new work or reconstruction had to be to a standard not
lower than that set out in the Guide. However, the maximum flexibility had
to be maintained in the case of existing structures and differences in such
matters as age, size and mode of construction had to be taken into account.

The Fire Service had contacted four other Brigades with designated grounds,
and only in one case had the recommendations of the Guide been strictly
adhered to.

                                   1.
         Spion Kop (pages 2, 3 & 4)

Additional to the points mentioned on 12th February, 1979, concern was
expressed by the Building Authority as to the general maintenance of the Kop
and the loosfe and broken concrete at the bottom in particular. If attention
was not given to this, it was AGREED that it would be necessary to restrict
admission to the Kop, additional to the restriction to 11,040 if the extra
exits are not provided.

On the question of exits, it was again AGREED that it was essential to line
up the gates in the existing barrier with the gangways. Of the existing two
exits, concern was expressed as to the effect of the right-angled turn on
the embankment at the exit at the rear. After discussion, it was AGREED
that the best compromise was to leave things as they existed, provided
handrails are provided on the stairways, taking into account the
desirability of maintaining a smooth flow.

The Fire Service queried the exact form of the lateral separation discussed
at the meeting on 12th February, 1979, as this would naturally have a
bearing on the means of escape recommendations. After discussion, it
was AGREED that the metal fences should not be of the climb-proof type,
that it was not intended that they should obstruct the gangways, and that
in consequence the padlocked gateway recommendation should be dropped.
However, it was AGREED that it was still desirable to seek 3 x 2 central
barriers but, if the Club really resisted the suggestion, 2 x 2 could
reluctantly be conceded. The Building Authority stressed that whatever
barriers were provided would have to pass the appropriate strain tests.

The fact that the height of many of the existing crush barriers was below the
recommendation in the Guide, in some cases well below, was pointed out by the
Building Authority. The corrosion point mentioned at the last meeting was
also reiterated. It was AGREED that these points must be drawn to the
Club’s attention, as must the condition of the Score Board Structure.

(c)      The West Terrace (pages 4 & 5)

As well as the condition of the crush barriers mentioned at the last meeting,
the Building Authority drew attention to the poor condition in places of the
terracing in small areas near to the stand. The cross-fa ll on the steps on
the north-west corner exit would also require attention as it tended to throw
people forward. The height of the crush barriers mentioned in regard to the
Spion Kop also applied. It was AGREED that all these points must be drawn
to the Club’s attention.

(d)      The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace (pages 5 & 6)

Having now had the opportunity of having a closer look at the existing corrugated
sheeting, the Building Authority confirmed that it would require alteration to
meet the requirements of the Guide.
A

    (e)      The North Stand (pages 8 & 7)

    The removal of a row of seats from the top of the stand down each gangway
    to the upper exits and the removal of four seats at those exits was
    confirmed as being a reasonable compromise to put to the Club.

    As the asbestos sheets at the top of the stand were protected, the Building
    Authority felt that these could be accepted, and confirmed that the glazing
    at the ends of the stands was not glass and so would not shatter.

    (f)      The West Stand (page 7)

    Consideration was given to the Building Authority's suggestion of lateral
    gangways and the segregation of exits but, after discussion,t it was AGREED
    that the additional staircase agreed at the last meeting should be confirmed.
    So long as it was of 4-unit exit width, it was AGREED it was not necessary
    to in sist it should be on the south-west corner. Such staircases could be
    bought "off the peg" and, if not installed in the close season, it was
    AGREED that a J reduction in capacity would be necessary.

    (g)      The South Stand (pages 7 & 8)

    As mentioned at the last meeting, the penning arrangements of the seating
    and the numbers of seats in the rows caused problems. Bearing in mind the
    need for reasonableness and to make the situation better, it was AGREED
    that, even though not strictly in accordance with the Guide, that the best
    compromise was to seek the removal of the existing barriers and their
    re-alignment, together with the widening of the gangways at the position
    of the wings.

    The Fire Service pointed out and it was AGREED that Fire Resisting Doors
    would be required leading to the D irectors’ seating, and 1 hour fire
    resistance would be required for all problem areas under the stand. This
    could be reduced to | hour if automatic detection equipment were to be
    installed.

    For their part, the Building Authority reiterated their concern as to the
    corrosion of the steelwork of the stand, and also pointed out the concrete
    spalling which was occurring. Again, the likelihood of the balustrading,
    barriers and guardrails needing to be reinforced or replaced was mentioned.
    It was AGREED all would need to be given attention by the Club.

    (h)      General Requirements (pages 8 & 9)

    As well as the Fire Service pointing out that the present temporary
    structures used for police and first-aid purposes would need removal
    from a means of escape point of view if the capacity of the North Stand


                                       3   .
was not to be reduced, the P olice stated that they were ready to discuss
with the Club the facilities they would require. Briefly, they envisaged
a permanent structure alm ost twice as large as the existing temporary
structure, and expected communications, detention, toilet, parade room,
e t c ., fa c ilitie s.

So far as F irst-A id was concerned, the Sheffield Area Health Authority
had confirmed their willingness to provide advice on F irst-A id and
Medical F acilities, but the person nominated (Dr. H. Bailey - Specialist
in Community Medicine (Social Services)) was on holiday until
2nd April, 1979. He had been invited to the meeting, with the Club on
2nd April, but it was recognised that possible practical difficulties might
prevent his doing so.

           I refer to my minute of 5th March, 1979, and to the recent telephone
           conversations between Mr. D. Vaughan of my staff and Divisional Officer
           K. Jones of your Fire Prevention Seefion.

           Following the return from holiday o f the Chairman of the Sheffield Wednesday
           Football Club L td., the Club Secretary informed me that the SOth March,
           1979 was not convenient. That meeting has, therefore, now been arranged
           for 2 .30 p .m . on Monday, 2nd April, 1979, after conferring with the members
           of ttte Working Party.

           However, because of evident differences of opinion on means of escape,

          As you are aware, the extremely adverse weather and road conditions
          necessitated the postponement of the meeting with the Sheffield Wednesday
          Football Club originally arranged for 16th February, 1979.

          The* Club suggested the 21st March, 1979 as an alternative date, but this'was
          not convenient to a number of Working Party representatives. It has not been
          possible to reach agreement on an alternative earlier date, as the Club's
          Chairman is on holiday until then.

          The date currently being considered is Friday, 30th March, 1979 at Hillsborough
          at 10.00 a .m . but evidently this cannot be confirmed by tie Club until their
          Chairman returns from holiday on the 21st March.

          Perhaps your representatives would note the 30th March provisionally in their
          diaries, and I will confirm it as sooij as possible.

           Further to my memo dated 10th January, 197$, I understand that the Secretary of
           the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. has forwarded direct to you a copy
           of the Report of Eastwood and Partners and copies of plansnumbered 1610/1 to 1610/10
           inclusive and an area plan.

           The date of 16th February mentioned by the Club for a farther meeting is convenient
           to my representatives, and perhaps you would let me know whether it is a ls o
           convenient to your representatives.

            As mentioned In the copy letter attached to my memo of 10th January, I feel it is
            essential for the officers of each discipline involved to first meet jointly to discuss -•
            any problems and present a single view to the Club. Perhaps you would tfetephone
            Mr. D. Vaughan of my staff (Extension 412) to arrange a mutually convenient
          *d a te for the officer meeting prior to the 16th February.

            I have written sim ilarly to the Chief Constable and the Chief Building Surveyor,

1.     Purpose o f M eeting

Following the Working Party's meeting with the representatives of the
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. on 13th December, 1978, the
Secretary of the Club had (by letter dated 22nd January, 1979) circulated a
Report, together with Plans, drawn up by Dr. W. Eastwood of Eastwood
and Partners. The Secretary had also suggested a meeting on Friday,
16th February, 1979, to discuss the documents.

The purpose of today's meeting was to consider the views which the Working
Party should put to the Club on the 16th February.

2.____ Plans

(a)    Whilst the "Notes for the Guidance of Applicants" stated that detailed
plans at 1:100 scale should be supplied of all buildings and other accommodation
for spectators, some of the plans supplied were to 1:200 scale. The Fire
Service felt that the latter size were acceptable provided all of the plans were
to the same scale, and it was AGREED that the "Notes for the Guidance of
Applicants" should be amended to read plans to 1:200 scale.

(b)    The site plan at 1:500 scale had not been supplied as required by the
Notes, but Eastwood and Partners had undertaken to prepare this in time for
Friday's meeting. The firm had also promised that all site fixtures would be
Indicated on that plan.
(c)     It w as AGREED thatthe plans supplied hadinaccuracies and                   *
inadequacies. In particular, they lacked indications of c r o s s sections,
p rofiles, structural stability, position of handrails and balustrades, width
of stairw ays, etc. Where appropriate, these could, a s an alternative, be
described in a Report.

(d)   The County Council's hope was that, in view of limited resources in
the Architectural & Building Services D ivision, the plans supplied and finally
accepted by the Working Party could form the b a sis of the C ertificate
Drawings.

3.     Report

(a)    General

It was recognised that the criteria set out in the Home Office "Guide to
Safety at Sports Grounds (Football)" required new work or reconstruction
to be to a standard not lower than the standard set out in the Guide, and that
In existing situations the criteri'on w as that of a reasonable degree of safety.
A s the Guide stated, it would be unreasonable, even if it w ere practicable,
to seek the absolute safety of everyone attending a ground.

With these factors in mind, both the F ire Service and the P olice felt that
the flow o f spectators was the m ost important criteria to be adopted.
Whilst not disagreeing with this viewpoint, the Building Authority suggested
it would be useful to know the reasoning behind the recommendation in the
Guide that gangways should not be le s s than 1 .1 m etres wide. The County
Council AGREED to try to find this information out, and the Fire Service
AGREED they would contact their colleagues in other a reas who had been
involved in the Certification p r o c ess to ascertain how nearly the 1 .1 m etre
gangway recommendation had been observed in existing situations in their
respective a rea s.

At the request of the F ire Service, the County Council also AGREED to try
and find out if there w as any general recommendation on reduced
adm ission if a ground were used at a night time instead of during the day
tim e.

 (b)    Front Cover

 Whilst it was probably a typing m istake, it w as AGREED that the wording
 on the Front Cover should read "REPORT TO SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY
 COUNCIL" and not "REPORT OF SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL".
(c)    Spion Kop   (pages 2 ,3 & 4)

The Working Party agreed with the Club's view that, with the existing three
ex its, there was no way that the recommended discharge time of 8 minutes
could be m et. Where they disagreed w as that an evacuation time of I l f
minutes should be regarded as acceptable. If no more exits w ere to be
provided, the Working Party AGREED that a crowd limitation of 11,040
on the Spion Kop should be imposed.

The existing exit at the North end passed under a bridge with a headroom
below agreed by the Club to be le s s than the recommended value of 8ft.
A s this w as in fact some 6'6", the Working Party AGREED that the Club
be informed that in their view it is essen tial that the floor be lowered to
rem ove this danger to spectators.

The exit at the South side would also require widening, and possibly flow
b arriers would need installing.

The area at the back of the Kop would also require close attention.

If new exits were to be provided by the Club, it w as AGREED that at least
TWO would be required. The m ost econom ical way of providing one would
be to use the gates in the existing b arrier, provided these were lined up with
the gangways, with discharge onto the pitch surround, and the other would
require to be a com pletely new exit.

The Building Authority felt that the majority of the crush b arriers would fail
the te s ts, and consequently any n ecessa ry r e-sitin g would probably not be
too much of a problem . Certainly the suggested additional b arriers would
require careful consideration.

For the purposes of crowd control, the P olice suggested there should be som e
form of lateral separation. The Working Party AGREED, and it was suggested
that three m etal fences sited centrally in the blocks (as opposed to adjacent
to the gangways) should be provided, with a c c e s s between each limited to a
padlocked gateway under the control o f the P olice.

A s recent adverse weather conditions had proved, ice and snow on the Kop
could cause problem s, and it was AGREED that Paragraph31 (4) of the draft
Certificate should be amended so a s to require the Club to take steps to
clear the Kop of ice and snow before a game w as played.

The Building Authority pointed out that information w as still required from
the Club on profile and step dim ensions and the slope of the Kop.
                                                                                  %
(d)    The West T errace fcages 4&5)

In view of the lack of depth of this terrace, the Club's offer to reduce the
spectator lim it to 7 ,2 0 0 , and the discharge time of 6. 6 m inutes, the
Working Party AGBEED that it would be unreasonable to in sist that
gangways or additional exits m ust be provided.

However, even if the existing crush b arriers w ere to p a ss the te sts, the
Working Party AGBEED that the b arriers would require special attention
in view of the apparant sharp edges, corrosion, etc.

(e)    The North West Corner Beinforced Concrete T errace         (pages 5 & 6)

The Working Party AGBEED there w ere no real problem s h ere, but the
Building Authority pointed out that a s w ell as the crush b a rriers, the
existing corrugated sheeting would require to p a ss the appropriate te sts.

(f)    The North Stand (pages 6 & 7)

Whilst the flow rates and discharge tim es w ere probably satisfactory (the
construction and width of the ram ps being such that they could quite properly
be regarded as elevated roadways), the fact remained that the gangways in
the North Stand w ere only 640mm wide for much of their length, compared
with the recommended width of 1 .1 m e tr e s.

Additionally, observations had shown that tw o-thirds.of the spectators used
the upper exit, w hilst the rem ainder used the lower exit. An ideal would be
to provide additional exits at’the top of the stand but, in view of its cantilever
construction, the cost would be prohibitive.

A s an alternative, the Working Party AGBEED that consideration might be
given to removing a row of seats from the top of the stand down each gangway
to the upper e x its, with a physical barrier a c r o ss the stand below the upper
ex its to ensure m ore equal u se of both upper and lower ex its by spectators.
If this would cause difficulties, a barrier in the gangways only below the upper
e x its might be considered.

So far as the Wire Mesh b a rriers under the stand w ere concerned, the
Working Party AGBEED that these m ust either be removed or made of a
permanent construction.

(g)     The West Stand

Whilst the exits w ere adequate and w ell spaced and the discharge tim es
w ere acceptable in view of the type of stand; the F ire Service felt that
the m eans of escape w ere not adectuate as the only means of e g r e ss was
by way of two sta ir c a se s. The Working Party .AGREED that it w as essen tial
that another staircase be provided, and one on the south-w est corner was felt
to be the m ost acceptable.

(h)     The South Stand (pages 7 & 8)

So far a s the seating arrangem ents were concerned, the Working Party
felt that it w as the front, open air part which caused the concern. B ecause
of the bad in gress /e g r e s s , the Working Party AGREED that two additional
ex its would be required. It w as suggested that the m ost econom ical way of
doing this was by m eans of one discharging at the Spion Kop end and the
other by breaking through the w all by the Tea Bar.

Additionally, the penning arrangem ents of the seating would need to be
looked at clo sely .

A s the balustrades and handrails w ere constructed of tim ber, the Building
Authority considered they would be likely to fail the appropriate te s ts.
A lso , as the staircase was a 24 instead of the maximum 12 r ise r recommende
in the Guide it was probable that this would have to be reconstructed.

 Contrary to their initial reaction, the F ire Service felt that, provided that the
 n ec essa ry increased fire resistan ce m easu res w ere carried out, the stand
 would not be the problem from a combustability point of view that they had
 anticipated.

 The Building Authority expressed concern a s to the corrosion of the steel
 work of the stand, and considered that this would require investigation.

 The P olice expressed concern about the u se of the car park behind the
 Stand. P erson s entitled to use this car park frequently arrived just before
 the start of a match and drove through the spectators attempting to gain
 a c c e s s to the ground. A s they left imm ediately afterwards, the sam e thing
 occurred at the end of a match. This practice had to be stopped, either by
 banning the use of the car park entirely on match days or imposing some sort
 of tim e restriction on its use before and after a match.

  (h)    General Requirements

 T hese were not discussed by the Working Party at this stage.

CO     Future Ground Capacity

If additional exits are not provided on the Spion Kop, this will have the
effect of reducing the ground capacity to 45,140, made up a s follow s.-

D ear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

I thank you for your le tte r dated 20th D ecem ber, 1978.

W hilst accepting the p rin c ip le , I feel that the suggested joint officer survey could not be
undertaken s a tisfa c to rily without plan draw ings, and I intend to p re s s the Club to submit them
as soon a s possible (see copy le tte r attached).

I would a gree that it is e ss e n tia l fo r all officers involved in the c ertific a tio n procedure to
act in unison. Following re c eip t of the plan draw ings, I would suggest that the officers m eet
to agree on identification p ro c e d u re s. In o rd e r that each officer is able to identify p a rts of
the ground in a uniform m a n n e r, I think it will be n e c e s sa ry to have stands and t e r r a c e s c le arly
identified, exit ro u te s , p a s s a g e s , gangways, gateways, d o o rs, e t c . , numbered in a consecutive
m anner and stairw ay s le tte re d .

I also think it will be e ss e n tia l for a copy of the r e p o r t of each s e rv ic e involved to be provided
to the other s e rv ic e s involved to enable any problem s to be discussed and determ ined on the b;.-. -i
of a single r e p o rt being form ulated for su b m issio n to the Club. This re p o rt, together with that
of Dr. Eastwood, would then fo rm the b a sis of a fu rth e r m eeting with officials of the Club to
d iscu ss any differences of opinion.

In this way, I would hope that we could avoid being in a position of having consultations with the
Club with insufficient o r lim ited inform ation for the County Council to r e a c h proper decisions.

I have passed copies of this le tte r to the Chief Constable and to the Chief F ire Officer and will,
of course, keep you informed of developments as re g a rd s sub m issio n of the plan drawings by the
Club.

                                                                      Yours faithfully,

  Dear Sir,

 Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

 I r e f e r to p a ra g ra p h 3(j) of the Note of the m eeting held on 13th D ec e m b e r,
 1978. If the County Council a r e to commence form al consideration of the
 Club's application, it is e ss e n tia l that the re q u ire d plan drawings a t the v e r y
 le a s t a r e subm itted as soon a s possible.

 This need not, I think, aw ait the completion of D r. Eastw ood's comprehensive
 re p o rt, which I a p p re cia te will take a little tim e.

 Can you kindly le t m e know when it is envisaged that the plan drawings will be
 available.

                                      Yours faithfully,

                                                        REPORT ON GROUND CAPACITY


                    This report sets out our thoughts on the ground capacity
    which is attainable.
                    It deals in broad terms with the necessary strengthening
    and supplementation of the crush barriers on the terraces, and
    calculations are made of the theoretical exit times.
                    Calculations of exit times are also made for each of
    the stands and reference is made to the observations which were
    made at the end of the third round cup-tie on 6 January, 1979.
                    The green guide has been used as a basis fofr our cal­
    culations, although as with probably all existing grounds, it
    will not be possible to satisfy all the recommendations in the
    guide.               Reasonable compromise will be needed on the part of the
    fire officer and the police.

        Standing Accommodation
        (a)    Spion Kop
                        The general layout of Spipn Kop is good.          It
               has a very adequate number of gangways, with spacings
               well below the maximum laid down in the guide.         The
W
               slope strikes a happy balance between the requirements
               for good viewing and the requirements of safety.
r                       The only questions therefore are the adequacy
               of the crush barriers to justify a high number of
               permitted spectators, and the capacity and nature of
               the exits.
                        Where the barriers are adequate in strength
               and spacing, the guide recommends that the number
                                                             2
               of spectators should not exceed 54 per 10m        of plan
               a,rea.      Disregarding the gangways the area of Spion
                                             2 which would provide
               Kop is approximately 3120m                             /
               accommodation for 16,850 spectators.          v7

                      Crush barriers can satisfy either of two
               standards.       Category A must be able to withstand a
               test load of 6kN/metrewidth (400 lb/foot approximately)
               and Category B must withstand 4.3 kN/metre (290 lb/foot) /
               In 1973 tests were made on all the barriers by Toft
               and Brocklebank Ltd.       Of the 101 barriers on Spion
               Kop, 21 failed to carry the test load of 400 lb and
               a further 15 carried the load but had some actual or
               incipient defect which needed attention.      Most of
               those which failed the test, failed so badly that they
               would probably not satisfy category B standard either.
               On the other hand, it was sometimes only one part of a
               long barrier which was weak.     It should be emphasised
               that the general situation was satisfactory compared
               with most grounds.
                        Clearly it would be advisable to bring all the
                                                                       SHEET   3.

           barriers up to a uniform category A standard.        It
           should be kept in mind that it is now five years since
           the tests and there may have been some deterioration
           due to rusting.      Most of the barriers are made from
           2§” diameter tube which only has a thickness of 0.192
           inches when new.      Rusting is now very slow in Sheffield’s
           atmosphere, but certain parts of the barriers are subject
           to more rusting than others and it is possible that
           there will be an increase in the number needing attention.
                     Provided a barrier can withstand 6kN/m, the       ^
           maximum distance between barriers recommended in the
           guide varies between 5m for slopes of only 5° to 2.9m l/
           for slopes of 30°.      These figures apply to ’peak viewing’
           areas.      Most of Spion Kop has a slope of ab^ut 17
           for which the recommended spacing is 3.6m. / The slope of the
           upper part     changes to 25° for which the spacing is
           3.1m. 'Z
                   Whilst we believe it is arguable that parts of
           Spion Kop could be considered as not being ’peak
           viewing a r e a s ’ we are prepared to accede to the police
           view and use peak viewing area standards for all barriers.
           This also applies to the stands at the west end of the
           ground.
                     We propose that the existing barriers should be
           supplemented by new ones as shown in red on the attached
           drawing 1610/1X.      The green shaded area behind each
           barrier shows the area which can then be assumed to be
           available for spectators.      This area is 2958m    which
           at 54 persons/10m2 gives a capacity of 1 5 , 9 7 3 . / It
           should be kept in mind that as many as 20,000 spectators
           have been admitted to the Kop in the past.

I                           interim period at least the evacuation time of ll|
minutes should be acceptable.

      be made for circulation space as spectators have
      to move         quite considerable horizontal distances
      to achieve good packing.                      The full area would
      justify about 8000 spectators, but we suggest it would
      probably be appropriate to allow 10% as the equivalent
      of gangways giving a capacity of 7200 spectators.
      Th# barriers should be designed to match this figure
      approximately.               Those barriers which cannot withstand
      6RN/m should be appropriately strengthened, and extra
      Ones provided where necessary.
                 The extra barriers required to achieve                                           fivfo.

                  The three exits have a total width of about
      11 . 5m which would permit about 1250 people per minute
      to lt?ave the ground.             Thus the terrace could be
      emptied in about six minutes which is very satt«f$©tory.
                  The guide suggests that everyone on a
      should be within 12m of a gangway or exit.                                There are
      no gangways and some spectators will be 25m fro® an
      exit.         But we feel this is of no consequence as
      movement horizontally along this terrace will be easy
      and quick.

      were adequate and the whole area is include# the number
      of spectators could .be about 3,050.

           shown on our drawing 1610/2X, the area which can
           be used in calculating spectator capacity is that
                                                       2 corresponding
           shown in green.   This area is about 535m
           to about 2900 spectators.     This would bring the total
           standing at the Leppings Lane end to 10,100.
                  The exits serving this part of the terraces
           are very adequate in width and there will be no
           difficulty in emptying in eight minutes.


    Seating Accommodation
    (a)    The North Stand
                  The form of construction of this stand is
           such that it presents a minimum fire hazard.      The
           exits are numerous and spaced so that they satisfy
           the recommendations of the guide.
                  The exits are very marginally below the
           recommended 1-lm width, but we do not consider this
           to be of great consequence.
                  Gangways are only 640mm wide for much of their
           length (they widen round the exit).     This is well
           below the green guide recommendation.      However,   it
           is clearly appropriate to take into account the
           general nature of the stand, the number as well as
           the width of the gangways, and above all the ease and
          speed   with which spectators can evacuate the stand.
                  On 6 January we counted the number of spectators
          leaving in successive minutes after the final whistle.
          The figures were 71, 72, 80 and 73.      Thereafter
          the number fell off as the spectators were in no hurry.
          This established that in an emergency the green guide s f '
          figure of 80 per minute (relating to a l*lm gangway)
          can be achieved.    With 18 exits for 10,000 spectators

 the average is 556 per exit.         Thus the stand would
 empty in about seven minutes, which is within the
 recommended limit of eight minutes.
        Our observations in company with the fire
 officer^ staff on 6 January showed that everyone
 had left this stand, apart from some people who were
 in no hurry, in about six minutes, although we nl«>
 counted about 40 per exit who left before the final
 whistle.    The overall picture appears very satisfactory
 and we suggest that this stand should be accepted
 as not needing any significant modification.

 The West Stand
        This stand is very similar to the north stand
 in its construction.        We were not able to accurately
 assess the time taken for it to be vacated on 6
 January because there were many seats which were unsold1.
 However, there is every reason to believe that there
 will be no difficulty in vacating this stand within
 eight minutes also.        There should be no need for
 significant modifications.

 The South Stand
        The structure has been surveyed and appended
 are prints of our drawings 1610/3, 4 and 5, which
 show the plans and cross-section.             Also attached is
 a seating plan, drawing No. 1610/6.
        The upper part of the stand (the covered n**e«)
 has 5710 seats.        These are served by 12 exits (^iisliidiis®
 those serving the directors box) so that an ave»ig#
 of 476 people need to pass through each exit.                    The
 count by the fire officer’s staff on 6 January stewed
 an average of about 70 per minute passing through cm®
 exit which corresponds to an emptying time of about
 seven minutes.    Indeed there were very few people
       EASTWOOD Ir PARTNERS




                   still trying to get out six minutes after the final
                   whistle.     A few had no doubt left early and a few
                   were still standing around, but the stand had
                   substantially emptied in about six minutes.
                           Having left the top of the stand the spectators
^                 have to make their way from the first floor landing
W -.              via one of three staircases.           Two of these are 3.6ai
                   wide and the other 2.4.          This is equivalent to 1?|

                           At ground floor level two of the staircases lea#
                   almost straight to the open air, through a compartment
                   which is separated from the main part of the building.
                   The third staircase passes through a wide lobby which
                   will probably need three sets of self closing fire
                   doors to separate it from the remainder of the building.
^                 The club intends to move the paint store from the
                   space behind this staircase.
                           The front, open-air part of the south stand is
                   well endowed with exits but these all discharge onto
                   one passage.       This passage has a theoretical capacity
                   of only about 150 people per minute in each direction.
                   This gives an emptying time of 11 minutes.                 Because
                   the stand is open to the air and there is very
                   ready access to the pitch we do not think this rather
                   long emptying time is of any great consequence.


           General Requirements
                   The police and the fire officer, and possibly the
           Building Surveyor, will no doubt wish to discuss a number of
           matters.     Prior to holding a further formal meeting they
                                                                     SHEET     9.

    will probably wish to study the drawings and to pay a
     further visit.    We would like to be present when any
     further inspection is made and would appreciate contact
    being made with Dr. Wood during Dr. Eastwood’s absence
    which will extend to 15 February.
            If the police would like to suggest the kind of police
    post they would like,    this can be considered by the club
    and drawings prepared by us as a matter of urgency.
            A meeting to discuss all aspects of the application
    might be held around say 16 February.
            In the meantime Eastwood & Partners will be checking
    the various electrical services so that we shall be in a
    position to discuss these at the meeting.


    Future Ground Capacity
            Following the upgrading of the barriers and the carrying
    out of such other works as may be required it is hoped the
    ground capacity will not* fall below 50,000 made up as follows
            Seating approximately                24.000
            Standing on Spion Kop                16.000    .
            Standing at Leppings Lane end
            (total including N.W.   corner)      10,100

                                                 50,100

            It will be recalled that in recent years agreement
    has been reached with the police that 55,000 spectators might
    be admitted to the ground.      This involved of the order of
    19.000 - 20,000 spectators being on Spion Kop.        Indeed,   it   tJo
    is believed that in the days when crowds of approximately
    70.000 were accommodated in the ground, the figure on Spion
    Kop probably approached 30,000.
            It should also be emphasised that the ground has an
    excellent safety record stretching over very many years.

                           (Adm inistration D epartm ent)

       1.     The Working P a r t y w e re inform ed that the S e c re ta ry of the Sheffield
              United Football Club Ltd. had w ritten to the Chief Executive of the
              County Council "enclosing fa r th e r draw ings obtained through the go,>d
              offices of the C i t y o f Sheffield M etropolitan D is tr ic t Council relatin g
              to the John S treet Stand and ground which a r e r e q u ire d by you to s u o p o i:
              an application for a licence a t this ground under the second designa ion
              o r d e r " . The le tte r concluded by saying that "we shall be g ratefu l to
              h e a r from you in due c o u rs e what p r o g r e s s has been m ade in relation lo
              our application".

       2.1    The w ork which had been u n dertaken p r i o r to the Club indicating in
              Septem ber, 1976 that they did not wish to p ro c e e d in anticipation of
              designation was review ed.

       2 .2   Whilst the County's A rc h ite c tu ra l and Building S e rv ic e s Officer had
              originally co m m enced work on the p re p a ra tio n of single line draw ings,
              it had proved to be m o re difficult than had been envisaged due to the
              n u m e ro u s different scale plans supplied a t v a rio u s stag es a s well as
              staffing difficulties, and had been nowhere n e a r com pleted by the time
              they had been in s tru c te d not to take any fu rth er action on the Club
              deciding (in Sep tem b er, 197G) not to p ro c e ed .

       2 .3   The la te s t p la n s supplied a p p ea re d to be e ith e r the D is tr ic t Council’s
              o rig in a ls loaned to the Club o r copies of them. The sam e p ro b lem of
              different, s c a le s would apply.

       3.     The Working P a r t y felt that the position had becom e so confused by the
              "sto p /g o " situation, and staff changes, that th e re was little alte rn a tiv e
              but to s t a r t again from the beginning. T h e re see m e d to be som e doubt,
              w hether the Club had been supplied with the Notes for Guidance of
              Applicants for Safely C e r tific a te s (which indicated the type and form of
              information re q u ire d ).

       4.1    It a p p ea re d that if had been intended lo a s k the F ir e Service Commiifee
               D e c e m b e r, 197G to agree; to an Application Fee of 11713 (bnry-d on the

           such time1 a s South Y ork sh ire ground (») becam e dosignaled mu!

    4 .2   In any c a s e , the fee to be c h arg ed to the Sheffield United Football Club
            would have lo await the ground being designated and a formal,

           So for as a d ra ft South Y o r k s h ir e C e r tific a te was concerned, it was
           pointed out that the O ffic e rs ' Joint W orking P a r t y had considered the

           IT WAS AGREED that

        D ear Sir,

        Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

        I have received the C lu b 's application, signed by the C hairm an, for a G eneral Safety
        C ertificate under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975. *

        F o r your information, the County Council had heard nothing from the Home Office
        since e arly August and the re c eip t of the Club's application prom pted a telephone
        enquiry of the Home Office who revealed the existence of th e ir ld ie r dated 23rd August
        to both Clubs and Local A uthorities. As this had evidently been received by the
        Club but not by the County Council, I asked for a copy to be forwarded on, and this has
        been received today.

        It is hoped that a meeting of the C m c c r ' s Working P a r ty (involving the P o lic e , the
        F ir e Service, the D is tric t Council Building Surveyor) will be held sh o rtly to give
        p re lim in a ry consideration to the m a t t e r , a fte r which I will get in touch with you. In
        the m e a n tim e , you will re c a ll that I enclosed with m y le tte r of 20th July, 1978, a Note
        on the type of detailed information and plans which the County Council will re q u ire for
        consideration of the application.

                                                              Y ours faithfully,

Thank you for your letter of 13 M ay about the terrible disaster at Hillsborough.
I was deeply moved by the tragic events that day, and I fully appreciate the
distress which you and your family must have endured.

You ask that the inquiry into this tragedy be re-opened. I am currently
considering w hat action to take in response to such representations. I have
been following the campaign for a new inquiry closely and, since the broadcast
of the television drama about the disaster in December, I have had the
opportunity to meet some of the members of the Hillsborough Families Support
Group.


I am therefore very conscious of the strength of feeling on this issue. I w ant to
make an announcement as soon as I can but I cannot say yet precisely when
that will be. However I do intend that you and the other families should be
given forewarning of the announcement. In the meantime, I would like to say
that my thoughts remain with you and with all the bereaved families.

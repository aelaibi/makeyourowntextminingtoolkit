I am an Inspector            inthe         South Yor k s h i r e Police,          at    present in charge

of the Audit         and Data P r o t e c t i o n Unit      in the C o m m u n i c a t i o n s     and

Computer      Development          Department.

On Satur d a y     15 April         198?    1 performed duty at the Football

A s s o c i a t i o n Cup S emi-Final        match at the H i l l s b o r o u g h Football

Stadium,      Sheffield,           between Liverpool           Football       Club and the Notts.

Forest Football            Club.

I paraded for         duty at 0945 that              day,    and verified that              the    officers        1

w as    responsible        for were also         present.          1 then a t t e n d e d    the    briefing

at     1000 that     day    in the North Stand,               given by Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

Duck enf ie 1d and other             officers.        I was      the   officer         in charge     of sub-

sector 20,        containing         serials 49,        50 and 51.          This       sub-sector

consisted of three marked                   police    'Transit*         vans,     containing        uniformed
                                                                                                               PAGE
                                                                                                               R57

officers,       who were       to    patrol      the Foxhill,         Parsers Cross,           and Grenoside

areas.       These areas were              in the area set aside              for the Liverpool

supporters,       and    included the            localities where Liverpool                    supporters

were    to    park their       coaches,        minibuses,       and    private         vehicles.

The Chief       Inspector       for     that area was Chief             Inspector Purdy;                  his

superior was S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Marshall.

After    the    briefing,       I briefed the members                 of my section,               and    ensured

that, the meals,         radios,        etc,     were    properly      drawn.          Although          our

i nstructions were         to take         the    packed meal         provided         i m m e d iately after

the briefing,          I felt       that   for the van          covering      the Foxhill            area.       Tango

4    (serial    49),    that    it would         be wisest      to a s c e r t a i n    the    immediate

circumstances w ith the               licensed       premises      in that area,              as    I was aware

that    some    of the    public        houses,      such as The Fox           Inn on Foxhill                  Road,

had been very busy the                previous year.

A ccordingly,      I elected to a c c o m p a n y          the Foxhill         van for         the       initial

part of the       shift,       on the      grounds      that    should there            be any trouble,

the    likeliest       locality would be the Foxhill                    area.          The    sergeant          in

charge       of the serial          was PS 2 2 0 7 S h a w , FS,       and we      commenced             patrol       at

1050 that day.

At    1058 we drove       past The Fox            public, house,        and    I noticed            that       there

were    six or seven young men,                  a p p a r e n t l y Liverpool     supporters,             already

wait i n g    outside    the    premises,         and    that   there were         two       or three

vehicles       in the    car    park.

At    1105 we drove       past The Basset               public, house       on Cowper Avenue.                    The

premises were alre a d y open,                 customers        could be seen           inside,          and a

small    knot    of young men standing                  by the entrance.               There were also

vehicles       in the    car    park.

At    1T.S5 We    returned to The Fox                public      house,     and    I went          inside and



influx       of L„iver poo 1 supporters;             he had set aside a larae                      room for
                                                                                                       PAGE        4
                                                                                                       RS7

                                       putting   his    regular; customers         into a side         room;

he had engaged a doorman and extra,bar                           staff,    and stated his

intention of staying                   open for .the Liverpool           supporters,

I advi s e d him to              exercise/care and discretion,              and' informed him that

there would be a police                    presence in the area.            My home address            is not

too     far    from this area?             I had heard a rumour           to the effect         that he

had also          l aid/in a large supply of                 beer,   ready for this       event.

However,          y    b e l ieved that all      licensees       in the area had been visited,
              /              ■                     '
and     their         intentions       discovered,      and    I was aware       that his    intention

to stay open was                 known.

Whe n    I visited the               premises,   there were a l r e a d y a p p r o x i m a t e l y twenty

customers             in the     room set aside        for    the Liverpool       supporters,         and the

car     park was a l r e a d y         beginning    to fill      up.

We then made a check                   of the other       licensed      premises    in the area.

Most     of the          public      houses were    either      closed,    or open only to the

rear;     all         of the o ff-licence        premises a p p e a r e d to be open,           but were

not at that             stage     giving    cause   for      concern.

We    then paid           passing att e n t i o n to the main           roads    in the Foxhill         area,

including The Fox and Basset                     public houses,          and a smal 1..-chi p-shop           in

Trafalgar             Road    that   had been the       scene    of disorder""on previous

mat chei              I noticed       in particular       that The^fox      public    house      rapidly

became        full;       the    crowd spilled out on to his              patio,   and the wall          in

front     of. his         premises      facing   on to Foxhill          Road was    compl e t e l y    lined

w i t h s u p porte r s , sitting          ojr'the wall        and drinking.       The    car    park was

e o rnp 1 e t e 1y full.

At    1315 we          received a radio message               to the    effect    that a group of
                             X                                                                  s ho p i n
youths were             cjrtising trouble and s h o p l ifting           in the

                             which    is i mmediately opposite                                                We

attended,             and the mana g e r e s s   c o mplained that a group           of youths         had

been     into the            premises,     snatching      sweets     from an open display,             and
when the m a n a g e r e s s          had r e m o nstrated with them,                   she had been

s ub j e c t e d to verbal            obscene abuse and              had been assaulted,                   although

there were          no apparent          injuries.            She was       however         very dist r e s s e d

and frightened.                 The youths       had     left       the area          in a white         van,   and     the

m anageress         had noted the number.                     We    passed these details                   to Ground

Control,          and    c o mmenced a search of the area.

At    1330 we saw the             van,    registered           number]__________               being       driven

along Halifax R o a d             towards       the City.            We    followed the            van as       it

stopped          in the    car    park of a public                 house    called The White Horse                     in

H a l i f a x Road,       and detained          the occupants.                  The    van was a simple

Renault          van,    containing       nothing more              in the       rear     than a m a t t r e s s and

six Liverpool             supporters,          all    of whom had been drinking.                           Details      of

the    occupants          of the       van are       given at the           end.

At    1340 we a r r i v e d at E c c l e s f i e l d Pol "ice Station.                       The    six     people

were     then documented;               this         process       took until          1450,    when we left           one

of the van's             crew,    PC                         e , with them at E c c l e s f i e l d and

resumed          patrol    direc t l y    to         the L e p p i n g s Lane entrance             to the       ground.

We were unable             to    inform ground           control           that we had          resumed patrol,

as    radio       traffic was at that                time     vir t u a l l y    continuous,         and     it was

ap p a r e n t    that    it was       very busy at           the Leppings Lane end.

We arrived at             the Le^pj^ngj^j-ane^jssnt ranee a t ^ 1 5 1 0 .                    There was a c w w d

milling ^ m i t           at^ the en'U^nce,             but     it was      not       p a r t i c u l a r l y dense,    and

we were able             to alight       and    pass     through          the    crowd to join other

officers          in the area          immediately           in front       of the        turnstiles         in front

of the West Stand.                    I there saw the other                 two       serials      from my s u b ­

sector,          ie serial       50    <P S H a i H ^ r o o k , Tango 5) and              serial      51    {PE ^ ^ j ^ i s e y

Tango 6),          who were a l r e a d y there              before       us.

Athough          radio    traffic       ne^a^n^^^x^U^emeJ^^b^^,                        giving      the     itnpr^s^ofi

of severe diff i c u l t i e s           inside        the    ground,       there was          no apparent           need

at that          precise moment          for our        presence at             that     location;          I thought
                                                                                                                PAGE      6

that we should be better                      employed          in our given duty of mobile

reserve,         and a c c o r d i n g l y    sought       p e rmission from Chief                Inspector Purdy

and S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Marshall            to    resume mobile             patrol.       On being given

this      permission,           I instructed all                three       serials     to    resume at about

•1515,.     I rejoined PS S h a w ’s serial,                         and    patrolled the         roads in .the

immediate         v i c inity of the ground.                     It       was at this stage I first

became aware           that      fatali ties         had occurred)               fr1om hearing a message

mentioning          that      five    bodies were at a particular                       location.

At    1525,      as a result          of the        radio       traffic revealing             that     there    had

been a serious and fatal                      incident,          I    instructed        the    driver     to return

to Leppings Lane..                Upon our arrival                   we    found that a m b u l a n c e s and fire

brigade       vehicles          were arriving.              ..We took        up a s t a nd-by        position     in

Leppings Lane            in the mouth of                 its   junction with S h e n s t o n e Road,             with

the    crew of the            vehicle        remaining          inside       the van.         At this     time there

was a trickle            of     people       leaving       the ground,             and some     of     these    persons

were      being     very abusive and t hreatening                           towards any        police     officer

they saw         in Leppings          Lane.         These       persons were using              obscenities,

threats,         and were        in   an ugly mood.

At    1535,      whilst       standing        by at that             location,       I saw a local G.P.,

Doctor E. Birkby,                in his own vehicle.                       Dr.   Bkir k b y was a p p a r e n t l y

trying      to    reach the ground,                 but was          held up by the           crowd and by the

eme r g e n c y vehicles          thronging          the       road.        Also    nearby was Chief

Inspector         Waring.         I took       possession of Dr.                   Birkby*s     car,     and handed

him over         to C h i e f    Inspector Waring                for       escort to the ground.

After      parking and           securing Dr.             B i r k b y ’s vehicle,         I left       the van and

its    crew on s t a nd-by at                that    point and went                towards     the ground.            I

entered       the ground          by the exit gate                   nearest       to Vere Road,         Gate    "A",

w h i c h was wide         open at that             time,       and       passed unde r n e a t h the North

Stand and          into the gym n a s i u m at             1545.

Upo n entering           the     gymnasium,              I was met          by the a p p a l l i n g    sight    of a
                                                                                                                 PAGE        7

 large number of a p p a r e n t l y              dead bodies         laid out on the floor,                    with

 police officers              and other          persons       in a t tendance        upon them.          This was

 the first       i ndication             I had of the mag n i t u d e          of the       tragedy?        I

a t t e m p t e d to    count       them,       but was      unable    to     continue       to do so,           I found

Dr,     Birkby a t t e n d i n g         to an    injured       person nearby,             and    returned his

 keys    to him,         I then          left    the g y m n a s i u m and     returned to the            van     in

Leppings Lane,

At no time did               I touch any of the bodies                      I saw,    nor was       I engaged          in

moving any of the                  bodies       in the ground.

Upon     returning           to    the    van,    I was      informed        that    the    van and driver

were     required        to help          in casualty e v a c u a t i o n to hospital.

Accordingly,           PC     1822 H u t c h i n s o n took the van for these                      duties,       and

 the    remainder        of the section              returned with me back t hrough Gate                          "A”

 to the entrance              to the       gymnasium,          where we        took up a position as                  part

 of a c^^^orvju^tyeclty^ii^the environs                          of the        gy m n a s i u m from the crowd,

A this time            there .Were a number               of    persons        attending at         the

 gymnasium,       tryifig ,-to trace              relatives       or find details                of the dead and
                              ,/                                       .

 g y m nas ium at       that       time.

At about        1615     I was asked by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Bates                  to form an       initial

 c o n tact   p o i n t n e a r t o t'he g ym nasi um e ntra n c e ,                 The    purpose was          to

 take    details        of    persons who were               reported as missing,                 and   of the

, persons     reporting,            so that a start             could be made          on identifying             some

 of the bodies,               I remained at that                location engaged             in this work

 unti1 approximately                 1730,       a s s isted    by other members             of serial          49„

'By that      time,      the       press    of the      relatives           had ceased,          and there was          no

 one    else at that              time    reporting anyone missing?                    in addition,

 arrangements           had been made             to a c c om m o d a t e    the    persons       looking for

 missing      relatives,            etc,    at H a m m e r t o n Road.

 I handed the           lists we had taken,                  together with an              incomplete       list of

P r i e s t l e y for onward t r a n s m i s s i o n to the        casualty b u r e a u/major

incident       room.

At    1740,    together with PS Shaw and his serial,                           1 went        on foot       to

Clay w h e e l s Lane,       where we       collected our        van.       At    that       time    the

members       of the serial          were all       reas o n a b l y fresh,       and had       not been

involved       in the harrowing             e x perience     of witn e s s i n g    the deaths             of the

casualties          or of moving          the dead and       injured?          I therefore           decided

not    to seek       p ermission to stand down at that                    time,     although          I

under s t o o d that        one    of the other       serials      in my sector              had been stood

down a short          time    before.        We therefore        resumed mobile               patrol,      as

there were          still    supporters       in the area,         at    1800,     as    I    felt    there was

still    a role that          the    serial    was    capable      of    performing.

At    1820 we       received a report          of trouble with s upporters at                        the

N o r t h e r n General      Hospital,       to which a number            of     injured       had been

taken.        We    remained       in the area of the           hospital         until       1920,    when we

returned to the ground.                   There     did not appear          to be any further

useful       duty to undertake at that                point,     and a c c or d i n g l y      I informd the

ground       control    of our a v a i l ab i l i t y and a sked for further

instructions.           We were          stood down at       1930,      returned to Clayw h e e l s

Lane    traffic       garage,       and went       off duty at 200 0 that               day.

I have       pocket    book       entries    of the above,         made     up on my arrival                home

at about 2100 that                day.    I have    since    r ecollected that at about                     1713

to    1730,    or    perhaps       later,    I had a con v e r s a t i o n with          Inspector Tingle,

C2,    who    stated    that       he had been a s s a u l t e d     by supporters             whilst

engaged       in a p p lying       first aid to an          injured man on the ground?

certainly the          officer was          upset and       to some      degree     d i s t r e s s e d when       I

spoke    to him,       but    I have       omited    to    include      this     in my       notes.

I have       previously       been engaged on football                  duties at H i l l s b o r o u g h

Stadium,       but not       frequently?       most       of my experience          lies with             city
                                                                                                          PAGE      9
                                                                                                          RS'7

centre work and at Bramall                 Lane.         I was    engaged on the semi-final

last year,       and was      a l l o c a t e d the     coach    park duties along C laywheels

Lane and Halifax           Road.      I have       not    been all o c a t e d the same             duties    on

any occasion         I have wo r k e d at Hillsborough.

On the occasion of this match,                     as    I have    said earlier,             I did not       see

any     of the   incident       inside     the     ground?        I at no time           entered the

playing area or perimeter                track?         and    I did not touch or handle any of

the     casualties,      either      injured or dead.              At    no time       did    I speak       to,

or have any d i f f i c u l t y with,            any of the       stewards         e m p l o y e d by the    club

either     inside     or outside        of the grots n d .

As for my o b s e r vations about                this matter,          I can only        state     that     I was

From               Kevin ROBINSON

                   Inspector, South Yorkshire Police

                   Audit and Data Protection Unit   (Ext 3222)

                   Force Headquarters, Snig Hill.



I am an Inspector in the South Yorkshire Police, at present in charge of the

Audit and data Protection Unit in the Communications and Computer Development

Department.

On Saturday 15 April 1989, I performed duty at the Football Association Cup semi­

final match at the Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield, between Liverpool

Football Club and the Notts Forest Football Club.

I paraded for duty at 0945 that day, and verified that the officers I was

responsible for were also present. I then attended the briefing at 1000 that day

in the North stand, given by Chief Superintendent Duckinfield and other officers.

I was the officer in charge of sub-sector 20, containing serials 49, 50, and 51.

This   sub-sector consisted of three marked police     'Transit' vans,   containing

uniformed officers, who were to patrol the Foxhill, Parson Cross, and Grenoside

areas. These areas were in the area set aside for the Liverpool supporters, and

included the localities where Liverpool supporters were to park their coaches,

minibuses, and private vehicles.

The Chief Inspector for that area was Chief Inspector Purdy; his superior was

Superintendent Marshall.

After the briefing, I briefed the members of my section, and ensured that the

meals, radios, etc, were properly drawn. Although our instructions were to take

the packed meal provided immediately after the briefing, I felt that for

the van covering the Foxhill area, Tango 4 (serial 49), that it would be wisest

to ascertain the immediate circumstances with the licensed premises in that area,

as I was aware that some of the public houses, such as the Fox Inn on Foxhill

Road, had been very busy the previous year.
                                           =2=

Accordingly, I elected to accompany the Foxhill van for the initial part of the

shift, on the grounds that should there be any trouble, the likeliest locality

would be the Foxhill area. The sergeant in charge of the serial was PS 2207 Shaw,

F2, and we commenced patrol at 1050 that day.

At 1058 we drove past the Fox public house, and I noticed that there were six or

seven young men, apparently Liverpool supporters, already waiting outside the

premises, and that there were two or three vehicles in the car park.

At 1105 we drove past the Basset public house on Cowper Avenue. The premises were

already open, customers could be seen inside, and a small knot of young men

standing by the entrance. There were also vehicles in the car park.

At 1125 we returned to the Fox public house, and I went inside and spoke to the

landlord.   He   had   apparently made   arrangements    for   an   influx   of   Liverpool

supporters; he had set aside a large room for their exclusive use, putting his

regular customers into a side room; he had engaged a doorman and extra bar staff,

and stated his intention of staying open for the Liverpool supporters.

I advised him to exercise care and discretion, and informed him that there would

be a police presence in the area. My heme address is not too far from this area;

I had heard a rumour to the effect that he had also laid in a large supply of

beer, ready for this event. However, I believed that all licensees in the area

had been visited, and their intentions discovered, and I was aware that his

intention to stay open was known.

When I visited the premises, there were already approximately twenty customers in

the room set aside for the Liverpool Supporters,        and the car park was already

beginning to fill up.

We then made a check of the other licensed premises in the area. Most of the

public houses were either closed, or open only to the rear; all of the off-

licence premises appeared to be open, but were not at that stage giving cause for

concern.
We then paid passing attention to the main roads in the Foxhill area, including

the Fox and Basset public houses, and a small chip-shop in Trafalgar Road that

had been the scene of disorder on previous matches. I noticed in particular that

the Fox public house rapidly became full; the crowd spilled out on to his patio,

and the wall in front of his premises facing on to Foxhill Road was completely

lined with supporters,   sitting on the wall and drinking.       The car park was

completely full.

At 1315 we received a radio message to the effect that a group of youths were

causing trouble and shoplifting in the             shop in                which is

immediately opposite                             We attended,   and the manageress

complained that a group of youths had been into the premises, snatching sweets

frcm an open display, and when the manageress had remonstrated with them, she had

been subjected to verbal obscene abuse and had been assaulted, although there

were no apparent injuries. She was however very distressed and frightened. The

youths had left the area in a white van, and the manageress had noted the number.

We passed these details to Ground Control, and commenced a search of the area.

At 1330 we saw the van, registered number)________ \ being driven along Halifax

Road towards the City. We followed the van as it stopped in the car park of a

public house called the White Horse in Halifax Road, and detained the occupants.

The van was a simple Renault van, containing nothing more in the rear than a

mattress and six Liverpool supporters, all of whcm had been drinking. Details of

the occupants of the van are given at the end.

At 1340 we arrived at Ecclesfield Police Station.       The six people were then

documented; this process took until 1450, when we left one of the van's crew, PC

333 Ogilvie, with them at Ecclesfield and resumed patrol directly to the Leppings

Lane entrance to the ground. We were unable to inform ground control that we had

resumed patrol, as radio traffic was at that time virtually continuous, and it

was apparent that it was very busy at the Leppings Lane end.
                                        =4=

We arrived at the Leppings Lane entrance at 1510. There was a crowd milling about

at the entrance, but it was not particularly dense, and we were able to alight

and pass through the crowd to join other officers in the area immediately in

front of the turnstiles in front of the West Stand. I there saw the other two

serials from my sub-sector, ie serial 50 (PS Hallbrook, Tango 5) and serial 51

(PS Cressey, Tango 6), who were already there before us.

Although radio traffic remained extremely busy, giving the impression of severe

difficulties inside the ground, there was no apparent need at that precise moment

for our presence at that location; I thought that we should be better employed in

our given duty of mobile reserve, and accordingly sought permission from Chief

Inspector Purdy and Superintendent Marshall to resume mobile patrol. On being

given this permission, I instructed all three serials to resume at about 1515.

I rejoined PS Shaw's serial, and patrolled the roads in the immediate vicinity of

the ground.   It was at this stage I first became aware that fatalities had

occurred, from hearing a message mentioning that five bodies were at a particular

location.

At 1525, as a result of the radio traffic revealing that there had been a serious

and fatal incident, I instructed the driver to return to Leppings Lane. Upon our

arrival we found that ambulances and fire brigade vehicles were arriving. We took

up a stand-by position in Leppings Lane in the mouth of its junction with

Shenstone Road, with the crew of the vehicle remaining inside the van. At this

time there was a trickle of people leaving the ground, and some of these persons

were being very abusive and threatening towards any police officer they saw in

Leppings Lane. These persons were using obscenities, threats, and were in an ugly

mood.

At 1535, whilst standing by at that location, I saw a local G.P., Doctor E.

Birkby, in his own vehicle. Dr Birkby was apparently trying to reach the ground,

but was held up by the crowd and by the emergency vehicles thronging the road.

Also nearby was Chief Inspector Waring. I took possession of Dr Birkby's car, and

handed him over to Chief Inspector Waring for escort to the ground.
                                      =5=

After parking and securing Dr Birkby's vehicle, I left the van and its crew on

stand-by at that point and went towards the ground. I entered the ground by the

exit gate nearest to Vere Road, Gate "A", which was wide open at that time, and

passed underneath the North Stand and into the gymnasium at 1545.

Upon entering the gymnasium, I was met by the appalling sight of a large number

of apparently dead bodies laid out on the floor, with police officers and other

persons in attendance upon them. This was the first indication I had of the

magnitude of the tragedy; I attempted to count them, but was unable to continue

to do so. I found Dr Birkby attending to an injured person nearby, and returned

his keys to him. I then left the gymnasium and returned to the van    in Leppings

Lane.

At no time did I touch any of the bodies I saw,    _   nor was I engaged in moving

any of the bodies in the ground.

Upon returning to the van, I was informed that the van and driver were required

to help in casualty evacuation to hospital. Accordingly, PC 1822 Hutchinson took

the van for these duties, and the remainder of the section returned with me back

through Gate "A" to the entrance to the gymnasium, where we took up a position as

part of a cordon protecting the environs of the gymnasium from the crowd. At this

time there were a number of persons attending at the gymnasium, trying to trace

relatives or find details of the dead and injured, and it was necessary not to

allow them access to the gymnasium at that time.

At about 1615 I was asked by Superintendent Bates to form an initial contact

point near to the gymnasium entrance. The purpose was to take details of persons

who were reported as missing, and of the persons reporting, so that a start could

be made on identifying seme of the bodies. I remained at that location engaged in

this work until approximately 1730, assisted by other members of serial 49.

By that time, the press of the relatives had ceased, and there was no one else at

that time reporting anyone missing; in addition, arrangements had been made to

acccmodate the persons looking for missing relatives, etc, at Hanmerton Road.
I handed the lists we had taken, together with an incomplete list of persons

treated by the St John's Ambulance Brigade, to DC 3211 Priestley for onward

transmission to the casualty bureau/major incident room.

At 1740, together with PS Shaw and his serial, I went on foot to Claywheels Lane,

where we collected our van. At that time the members of the serial were all

reasonably fresh,    and had not been involved in the harrowing experience of

witnessing the deaths of the casualties or of moving the dead and injured; I

therefore decided not to seek permission to stand down at that time, although I

understood that one of the other serials in my sector had been stood down a short

time before. We therefore resumed mobile patrol, as there were still supporters

in the area, at 1800, as    I felt there was still a role that the serial was

capable of performing.

At 1820 we received a report of trouble with supporters at the Northern General

Hospital, to which a number of injured had been taken. We remained in the area

of the hospital until 1920, when we returned to the ground. There did not appear

to be any further useful duty to undertake at that point, and accordingly I

informed   the   ground   control   of   our   availability   and   asked   for   further

instructions. We were stood down at 1930, returned to Claywheels            Lane traffic

garage, and went off duty at 2000 that day.

I have pocket book entries of the above, made up on my arrival heme at about 2100

that day. I have since recollected that at about 1715 to 1730, or perhaps later,

I had a conversation with Inspector Tingle, C2, who stated that             he had been

assaulted by supporters whilst engaged in applying      firstaid to an injured man on

the ground; certainly the officer was upset and to some degree distressed when I

spoke to him, but I have emitted to include this in my notes.

I have previously been engaged on football duties at Hillsborough Stadium, but

not frequently; most of my experience lies with city centre work and at Bramall
Lane. I was engaged on the semi-final last year, and was allocated the coach park

duties along Claywheels Lane and Halifax Road. I have not been allocated the same

duties on any occasion I have worked at Hillsborough.

On the occasion of this match, as I have said earlier, I did not see any of the

incident inside the ground; I at no time entered the playing area or perimeter

track; and I did not touch or handle any of the casualties, either injured or

dead. At no time did I speak to, or have any difficulty with, any of the stewards

employed by the club either inside or outside of the ground.

As for my observations about this matter, I can only state that I was saddened

and depressed to see so many of the Liverpool supporters whose only attitude

seemed to be hostile and completely ungovernable; whose main interest seemed   to

be centred on drinking from as early as possible to as late as possible; and to

remark that the young men arrested by serial 49 appeared to have no shame or

finer feelings of any description.

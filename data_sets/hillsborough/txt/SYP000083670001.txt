A convoy was formed, and we attended at the ground at the rear of the

North Stand,

On Na 1 i g ht i ng , an       Inspector       (idem, ity unknown)                ordered us to go onto

the    pitch a nd line up f a c :i.n g t h e N o r t h               S ta n d .

I saw that             the Leppings        Lane    half   of the       pitch was         full      of    people

a p p a r e n t l y wan d e r i n g ar o u n d aimlessly.            Persons        in the N o r t h S t a n d

grea t e d us with animosity,                  abusing      us,     and di r e c t i n g       our a t t e n t i o n    to

the Le ppi ngs Lane             end of the g r o u n d .

After      a few minutes we were                  i nstructed       tcN^orm a , cordon across                   the

h a If w a y 1 i n e o f t h e pit c h , Xft c i n g towards            the Leppi n g s          Lane       end..      Man

L iv e'rpcfa 1 fans appro ched u s , scto e worse                    for    Intoxicating             liquor, a nd

goalmouth.

It was       not apparent what              had a c t u a l l y   o c c u r r e d at    that      time,      either        t

ourselves         or the m a j o r i t y     of fans      in the      ground,              \

Whilst       I w^standing             in the       cordon fans         began      to b r i n g \ ^r^jured peop 1

from the Leppi n g s Lane              end on m a k e s h i f t      stretchers.           After        a

short while            it was apparent            that most       of the      people       that      they were

conveying were            dead.

The a t t i t u d e     of the      fans    on the     pitch grew          p r o g r e s s i v e l y more      hostile

towards       us.

During       that      time    the Forest         fans who were         in the Hop             began to shout

for    their      team,       and   taunt    the Liv e r p o o l     fans.

Thi s pr ompted a 1arge               nurnbe r of Li ve r pool          f ans     to break         thr ough         gaps

in the       cordon and a p p r o a c h the Forest                supp o r t e r s and trade             insults,

assisted         to s h e pherd these          fans    back       into their       own half,            with    the

mi n i m u m of fuss.           The   cordon       reformed with           reinforcements.                  Fans

co n t i n u a l l y   approached      us,     some    insulted us,           some a s k e d about             what wa

happeni n g .

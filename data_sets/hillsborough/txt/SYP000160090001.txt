Dear Mick,

Many thanks to you and to all Team for the way in which you received
          and myself on Friday.

I felt our visit was emmensely worth while, it gave me an insi^fcTinto what
was happening and - in practical terms as far as identification of test cases
for the civil action was concerned - was invaluable.

It also enables me to deal with a number of questions which may arise from
members of our Group.

Dealing with the practice matters which flowed from the visit I note that
you are still looking for additional witness statements and I will forward
to you over the next couple of days copies of those statements which have
been passed through to me by Solicitor members of the Group since the Inquiry
closed and which therefore I have not forwarded to the Inquiry itself.
When I next write to the Group as a whole (which is likely to be in mid-August) )
will include a request that if they do take further statements from clients
or witnesses they forward copies to me which I will pass through to you.

As far as the eight families who have expressed a particular wish to see the
video of the Leppings Lane end is concerned I leave it to you to make arrangements
with the families direct for appropriate appointments.  I enclose a copy letter
that I am today sending to the Solicitors for each of those clients which
is self explanatory and I would be grateful if the Solicitors could be informed
- purely as a matter of courtesy - of the date of the appointments.

So far as any showing of material to the injured is concerned I leave that
to                 who will be writing separately to Mr Jones with a request
to be considered by the Coroner.

I have written (enclosed) to Mr Jones in relation to those photographs which
were on display at the Inquiry itself and await to hear from him once he has
considered that request with the Coroner.
 C/tnd



I gave Kevin Tope a copy of our List showing Solicitors instructed on behalf
of relatives and dependents of the deceased.   As I mentioned we have asked
members of the Group to confirm and update their client list by the 31st
July - that is needed in connection with the civil claims.

If there are any alterations to the List which you have once the additional
information is fed into the computer I will let you have a revised list.


ET al ly, I WaS Very grateful to be able to take a note of those individuals
who had been confirmed as being in either Pen 3 or Pen 4 and I would be grateful
l w en ur er identification is made you could let me have an updated list
confirming pen 3 and pen 4 victims respectively.

Finally, without wanting in anyway to go "over the top" I would like to say
how tremendously impressed I was with the methods of work, the hard work that
everyone was doing and the effectiveness of it all but particularly with the
sensitive approach which was obvious from all your Team and the very helpful
and friendly approach they had to us.


1      T d°Ubt that We may have to be in touch with y°u again in the future
and thank you again for our visit on Friday.

Every good wish.

Yours sincerely._____

                   For the attention of
                   Chief Superintendent Foster

                   Dear Mr. Jones,

                   Further to my visit to Nechells Green Police Station in the company
                   of Miss Elizabeth Steel on Friday last (28th? July 1989). I would
                   like to convey my thanks to Mr. Foster and his colleagues for the
                   courtesy extended to us during what was a very informative and
                   useful visit.

               As I discussed with Mr. Foster and Mr. Tope, the work of my team
               and other social services core groups with bereaved families, and
               with survivors of the tragedy, has increasingly made use of video
               material and a range of photogjaphs. Until now we have used video
               material culled from B.B.C. transmissions, but will shortly be in
               a position to use the material prepared by yourselves for Lord
               Justice Taylor's Inquiry.  Photographic material available to us
               is, again, largely confined to what was actually published by the
               Press, although one or two newspapers have provided us with addit­
               ional prints.

               It is rather difficult to describe in detail just how useful such
               material is; however, I hope that I conveyed to Mr. Foster the
               essence of this, viz, that in taking survivors through their
               experience in close detail they are better able to talk about and
               perhaps exorcise the often horrific memories of that afternoon.
               (While similar work is appropriate with bereaved families, it is
               with survivors that this approach comes into its own).

{             To this end I would like to formally request that the video and
         \    photographic material that your team has accumulated is made
         J    available to us at an early date.  I appreciate that this will require
              the agreement of the Coroner, and would therefore be grateful if
     j        you would discuss this request with him.  In the meantime,
    /        Mr. Foster has kindly offered to allow my staff to visit by appoint-
    -y       ment and view material relevant to specific clients.   In the course
/             of the next few weeks I shall be glad to take up this offer.
                                -2-




Once again/ may I thank your colleagues for their considerable
assistance on Friday/ and I look forward to continuing a productive
working relationship with them.



Yours sincerely/

Re: ANDREW BROOKS


I refer to your fax letter of yesterday relating to the above named and asking that we forward a
copy of the body file to your office as soon as possible as requested by his sister Louise Brooks.

I recieved the request from Louise Brooks on Tuesday 4 November and replied to her the
following day explaining that I was unable to comply with her request firstly as Andrew Brooks' file
was with Lord Justice Stuart Smith at the Hillsborough Scruting and secondary, that she had
been provided with a full copy of the file and if she wished her legal representation to have sight
of it she should provide her copy rather than asking us to duplicate work we have already
undertaken.

A copy of our letter of 5 November 1997 is enclosed.

Dear Ms Brookes

ANDREW MARK BROOKES

I refer to your facsimile letters of 14 August 1997 and 1 September 1997.

Please find enclosed a copy of the continuity chart which relates to your brother Andrew. You
have now been supplied with all the material from Andrew's file, which you may wish to supply to
Ms Adlington.

The sudden death report of Andrew did not form part of the documents presented at the Inquest
of your brother, and therefore we will not be releasing this document to you.

As you will appreciate with polaroid photographs there are no negatives. I have already supplied
you with a laser copy of the polaroid photograph taken of Andrew and will be providing you with a
proper photograph of this, and other laser photographs which have been supplied to you
previously, in the near future.

You have requested the original copy of photograph timed at 14.49.40.02. It would assist me in
identifying this document if you could supply me with a reference number.

You have been provided with all the photographs that relate to Andrew, your request for
71 photographs in addition to those already supplied is denied.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Walton

I have received a request from Louise Brookes, whose brother Andrew Mark Brookes died at
Hillsborough on 15 April 1989, for video material which you were shown by West Midlands police
on 1 September 1989.

I wonder if you would be prepared to view a small part of video reference VRM/2 in order to
enable me to prepare the material for Ms Brookes.

I enclose a stamped addressed envelope for your convenience.

Yours sincerely

                together with stills from video reference MAP7 15:30:10.

Dear Miss Brookes

RE: ANDREW MARK BROOKES


I refer to your letter dated 21 June 1997 requesting copies of statements and photographs
relating to your brother Andrew, some of which have been forwarded to you.

We have always co-operated fully with all such requests. However, in view of the
establishment of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny on aspects of the Hillsborough
Disaster, I feel we must take a slightly different approach now.

I have written to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to ask his permission to comply with your
request. I am anxious not to cut across his work. In taking such a course of action I am
unable to release the remaining material to you at this time, however, as soon as I hear
from him, I will contact you again.

Yours sincerely

Dear Ms Brookes

I refer to your letter of 21 June 1997 requesting further statements, photographs and plans.

                   and Peter Wallis were separated from Andrew prior to their entering the
Hillsborough Football Stadium and they did not see him again. They were unable to give any
evidence of the circumstances surrounding Andrew's death, subsequently their statements were
not included in Andrew's file. I have caused enquiries to be made with                   md Peter
Wallis, seeking their authority to release copies of their statements to you and I hope to be in a
position to write to you again in the near future.

In the meantime I enclose the following photographs and plans which you have requested:-

SMIR 1/45, SMIR 1/46, SMIRf/82, DE»^16, DE <017, MCR 1/30, LPE 4/15, ASP 1/9, JP ^ /2 3 ,

I am sorry that I have to write to you at this time but I feel it only proper in the circumstances.

Louise Brookes, who lost her brother Andrew Brookes in the disaster has requested a copy of
your statement. Before I release a copy I think it right that I seek your views on the matter.

I should be grateful if you would indicate, in writing whether you have any objections to my
releasing your statement to Ms Brookes.

Dear Sir,

Re: 1989 F.A. Cup Semi-Final - Hillsborough Stadium




Following the events of the day I was subsequently interviewed at our offices in Hull
by the W est Midlands Police. I gave to the interviewing officer a statement of my
observations before the match commenced, during the few minutes of actual play
and the events which transpired.

I hereby request a copy of my statement which I understand I am entitled to receive.

I look forward to your co-operation in this matter.

Yours sincerely.

Dear Mr Greenaway
Hillsborough Inquest
I enclose a note received today from Mr Hammond from which you will notice that he is
asking for a full list of exhibits produced at the inquest.
I assume that there is some record in existence, probably amongst the documentation of
the West Midlands Police. I wonder if you would be kind enough to have a quick search
and let me know what can be found.
If there is no immediate answer then I will ask Dr Popper for his comments.
Kind Regards

Dear Ms Adlington

RE: GRAHAM WRIGHT

I refer to your facsimile letter dated 30 July 1997 requesting copies of photographs referred
to at the inquest of Graham Wright.

We have always co-operated fully with all such requests. However, in view of the
establishment of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny on aspects of the Hillsborough
Disaster, I feel we must take a slightly different approach now.

I have written to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to ask his permission to comply with your
request. I am anxious not to cut across his work. As soon as I hear from him, I will contact
you again.

Yours sincerely

Dear Ms Adlington

RE: VIDEO FOOTAGE TB1 and TB2

I refer to your letter dated 23 July 1997 regarding video tapes TB1 and TB2.

We have always co-operated fully with all such requests. However, in view of the
establishment of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny on aspects of the Hillsborough
Disaster, I feel we must take a slightly different approach now.

I have written to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to ask his permission to comply with your
request. I am anxious not to cut across his work. As soon as I hear from him, I will contact
you again.

Yours sincerely

For the Attention of Ms A M Adlington




Dear Ms Adlington

I refer to previous correspondence in this matter, in particular your letters of the 3 June 1997 and
21 April 1997.

I am sorry you have found the quality of TB1 and TB2 are poor at certain times. However, if you
return the video tapes to me I will endeavour to provide you with copies that will be to your
satisfaction. I am unable to accurately advise you as to which generation the copies which you
have already been provided with are.

In your facsimile letter of 21 April 1997, you requested copies of the list of exhibits from the Lord
Justice Taylor Inquiry and the Inquest. Mr George Croston from CPS Central Casework has
provided you with the list of exhibits from the Inquest and the further list I have provided you with is
a record of exhibits obtained for use or reference during the Inquiry into the Hillsborough Football
Stadium Disaster, Saturday 15 April 1989.

If I can be of any further assistance then please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours sincerely

Dear Sir

I refer to your letter of 16 April 1997 together with its enclosure.

The material requested has been forwarded to Mrs Stringer with the exception of Plan PRT/2 which
I am unable to locate from our records. I have requested further information from Mrs Stringer to
assist me. Have you any record of Plan PRT/2?

The normal procedure for copying photographs is by laser copier, which in the normal course of
events has been satisfactory. Negatives are held in respect of some but not all photographic
material in our possession. The processing of material is not charged for at this time.

If I can be of any further assistance in the future please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours faithfully

Dear Mrs Stringer

I refer to your letter to Mr Dorries H M Coroner, requesting copies of photographs referred to at the
inquest of your son Paul, which has been forwarded to me.

Copies of the following photographs and plans you have requested are enclosed.

       1.   MWL10/33A         7.    PR2/2
       2.   MWL10/34A         8.    PR2/21
       3.   DBML2/19          9.    PR2/25
       4.   PRI/22A           10.   MWJL170
       5.   PRI/29A           11.   MWJL128
       6.   PR2/1             12.   MTH/1

The documents you refer to as C221, C222 and C223 are in fact MWJL170, MWJL128 and MTH/1
respectively.

I am unable to locate plan PRT/2 and wonder if you are able to furnish me with more information to
assist me.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Greenaway
Hillsborough Inquest
I enclose a letter received today from Mrs Stringer asking for some documentation.
Unless you are aware of something to the contrary I will assume that all of these were
documents referred to in evidence and that Mrs Stringer is entitled to them
The last paragraph of Mrs Stringer’s letter asking for “good quality glossy copies” is
obviously based on the recent problems. Might I ask what the normal procedure for
copying photographs is? I think it is perfectly fair to say that relatives should be given a
good quality photograph even if that means that they are then asked to pay a production
charge. Do the police hold the negatives?
I will be grateful for your comments in early course.
Yours sincerely




C P Dorries
HM Coroner

RE: JAMES GARY ASPINALL

I refer to your letters dated 3 September and 5 September 1997 and enclose a copy of the post
mortem report by the pathologist, Somasundrum Sivaloganathan. Also enclosed as requested is
a video still, reference MAP 7 15.28.46 As previously stated in respect of other files, I am not
providing you with a copy of the West Midlands Police Summary.

I have examined the statement dated 15 March 1990, referred to by Detective Constable Fox in
his statement of 25 March 1990. This statement makes no reference whatsoever and has no
reference to the above named. Therefore it is not included in the file. The statement in fact
refers to another deceased altogether and rather than waste time waiting for Detective Constable
Fox's permission to release it, I ask you to accept my word.

Also enclosed as requested in your second letter is a copy of the original statement made by
James Aspinall (senior). The origin of the photograph, reference MW 1/2 is that it was taken by a
newspaper photographer and it is untimed.

Finally, we will forward a photographic copy of the identification photograph in due course.

           Having studied further the body file of the above-named deceased
           James' father, also James, has asked me to obtain a copy of his
           original signed statement (pp 23 and 24 refer). In addition could
           you please tell me the origin of photograph ref. MW 1/2 and the
           time it was taken.

           Finally, James' mother has asked me to request from you a
           photographic copy of the identification photo.

           I thank you for your assistance.

          Dear Sir

          Re:      James Gary Aspinall

          I acknowledge receipt of the body file of the above-named
          deceased.  I note that the file does not contain James post mortem
          report. Nor does it contain the West Midlands Police Summary of
          Evidence.  I should be grateful if you would forward the same.

          Also, at Page 39 of the file D.C. Fox refers to his earlier
          statement of 25 March 1990. Could you please let me have a copy
          of this statement.

          Finally, could you forward a copy of the video still timed at
          1528.46 referred to in the continuity chart.

          I thank you for your assistance.

          Yours faithfully

Dear Ken
James Gary Aspinall (deceased)
I enclose a copy of a letter received on the 4th July from Mrs Margaret Aspinall asking for
copies of three photographs. I have written back indicating that you will send these on to
her.
Are we aware of any photographs beyond these three that might help Mrs Aspinall?
Many thanks for your help.
Kind regards.

            I refer you to my letter o f 12 September 1997.


            I should be grateful for an immediate response. The family is concerned that they will not be
            able to comply with the timescale lard dow n by Lord Justice Stuait-Smith due to lack o f co-
            operation from South Yorkshire Police.

      Dear Sir

      Re:     Kevin Martin Traynor

      At page 4 paragraph D of Kevin's mini-inquest it is made quite
      obvious that DC Turner must have made a further statement in
      addition to his statement of 9 May 1989 which consists of a mere 2
      pages.  Could you please supply me with a copy of the statement
      referred to by DS McCombie.

      Yours faithfully

 Dear Sir

 Re:        Martin Kevin Traynor and
            Christopher Traynor

 I thank you for your letter of 8 August enclosing laser copy
 photograph of Martin Kevin Traynor.  Unfortunately the quality of
 the same does not meet the needs of the Traynor family.  Could you
 please supply me with an actual photographic copy. Alternatively
 could you release the original to me for a period of 14 days in
 return for which I will provide you with a solicitors undertaking
 to return the photograph to you at the end of the said period.

 Mrs Traynor has also asked me to request the continuity charts in
 respect of both her sons.

Dear Ms Adlington

RE: MARTIN KEVIN TRAYNOR

I refer to your letter dated 11 July 1997 requesting a copy of the Polaroid photograph of
Martin Traynor.

We have always co-operated fully with all such requests. However, in view of the
establishment of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny on aspects of the Hillsborough
Disaster, I feel we must take a slightly different approach now.

I have written to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to ask his permission to comply with your
request. I am anxious not to cut across his work. As soon as I hear from him, I will contact
you again.

Yours sincerely

RE: PAUL CARLILE

I refer to your letter dated 15 October 1997 regarding the meeting of Hillsborough Families with
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith and whether a full copy of the body file of the above named had been
released to relatives.

We have a considerable amount of correspondence with Mrs S Stringer, mother of Paul Carlile,
which dates back to 11 June 1991 and with Ms Donna Carlile, Paul's sister, dating back to
17 September 1991. I have carried out a detailed review of the files and whilst I can be certain
that Mrs Stringer has received copies of all the charts, plan and photographs within the file, I
cannot express the same certainty in respect of all the statements, as some may have been
forwarded to her and some to Ms Donna Carlile. I am therefore taking the opportunity to forward
you a copy of all the statements contained within the file.

        Dear Sir

        Y ou will be aware that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith met with a number o f families during his
        visit to Liverpool last week. In som e o f those meetings he asked whether the families had
        received a com plete body file from South Yorkshire Police. In the follow ing cases I was
        unable to state categorically that a full body file had been released and undertook to clarify this
        with yourself:-

        Paul Cariile;
        Michael Kelly;
        Philip Hammond;
        Kevin and Christopher Traynor

        In all o f the ab ove cases som e information has been released to families in the past. On this
        basis, only a limited amount o f information w as supplied to m yself as you assured me that this
        com prised the remainder o f the body-file. H owever, at individual meetings with Lord Justice
        Stuart-Smith families o f the above named deceased identified gaps in the evidence provided so
        far. In order that I might com ply with my undertaking to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith I should
        be grateful if you w ou ld provide m e with a cop y o f the com plete body file.

        I thank you for your assistance.


        Yours faithfully

Dear Ms Adlington

RE: PAUL CARLISLE

I refer to your letter dated 25 July 1997 requesting copies of statements.

We have always co-operated fully with all such requests. However, in view of the
establishment of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny on aspects of the Hillsborough
Disaster, I feel we must take a slightly different approach now.

I have written to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to ask his permission to comply with your
request. I am anxious not to cut across his work. As soon as I hear from him, I will contact
you again.

Yours sincerely

RE: RELEASE OF STATEMENTS RELATING TO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

Our records show you made a statement to the West Midlands Police with regards to your
involvement in the Hillsborough Disaster.

Ms Adlington, a solicitor representing the Hillsborough Family Support Group at Liverpool, has
asked to be provided with a copy of your statement. Before I release a copy I think it only proper
that I seek your view on the matter.

Please accept my apologies for raising this issue at this time, but I trust that you will appreciate
my reluctance to release a document which carries your address, without first seeking your
approval.

I enclose a pre-paid envelope for favour of your reply.

Dear Ms Adlington

RE: PHOTOGRAPHS EXHIBITED AT INQUEST

I refer to your facsimile letter dated 30 July 1997 requesting copies of photographs which
were referred to at the inquest and were given to Coroner reference numbers C326A,
C449, C489 and C490.

We have always co-operated fully with all such requests. However, in view of the
establishment of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny on aspects of the Hillsborough
Disaster, I feel we must take a slightly different approach now.

I have written to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to ask his permission to comply with your
request. I am anxious not to cut across his work. As soon as I hear from him, I will contact
you again.

Yours sincerely

D ear Mr

H illsb o ro u g h In q u est

Thank you for your letter of the 6th August which was received here yesterday.

I note your request for “copies of all evidence, photographs and videos that were used at the
inquest”. It is rather difficult to deal with such a broadly stated request, if I were to take your words
literally the charges for supplying such of these documents as I am legally able to provide would
actually run into several thousand pounds.

By Rule 57 of the Coroners Rules 1984, I am only able to supply you from here with a post-mortem
report, copies of any statements which were rea d o u t at the inquest (as opppsed to statements of
people who gave oral evidence) and the transcript of what was said. Although we have generally
supplied copies of a small number of statements without charge,a copy of the transcript would run
well into four fig u res.. As there are already several copies held by relatives of the deceased, or those
advising the relatives;! am not sure that you would want to pay out an enormous sum just to have a
fresh copy.

Other documents, such as the statements of those who did give oral evidence at the inquest have
generally been supplied by the Police upon request. Again, if dealing with a reasonable number of
statements I understand that they have not made a charge for this or the copying of photographs or
videos.

I would be grateful if you could let me know your wishes, in the meantime I have passed a copy of
your letter on to the department in the South Yorkshire Police who are sending out copies of
statements and photographs etc.

I look forward to hearing from you again shortly.

Yours sincerely

KEVIN & CHRISTOPHER TRAYNER

I refer to your faxed letter of 28 October 1997 regarding the above named and would inform you
that I am unable to comply with your request to provide you with a duplicate copy of everything we
have on file in relation to the above deceased as both Kevin and Christopher’s body files are with
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith at the Hillsborough Scrutiny and I have no date for their return.

Notwithstanding the above I am stiil inclined not to accede to your request because Mrs Trayner
has been supplied with full copies of both files and you should access them via her. I note your
offer to pay the copying costs for duplicating the two files, but of more concern to me is the time
that it takes and the precedent that it would set for others to make similar requests.

RE: KEVIN & CHRISTOPHER TRAYNOR

I refer to your letter of 15 October 1997 regarding the meeting of Hillsborough Families with
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith and whether full copies of the body files relating to the above named
persons had been released to relatives.

We have a considerable amount of correspondence with Mrs J Traynor, which dates back to
12 June 1992. She has in fact been provided with copy documentation on seven different
occasions, which has not only encompassed all the documentation from both body files, but
additional material as well. This was confirmed in writing to yourself by one of my colleagues on
1 September 1997.

Both yourself and Mrs Traynor have requested that we release the statement of a Mr Langley
that does not form part of either body file. Can I here remind you that your initial request of
12 August 1997 for this statement gave no indication that you were seeking the statement on
behalf of Mrs Traynor and that the statement reference number you supplied related to a
statement made by PC Langley of South Yorkshire Police. I wrote to him, obtained his written
permission to release his statement and forwarded it to yourself on 19 September last. On
30 September we received a telephone call from Mrs Traynor indicating that it was the statement
of Norman Langley, a coach driver that she was requesting. I wrote to Norman Langley on
6 October 1997 requesting his permission to release his statement to Mrs Traynor. To date, I
have not received a reply. This is the only outstanding request we have in respect of
Mrs Traynor.

12 August 1997 for this statement gave no indication that you were seeking the statement on
behalf of Mrs Traynor and that the statement reference number you supplied related to a
statement made by PC Langley of South Yorkshire Police. I wrote to him, obtained his written
permission to release his statement and forwarded it to yourself on 19 September last. On
30 September we received a telephone call from Mrs Traynor indicating that it was the statement
of Norman Langley, a coach driver that she was requesting. I wrote to Norman Langley on
6 October 1997 requesting his permission to release his statement to Mrs Traynor. To date, I
have not received a reply. This is the only outstanding request we have in respect of
Mrs Traynor.

            unable to state categorically that a foil body file had been released and undertook to clarity this
             w ith yourself:-

             In all o f the a b ove cases som e information has been released to fam ilies in the past. O n this
             basis, only a lim ited am ount o f information w as supplied to m y self as you assured m e that this
             com prised the remainder o f the body-file. H ow ever, at individual m eetings with Lord Justice

             be grateful if y o u w ou ld provide m e with a copy o f the com plete b ody file.


              I thank you for your assistance.

I refer to your telephone request of 30 September 1997 for a copy of the video still from VRM2
and am pleased to be able to forward it to you.

You also requested that we release to you the statement of Norman Langley. We have received
a similar written request on your behalf from Ms A Adiington. Here I would like to explain that
Ms Adlington's initial request of 12 August 1997 for this statement, gave no indication that she
was seeking the statement on your behalf and quite simply gave a statement reference number
and the surname "Langley". This was a statement made by PC Langley of South Yorkshire
Police. We wrote to him, obtained his written permission to release his statement to Ms
Adiington and did so on 19 September.

I have now written to Norman Langley at the last address we have for him. Once I receive his
response we will contact you again.

RELEASE OF STATEMENTS RELATING TO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

Our records show you made a statement to the West Midlands Police with regards to your
involvement in the Hillsborough Disaster.

Mrs Traynor, who lost two sons in the Hillsborough Disaster, has asked to be provided with a
copy of your statement. Before I release a copy I think it only proper that I seek your view on the
matter.

Please accept my apologies for raising this issue at this time, but I trust that you will appreciate
my reluctance to release a document which details your involvement without first seeking your
approval. Should you agree to my releasing your statement, I will delete your address if this is
your wish, before doing so.

I enclose a pre-paid envelope for favour of your reply.

Yours sincerely

referenced TOD1/11, 1/14, 1/35 AND SF1 1/11. The copies we have in respect of ihese

RE: KEITH MCGRATH

I refer to our telephone conversation of 17 November 1997 relating to the clothing worn by Keith
on the day of the Hillsborough Disaster, why there was no photograph of his clothing in his file;
how PC           >f West Midlands Police knew that the shoe returned to you later was Keith's; the
provision or actual photographs from the file rather than laser copies; and, how you could obtain
copies of video in which Keith appeared particularly the one on the Leppings Lane Terraces
where he is seen hitting a beach ball.

I will try and deal with your queries in the above order, but please bear in mind that Keith's file is
currently with Lord Justice Stuart Smith and the Hillsborough Scrutiny Team at the Home Office. I
have, however, checked various registers within the Hillsborough Archives and our previous
correspondence. The position remains that there is no photograph of Keith's clothing in his file.
His clothing and personal effects were listed in a property register ( copy document marked A )
and these were handed over to and signed for by a relative, Terence McGrath, at 5.05 am
Sunday 16 April 1989 (document B, which is the reverse side of document A). The property and
clothing was handed over to Terence McGrath before arrangements were made for clothing to be
photographed, hence the lack of a photograph in Keith's file.

PC        f West Midlands Police took a statement from you on 26 April 1989 (document marked
C) in which you describe the clothing Keith was wearing when he left home on the 15 April 1989
including Brown Brogue shoes. Your statement goes on to indicate that one of these shoes had
been returned to you and that you would like the matching shoe returned at a later date if it is
found. There is also a more detailed description of the shoe. This part of the inquiry was handled
by West Midlands Police, but I am aware that an attempt was made to identify ownership of all
the property recovered from Hillsborough and it would appear to me that the description of the
shoe in your statement enabled them to trace the missing shoe and return it to you on
14 May 1989, when it was signed for by your husband (document D).




                                                   The person dealing with this correspondence is:
                                                   Superintendent Hepworth
                                                   Tel (0114)296 3084       Fax (0114)2963113
Incidentally Keith's file is not the only one that does not contain a photograph of the clothing worn
on the day as there were other families to whom clothing and property was returned in the 24
hour period immediately following the incident. I hope the above information clears up any doubts
that you may have had about the way his possessions were dealt with.

I am sorry that we have not yet been able to process your request to be provided with
photographic copies of the laser prints we originally provided. As I indicated in my letter of
15 September we will do so as soon as we are able.

Moving now to your request to be provided with a copy of the video footage of Keith hitting the
beach ball on Leppings Lane Terrace. The video in which this sequence appears has a reference
MAP 1. MAP 1 is the property of the BBC and they hold copyright in it. In the first instance you
should approach the BBC to ascertain whether they are able and willing to supply you with a
copy.

RE: KEITH McGRATH

I refer to your undated letter received at this office on 30 August 1997, in which you refer to
previous correspondence and the file for your son, which we forwarded on 19 August 1997. I am
sorry that we are unable to provide you with a photograph of Keith's clothing for no other reason
than that his file does not contain one. At this time I am unable to ascertain why this should be
the case.

You have requested photographic copies of the three laser printed photographs that we supplied
to you. These will be forwarded in due course, but the provision of laser copies in the first
instance has enabled South Yorkshire Police to respond more expeditiously to your and the
many other similar requests for documentary information that we are presently receiving.

Dear Mr Glover

I refer to your letter of 10 August 1997 requesting copy statements and photographic material in
relation to your son Ian Thomas Glover who died at Hillsborough on Saturday 15 April 1989.

Enclosed please find copies of photographs and plans you have requested. I am not able to
release video VRM2 to you.

Unfortunately I have been unable to obtain the authority of PC's Fojut and Glaves to release their
statements to you. I would refer to our letter of 14 July 1994 to you which clarified certain points
in relation to the contents of his initial statement.

I am unable to assist in identifying the doctor who attended to Ian outside and inside the
Gymnasium.

Yours sincerely

                                                   Date:        27 January 1998




RE: WILLIAM ROY PEMBERTON

Thank you for your recent, but undated letter in which you acknowledge receipt of photographs I
forwarded to you on 13 January 1998. You raise four points regarding statements, property and
the notification of your son's death in your letter, which I will now deal with.


Statements of Detective Constable Fox

You have previously been supplied with the statement dated 16 October 1989 made by this
officer, relating to his dealings with your son. His statement of 7 July 1989 does not relate to
your son at all, but to the officer's dealings with another body and I shall not be releasing it to
you. Incidentally, Ms Ann Adlington, solicitor to the Hillsborough Family Support Group
requested the 7 July statement on your behalf on 27 October 1997 and this request was refused.


Statement of Sergeant 2235

This sergeant was heavily involved in rescuing supporters from the pens at Leppings Lane and
during his efforts, took off his jacket, throwing it down at the side of the pitch. It was removed
from the pitch by some unknown person, who has not been specifically traced. The sergeant's
statement does not form part of your son's body file and there are no references in the statement
to him. The sergeant had no dealings whatsoever with Roy and I will not be releasing the
statement to you.




                                                 The person dealing with this correspondence is:
                                                 Superintendent Hepworth
                                                  (0114)296 3084
Student's Union Card

A student's union card is not listed in any of the four property indexes that relate to your son,
these are the South Yorkshire Police index, the Mortuary Index, the index recording the
hand-over of property from South Yorkshire Police to West Midlands Police and the West
Midlands Police index, which is the one your husband signed when the property was returned to
him. I have checked all these indexes and the property listed is identical in each one. Your son
was not in possession of a student union card.


Notification of Death

Your husband formally identified your son at midnight on the day of the disaster. I have checked
all the records and logs of the Casualty Enquiry Bureau, set up by South Yorkshire Police on
15 April 1989 and I can assure you that no information went out from that Bureau regarding the
death of your son, until more than six hours after he had been identified by your husband. The
information then was passed to another police force. We never give out information on
deceased persons, prior to formal identification, nor before the closest relatives have been
informed. If Roy's University friends heard about his death prior to your husband, it was not from
South Yorkshire Police.

I hope the above information fully answers your queries and puts your mind at rest.

laser copies of all the below photographs relating to William. I am now able to supply you with
photographic copies of photographs as follows:

TOD 1/14, RTS 1/25, NGN 1/52, AH /11, SS/3, NGN 1/27, PR6/2A, DB 16/30

I am unable to provide you with photographic copies of the following photographs which were not
taken or developed by the South Yorkshire Police.

Our Photographic Department has advised me that the processing of the negatives at the initial
stage of developing has led to irreversible deterioration, which has resulted in their not attempting
to produce further photographs from them.

JP 3/17, JP 3/18, JP 3/19, JP 3/20, JP 3/21.

RE WILLIAM ROY PEMBERTON

I refer to your recent telephone conversation with Police Constable Greenway regarding your son
William's file, which was unfortunately forwarded to Ms Adlington Solicitor for the Hillsborough
Family Support Group by mistake.

Ms Adlington office has been contacted and I have been assured that William's file will be
forwarded to you. However, I have taken the opportunity to forward duplicates of the material. I
apologise for any distress this error may have caused you.

RE: WILLIAM ROY PEMBERTON

Thank you for your letter of 9 September 1997. We have provided you with a laser copy of all
the photographs relating to William as it is a much quicker way for us to meet your request. At
this time we are also dealing with many other similar requests, both from bereaved relatives of
the Hillsborough Tragedy and from the Hillsborough Families Support Group. We will ultimately
provide you with photographic copies, but of necessity this will take time.

I also enclose copies of all the statements and charts from William's file, which show where he
was at a given time. All the other documentation was supplied to you on 20 August 1997.

RE: COLIN ANDREW SEFTON

I refer to previous correspondence between yourself and South Yorkshire Police, including my
letter to you dated 23 September 1997 and our telephone conversation of Thursday last,
25 September 1997.

I am pleased to forward to you copies of the original statements made by yourself and by
Leo Fallon, Colin's brother-in-law.

I have checked our correspondence file and can confirm that we have previously forwarded to
you a copy of the statement of             ~| but we still have his authority to release his statement
to you on the file and I am therefore enclosing another copy. I have also checked in relation to
              The only statement made by him was in the form of a questionnaire and no formal
written statement was ever taken from him. I believe you told me you had received a copy of the
questionnaire, but as             authority to release it is also still on file, I am pleased to enclose
a further copy for your use.

We did in fact write to              it his last known address on 13 January 1993, seeking his
authority to release a copy or his statement to yourself, but we did not receive any form of
response. I do not therefore feel it appropriate to write again some 414 years later.

Finally, may I confirm that you will approach                     and                    jnd obtain their
written consent to release their statements to                          uitt baiiie iu me. On receipt of
their authority I will be pleased to send copies to you.

Dear Mrs Harrison

I refer to your letter of 22 August 1997 requesting a copy of your husband Gary Harrison's file to
be released to Ms Adlington.

I wonder if you were aware that a copy of Gary's file had already been forwarded to his brother
David Harrison, who may be willing to make it available to Ms Adlington.

If I can be of any further assistance then please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours sincerely

RELEASE OF STATEMENTS RELATING TO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

Our records show you made a statement to the West Midlands Police with regards to your
involvement in the Hillsborough Disaster.

Ms Adlington, a solicitor representing the Hillsborough Family Support Group at Liverpool has
asked to be provided with a copy of your statement. Before I release a copy I think it only proper
that I seek your view on the matter.

Please accept my apologies for raising this issue at this time, but I trust that you will appreciate
my reluctance to release a document which carries your address without first seeking your
approval.

I enclose a pre-paid envelope for favour of your reply.

PHILIP JOHN STEELE

I refer to your letters of 9th and 12th September 1997 regarding the body file relating to the
above named.

Dealing first with your letter of 9 September, I am pleased to enclose a copy of the statement
made by Mr N Udall. I am also enclosing the Pathologist's Report by Professor Underwood and
statements by Detective Inspector Timms and Inspector Layton, which also form part of the body
file and appear not to have been included in the original documentation sent to you.
Mr McShane, although mentioned in Dr Calder's statement, did not have any involvement and no
statement was ever taken from him. Following a meeting I have had with the Coroner, he has
decided that the Gen 18 Sudden Death forms and incidentally the West Midlands Police
Summary of Evidence will not be released and Mr Domes is writing to you regarding this.

Moving now to your letter of 12 September there are no statements from ambulance personnel in
the body file of the above named and we are unable to identify who transported Philip Steele's
body to and from the Northern General Hospital. There is no statement from Charge Nurse Batty
in the body file either but he has made a statement and I have written to him seeking his
permission to copy it to yourself. Once I am in receipt of his reply I will contact you again.

After completing the examinations I noticed that a large number of

doctors had arrived with equipment.      I spoke to a senior Police

Officer and after leaving my personal details, was allowed to leave.

I met Dr Caroline ALTOFT in the gymnasium and we eventually found the

other two of our party back at the car.

We then returned heme.

I have listed a number of things that I feel very strongly about in

the supporters' questionnaire that I have also completed, and feel

these should be brought to the attention of Lord Justice TAYIDR.

RE: NICHOLAS PETER JOYNES

I refer to your letter of 3 September 1997 regarding your late son. I am sorry that pages 1 and 3
were inadvertently missed from Dr Byrne's statement and I enclose herewith a full copy of the
statement.

The only photograph we have of Nicholas in Pen 3 is the one marked PRI/12A, a copy of which
was forwarded to you with our letter dated 22 August 1997.

I have searched our records for a statement made by a police sergeant Gary Smith. We do not
have a statement made by such a named individual. Having studied Dr Byrne's statement it is
quite probable that the person he was attempting to resuscitate on the pitch was not Nicholas
and that the cousin was not Police Sergeant Gary Smith, particularly as he is described as being
in his late teens or early twenties. Dr Byrne is the doctor who certified life was extinct for all the
persons listed on page 3 and 4 of his statement and that is the reason for his statement being
included in Nicholas's file.

I apologise for writing in such detail, but I felt I should try and clear up this ambiguity for you and I
hope I have not caused you any further distress.

RE: HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - RELEASE OF STATEMENTS

Ms Adlington is a Solicitor representing the Hillsborough Family Support Group in Liverpool.
She has asked to be provided with a copy of your statement which was produced after the
Hillsborough Disaster. Before I release this document I think it only proper that I seek your view on
the matter.

Please accept my apologies for raising this issue at this time, but I trust that you will appreciate my
reluctance to release a document which carries your details, without first seeking your approval.

I enclose a pre-paid envelope for favour of your reply.

Yours sincerely

RE: PHILIP HAMMOND

I refer to your letter of 15 October 1997 regarding the meeting of Hillsborough Families with
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith and whether a full copy of the body file of the above named had been
released to relatives.

Our correspondence with Mr Hammond dates back to 8 May 1992. Having carried out a detailed
review of the file I note that some statements were provided by the Coroner and some by
ourselves. Whilst I can be certain that Mr Hammond has received copies of all the charts, plans
and photographs within the file, I cannot express the same certainty in respect of all the
statements. I am therefore going to take the opportunity of forwarding a copy of all the
statements to Mr Hammond, as I do not have written authority from him to release documentation
to yourself.

                                                   Date:          27 October 1997




I refer to a letter from Ms Adlington dated 15 October 1997, regarding the meeting of
Hillsborough Families with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith and whether a full copy of the file relating to
your son has been released to yourself.

Our correspondence dates back to 8 May 1992 and having carried out a detailed review of the
file, I note that some statements were provided by the Coroner and some by ourselves. Whilst I
can be certain that we have forwarded to you copies of all the charts, plans and photographs
within the file, I cannot express the same certainty in respect of all the statements. I am therefore
taking this opportunity of forwarding you a copy of all the statements contained within the file.

I refer to your fax message of 28 August 1997 sent to South Yorkshire Police Headquarters
rather than to the office dealing with the Hillsborough Tragedy. This has led to some delay in my
responding to you and I apologise for this.

We are not releasing video tapes under the reference VRM, nor are we releasing complete
photograph albums as they contain pictures of more than one deceased person and if we were to
do so, this would leave us open to criticism from other bereaved families.

I am therefore unable to accede to your request.

  Dear Mrs Stringer
  Hillsborough Inquest
  Thank you for your recent letter received at my office today.
  I do not believe that the files kept here will readily give me the answer to your enquiry but I
  am quite sure that PC Greenaway (who as you will now is looking after the Police copy of
  the Hillsborough papers) will be able to give you a speedy answer.
1 I have sent a copy of your letter on to PC Greenaway today and asked that he reply direct
  to you. If you do not hear from him within the next couple of weeks please let me know
  and I will gladly chase it up for you.
  Yours sincerely ^

I refer to your recent telephone conversation with Police Constable Greenway. The above named,
a final year student at Portsmouth University has asked my help in conducting a survey with

to PC Greenway, to receive a copy of the attached survey forms and request them to complete
and return to me preferably via yourself as soon as possible.

I enclose a copy c                       jtter and synopsis for your information.

Dear M

I refer to your letter of 22 August 1997.

I have distributed the survey forms you have supplied to members of the South Yorkshire Police
who I believe fall into the category you wish for the survey to cover.

Once the completed forms have been returned to this office I will write to you again.

Yours sincerely

           Dear Sir

           You will be aware that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith met with a number o f families during his
           visit to Liverpool last week. In some o f those meetings he asked whether the families had
           received a com plete body file from South Yorkshire Police. In the following cases I was
           unable to state categorically that a full body file had been released and undertook to clarity this
           with yourself: -

           Paul Carlile;
           Michael Kelly;
           Philip Hammond;
           Kevin and Christopher Traynor

           In all o f the above cases som e information has been released to families in the past. On this
           basis, only a limited amount o f information was supplied to myself as you assured me that this
           comprised the remainder o f the body-file. However, at individual meetings with Lord Justice
           Stuart-Smith families o f the above named deceased identified gaps in the evidence provided so
           far. In order that I might comply with my undertaking to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith I should
           be grateful if you would provide me with a copy o f the complete body file.

           I thank you for your assistance.

           Yours faithfully

RE: MICHAEL KELLY

I refer to your letter dated 15 October 1997 regarding the meeting of Hillsborough Families with
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith and whether a full copy of the body file relating to the above named
had been released to relatives.

As recently as 15 September 1997, at the request of Mrs J M Sinclair, sister of Michael Kelly, I
forwarded a full and complete copy of his file to yourself. Subsequently a telephone call was
received at this office from Mrs Sinclair, claiming that the statement of an off duty Merseyside
Police Constable called           was "missing" from the file. This was not the case, as the
statement had never been part of the file. Nevertheless, we searched our data base, traced the
statement made by Police Constable             and on 8 October 1997, I wrote to him seeking his
written authority to release his statement to Mrs Sinclair. On 10 October 1997 I wrote to Mrs
Sinclair, advising her of her error regarding the statement of Police Constable______ jeing
missing and that I was seeking his authority to release it.

In consequence of your letter I have today taken the unusual step of telephoning Police
Constable Evans and subject to an assurance that his home address will not be disclosed, he will
send me written authority to release his statement, which I will then forward to Mrs Sinclair.

RE MICHAEL KELLY

I refer to your recent telephone conversation with Police Constable Greenway regarding a
statement from an off duty Liverpool Police Officer which you state was missing from Michael's
file.

The officer did provide West Midlands Police with a statement as a result of his attending the
Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989, however there appears to be insufficient information in
the statement to link him positively with your brother hence the statement did not form part of his
file. I can assure you that the statement is not missing.

I have written to the author of the statement seeking his authority to release the statement to you.
Once I have received his response I will write to you again.

On 8 June 1989 you made a statement to the West Midlands Police with regard to your
involvement in the Hillsborough Disaster.

Mrs Joan Sinclair, the sister of Michael David Kelly, who was a victim of the Hillsborough tragedy
has asked to be provided with a copy of your statement. Before I release a copy of your
statement I think it only proper that I seek your view on the matter.

Please accept my apologies for raising this issue at this time, but I trust that you will appreciate
my reluctance to release a document which carries your details, without first seeking your
approval.

I enclose a prepaid envelope for favour of your reply.

Re: ADAM SPEARITT DECEASED

I refer to your letter of the 27 October 1997 requesting statements of Ambulance men
and             jnd our fax response of 3 November 1997.

  have now received a response from both Mr                                         n respect of our
request for their authority to release copies of their statements to you. Both refuse permission.

I would however draw your attention to the body file of David Thomas forwarded to you yesterday
under rule 57 of the Coroner's Rules 1984, which does contain the statement of Ambulance man
Boyington.

                                                   Date:         7 October 1997




I refer to your letter of 30 August 1997 and my response of 15th September 1997 with which I
enclosed a copy of your late son Adam's file and statements of three ambulance officers whom
you named.

I wrote to the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service, asking for their assistance in
tracing the ambulance personnel who conveyed you to the Northern General Hospital. I have
now received a response from the Ambulance Service, indicating that they are unable to identify
the crew who transported you to the hospital. I am therefore unable to provide you with their
statements.

Since the correspondence referred to above, you have contacted PC Greenway by telephone,
requesting a copy of the statement of Dr Jacob. We have also received a written request from
Ms Adlington for a copy of Dr Jacob's statement, which I later learnt was made on your behalf.
This duplication of requests is causing us additional work. Nevertheless, I have researched the
file of your late son, the details we have of yourself and the statement of Dr Jacob. I am satisfied
the Doctor did not have any dealings with either of you. In accordance with our policy on the
release of documentation, I cannot supply the statement of Dr Jacob to yourself or Ms Adlington
without the Doctor's consent. In the light of my research I do not propose to seek that consent.

Turning now to our telephone conversation of this morning, I fully understand that you are trying
to find out what happened to you at Hillsborough and "to fill in the gap of the two hours of your
life that is missing" as you phrased it. We will do our best to help you. I cannot however, provide
you with information that is not in the possession of South Yorkshire Police. Neither can I provide
you with copies of statements without the consent of the authors, unless they fall within Rule 57
of the Coroner's Rules 1984. The statement of Dr Jacob does not fall within Rule 57. The
statements that I forwarded to you on 15 September 1997 as part of Adam's file, including those
of the three ambulance officers that you named, all fell within Rule 57.




                                                  The person dealing with this correspondence is:
                                                  Superintendent Hepworth

Finally, threatening to report me to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, as you did this morning, will not
alter the above. I will continue to act in a professional manner, releasing documentation in
accordance with the legal advice given to South Yorkshire Police and the policy agreed with Her
Majesty's Coroner.

STATEMENT OF DR JACOB

I refer to your fax letter of 26 September 1997 requesting a copy of the statement of Dr Jacob,
my subsequent response and our telephone conversation of yesterday in which you informed me
that the request was made on behalf of Mr Eddie Spearitt. Mr Spearitt has also contacted
PC Greenway direct and made the same request. There does therefore seem to be some
duplication occurring, which I believe could be avoided if a little more detail were provided with
your requests for information as I indicated in my initial fax response.

I have researched the file of Adam Spearitt (deceased), the details we hold of Edward Spearitt
and the statement of Dr Jacob and I am satisfied that the Doctor did not have any dealings with
either of them. In accordance with our policy on the release of documentation I cannot supply
the statement of Dr Jacob either to yourself or Mr Spearitt without the doctor’s consent and in the
light of my research do not propose to seek that consent.

Following advice from the Coroner that their statements are disclosable under Rule 57 of the
Coroner's Rules 1984, copies of the above statements have been forwarded to Mr Spearitt,
together with other documents which formed part of the body file of Adam Spearitt.

Edward Spearitt, who was injured at Hillsborough, has also asked for the statements of the

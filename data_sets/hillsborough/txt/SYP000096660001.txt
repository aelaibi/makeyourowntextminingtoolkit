          enclosure and forms the buttress at the end of the centre

          tunnel.



1310.33   Switch to shot of playing area at the foot of the players tunnel

          - now a group of approximately 50 people, male and female

          standing around on the playing area.




1310.52   Change to shot of Leppings Lane terraces showing west stand

          traffic - Ford Transit police personnel carrier parked on

          central reservation, driver of transit places what appears to be

          a cup of something on top of bollard - gets back into transit

          van to driver's seat.




1312.20   Return   to shot of Leppings Lane turnstiles - signs of groups

          standing around on footpaths of Leppings Lane but the area

          outside the turnstiles relatively clear.      People making their

          way through the turnstiles.




1312.40   Generalshot out of Penistone Road North looking up Herries

          Road, people making their way towards the ground but relatively

          calm and quiet.




1314.25   Return   to shot of Leppings Lane   terracing and seated enclosure

          above - now see that the Inspector is Inspector David Bullas

          looking down directly above the central tunnel.




1314.50   Return   to shot of Leppings Lane   turnstiles at least four mounted

          officers in view moving amongst the crowd keeping the area clear

          for spectators to enter through the turnstiles.




1315.09   General shot along Penistone Road North along Halifax Road -

          footpath quite full of spectators - spectators stepping out into

          the roadway from the footpath but moving quietly and calmly
          towards the ground.



1316.58   Return to shot outisde Leppings Lane turnstiles.   Relatively

          free of people outside turnstiles.   People making their way

          through the turnstiles - being searched at random by police

          officers inside the ground.




1318.05   Return to Leppings Lane turnstiles - Mounted officers making

          sweep across area outside turnstiles - moving people on towards

          turnstiles.



1320.20   Individuals moving freely through Leppings Lane turnstiles and

          into the ground.



1321.25   Leppings Lane turnstiles - larger crowds outside but mounted

          officers moving amongst them breaking those crowds up.




1321.43   Penistone Road North - traffic moving freely - football

          supporters moving towards ground from all directions.




1322.27   Again evidence of individuals not large groups standing around

          outside Leppings Lane turnstiles although steady stream of

          people into the ground through those turnstiles.




1322.46   Junction of Penistone Road North and Herries Road - footpaths in

          this area quite densely packed with spectators making their way

          towards the ground.




1323.30   Return to Leppings Lane turnstiles - mounted police officers
           continue to sweep across the area outside the turnstiles,

           thereby keeping people moving.




1323. 47   Penistone Road North - large groups of individuals walking

           towards football ground.




1326. 56   Leppings Lane turnstiles - mounted officers sweeping across      the

           area outside moving people on and into the ground.




1327. 05   Penistone Road North - outside the main turnstiles to the Spion

           Kop.     Crowd filling the footpatjeh in this area and spilling out

           into the roadway, the first lane of which has been cordoned off.

           No problems.




1327 ,50   Return    to shot of Leppings Lane   turnstiles - people moving in

           through turnstiles.     Numbers of people gathering outsidetthough

           continually swept along by mounted police officers.




1329 .58   Return    to shot of Leppings Lane   terracing with West stand seated

           enclosure atop them.     No sign now of people sitting on the

           terracing, continual stream of people entering the terracing

           through the central tunnel.     No sign of dense packing.




1330 .20   Return    to shot of Leppings Lane   turnstiles - at least 5 mounted

           police officers visible - no problems outside the turnstiles.




1331.32    Outside Leppings Lane turnstiles - 1 mounted police officer has

           positioned himself near to the fence that separates turnstiles 1

           - 16 from turnstiles A - G.     This acts as a sort of breaker for
          crowds there moving towards the turnstiles and       they break and

          move round the police horse as they move towards the turnstile.




1332.31   Return to shot of Leppings Lane terraces - you can only see the

          back of the terraces and the front of the seated enclosure

          together in the same shot, the rear of the terraces looks as

          though there are quite a number of people standing on the

          terraces now.




1332.54   Leppings Lane turnstiles - area around turnstiles A - G appears

          clear, area around turnstiles 1 - 1 6   may be less clear of

          people.




1333.58   Return to shot of Leppings Lane terraces and West stand seating

          enclosure.   Police officers still adjacent to the Howarth Timber

          sign with their backs to the terracing looking up into the

          seated enclosure. The Inspector further along, Inspector Bullas

          appears to be looking down into the terraced area.




1335.21   Leppings Lane turnstiles - relatively trouble free - individuals

          making their way into the turnstiles forming orderly queues -

          mounted police officers at the mouth of the turnstile area

          adjacent to Leppings Lane itself.




1335.46   View along Penistone Road North - towards Leppings Lane island -

          a coach parked on the left hand side, the near side of the road,

          a police motor cyclist turns off Penistone Road North into the

          main emergency service entrance to the ground - crowd whilst
          filling the pavement is moving freely towards the football

          stadium.




1336.15   Shot inside the ground - South stand enclosure - no problems.




1336.21   Leppings Lane terracing and seating enclosure above it -

          terracing now appears to be filling up although plenty of room

          to move round immediately to the right of the picture is a young

          man dressed in dark jumper wearing a hat who is jumping around

          on the terracing thereby giving the indication that there is

          plenty of room to move around on the terracing - police officers

          still in attendance on the seated enclosure above.




1336.56   Leppings Lane turnstiles   - moving very freely - mounted police

          officers still doing their work.




1337.53   Leppings Lane turnstiles   - a coach and a motor cycle outrider

          moves out of the service road from the rear of the South stand

          and turns left into Leppings Lane.




1339.02   Leppings Lane turnstiles   - relatively free - a dark coloured

          estate car pulled off Leppings Lane onto the pedestrian concorge

          in front of the turnstiles - now reverses off and moves onto

          Leppings Lane itself.




1339.24   Penistone Road North looking towards Halifax Road - van moves

          into Penistone Road North turning left out of the emergency

          services gate to the stadium.
1340.00   Return to Leppings Lane turnstiles - crowd beginning to build up

          outside - lots of indications of people standing around outside

          but indications also of free access into the turnstiles and thus

          into the ground.




1340.57   Camera inside the ground pans across to the North-east corner of

          the Spion Kop.




1341.06   Switch to Leppings Lane turnstiles - crowd beginning to gather -

          not significant - no problems.   Crowd standing on footpath on

          Leppings Lane across the road from the turnstiles.




1341.40   Shot of Penistone Road North - 2 mounted police officers central

          reservation walking towards Halifax Road.




1341.50   Shot of exit gate V and standing spectators round that exit

          gate.

          That exit gate has now been placed at the North-east corner of

          the Spion Kop, a triangle that stands between the Kop itself and

          the North stand.




1344.20   Change camera position to Leppings Lane turnstiles - crowd

          moving freely outside and individuals coming through the

          turnstiles.




1343.19   Leppings Lane terracing and seating enclosure above.   Leppings

          Lane terracing appears to be getting more full - police officers

          still in attendance in seating enclosure above looking down now
          into the terraced area.




1343.43   Groups beginning to amass outside Leppings Lane turnstiles.




1344.45   The group on the previous shot moves through into the ground

          through Leppings Lane turnstiles - police officers inside the

          ground continue to search individual spectators coming into the

          ground.




1345.08   Shot along Penistone Road North - steady stream of customers

          moving towards turnstiles giving entrance to the ground.




1345.22   Shot of terracing around exit gate V Spion Kop end of the

          ground.   All calm - plenty of room on terraces.




1345.55   Leppings Lane turnstiles - mounted police officers continue to

          sweep the area - people moving freely through and into the

          ground.




1347.00   Leppings Lane turnstiles - people moving freely through into the

          ground.




1348.01   Leppings Lane terraces and seating enclosure above - across the

          front of the seating enclosure is a row of spectators

          interspersed with police officers looking down over the

          terracing into the ground.   Terraces appear quite full at this

          stage.




1349.30   Leppings Lane terraces - the camera only picks up the rear half

          dozen rows of the terraces which appear to be quite full.
1349.45   Leppings Lane turnstiles - mounted officers continue to work

          outside the ground - constant stream of people now coming

          through the turnstiles - occasional individual picked by police

          officers for search.




1350.05   Penistone Road North looking up towards Halifax Road - constant

          stream of people moving towards the stadium.     Peogeot 309 motor

          car turn left from Penistone Road North and into the emergency

          services gate on the Penistone Road North side of the ground.




1350.46   Leppings Lane turnstiles - build up of crowd outside turnstiles.

          Footpaths leading towards the ground quite densely packed with

          people but still steady and unrestricted access into the ground

          permitted.    Individuals moving through tunrstiles - being

          searched by police officers inside the ground.




1351.17   Penistone Road North - coach putting down passengers outside the

          stadium.




1351.57   Leppings Lane terracing - reasonably full at this stage.      2

          police officers immediately adjacent to Howarth Timber sign

          looking down on the crowd.    Inspector Bullas still in view at

          this stage.




1352.18   Leppings Lane turnstiles - significant numbers beginning to

          gather outside the turnstiles approximately 2/300 in number,

          many of whom aren't making their way towards the turnstiles

          although there is a constant stream of people through the
           turnstiles.




1353. 25   Return to shot of Leppings Lane terraces - Inspector Bullas

           standing above an advertising hording beginning with the letter

           P - appears to be looking down carefully on the crowd below him.




1353. 43   Leppings Lane turnstiles - many of the crowd have now moved away

           from this area leaving unrestricted access into the turnstiles.




1354 ,50   Leppings Lane terraces and seating enclosure above - many more

           people in the seating enclosure, not sitting down but standing

           at the edge overlooking the terracing down over the ground.

           Police officers still in attendance.




1355 .08   Influx of people at the Leppings Lane turnstiles - majority of

           whom are in fact moving steadily in orderly queues towards the

           turnstiles and into the ground.    Appears larger build-up of a

           crowd at turnstiles 1 - 1 6   other than turnstiles A - G.




1356 .18   Leppings Lane terraces - people still moving through the central

           tunnel and into the terracing.    Appears reasonably full on the

           terraces from this particular angle.




1356 .37   Leppings Lane turnstiles - people moving freely towards the

           turnstiles and into the ground.




1357.46    Leppings Lane terraces - camera angle moved slightly again to

           take in more of the seating area and less of the terraced

           standing area.
1358.00   Leppings Lane turnstiles - 2 double decked coaches in view on

          Leppings Lane apparently stopped, apparently putting down

          passengers into Leppings Lane.    General crowd moving towards

          turnst iles.



1359.13   Leppings Lane turnstiles - 2 double decked buses now stopped and

          are indeed putting down passengers who are moving towards the

          turnst iles.




1400.15   Leppings Lane terraces and the seating enclosure above - camera

          angle takes in even less of the terrace area therefore difficult

          to judge on packing in the terraces, youth approximately 17

          years of age wearing dark clothing standing atop the wall which

          forms the buttress at the end of the tunnel and juts into centre

          south enclosure.     Police Sergeant taking very particular note of

          the crowd on the terracing below him from the west stand seating

          enclosure above.




1401.42   Return to Leppings Lane terracing - Police Sergeant standing

          above a sign that begins with the letter P - difficult to see

          what it says - appears to be leaning over and speaking to

          somebody in the crowd in the terraces below him.




1402.03   2 coaches still in position at the Leppings Lane turnstiles,

          general crowd moving towards the turnstiles, more people in

          turnstiles 1 - 1 6   than in the turnstiles area A - G.




1403.06   Leppings Lane turnstiles - large group of people moving along

          Leppings Lane taking up much of the roadway, walking south
          towards the stadium and orderly queues making their way to the

          turnst iles.



1404.13   Constant stream of people coming through turnstiles, very

          orderly, making their way towards the turnstiles, queuing

          arrangements and mounted police officers in view standing near

          to the roadway at the edge of the concotge area outside the

          turnst iles.




1404.35   General view along Penistone Road North near to turnstiles,

          people making their way into turnstiles.




1404.48   New camera shot of terracing - unable to say which    terracing -

          moving up to bring into view exit gate V, so from earlier I am

          able to say that this is the area around the north-east corner

          of the Spion Kop.    At least 8 police officers in view at this

          stage.     Police officers appear to be forming a cordon separating

          1 part of the terraced enclosure from another one directly above

          ext gate V.     Camera remained trained on these officers until

          1412.54.     Part of this serial of officers then move amongst the

          crowd on the Spion Kop.




1413.04   12 police officers move down into the crowd on the    Spion Kop and

          out through exit gate V.     Difficult to see whether anyone was

          arrested by these police officers on route or whether they were

          just making their way out of the ground to a different part of

          the ground.




1414.00   Camera pans back to original position showing police officers

          atop exit gate V forming a cordon between one section of the
          crowd on the terraced kop and another section of the crowd.

          Camera remains trained on this position until 1418.38 then

          changes camera position to terracing - unable to see which at

          this stage - relatively empty terracing at the front of the

          Leppings Lane end of the ground.     Unable to say which enclosure

          of the Leppings Lane terraces this camera is trained upon but

          the terraces are very sparsely populated, people able to move up

          and down two or three steps talking to friends.      A great deal of

          space around each spectator.     Time now 1419.46.




1419.54   This particular shot shows clearly the well effect at the bottom

          of the Leppings Lane terraces.     The terraces go down to a wall

          that separates the terraces from a perimeter track around the

          actual playing area from the people standing around this area,

          it is apparent that on going to the bottom of the terracing

          anyone of below average height would be unable to see over the

          wall and onto the playing area.

          Camera remains trained on this view.




1421.20   Shot clearly displays the perimeter fencing stanchions upon

          which the perimeter fencing is fastened and the distance between

           this perimeter fencing and the start of the terracing.




1421.42   Bottom right corner of shot shows stanchion leg protruding into

           the terracing upon which the perimeter fencing is supported.

           Spectators appear very happy, very high spirited, raising hands,

           clapping, pointing, laughing - no problems at this point.
1423.45   Return to shot inside ground of officer cordon on north east

          corner of Spion Kop.




1431.00   Camera angle slightly moved down from this point to reveal

          apparent transfer between enclosures, directly below where

          police officers standing so obviously permitted by them.

          This camera angle remains until 1435.20.       Then close up of

          heavily packed very dense crowd behind Leppings Lane turnstiles.

          Mounted police officers in midst of this crowd, but crowd packed

          very tightly around them.   Mounted police officers very close to

          perimeter gates separating the concorge in front of the

          turnstiles from Leppings Lane proper.    Signs are on the left of

          the picture that the left most perimeter gates have been closed

          by police officers and police officers stand behind these gates.

          Mounted police officers moving amongst crowd.




1436.00   The film appears to go   into 'slow motion'.




1437.39   Camera pans back to show full extent of crowd at      this point

          individuals coming through the turnstiles, the four turnstiles

          closest to exit gate C are in full and and clear      view and

          individuals are moving   through those turnstiles.     The scene is

          one of tightly congested crowds from Leppings Lane roadway right

          up to the turnstiles in areas marked by turnstiles 1 - 1 6        and

          turnstiles A - G.   The service road which links Leppings Lane

          with the rear of South stand is still barriered off, the crowds

          come right up to the barrier and stretch back into the roadway

          on Leppings Lane.   There are signs now 1442.50 of youths scaling
           the turnstile walls on the outside and climbing over into the

           ground.   Turnstiles still apparently operational.   I can see all

           turnstiles perhaps with the exception of turnstile A in u s e .   A

           police officer is standing beside turnstile A.




1446.03    Upwards of 20 youths now standing on the roof of the turnstiles

           having scaled the out side wall and looking now to jump down and

           are jumping down into the main body of people in this concorjje

           between the turnstiles and the entrance to the terracing.     Some

           perimeter gates 1447.36 caip% still be seen to be closed although

           it is difficult to see whether all perimeter gates across the

           mouth of the concorsje in front of the turnstiles are open.




1444.32?   Signs of crowd swaying outside the turnstile - situation now

           looks very difficult to control - very densely packed crowd

           outside the turnstiles, youths scaling the wall continuously and

           climbing down into the concourse below having not passed through

           the turnstiles.   Can now see that all turnstiles 1446.37 all

           turnstiles A - G are in use and can just see to the right of the

           picture turnstiles 1 - 16, many of which are in use, diffuclt to

           see which are being used and which aren't.




1448.00    Youths continue to come over the external turnstile wall.




1452.30    Exit gate C has been opened and there is a crocodile of people

           encouraged by mounted police officers to move in through exit

           gate C thereby not passing through the turnstiles.    There is

           absolutely no rush with this group of people as they enter in
          the gate they circulate in the concourse between the turnstiles

          and the entrance to the ground, some stand around waiting,

          police officers attempting to move them on, others walk across

          the camera angle from the left to right.




1453.43   Signs of many of the group entering by exit gate C, moving down

          to the South entrance to the Leppings Lane terraces.

          Individuals still coming through the turnstiles.     The area

          outside turnstiles A - G appears to be much clearer although

          looking over the top to turnstiles 1 - 1 6   the situation appears

          to be very much the same there with densely packed crowds.




1454.20   Shot of an Inspector speaking into a police radio    standing on

          top of the terracing inviting youths climbing the    terrace walls

          to get over and into the ground.   There is a sway amongst the

          crowd at 1454.37 amongst the crowd outside turnstiles 1 - 1 6 .

          It appears very uncomfortable    for those crowds standing outside

          there.   The perimeter gates I   can see around these turnstiles 1

          - 16 have not been closed, they are open at 1454.36.




1454.47   After a period of a minute or    two running normally the film now

          moves into 'slow motion' format.




1455.00   The exit gate C is still open    and crowds of people move from the

          perimeter fences around Leppings Lane turnstiles down the

          service road and into entrance gate C, but there is no signs of

          any panic or rush amongst these crowds.
1456.15   Close up of individuals standing atop of the turnstiles shouting

          to people below.   Youths still clambering over.




1456.36   Exit gate C still open and individuals moving in to the

          concourse between the turnstiles and the ground.     Appear to be a

          lot of people standing around in that concourse, milling around,

          people aren't moving rapidly or directly as a crowd towards the

          entrance to the spectator area.




1457.38   Signs now of mounted police officers having stended      the flow of

          people in from the perimeter gate area towards the turnstiles.




1458.05   Left hand corner of the picture shows the area in front        of

          turnstiles A - G is now more or less clear of people.




1458.28   Still a huge crowd outside turnstiles 1 - 1 6   moving   in,

          obviously moving from an exit gate - difficult to see which one

          - presumably exit gate B because the number of people coming

          through at that point beyond the wall which separates the

          concourse between the turnstiles and the terracing area, there

          are signs of more people moving through that area than could be

          accommodated through the turnstiles, signifies exit gate B open.

          Now group of individuals moving quickly round from the area

          around in front of turnstiles 1 - 1 6 ,   round most definitely exit

          gate B, where a mounted police officer is on duty and is

          allowing people to move into the ground through exit gate B.

          Exit gate C now appears to have been closed, nobody is entering

          through exit gate C, the time now is 1500.35.      The crowd around
          turnstiles A - G has thoroughly dispersed and is moving quite

          freely outside now, individuals are moving freely through all

          turnstiles A - G.      It appears, although it is difficult to see

          because of the distance from the camera that turnstiles 1 - 1 6

          remain in operation and people are moving through there.      The

          time now is 1501.43 and the scene in the concourse that

          separates the turnstiles from the entrance to the spectator

          areas is one of relative calm.      Still many people but not a huge

          crowd.   Still individuals climbing over the terracing and

          dropping down into the ground.




1502.07    Police Inspector now climbing down from the position he occupied

          above the turnstiles near to the top of turnstile 16.




1502.34    People still moving into the ground through exit gate C which is

          now open, throough the turnstiles A - G and through the

          turnstiles 1 - 1 6 .    The crowd outside the turnstiles and the

          concourse between there and Leppings Lane now appears to have

          diminished.



1502.53    Switch camera position to inside ground front of Leppings Lane

          terraces, individuals climbing over perimeter fencing and onto

          the perimeter track around the playing area, the camera angle is

          such that it just shows the top of the perimeter fencing it is

          therefore difficult to see what is happening on the inside of

          those perimeter fencing sections that is inside the terraced

          area.    Outside of the perimeter fencing individuals are milling

          around, climbing over the fencing, getting through the emergency
           exit gates, which are clearly shown to be opened.




1504. 30   Sergeant Howard Swift of Barnsley seen to be helping people out

           through the emergency exit gate and onto the playing area.




1505. 00   Individuals still continue to climb over perimeter fencing,

           pulling    others up by the arms behind them, very difficult to see

           what is    happening on the terracing itself inside the perimeter

           fencing.




1505. 57   Youth sitting astride the perimeter fencing looking around.




1506. 17   He and another youth helping people out over the perimeter

           fencing.     The top of the perimeter fencing at 1506.33 has a

           covering of people leaning back from the playing area and

           leaning in towards the spectator areapulling people        out from

           the crowd.     Police officers continually   move in   from out of

           camera shot towards the perimeter fencing attempting to get

           through    to perimeter fencing.




1507 49    Inspector Newey,   'C ' Division comes into view walking towards

           perimeter fencing playing area.




1508 15    Special    Constabulary Commandant appears to left hand of screen

           moving towards perimeter fencing.     Individuals still climbing

           over perimeter fencing.




1508 40    Film speeds up for a few seconds.

1509 .00   Returns to    normal.
1509.30   Exposure of film at this stage appears over-exposed and

          difficult to make out individuals for the glare from the camera.

          Police officers and civilians alike still working at the

          perimeter fencing to help people out of the spectator area.




1510.20   2 Police officers clamber onto top of fencing, discard helmets

          and reach down to help people in the enclosures below.     Many

          police officers amongst the group now assembled.




1511.20   Again film speeds up for a few seconds returning to this    'slow

          motion' play at 1511.40.




1512.50   Sign of police officer right hand corner of shot, may be Chief

          Inspector.



1513.33   Police officers climbing over the fence and into the spectator

          area below.




1514.11   Another police officer climbs over and into spectator area below

          as civilian individuals are climbing out of the spectator

          enclosure and onto the playing area.




1515.36   Police officers continue to climb fencing, stretching over,

          reaching people out.




1515.54   Ambulance first comes into view, pulls up alongside perimeter

          fencing, police officers continuing to pull individuals out over

          the perimeter fencing.
1516.50    Supervisory officer appears to be Chief Inspector Creaser, moves

           across shot.




1517.45    Centre of shot shows officer wearing flat hat helping

           individuals out of the pen and onto the perimeter track.




1518.57    Police officers climb on top of perimeter fencing, climb back

           down onto perimeter track.




1519.29    Special Constabulary Commandant moving in near to emergency exit

           gate.




1519.58    Now apparently more police officers and civilians assisting in

           the operation.




1520.24    Flat hatted police officer, identified as Superintendent

           Greenwood in possession of loud hailer climbs on top of fencing

           apparently trying to organise the efforts inside the spectator

           enclosure.




 1521.57   Special Officer clearly in view in centre of shot close by exit

           gate .




 1523.35    Efforts still continuing on perimeter track although series of

            individuals climbing over the perimeter fencing now appears to

            have ceased.    Camera angle is such that it is impossible to see

            into the spectator enclosure, one can merely see over the top of
           the perimeter fencing to the perimeter track.




1525. 48   Camera angle shifts - now looking from the South side of the

           ground towards the Leppings Lane end goal and beyond the crowd

           on the terraces standing behind the Leppings Lane end goal.

           Ambulance is still in position at the rear of the Leppings Lane

           end goal and Leppings Lane terraces are apparently sparsely

           populated     in the central enclosures.   People are moving around

           quite freely on the terraces.




1527. 24   Signs now of advertising hoarding boards being used as make

           shift stretchers.     Individuals carrying hoardings move into view

           towards the area behind Leppings Lane end goal and     then carrying

           away prostrate bodies on the hoardings away to off     camera right.




1528 .46   Many hundreds of people on the playing area itself, the terraced

           area behind the goal is out of focus and it is difficult to

           define what is happening on the terraces.




1531 .12   Crowd still milling around on playing area.




1531 .26   Ambulance moves away from behind Leppings Lane end     goal, large

           crowd still in camera view.     Terracing behind goal appears

           relatively loosely packed.




1532 .35   Tape Ends .
1340 00    Return to Leppings Lane turnstiles - crowd beginning to build up

           outside - lots of indications of people standing around outside

           but indications also of free access into the turnstiles and thus

           into the ground.




1340 57    Camera inside the ground pans across to the North-east corner of

           the Spion Kop.




1341 ,06   Switch to Leppings Lane turnstiles - crowd beginning to gather -

           not significant - no problems.   Crowd standing on footpath on

           Leppings Lane across the road from the turnstiles.




1341 40    Shot of Penistone Road North - 2 mounted police officers central

           reservation walking towards Halifax Road.




1341 50    Shot of exit gate V and standing spectators round that exit

           gate.

           That exit gate has now been placed at the North-east corner of

           the Spion Kop, a triangle that stands between the Kop itself and

           the North stand.




1344 20    Change camera position to Leppings Lane turnstiles - crowd

           moving freely outside and individuals coming through the

           turnstiles.




1343.19    Leppings Lane terracing and seating enclosure above.   Leppings

           Lane terracing appears to be getting more full - police officers

           still in attendance in seating enclosure above looking down now
          into the terraced area.




1343 43   Groups beginning to amass    outside Leppings Lane turnstiles.




1344 45   The group on the previous    shot moves through into the ground

          through Leppings Lane turnstiles - police officers inside the

          ground continue to search individual spectators coming into the

          ground.




1345 08   Shot along Penistone Road North - steady stream of customers

          moving towards turnstiles giving entrance to the ground.




1345 22   Shot of terracing around exit gate V Spion Kop end of the

          ground.    All calm - plenty of room on terraces.




1345 55   Leppings   Lane turnstiles - mounted police officers continue to

          sweep the area - people moving freely through and into the

          ground.




1347 00   Leppings   Lane turnstiles - people moving freely through into the

          ground.




1348 01   Leppings   Lane terraces and seating enclosure above - across the

          front ofthe seating enclosure is a row of spectators

          interspersed with police officers looking down over the

          terracing into the ground.    Terraces appear quite full at this

          stage.




1349 30   Leppings   Lane terraces - the camera only picks up the rear half

          dozen rows of the terraces which appear to be quite full.
1349 45       Leppings Lane turnstiles - mounted officers continue to work

              outside the ground - constant stream of people now coming

              through the turnstiles - occasional individual picked by police

              officers for search.




1350 05       Penistone Road North looking up towards Halifax Road - constant

              stream of people moving towards the stadium.     Peogeot 309 motor

              car turn left from Penistone Road North and into the emergency

              services gate on the Penistone Road North side of the ground.




1350 46       Leppings Lane turnstiles - build up of crowd outside turnstiles.

              Footpaths leading towards the ground quite densely packed with

              people but still steady and unrestricted access into the ground

              permitted.    Individuals moving through tunrstiles - being

              searched by police officers inside the ground.




1351 17       Penistone Road North - coach putting down passengers outside      the

              stadium.




1351 57       Leppings Lane terracing - reasonably full at this stage.      2

              police officers immediately adjacent to Howarth Timber sign

              looking down on the crowd.    Inspector Bullas still in view at

              this stage.

          r


1352 18       Leppings Lane turnstiles - significant numbers beginning to

              gather outside the turnstiles approximately 2/300 in number,

              many of whom aren't making their way towards the turnstiles

              although there is a constant stream of people through the
          turnstiles.




1353.25   Return to shot of Leppings Lane terraces - Inspector Bullas

          standing above an advertising hording beginning with the letter

          P - appears to be looking down carefully on the crowd below him.




1353.43   Leppings Lane turnstiles - many of the crowd have now moved away

          from this area leaving unrestricted access into the turnstiles.




1354.50   Leppings Lane terraces and seating enclosure above - many more

          people in the seating enclosure, not sitting down but standing

          at the edge overlooking the terracing down over the ground.

          Police officers still in attendance.




1355.08   Influx of people at the Leppings Lane turnstiles - majority     of

          whom are in fact moving steadily in orderly queues towards the

          turnstiles and into the ground.      Appears larger build-up of a

          crowd at   turnstiles 1 - 1 6   other than turnstiles A - G.




1356.18   Leppings   Lane terraces - people still moving through the central

          tunnel and into the terracing.      Appears reasonably full on the

          terraces from this particular angle.




1356.37   LeppingsLane turnstiles - people moving freely towards the

          turnstiles and into the ground.




1357.46   Leppings Lane terraces - camera angle moved slightly again to

          take in more of the seating area and less of the terraced

          standing area.
1358.00   Leppings Lane turnstiles - 2 double decked coaches in view on

          Leppings Lane apparently stopped, apparently putting down

          passengers into Leppings Lane.     General crowd moving towards

          turnstiles.




1359.13   Leppings Lane turnstiles - 2 double decked buses now stopped and

          are indeed putting down passengers who are moving towards the

          turnst iles.




1400.15   Leppings Lane terraces and the seating enclosure above - camera

          angle takes in even less of the terrace area therefore difficult

          to judge on packing in the terraces, youth approximately 17

          years of age wearing dark clothing standing atop the wall which

          forms the buttress at the end of the tunnel and juts into centre

          south enclosure.     Police Sergeant taking very particular note of

          the crowd on the terracing below him from the west stand seating

          enclosure above .




1401.42   Return to Leppings Lane terracing - Police Sergeant standing

          above a sign that begins with the letter P - difficult to see

          what it says - appears to be leaning over and speaking to

          somebody in the crowd in the terraces below him.




1402.03   2 coaches still in position at the Leppings Lane turnstiles,

          general crowd moving towards the turnstiles, more people in

          turnstiles 1 - 1 6   than in the turnstiles area A - G.




1403.06   Leppings Lane turnstiles - large group of people moving along

          Leppings Lane taking up much of the roadway, walking south
           towards the stadium and orderly queues making their way to the

          .-turnstiles ••




1404.13   Constant stream of people coming through turnstiles, very

          orderly, making their way towards the turnstiles, queuing

           arrangements and mounted police officers in view standing near

           to the roadway at the edge of the concorce area outside the
                                                  /\
          turnst iles.




1404.35   General view along Penistone Road North near      to turnstiles,

          people making their way into turnstiles.




1404.48   New camera shot of terracing - unable to say which terracing -

          moving up to bring into view exit gate V, so from earlier I am

          able to say that this is the area around the north-east corner

          of the Spion Kop.      At least 8 police officers in view at this

          stage.     Police officers appear to be forming a cordon separating

          1 part of the terraced enclosure from another one directly above

          ext gate V.       Camera remained trained on these officers until

          1412.54.     Part of this serial of officers then move amongst the

          crowd on the Spion Kop.




1413.04   12 police officers move down into the crowd on the Spion Kop and

          out through exit gate V.       Difficult to see whether anyone was

          arrested by these police officers on route or whether they were

          just making their way out of the ground to a different part of

          the ground.




1414.00   Camera pans back to original position showing police officers

          atop exit gate V forming a cordon between one section of the
           crowd on the terraced kop and another section of the crowd.

           Camera remains trained on this position until 1418.38 then

           changes camera position to terracing - unable to see which at

           this stage - relatively empty terracing at the front of the

           Leppings Lane end of the ground.     Unable to say which enclosure

           of the Leppings Lane terraces this camera is trained upon but

           the terraces are very sparsely populated, people able to move up

           and down two or three steps talking to friends.      A great deal of

           space around each spectator.     Time now 1419.46.




1419 .54   This particular shot shows clearly the well effect at the bottom

           of the Leppings Lane terraces.     The terraces go down to a wall

           that separates the terraces from a perimeter track around the

           actual playing area from the people standing around this area,

           it is apparent that on going to the bottom of the terracing

           anyone of below average height would be unable to see over the

           wall and onto the playing area.

           Camera remains trained on this view.




1421 .20   Shot clearly displays the perimeter fencing stanchions upon

           which the perimeter fencing is fastened and the distance between

           this perimeter fencing and the start of the terracing.




1421 ,42   Bottom right corner of shot shows stanchion leg protruding into

           the terracing upon which the perimeter fencing is supported.

           Spectators appear very happy, very high spirited, raising hands,

           clapping, pointing, laughing - no problems at this point.
1423.45   Return to shot inside ground of officer cordon on north east

          corner of Spion Kop.




1431.00   Camera angle slightly moved down from this point to reveal

          apparent transfer between enclosures, directly below where

          police officers standing so obviously permitted by them.

          This camera angle remains until 1435.20.       Then close up of

          heavily packed very dense crowd behind Leppings Lane turnstiles.

          Mounted police officers in midst of this crowd, but crowd packed

          very tightly around them.    Mounted police officers very close to
                                                u
          perimeter gates separating the concorge in front of the

          turnstiles from Leppings Lane proper.     Signs are on the left of

          the picture that the left most perimeter gates have been closed

          by police officers and police officers stand behind these gates.

          Mounted police officers moving amongst crowd.




1436.00   The film appears to go   into 'slow motion'.




1437.39   Camera pans back to show full extent of crowd at      this point

          individuals coming through the turnstiles, the four turnstiles

          closest to exit gate C   are in full and and clear view and

          individuals are moving   through those turnstiles.     The scene is

          one of tightly congested crowds from Leppings Lane roadway right

          up to the turnstiles in areas marked by turnstiles 1 - 1 6     and

          turnstiles A - G.   The service road which links Leppings Lane

          with the rear of South stand is still barriered off, the crowds

          come right up to the barrier and stretch back into the roadway

          on Leppings Lane.   There are signs now 1442.50 of youths scaling
           the turnstile walls on the outside and climbing over into the

           ground.   Turnstiles still apparently operational.   I can see all

           turnstiles perhaps with the exception of turnstile A in use.     A

           police officer is standing beside turnstile A.




1446.03    Upwards of 20 youths now standing on the roof of the turnstiles

           having scaled the outside wall and looking now to jump down and

           are jumping down into the main body of people in this concorce

           between the turnstiles and the entrance to the terracing.     Some

           perimeter gates 1447.36 cai^ still be seen to be closed although

           it is difficult to see whether all perimeter gates across the
                            'A
           mouth of the concorce in front of the turnstiles are open.




1444.32?   Signs of crowd swaying outside   the turnstile - situation now

           looks very difficult to control - very densely packed crowd

           outside the turnstiles, youths scaling the wall continuously and

           climbing down into the concourse below having not passed through

           the turnstiles.   Can now see that all turnstiles 1446.37 all

           turnstiles A - G are in use and can just see to the right of the

           picture turnstiles 1 - 16, many of which are in use, diffuclt to

           see which are being used and which aren't.




1448.00    Youths continue to come over the external turnstile wall.




1452.30    Exit gate C has been opened and there is a crocodile of people

           encouraged by mounted police officers to move in through exit

           gate C thereby not passing through the turnstiles.   There is

           absolutely no rush with this group of people as they enter in
           the gate they circulate in the concourse between the turnstiles

          .<aad the entrance to the ground, some stand around waiting,

           police officers attempting to move them on, others walk across

           the camera angle from the left to right.




1453.43   Signs of many of the group entering by exit gate C, moving down

           to the South entrance to the Leppings Lane terraces.

           Individuals still coming through the turnstiles.     The area

           outside turnstiles A - G appears to be much clearer although

           looking over the top to turnstiles 1 - 1 6   the situation appears

           to be very much the same there with densely packed crowds.




1454.20   Shot of an Inspector speaking into a police radio     standing on

          top of the terracing inviting youths climbing the     terrace walls

          to get over and into the ground.   There is a sway    amongst the

          crowd at 1454.37 amongst the crowd outside turnstiles 1 - 16.

          It appears very uncomfortable   for those crowds standing outside

          there.   The perimeter gates I can see around these   turnstiles 1

          - 16 have not been closed, they are open at 1454.36.




1454.47   After a period of a minute or   two running normally the film now

          moves into 'slow motion' format.




1455.00   The exit gate C is still open   and crowds of people move from the

          perimeter fences around Leppings Lane turnstiles down the

          service road and into entrance gate C, but there is no signs of

          any panic or rush amongst these crowds.
1456.15    •Close up of individuals standing atop of the turnstiles shouting

           to people below.   Youths still clambering over.




1456 ,36   Exit gate C still open and individuals moving in to the

           concourse between the turnstiles and the ground.      Appear to be a

           lot of people standing around in that concourse, milling around’,

           people aren't moving rapidly or directly as a crowd towards the

           entrance to the spectator area.




1457 ,38   Signs now of mounted police officers having stended the flow of

           people in from the perimeter gate area towards the turnstiles.




1458 .05   Left hand corner of the picture shows the area in front of

           turnstiles A - G is now more or less clear of people.




1458 .28   Still a huge crowd outside turnstiles 1 - 1 6   moving in,

           obviously moving from an exit gate - difficult to see which one

           - presumably exit gate B because the number of people coming

           through at that point beyond the wall which separates the

           concourse between the turnstiles and the terracing area, there

           are signs' of more people moving through that area than could be

           accommodated through the turnstiles, signifies exit gate B open.

           Now group of individuals moving quickly round from the area

           around in front of turnstiles 1 - 1 6 ,   round most definitely exit

           gate B, where a mounted police officer is on duty and is

           allowing people to move into the ground through exit gate B.

           Exit gate C now appears to have been closed, nobody is entering

           through exit gate C, the time now is 1500.35.     The crowd around
          turnstiles A - G has thoroughly dispersed and is moving quite

          freely outside now, individuals are moving freely through all

          turnstiles A - G.      It appears, although it is difficult to see

          because of the distance from the camera that turnstiles 1 - 1 6

          remain in operation and people are moving through there.      The

          time now is 1501.43 and the scene in the concourse that

          separates the turnstiles from the entrance to the spectator

          areas is one of relative calm.     Still many people but not a huge

          crowd.    Still individuals climbing over the terracing and

          dropping down into the ground.




1502.07   Police Inspector now climbing down from the position he occupied

          above the turnstiles near to the top of turnstile 16.




1502.34   People still moving into the ground through exit gate C which is

          now open, throough the turnstiles A - G and through the

          turnstiles 1 - 1 6 .   The crowd outside the turnstiles and the

          concourse between there and Leppings Lane now appears to have

          diminished.




1502.53   Switch camera position to inside ground front of Leppings Lane

          terraces, individuals climbing over perimeter fencing and onto

          the perimeter track around the playing area, the camera angle is

          such that it just shows the top of the perimeter fencing it is

          therefore difficult to see what is happening on the inside of

          those perimeter fencing sections that is inside the terraced

          area.    Outside of the perimeter fencing individuals are milling

          around, climbing over the fencing, getting through the emergency
           exit gates, which are clearly shown to be opened.




1504 .30   Sergeant Howard Swift of Barnsley seen to be helping people out

           through the emergency exit gate and onto the playing area.




1505 .00   Individuals still continue to climb over perimeter fencing,

           pulling    others up by the arms behind them, very difficult to see

           what is happening on the terracing itself inside the perimeter

           fencing.




1505 .57   Youth sitting astride the perimeter fencing looking around.




1506 17    He and another youth helping people out over the perimeter

           fencing.     The top of the perimeter fencing at 1506.33 has a

           covering of people leaning back from the playing area and

           leaning in    towards the spectator areapulling people   out from

           the crowd.     Police officers continually move in   from out of

           camera shot towards the perimeter fencing attempting to get

           through    to perimeter fencing.




1507 49    Inspector Newey,   ’C'   Division comes into view walking towards

           perimeter fencing playing area.




1508 15    Special    Constabulary Commandant appears to left hand of screen

1535.08      Video tape begins.   Scenes on football pitch at Hillsborough

             camera in south stand area facing towards west stand.     Scenes of

             crowds milling around on that half of the playing area.

             Occasionally individuals carrying make shift stretchers are seen

             to cross the camera line of view.




1535.53      People pulling at netting at the rear of the Leppings Lane end

             goal, pulling it away from the posts and crossbars.




15.36.       Apparently hoardings at the front of the west stand seating

             enclosure are taken down, the hoarding immediately to the left

             of the Presto sign is taken down and dropped below.




1536.30      Fire Brigade officers moving freely in the centre enclosures of

             the Leppings Lane terraces.




1536.30      Concertive run by numerous supporters on the playing area

             towards the off camera area occupied by Nottingham Forest

             supporters, followed by police officers walking quickly towards

             them.
1536.54   Ambulance apparently South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance

          Service moves into view behind Leppings Lane goal.




1537.00   Hoardings including the Presto hoarding torn down and passed

          down to the crowds below in the west stand terrace area.     It is

          fair to say that from the beginning of this video the

          reproduction quality is not good and it appears over exposed and

          badly out of focus.




1538.25   Fire Brigade officers clearly seen moving freely in Leppings

          Lane terraces, crowd on playing area apparently milling around,




1538.13   Ambulance mentioned previously moves across camera heading

          towards north-east corner of stadium.




1539.25   3 Fire Brigade officers move quickly, almost running, across

          football pitch playing area towards north side of ground.




1540.57   Group of people holding a make shift stretcher made out of a

          hoarding run across pitch left to right running towards north

          east corner of stadium.




1541.37   It appears, looking towards the central enclosures of the

          Leppings Lane terraces that the centre south enclosure has been

          cleared to a much greater extent than the centre north
           enclosure.   In the centre north enclosure people are still

           relatively tightly but comfortably packed into the enclosure

           whereas the centre south enclosure has been emptied almost of

           football supporters.




1542. 24   Serial of police officers moving right to left across camera.

           Move out of view.




1542 .40   Still many, many police officers standing at the Leppings     Lane

           end of the ground between the goal posts and the perimeter

           fencing.




1543 ,33   Signs of people being helped out of the seating enclosure     at the

           west stand and dropped down into the standing enclosure.




1545       Still many people milling around on the playing area, difficult

           to see beyond these people to see what's actually happening in

           the terrace section of the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

           Fire Brigade personnel recognisable by their hats, moving freely

           amongst the terracing but all the activity taking place in the

           centre south section rather than the centre north enclosure.




1546 .29   4 Fire Brigade officers move right to left across camera.




1547.17    Many Fire Brigade officers moving around on the playing area,
          crowd appears to have thinned and the camera appears to have

          zoomed slightly more in towards the area of concern.   Still a

          large crowd between the goal and the perimeter fencing of the

          enclosures.




1547.56   Still noticable that the centre north enclosure is still

          relatively full with people whilst the centre south enclosure

          is, with the exception of 50 perhaps, has befhg cleared of

          people.

          playing area.
1552.58   Majority of police officers remain on pitch side of perimeter

          fencing.   Spectators still remain standing on Leppings Lane end

          terrace.




1555.17   More people than ever on the playing area just milling around,

          police officers apparently static behind Leppings Lane goal

          between goal and the perimeter fence and spectators remain

          static on the terrace itself.




1555.59   Spontaneous applause from spectators on terracing and standing

          on the football pitch, everyone looking towards south stand.

                             15 APRIL 1989

                    SUMMARY OF WEST MIDLANDS POLICE

                            COMPILATION TAPE

              VIEWED BY DETECTIVE SERGEANT 1262 PRIESTLEY

The tape is divided into a number of sections and compared with other
summaries the following include extra observations regarding Police
presence.

SECTION 1

This section is not timed and shows views of theLeppings Lane
turnstiles from a position on Leppings Laneitself. There are no
supporters and the film was probably taken well after the event.

It shows a view of all the turnstiles and the outer perimeter gates.
The camera views take us through Gate C and shows views of the West
Stand Enclosure to the centre tunnel leading to the terraces.
Further views are shown of Gate C and the A - G Turnstiles from within
the West Stand Enclosure and also the gap in the dividing wall within
this Enclosure. From the West Stand Enclosure behind the A - G
Turnstiles a view and verbal explanation is given how fans can gain
access to Pens 6 and 7 (through the gap in the dividing wall) and Pens 1
and 2 (via the corner of the West and South stands).
The Camera takes us through the centre tunnel and describes a slight
gradient up before going down to the pens.
Views are taken of Pens 3 and 4.

SECTION 2

This section is timed by use of the 24 hour clock and shows black and
white viewsof the Leppings Lane turnstiles area taken by a fixed camera
mounted on the stadiums structure. The views commence at 1402.37.

1402         Very few fans in the turnsile areas but fans are
              approaching the area along Leppings Lane from the
              direction of Penistone Road. They fill the pavements
              and although are spilling on to the roadway, they are not
              blocking the road and vehicles are being driven along it.
              Although the black and white pictures are not clear it
              shows Police Officers within the enclosure watching fans
              as they come through the A - G Turnstiles.
              It is not clearly defined but it appears groups of Police
              Officers are on Leppings Lane at the turnstile area and
              at least one mounted officer is present but at this stage
              there is no cause for concern as fans are still sparse.
1402.57       This section concludes.

SECTION 3

This section is not timed but the commemtator states the views start at
1424 and show Liverpool supporters in Halifax Road (at its junction with
Leppings Lane).   Two Police Officers can be seen watching the fans
pass. The section only plays for approximately one minute.
                                 - 2 -



SECTION 4

Views then return to the black and white film taken by the fixed camera
on the stadium's structure, which is timed. The views commenced at
1429.50.

In contrast to the previous views by the camera its shows a marked
increase in the number of supporters in the concourse areas of A - G
Turnstiles and 1 - 1 6 Turnstiles.

Police Officers are still in the enclosure observing fans coming through
the A - G Turnstiles. Three sets of turnstiles can be seen with two
Police Officers on two of the sets and one Police Officer on the other
set of turnstiles.

Fans are going through the outer perimeter gates towards the 1 - 1 6
turnstiles, but there appears to be some Police control at the outer
perimeter gates leading to the A - G Turnstiles. Mounted Officers are
in attendance. Fans are approaching the turnstile area from both
directions along Leppings Lane.

The river side of the concourse area of the A - G Turnstiles shows
plenty of space but in contrast the fans in the enclosure by the large
dividing fence, appear tight. Fans are building up outside the
perimeter gates. Inside the West Stand Enclosure the small view that is
given shows plenty of space with some fans remaining in the area.

1430.31      The tape then jumps to -

1432.52      and shows mounted officers at the open perimeter gates
             trying to control the crowd but fans stream through past
             the horses by the open perimeter gate nearest the large
             dividing fence causing the horses to "back away."

1433.00      It can be seen there is a concerted push by fans a little
             way back frcm the perimeter gates to cause those in front
             of them to force their way past the horses and into the
             concourse area. The mounted officers regain partial
             control at these gates but fans are still getting past
             them when the opportunity arises. This area in front of
             the A - G Turnstiles is obviously packed and is swaying
             with fans.

1433.10      Fans can be seen going through an open perimeter gate at
              the river side into the A - G concourse area. A mounted
              officer is present but fans still pour through. Another
              mounted officer is by the crowd near to Gate C and
              approximately four mounted officers are by the open
              perimeter gate near to the large dividing fence.

1433.38      Vehicles can be seen travelling along Leppings Lane.

1433.49      Shows clearer views of fans going through the open
             perimeter gates towards the 1 - 1 6 turnstiles. There is
             no apparent Police control at these particular open
             perimeter gates.
             Although the pictures are not clear and the crowd is
             dense, no foot officers are seen until -

1434.23      Which shows two foot officers on the outside of the
             perimeter gates, within the crowd. A number of Police
             Officers are on Leppings Lane on the outside of the crowd.
             (Four can be clearly seen)

1434.36      Shows views of the concourse area of the A - G turnstiles
             and it can be seen there is space by the river side, and
             some fans are leaving the area by the river side perimeter
             gate. However at -

1434.54      There clearly is a surge within this concourse area
             emanating from the crowd by the large dividing fence
             causing the fans to spill into the space by the riverside.
             The Police horse by the open perimeter gate near the river
             side is forced back away frcm the open gate. An officer
             of Inspector rank or above is at this open perimeter gate.

1435         Shows views around Gate C. A Mounted Sergeant is at this
             position. There are no fans around this gate, two foot
             officers are present. The mounted officer by the open
             perimeter gate is unable to control the influx of fans and
             they rush through as the officer speaks with one fan in
             the crowd.

1435.20      This section concludes.

SECTION 5

This section is timed but not by means of time of day by the 24 hour
clock. The timing commences at -

0558          and shows colour views of the fans at Leppings Lane
              (extracted from the BBC tapes) and commentary says it is
              from 1437.

             Attention is focused on the Leppings Lane end on the
             outside of the ground. The view shows a large amount of
             people in front of the Turnstiles A - G and Gate B, two
             mounted officers are at or near to Gate B. Inspector
             Purdy and two foot officers are near Gate G, there is
             is still room on the river side of this concourse area and
             people are walking about freely between the small metal
             barrier and the river.

0610          The tape jumps to -

0632          A mounted officer is near Gate B.

0633          Sees a young boy aged approximately 12 years climbing the
              wall at the side of Gate B, the outer corner of the wall.
              Fans are also seen to be on the dividing fencing which
              separates the concourse areas of 1 - 16 and A - G. The
              boy gets to the top of the wall, looks over and then
              climbs back down again.
                           - 4 -


0703   The tape jumps to 0729

0730   Fans are coming through the outer perimeter gates, going
       into the concourse area of the A - G turnstiles. Gates B
       and C clearly can be seen to be closed.

0741   Chief Inspector Creaser is in the area, fans are still
       ccming through the outer perimeter gates. Fans are on
       the fencing separating concourse areas 1 - 1 6 and A - G.
       One young boy climbing the outer perimeter gate, fans
       still entering through the outer perimeter gates, where
       mounted officer is present.

0822   Views of Leppings Lane outside the turnstile area where
       fans are congregating, although they are not compact on
       the roadway. Fans are coming along Leppings Lane from
       the Penistone Road area. Few Police Officers are in this
       crowd or near to it.

0838   Concourse area in front of Turnstiles 1 - 1 6 and A - G,
       there is heavy compaction in that area and fans are
       approaching from Leppings Lane. All perimeter gates are
       open and fans are going through. There are six mounted
       officers at the perimeter gates to the A - G turnstiles
       but fans are still going through, there are two mounted
       officers at or near Gate B. There is at least one foot
       officer by the outer perimeter gate at the river side and
       an officer of Inspector rank or above is nearby (probably
       Inspector Sykes) There appears to be little control in
       stopping the fans entering the concourse area. There
       appears to be little movement of fans going through the
       turnstiles.

0853   Fans on Leppings Lane still approaching the turnstile
       concourse areas.

0857   Views of Superintendent Marshall within the crowd.

0913   Mounted officer within the crowd, frantically trying to
       direct fans, his mouth is obviously very dry, fans within
       this crowd are very heavily compacted, this is in front of
       the A - G turnstiles. At least two outer perimeter gates
       are open but horses are in that position.

0950   Police Officer on foot can be seen near the turnstiles.

       Inspector Purdy can be seen stood on the small barrier
       running in the A - G concourse near to the C Gate. Some
       perimeter gates are open. Perimeter gates by the
       river side are slightly open with Foot Officers present.

0953   The area round Gate C is clear of fans.

1007   Inspector Purdy still stood on the small barrier is passed
       a young boy who is obviously distressed, this boy is
       looked after by Police Officers by Gate C.

       Commentary states time is 1439.

SECTION 7

1440.10      Views continue inside the ground.

1440         There is surging in Pen 4 which originates frcm the back
              of the crowd. A fan in a red shirt appears to be stood on
             the safety barrier in Pen 3. Another fan in a blue shirt
              is above the crowd but he may be on the shoulders of
             others. There is plenty of space in the West Stand
              seating area and in the North Stand seating area. Fans
              can be seen to be playing with a beach ball in the pens
              behind the goal on the Leppings Lane terracing.

1440.53      This section concludes.

SECTION 8

Return to the Leppings Lane area and shows views taken by the camera in
section 5.

1023         At least one outer boundary gate is open with fans coming
             through. Mounted Officers and two foot officers in
             attendance. Chief Inspector Creaser in the area.

1029         Foot Officers appear to be attempting to close at least
             one of the outer boundary gates.

1030         Fans on the wall by the     turnstiles, at the corner where
              the fencing is sitated    that separates Turnstiles 1 - 1 6
              and A -G. At least one    of the outer perimeter gate appears
              to be closed, fans are    continuing to climb the wall by
              the turnstiles.

1053         Outer perimeter gates leading to Turnstiles A - G appear
             to be closed with one exception by the large dividing
              fence. There is a heavy compaction of fans inside the
             concourse area of A - G and a heavy compaction of fans
              outside the perimeter gates. At least two foot officers
             are by the outer perimeter gates by the river side and
             other foot officers are within the crowd outside the
             perimeter gates (at least 3).

1105         The outer perimeter gate near the large dividing fence
              is open leading to the A - G turnstiles, the nearest one
              to Gate B. Mounted Officers (4) are in attendance in
                                -   6   -




            this gap and two more are near by, outside the perimeter
            gates. The area in front of turnstiles 1 - 1 6 and Gate A
            looks severely compacted, there is a heavy compaction of
            fans outside the perimeter gates. Fans going through the
            outer perimeter gates into the concourse area of
            turnstiles 1 - 1 6 . It appears a foot officer is against
            the wall of these turnstiles.

1128        Shows fans going through the outer perimeter gates
            towards turnstiles 1 - 1 6 and a stream of fans is now
            going through the open perimeter gate in front of
            turnstiles A - G, through the gate which is nearest the
            Gate B, mounted officers now not controlling this gap.
            There are at least two outer perimeter gates open, leading
            to the concourse area behind turnstiles 1 - 1 6 .

1137        Mounted Officer Sergeant, trying to shut one of the outer
            perimeter gates. At least four mounted officers now in
            this location. At least two foot officers present.

1201        Mounted Sergeant shuts half of the gate opening.

1202        Scenes of fans coming down Leppings Lane frcm the
            direction of Middlewood Road. A South Yorkshire
            Passenger Transport bus is on Leppings Lane. A mounted
            officer is on Leppings Lane shepherding fans. Foot
            officers are by the bus another mounted officer arrives to
            shepherd fans.

1213        Views of Superintendent Marshall within the crowd, he is
            frantically signalling to the crowd. There are at least
            two other perimeter gates open leading to the concourse
            area behind turnstiles 1 - 1 6 and one more leading to the
            concourse area behind turnstiles A - G with fans pouring
            through.

1239        This section concludes.

SECTION 9

1444.50     Views return to inside the ground.

1445        There is a heavy concentration of fans in pens 3 and 4
            although at the front of the pens it is quite loose.
            There is a surging and swaying of fans in Pen 3 and one is
            above the crowd in Pen 3 but it is unknown what he is
            stood on. Another fan in a white top appears to be
            stood on the safety barrier in Pen 3 and another fan in a
            blue shirt is above the crowd.

1446        Close up shots of the fan in the white top believed to be
            the one in Pen 3 standing on the safety barrier. On the
            North side of the terracing camera shots show very few
            supporters there with a lot of space available.

1447         Shows a lot of space available on the South side of the
             the terracing behind Track Gate 1. Fans surging in a
             minor way in both Pens 3 and 4, a fan looks as though he
             is stood on the safety barrier within Pen 3 with a white
             top 1bouncing up and down.'

1448         There is still plenty of space available in the West Stand
             seating area, surging in Pen 3.

1449.01      This section concludes.

SECTION 10

Returns to the Lappings Lane area and shows views taken by the camera in
Section 2 commencing at 1439.59.

1439.59      There has been a dramatic increase in the number of fans
             who are now up and against the Police barriers. Mounted
             officers are in the crowd.

1440         The service road is now full of fans which have over­
             spilled into it. Gates A and B appear under pressure.
             Gate C has fans nearby. Police Officers are in the
             enclosure by A - G turnstiles.

1442         Turnstiles A - G can be seen in use and although pictures
             are not clear it appears Police Officers are in the
             enclosure by some turnstiles.

1443         Fans are sat on the roof of Gate B. At least two Police
             Officers are in the enclosure by Gate B.

1444         Enclosure shows fans with plenty of room.   Some staying in
             vicinity.

1445         Two buses pass along Leppings Lane. Police Officers are
             still in enclosure by A - G turnstiles and by Gate B.

1447          Police Officers outside ground near Gate C some are in the
              crowd by this gate. Foot Officers are by the perimeter
              gate (at least two and an officer of Inspector rank or
               above.)

1448          Gate C opens for about 15 seconds, fans pass through but
              only a small number (100 - 200) compared with the masses
              outside. Gate A is under pressure. After Gate C is
              closed there is an over spill into the service road.
              West Midlands commentary indicates that Gate C was opened
              from the inside to enable Police to eject a youth.

              The over spill into the service road is forced back by
              mounted and the area regained by Police.

1450          These views conclude.

SECTION 11

Shows black and white views of the enclosure and turnstiles A - G
but taken by a different camera. These are not timed but West Midlands
Police commentary states this was from about 1439 to 1450. The quality
is very poor but shows Police Officers in the enclosure and by the
                                     -   8   -




turnstiles.

It appears a steward is by Gate C.

At an early part of the tape it shows fans in the enclosure obviously in
no hurry to take positions on the terracing or in the stands. A Police
Officer can clearly be seen to enter a turnstile, take out a youth and
eject him through Gate C. As time progresses fans are flowing through
the turnstiles, Police are in the enclosure and fans are still remaining
in the enclosure. Police Officers are outside Gate C. Fans begin to
climb on to the roof above turnstiles A - G and jump down into the
enclosure. The views show a youth jump from the roof of turnstiles A -
G into the enclosure where he walks away. This youth is 'caught' by a
Police Officer and taken to Gate C. The picture is not clear but it is
assumed he is ejected, but on this occasion as the gate opens fans
stream through from outside and into the enclsoure, about 2 - 300 in
total. It is assumed this is the first opening of Gate C at 1448 hours.
A mounted officer controls the situation outside and the gate is secured
after being open for 15 - 20 seconds.

A number of fans remain in the vicinity of the enclosure.   Police
Officers are still evident in the enclosure.

These views conclude shortly after the closing of Gate C.

SECTION 12

The views continue with camera shots of inside the ground commencing at
1449.28.

1449.53       In what seems to be Pen 3 a gap forms in the crowd near
              to the safety barrier that collapsed. A few fans rise
              from the floor area.

1450          Pen 3 is quite full now but the area around the front of
              the terracing is still quite comfortable. The mouth of
              the tunnel where it meets the terracing is packed with
              fans. At 1450 running into 1451 announcements over the
              Ground Tannoy System causes cheers from the crowd.

1451          Fans are still caning down the centre tunnel and filing
              into Pens 3 and 4. At 1451 Pens 3 and 4 are tightly
              packed. There is still plenty of space in the West Stand
              seating area.

1451.58       Views conclude.

SECTION 13

Shows views on Leppings Lane taken by the camera in Section 2 from
1449.31.

Views show fans still in the enclosure some not making progress to the
positions inside the ground.

1452      Mounted and foot officers are outide by Gate C within the
          crowd. An officer of Inspector rank or above is also
          within the crowd.

1452.10   A foot officer is by an open perimeter gate where fans
          are ccming through. This is the one nearest to Gate B.
          Mounted officers are by sane perimeter gates.
          Gate C is opened.
          The turnstile areas are severely compacted with a large
          crowd outside the outer perimeter fences.
          Gate C is opened and fans are streaming through. Fans
          from the A - G turnstile areas are directed through
          Gate C. At first there is an orderly fashion but numbers
          quickly accelerate and fans pour through. Several
          thousand enter. Police Officers are seen on both sides of
          Gate C.
          The A - G concourse area begins to clear. The crowd still
          being held back outside the perimeter gates.
          The area in front of turnstiles 1 - 16 is severely packed.

1453      Six PC's are seen running from the West Stand Enclosure
          through Gate C and into the concourse area in front of
          Turnstiles A - G.

          The perimeter gates are continuing to be held apparently
          closed by mounted section. There is swaying and surging
          of the crowd outside these gates and Gate A and the area
          in front of Turnstiles 1 - 1 6 can be seen to be under
          pressure.

1453      The perimeter gates at the river side are then breached
          and fans run towards the Gate C and through it.

1454      There is surging in front of Gate A. A number of Police
          Officers are behind this gate in the enclosure. An
          Inspector or above is on the turnstile roof. Gate C is
          still seen to be open. The perimeter gates are now being
          breached and fans making their way through and towards
          Gate C.

1455      Gate C is seen open with fans going through.

1456      Mounted are still at the perimeter gates. There is a
          severe press in front of Gate A and turnstiles 1 - 1 6 .
          The area in front of turnstiles A - G is reasonably clear.
          The enclosure is filling with fans, some are going through
          the gap in the dividing wall in the enclosure and heading
          towards the North Side of the ground.

1458      It appears that Gate A is now open, there is an
          increasing number of fans inside the ground making their
          way towards the North Stand. Fans can be seen arriving
          along Leppings Lane. Behind Gate A two lines of Police
          Officers are directing fans.

1459      The perimeter gates which are being held by the mounted
          are breached and mounted officers are then seen
          retreating. Gate B and C both appear to be open. Fans
          who had previously been held at the perimeter gates
          approach the gates.

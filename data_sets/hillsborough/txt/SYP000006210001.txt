Lord Justice Taylor
Head of the Hillsborough Inquiry
Hillsborough Football Ground
Sheffield.

Sir
       I,hope that your investigation into the Hillsborough tragedy will
go beyond the imediate circumstances otherwise any report will be false,
the fact remains that it was Hooligans that brought this incident about
and that problem has been with us for many years.
Both Governments have failed to deaUjwith the problem much of which of their
own waTHwg it is a Natiofial problem that happens in grounds of all sports,
Rugby, Cricket, Horse Racing in all situations of social gatherings, in Pubs
Dance Halls, Restaurants, Private Parties, at Political and Trade Union
gathering the list is endless but it was the present Government that is
directly responsible when to save spending the necessary public money on
Police,, Probation Officers, Social Workers and passing necessary legislation
they placed the whole hooligan problem on to the Football Authoritirs.
The Football Authority had' neither the power, ability or the finance to
deal with this National problem and they had no other means to deal with
hooligans than to contain them within fenced pens*     insure their own
survival.
The hooligan element seek out any gathering to create situations t» gejl
their kicks and as in football there is the greatest crowd depth they^i can
practice their acts without being spotted but this in no way makes this
just a football problem its still a National problem that this Government
has failed to deal with.
                                      Yours Sincerely
     Private & Confidential
                                    O   ■ r !■>

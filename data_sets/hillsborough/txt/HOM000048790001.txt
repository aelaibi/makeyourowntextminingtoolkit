VIDEOTAPES OF HILLSBOROUGH


I attach the four VHS videotapes of BBC footage of the Hillsborough Football Stadium
disaster which you kindly loaned to the Scrutiny in August last year.

It was plainly essential that we should see these tapes and Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has
asked me to thank you for allowing us to do so. We have made no copies of them.

The Home Secretary has published Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report and the Scrutiny is at
an end. This office closes today. I understand that the BBC are in touch with the Home
Office following the latter’s request for copies of the videotapes to be placed in the Librarie
of the House of Commons and the House o f Lords, and if there is anything arising from the
scrutiny which you wish to discuss I would suggest that you do so with the Home Office at
the address on that correspondence.

 Thank you again for your help.




 C F BONE
 Secretary to the Scrutiny

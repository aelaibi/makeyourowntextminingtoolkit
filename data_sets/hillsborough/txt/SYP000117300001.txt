no suppo r t e r s        of note around,             and the        turnstiles were               open.     We

completed          the tour       of the area and              returned to the L e p p i n g s Lane

attention          to L e pp i n g s    Lane and Cat chbar Lane                   vicinity.          The    horse        I

become     too muc h for him to                 contend wit h            so my     position on the

approach       to the       reception area w o u l d               be a better            duty to work.             PS

Thomas a g r e e d wit h          this       enabling      the more         ex p e r i e n c e d horses      to work

G r u nhill    and, PC S t a n b r i d g e went          off      in a pair and again toured the

area.

I then p a t r o l l e d the area alone                  for approx.             15 minutes         then    returned

to stand wit h the              two S e r geants         and the         two M e r s e y s i d e    officers who

had by this             time also       returnee.            We     remained       in this         position for

sometime.           No    problems       arose wit h         the a p p r o a c h i n g     fans     the    usual

a s s i s t a n c e was    given       directing        them to their             correct      entrance       gate

number,       many       fans   see m e d to be         looking at the             "gangway         letter"       on

their     tickets and           not     the t u rnstile           entrance        letter.

As time       passed and          the    number       of a p p r o a c h i n g   fans      increased,        all       were

directed       to the       turnstiles,          we    each s h o u t e d to them            instructing            them

tickets       to move       back       out    of the way a n d not               to obstruct         the    reception

area.      That         is the area          from the      blue      iron gates          to the      f o o tpath of

without ."problems..            However,             I noticed          that a number             of fans were

carrying m a n y        ckns ,of beer and 2- litre                       bottles .of lager/beer.                      I saw

a foot      Inspector,         Inspector Sykes,                   taking       the    beer       from a number                of

f aFis, but .due        to 'the ever            increasing             numbers       this task          became ,

impossible.            I n o t i c e d a general             a r o m a of beer         coming          from the       crowds

of fans      in general.             It a p p e a r e d      to me       that 'they were a f f e c t e d              by

alcohol      c o n s u m p t i o n and becoming more                    hostile.           The    c o m b i n a t i o n of

drink and a s u n n y day seemed to be taking                                  effect.           I contin u a l l y

advised      fans      that    they w ould            not    get       into the       ground d r u n k , man y

ignored me an d          I was       not     in a p o s ition            to do much about                it.       Many were

standing a r o u n d         obstructing             the    f o o t p a t h a p p r o a c h to the           reception

corner      of L e p p i n g s Lane        bridge,           I contin u a l l y a d v i s e d fans                 that       they

w o u l d not    get    into the ground drunk.                          I made a number                of sweeps          of

the     footpaths       to    clear     them from            in front          of the shop to the                   first

road j u n c t i o n    (Vers Road)             but    it was          like walking          thro u g h water,                as   I

moved A w a y , the          crowd    closed          in behind.              Due    to a radio message                   I

became      aware      that a Special                Train       had arrived and             the       fans arrival

was     imminent.        The arrival                area    of    the    fans was          heavily       congested

between Vere R oad and                the       shop also          a    considerable             number       of

approaching         fans all         the way along               L e p pings Lane-               I a s k e d Sgt,

footpath approach.               After          a    couple       of m i n u t e s    this       we    did   just     prior

to    the   arrival      of    sight       of       train    escort.           When    the       escort      was     some

30 yards        away    we    made    a further             2 full       sweeps       of    the       area

successfully           moving    all       the       supporters          towards       the       turnstiles.

 understood          to be non ticket                   holders.         I assumed         they were         non ticket

 holders,       as       they made         no attempt           to a p p r o a c h     the turnstiles.                Some    of

 them st a t e d         they were w a i t i n g            to meet      their        'mates'     coming        in .private

A fight was              taking      place       outside        a gas     showr o o m at        the   crossroads             of

this was almost                 impossible.              A further        distur b a n c e      of fighting

At approx.          2.45      pm an a s s i s t a n c e       call       was made         from my m o u n t e d

colleagues          for any m o u n t e d a s s i s t a n c e            to the L e p p i n g s .La'iie

turnstiles.              At   this       point    I was       p o s i t i o n e d at      the    corner      of the

Bridge a p p r o x i m a t e l y         15 to 20 yards             a way      from the C Gate              Terrace

Tu r n s tiles.          I saw that           the whole a r e a from the                    t urnstiles       outwards

was a solid block                  of    people    stret c h i n g        out       into Leppings           Lane.      The

whole      are a seemed            to be blocked w ith no movement                           thro u g h the

turnstiles.              I saw many fans              climbing           over       the walls above           the

turnstiles          into      the       gruond.       1 saw        Insp.       H„    Davis who was           nearest        to

me     compl e t e l y s u r r o u n d e d     by the      crowd his            horse       having     difficulties

in stand i n g        due     to    the weights          of    people          pushing ar o u n d        him.       I saw

my     other     c o lleagues at             the t u rnstiles            also       surro u n d e d t i g h t l y   packed

by     suppo r t e r s    pushing         their     horses         backwards.             It was a f rightening

sight a        crowd of t h o usands              f r a nt i c a l l y    pushing         forwards       w hich seemed

to be easily             knocking         half a ton of             horse       off      its feet.

Inspector         Davis       beckoned         for. myself          and PC          156 Main      to join       him,       but

as we      tried      to do so the             crowd were           pushing          so tightly they

physi c a l l y     pre v e n t e d     our access         into      the       crowd by purposely               pushing

at the       horses       chests.            I then noti c e d that a Police                      Land Rover         had

a r r i v e d and the         driver w i s h e d       to get        the vehicle             into    the     crowd     in

order      to appeal          to the         crowd over        the       the    loud speaker           system.         We

a g a i n tried      to get         our horses         into        the    crowd app e a l i n g        to    people to

stop      pushing and a l l o w              the vehicle           in,    but our attempts               were

hopeless.           It a p p e a r e d to me that              this       crowd had made a d e t e r m i n e d

an d    c o ncerted effort              to    prevent any           police          control     of the s i tuation

along wit h a d e f i n i t e            intention        to force entry             into the         ground.        The

crowd were at a, corriplete standstill                            refusing        to move and          it was not

safe      to force, the           "bottle       neck     situation".             Beca u s e   of the        noise of

thfe -crowd the .lpud speaker a n n o u n c e m e n t s                    had no effect.              I '

w er e    being     crus h e d at the front,                few took        notice - o t h e r s        pushed even

more,      I could see            that      the s i t u a t i o n at    the front         of the       turnstiles

wa s at dang e r ' l e v e l          - that there w o u l d           be fatal        injuries        if the

pressure       of    crowd was           not    released,         the only way of doing                 this was          to

release       pressure          at    the front.                                                                               ,

All      of a su d d e n    this       happened after             having      heard shouts            "open the

gates".         I never         saw w hich gates            had    been opened,           only the          extreme

right metal          iron gates             being    shut      some    10 yards        in front        of the

t urnstiles         of the C Gate area.                   A gap then a p p e a e r e d          in the       crowd       in

front      of the L a n d Rover where                  I f i n a l l y m a n a g e d to       ride my horse

t hro u g h and      jo i n e d      Inspector Davis and               the other m o u n t e d         officers.

We were       then       instructed          to form a cordon of horses                       nose    to tail

across       the    entire        length of the           r e ception area w hich e f f e c t i v e l y

stop p e d any       further          access      to the whole          entrance area.                This    then

gave      opportunity           for    the     fans a l r e a d y at       the    front       of the    turnstile

to get       t h r o u g h sa f e l y without          pushing.         E v e n once the         cordon was

f o r m e d many     fans       tried       to get     t h r o u g h the    horses      by slapping           them on

the head and flanks                   and    pulling      on the       reins.        It was a very hostile

situation,          we    each did our            best    to     calm the fans,               I was    under       the

i m pression        that a dela y e d kick               off was       being      requested          over    the    radio.

This      I shou t e d     to the        fans     that    the     game was        going       to be delayed

30 minutes.              This     seemed to         calm many         fans,      but then a large             cheer

was      heard from        inside        the ground w h i c h          I assumed        the m a t c h was

underway.           The    fans       became      frantic a g a i n        pushing v i o l e n t l y and

shouting       obscene          remarks        furious      at    being     delayed       further.

to the     r e s ulting       erowd, pressure and a large                     group surged            thro u g h the

gap.     We   regairied rcontrol               of the    situation,           then faced the               crowd and

A l l o w e d them'-to f i l t e r      t h r o u g h / s t e a d i l y between the; horses.                 The

atmosphere        had    calmed       somewhat        though       I c ontinually           re q u e s t e d that

they    stopped      pushing as           they were         only     Causing        injury to their               own

fans.      Very few        took      notice.        A radio mess a g e was               then     received of a

possible       pitch     invasion,         a group of m o u n t e d           officers         were    detailed by

fans     both towards             the g round a n d north towards Wads 1ey Bridge

increased.              A cons i d e r a b l e    number      of fans were asking             directio’

'The Fox'          public        house,      a con s i d e r a b l e    number     of fans were

a p pr o a c h i n g    others        saying     "Any s p a r e s ” .      In general      the     fans were       in

good humour,             well     behaved but          in general          were    standing a r o u n d and

se e m e d    reluctant          to make       their way to the               ground.    Large      numbers were

carrying         cans of beer and                lager    obviously           purchased from other           than

public        houses.          1 perso n a l l y a d v i s e d a number            of these       fans    on the

imp l i c a t i o n s    of    trying       to enter      the g r o u n d with alcohol             in their

possession.              The    stock       reply was       "I'll       drink     it before       I get    in the

ground mate".                 1 noti c e d at this          time       that    ’The G a t e ’ public       house

was    open and a l l o wi ng Liverpool                   s u p po rt er s    to enter.

At 2 . 3 0 p m     (1430)        I noticed a m a r k e d         increase         in the number          of fans

ap p ro ac hi ng        from the Wads ley Br i d g e area.                    A high    p r o p o r t i o n of these

fans     had o b v i o u s l y        been drinking,         they were          chanting slogans,

d is or d e r l y an d were male               persons m a i n l y       in the age group           of    18 to 25

years        of age.          S ome    coaches were         still       a r r i v i n g at this    time.

the     ground,       although         I saw four        coaches         off-loading        their    passengers

on H al i f a x R o a d to the               north of Wads 1ey Bridge.                The    fans    fram these

coaches were m u c h              the same as         those     described         in the     preceding

paragraph.            B ec a u s e    the flow of fans           had d e c r e a s e d   to a trickle            1’

view to        commence        phase 2 of the o p e r a t i o n             (standby duties          at    junction

of C a t c hb ar L a n e / L e p p i n g s      Lane).

At H . 5 0 p m    ('1450)      the Serial was            d e l a y e d at a d i s t u r b a n c e at      ’The

Gate'      involving Liv e r p o o l            s up p o r t e r s and    local     residents.         This

d i s tu rb an ce was         q ue l l e d    by the o f f icers a t t e n d i n g       leaving     some sixty

supporters           still     in the         premises.       I radioed          control     advising       them of

the     s i t u a t io n and      r e questing        that we    be relieved by other officers                         in

order      that      the Serial            could go on wi t h         phase S.        The    response was

that     they had no officers a v a i l a b l e at that                       time.       I was of the

opin i o n     that     the    serial         w ou l d be better         deployed     nearer      the ground so

I a dv i s e d    control         that       1 was joining        Inspector Mill e t t          in order         to

a p p r o ac hi ng    the     ground         late    I thought       there may foe some           problems        on

Le p p in gs     Lane.

At 2 . 5 5 p m    (1455)       I joined         Inspector Mill e t t and other Serials                      at the

j u n c t io n of L a pp in gs L a n e / C l a y w h e e 1s Lane.             It was most         noticeable           that

large q u a nt it ie s         of bottle and            canned       beers    had been d i s c a r d e d at

this     point a long with empties.                      I became aware             of an    increase       in

radio      traffic,         one      particular       officer was           very anxi o u s about         the

s i t ua ti on at a gate and                  requesting      that       it should be opened an d that

fans were         in danger           of     being    crushed.       At     least    three     requests were

mad e    for the gate             to be opened.            It was        clear    that   the    problem was at

the West         stand.

o ut n u m b e r e d fans at         this      point,     wha t     fans were outside               the ground

were     being     p r ev en te d from entering                  the    ground.          Radio    traffic at this

point a p p e a r e d to be frequent and urgent.                                11 was a p p a r e nt, to me

there was         problems          in the ground.               A con s i d e r a b l e    number    of fans were

m i ll i n g about       in the d i re ct io n of C a t c hb ar Lane.                       I was    under the

i mp r e s s i o n they had been               pushed back          by the         officers      in Leppi n g s

Lane.        A number        of     fans were        irrate,        aggressive,            and holding      tickets

up d e manding         e nt r y     to the g r o u n d .         A senior          officer      then ordered a

cordon        to be fo r m e d across             the e n t rance         on L e p p i n g s Lane,        At this

point        having    fo r m e d    the     cordon we were             joined          by officers      from

M ou n t e d Branch.           A fan a p p ro ac he d me very                 irrate,       it was appar e n t

he'd been d r i nking and was wa v i n g                       his arms about              holding    a ticket,

saying        "I've got a ticket" and was                        dem a n d i n g    entry to the ground.                1

a dv i s e d him that          fans were          not    being a l l o w e d to enter             because       of a

serious        incident        in the West           stand.         This      particular         fan became more

a g g re ss iv e and was a p p r o a c h e d            by a M o u n t e d officer who a d v i s e d him                in

strong        terms    to    leave        the area.           The y ou t h a t t e m p t e d to      push the

Po l i c e   horse a way and              in doing       so    lost     his     balance and fell           beneath

the horse's           hooves.            He got    up and        im m e d i a t e l y   struck a stone          pillar

took    him away saying                  " I ’ve seen     it all,         it's     ridiculous,        he'll

complain,        I*m a witness".                  It was at this              point      that    I heard a

message        on the       radio        for all a v a i l a b l e      officers         to enter     the ground.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 . 0 5 p m     (150S)      I e n t e r e d the ground             by way    of the

  and     nostrils,           there was         no sign of a pulse,               it a p p e a r e d    to me      he was

  dead.        There was a strong                   smell    of alcohol.             A t t e m p t s made    to

  resusc i t a t e       this ma n were without                 success.          I was     then       involved         in

  a s s i s t i n g w i t h the       dead and         injured.        Fans were          stood about,            some

  were     angry,        some were          distressed,         a    large     number were drunk,                 some

  w ere    physically            i nterf er r i rig w ith officers,               I perso n a l l y had           to

  s t r o n g ly advise         fans      to    leave the area.              L i q u i d was    pouring       down the

  back     of the        stand.

  I was      later       given to u nd e r s t a n d that             this was        urine.       1 could see

  damage       being      caused to the               covered s t a i r w a y of the stand               I was         unable

  to    respond to t h i s .

  It seemed to me               that      the       remaining       fans    in the West         s tand w o u l d be

  leaving        the gr o u n d and            there was      every        like l i h o o d this w o u l d

  interef ere           w ith the Polic e             operation       involving         the dead and          injured.

  W i t h what a v a i l a bl e m a n p o w er was a v a i l a b l e and with                   the a s s i s t a n c e       of

  some Liverpool               s up p o r t e r s    I formed a cordon to prevent these fans

  leaving        by way        of the       gate      leading       to the     service       road at        the    rear of

  the     stand w here          the     dead and        injured were           being a s s e m b l e d await i n g

  T h r o u gh o u t    the    latter       part of this            incident      I w i t n e s s e d officers who

  were     d i stressed,          sickened          by the whole           incident       being s u b j e c t e d to

  spitting,            verbal     abuse and           countless       u n f o u n d e d accusations.              I cannot

  recall       any officer            in my view         r e sponding        unprofessionally               or whose

  conduct        I w ou l d     have      thought       inappropriate            in the      c i r curnstances.

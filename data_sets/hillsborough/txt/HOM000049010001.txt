 1                                                  Tuesday, 7th October, 1997
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I have read your letter to me of
 3          8th August, Mr. Glover.          I have looked at the points you
 4          made.     Have you got a copy of it there?
 5   MR.    GLOVER:     No, I didn't bring a copy with me, I do have
 6          another copy to give to you this morning.          I have done
 7          this so you can understand it better rather than me
 8          rambling on about it.
 9   LORD JUSTICE      STUART-SMITH:    Would you like me to read it now?
10   MR.    GLOVER:      Yes, there is some parts of transcripts.
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Right, thank you.    (Judge reads )
12          These are the extracts from the Coroner's that you are
13          referring to, are they?
14   MR.    GLOVER:     That's right.    There is a thing that I would like
15          to add to that, sir.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Can I just read the passages in the
17          Coroner's .    Are they the bits that you have marked?
18   MR.    GLOVER:     Yes, they have been marked down as a little
19          transcript.     (Judge reads )
20   LORD    JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: Can you just help         me, which days
21          are these?      Is it all the same day, the extract from the
22          Coroner?
23   MR.    GLOVER:     Well,   I don't know because we received them with
24          the judicial review papers so I couldn't say.          I could
25          find out for you.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Never mind,    I can probably find
27          out.      Can you just help me about this, was this something
28          that the Coroner said to everybody or did he just say---
29   MR.    GLOVER:     That's actually at the inquest court.
30   LORD    JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: It was addressed         to everybody?
31   MR.     GLOVER:     The jury and everybody, yes.
32   LORD    JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: You heard this?
33   MR.    GLOVER:     Yes. I was there every day.      The point is, he
34          actually said them words, they are from the transcripts.
35          That's another letter received from the police, i t ’s in
36           connection with th a t , only in the green there.


                                              2
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I follow the points that you are
2          making in this letter.      I suspect theexplanation    of what
 3         the Divisional Court said was that at the particular time
 4         of the Divisional Court hearing the Coroner had not at
 5         that stage got these documents, they had all been handed
 6         back and were in the custody of the police.        I have
 7         actually seen the archive room at Hillsborough, which is
 8         in the custody of the police,      and it is a massive room.
 9         All these body files, that is what we are talking about
10         here, are there.
11              I think I probably said yesterday, if I did not I say
12         to you, I have looked at some of those files.        I have not
13         yet obviously looked at all of them but I will certainly
14         make a point of looking at the one in your case.
15              Have you got a copy of it?
16   MR.   GLOVER:    Sir, I'm just an ordinary layman, as far as I'm
17         concerned in the High Court the evidence was that the
18         Coroner did not have a copy of this P.C. Fuget's
19         statement.    The Coroner actually had these in front of him
20         right through the inquest and the first thing you see when
21         you open it is PC Fuget's statement.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I think the problem, as I
23         understand it, was there was a late delivery of PC Fuget's
24         statement to you and that put you in a difficulty.
25   MR.   GLOVER:    But the Coroner actually had this document.
26   LORD JUSTICE     STUART-SMITH:   At the time?
27   MR.   GLOVER:    This document was in front of     the Coroner at tlie
28         inquest.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        That may well be so.
30   MR.   GLOVER:    It's got to be because that's     the file that was
31         with the Coroner and here's the statement, there.
32   MR.   GLOVER:    (Junior)    The thing is, he should have definitely
33         been called at the inquest, that PC Fuget, he had crucial
34         evidence.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I will look at that.
36   MR.   GLOVER:     (Senior)    That's where I tried to get the


                                          3
 1         document in 1992 and that's just part of the obstructions
2          on the phone to him, it had to be extracted but it was in
 3         the Coroner's belongings anyway, in his archive, surely
 4         he's got immediate access to that.
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      It is not the first day, it is the
 6         second day, is it?
 7   MR.   GLOVER:    Sorry.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      It looks like a bit of buck
 9         passing.
10   MR.   GLOVER:    I don't know what's going on but I need it to be
11         sorted out.    Now the thing is, on the result of the High
12         Court's, the judicial review decision, I think, I don't
13         quite understand the law about it but we actually had 7
14         days to put an appeal in.     I requested to see the judgment
15         before I decided--
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      To put an appeal in for what?
17   MR.   GLOVER:    To go to a higher court in my son's case.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      From the judicial review?
19   MR.   GLOVER:    From the judicial review.    The judge has actually
20         said that with the exception of my son, you know, there
21         was evidence there to say he could have been alive later
22         on.   Now, what I'm saying, because I had another son who
23         was crushed in the pens who was in assistance with his
24         brother, what he actually said is there was ambulances
25         lined up, they took them down and they were dumped inside
26         that gymnasium.     They should have been put into ambulances
27         and taken to hospital.
28               The reason they wouldn't let the ambulances come and
29         drive onto the pitch is because they wanted to restart the
30         match.     They, thought they were going to restart the match.
31         They won't even let you stand on a football pitch when,
32         they have signs all over, you know, when it's not in use
33         you can't even stand on a pitch.       It would have made wheel
34         marks on the pitch and that's why they wouldn't let the
35         ambulances come on.     No matter what anybody says.
36               I have really studied all this and I know what


                                        4
 1          happened but I expect in an accident like that, if they
 2          say it was an accident, my son should have been put in one
 3          of them ambulances which were lined up and given proper
 4          medical attention which the only medical attention he
 5          received was from my other son, Joseph.
 6               I just feel as though the emergency services who were
 7          praised by it you couldn't fault them because they wasn't
 8          allowed to come in by police, they stopped them going into
 9          that ground.    That's negligence as far as I'm concerned
10          and it should have all been brought out.
11               I mean,    I'm actually one of the families that's
12          worked every day, studied everything, you know.        Why did
13          they telephone for ambulances and then tell the ambulance
14          drivers that they were not needed?     They couldn't go onto
15          the pitch.     That's what happened.   Same with the fire
16          brigade, they said,    "We don't need you."
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       They went to the gymnasium which is
18          where the first aid post was.
19   MR.    GLOVER: No, there was two first aid sections     set    up.
20   LORD   JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     There were actually three.     One at
21          Leppings Lane, one behind the South Stand where some of
22          the fire brigade people were taking people.
23   MR.    GLOVER:    I didn't know about that.
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       That comes out in the Taylor
25          Inquiry.     There were ambulances going there too.     The main
26          one, of course, was at the gymnasium.
27   MR.    GLOVER:    That's correct, yes.   You know, I've tried to       get
28          the doctor's statement that actually said my son had a
29          pulse and, as I explained yesterday, there was actually a
30          video taken inside that gymnasium.      I've got to mention
31          this, this lad is the only person that's ever had a copy
32          of that particular tape for his High Court case.        The
33          thing is, I know that doctor will be on that tape because
34          he fought for over 20 minutes to save him and yet the
35          police says he's non-existent, they can't find him.           He'll
36          be on the video but they will not give us copies of the


                                         5
 1         video.
 2   MR.   GLOVER:     That's correct, yes, but you know I've tried to
 3         get the doctor's statement that actually said my son had a
 4         pulse and I explained yesterday that there was actually a
 5         video taken inside that gymnasium.
 6               I've got to mention this.     This lad is the only
 7         person that's ever had a copy of that particular tape for
 8         his   High Court case.    Thething is know I    that doctor
 9         will be on that tape because he fought       for over 20 minutes
10         to save him and yet the police say he's non-existent, we
11         can't find him.     He will be on the video but they will not
12         give us copies of the video.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      This is the video of the temporary
14         mortuary?
15   MR.   GLOVER:     The temporary mortuary, yes, the one in the
16         gymnasium.
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I have seen that video, but of
18         course I was only looking generally speaking, I was not
19         looking for any particular       thing.   You say that you have
20         actually seen a photograph       of somebody who you think is a
21         doctor--
22   MR.   GLOVER:     No, that's my other son, Joseph.     Joseph actually
23         carried Ian on a makeshift stretcher into the gymnasium
24         and he was there all the time with the doctor while the
25         doctor was working on him.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      He made a claim for the shock and
27         so on that he suffered as a result--
28   MR.   GLOVER:     As a matter of fact he was refused compensation.
29         I think he was given a small amount of compensation but he
30         didn't want compensation, no matter what people think.            It
31         wasn't about money.
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      At any rate just so that I get this
33         clear.    Your other son saw that video.      Is that right?
34   MR.   GLOVER:     No, none of us have seen the video.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      But he saw actually with his own
36         eyes a doctor administering first aid?


                                        6
 1   MR.    GLOVER:    He was helping the doctor for approximately 20
 2          minutes.
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        This is your son Joseph?
 4   MR.    GLOVER:     Joseph.   The report I got back from---
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Can you just tell me what time —
 6          is there a statement from your son about this?
 7   MR.    GLOVER:     There is a statement, yes.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Where will I find that?
 9   MR.    GLOVER:     It will be with the South Yorkshire Police.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        With the police?
11   MR.    GLOVER:     Yes, it was with the West Midlands Police but
12          South Yorkshire Police hold all the evidence.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I am not sure whether we have seen
14          that or not.
15   MR.    BONE:     We have not, sir, it should be within the paper.
16   LORD    JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: Is it with that file there?
17   MR.     GLOVER:    No, I haven't actually got   it with me.
18   LORD    JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: No, with the      body file?    Is it part
19          of that?
20   MR.    GLOVER:     No., you see what they've actually sent me is that
21          small file because over the years I have got bits of the
22          files, but they haven't sent me a full body file.        This is
23          just the rest.
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        We will look at the body file, if
25          you think that you have not been given everything you
26          should have been I will try and see that you get any
27          additional pieces.
28   MR.    GLOVER:     I'm not saying I haven't received any, I have
29          received the other but it's been in      the past years and
30          I've got a quite a lot of stuff.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        You are satisfied you have had the
32          entire body file?
33   MR.    GLOVER:     No, because in the first place I don't know what
34          the entire body file consists of so I don't know, do I .        I
35          would like to have a completed file.
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        That is why I suggested that if you


                                          7
 1         could let me know what you have had I would try and make
 2         sure that you had everything.           Do you follow?
 3   MR.   GLOVER:     Yes, I understand but I've been getting a couple
 4         of papers in 1991, some in 93, 94.           I've actually got
 5         crates of papers you see.           They've got all mixed up.     Once
 6         we lost the judicial review--
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         It may be simpler to get a copy of
 8         it?
 9   MR.   GLOVER:     I would like a full copy of the document.
10   MR.   BONE:     Sir, I think what we will do is we will look at the
11         body file on Ian and we will see whether there is a
12         statement from Joseph on it.
13   MR.   GLOVER:     There's definitely a statement.         It was read out
14         at the inquest so it should be there.
15   MR.   BONE:     There certainly should be a statement.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         If there is not we can trace it.
17   MR.   GLOVER:     What the Coroner actually says in the document is
18         that the doctor        could have been mistaken    with the pulse.
19         I don't feel —         the doctor doesn't   do   20 minutes   if he's
20         mistaken.
21   MR.   BONE:     This was     in the gym?
22   MR.   GLOVER:     In the     gymnasium.
23   MR.   BONE:     Which is the significance of the video about the
24         gym of course?
25   MR.   GLOVER:     Correct.
26   MR.   BONE:     Because it should be on that video?
27   MR.   GLOVER:     Yes, I feel as though that doctor will be on that
28         and my son Joseph.
29   MR.   BONE:     If you can remember from what Joseph said in the
30         statement at about what time, between what time was the
31         doctor trying to revive Ian for 20 minutes?
32   MR.   GLOVER:     Between half past three and 10 to 4.          Five
33         minutes later John and Joseph were taken to hospital
34         themselves. That's only approximate times.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         He does not know who the doctor was
36         but he believes he was a doctor?


                                               8
 1   MR.   GLOVER:     The doctor actually said to him:   "I am a
 2         doctor."
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      He does not know which, because
 4         there were number of doctors?
 5   MR.   GLOVER:     He didn't know what his name was, his brother had
 6         just been crushed to death and he was being crushed
 7         himself.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      We probably know who certified him
 9         dead.
10   MR.   GLOVER:     I do, Dr. Redgrave but there's nothing at all in
11         his statement.
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I am sorry, do we know what time he
13         did that?
14   MR.   GLOVER:     I'm not quite sure, I should have a statement
15         here.     They don't actually give times.   They actually say
16         within half an hour he actually pronounced so many dead.
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I think I explained this to you
18         yesterday, that the time certification of death does not
19         mean that person died at that time, it merely means that
20         they are dead by that time.
21   MR.   GLOVER:     I understand that, you can be pronounced dead two
22         hours after, can't you, three weeks after.
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Yes.   Mr. Glover, we will certainly
24         look into these matters for you.      I think, if I may say
25         so, you have put it very clearly in this letter.
26   MR.   GLOVER:     I did have a little bit of help to put it in a
27         proper way but I wanted to present it to you in a way you
28         could understand because I ramble on a bit.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      If I may say, it is very helpful.
30   MR.   GLOVER:     I said to you yesterday about I feel as though —
31         I have got quite a lot more stuff but I feel as though I
32         can't do in half an hour and you did say: we'll sort that
33         out tomorrow.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      You mention in your letter that you
35         have given material to Mr. Jones Q.C., Mr. Alun Jones.
36   MR.   GLOVER:     I think maybe that's judicial review stuff.     I've


                                        9
 1         got additional stuff besides that which I haven't bothered
 2         sending in because I didn't know what was happening.
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I listened to submissions by Mr.
 4         Jones for the whole of one day last week and obviously
 5         asked him questions and so on about it.         I have very much
 6         got in mind the submissions that were made by him on
 7         behalf of the Family Support Group.         I suspect that those
 8         submissions probably cover most of the matters, other than
 9         perhaps the specific matters which refer to your son,
10         which I hope you have dealt with this morning and in your
11         letter to me.
12   MR.   GLOVER:    The best I can, yes.    Sir, the actual statement
13         of P.C. Fogitt they won't give me his first statement --
14         been told by a person who has actually received a copy of
15         the first statement.      This particular policeman has
16         nothing at all to do with my lad, nothing at all
17         whatsoever.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Which particular policeman?
19   MR.   GLOVER:    P.C. Fogitt, his number is 1100.       He has no
20         connection at all with my son, Jan, on the pitch in his
21         first statement.     In his second statement the man's done
22         everything for him, it's unbelievable how he come on the
23         scene.     I know in my own mind w h a t 's happened,.what I
24         think has happened.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       What do think has happened?
26   MR.   GLOVER:     I just feel as though by calling the doctor in
27         they could have proved that my son was still alive.            I
28         would have really got into them that he should have been
29         put into an ambulance because what the pathologist's
30         explanation was that people vomited people even once they
31         died.     But a lot of people vomited and survived.      Now my
32         son actually vomited.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Who says that?
34   MR.   GLOVER:     Dr. Usher I think, you know when he was giving
35         evidence at the mini-inquest.
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       That is the pathologist, is it?


                                         10
 1   MR.   GLOVER:       Yes, he is a pathologist, yes.
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        The pathologist said that he had
 3         vomited?
 4   MR.   GLOVER:       No, the policeman said he'd vomited, P.C. Fogitt
 5         said he vomited and he tried to revive him.       What my son
 6         Joseph actually said that he didn't think a policeman
 7         carried him but I spoke to Joe about this.        He actually
 8         seen his brother being carried out pens by two policemen
 9         and all that and he was in shocking state.        I made a
10         statement myself and I don't remember making it.
11               In the inquest the way I can explain is that they
12         said the identification was through clothing, photographs
13         of clothing.       Then I found out later that the actual
14         identification by Fogitt was by his clothing and an actual
15         photograph of my son.       He said:   "Without doubt that's the
16         lad who I helped."
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I am not sure that I am quite
18         following this.       Is it your belief that Fogitt is mistaken
19         about that or merely that he is mistaken about that or he
20         has made it up because he it does not appear in his first
21         statement?
22   MR.   GLOVER:       It is not my suggestion, it is actually the
23         Coroner's suggestion that Fogitt where identifying my son
24         through his clothing--
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Has made a mistake.
26   MR.   GLOVER:       Has made a mistake just because he said clothing,
27         it is very weak identification.        But then when it turns
28         out       :
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I am sorry.   Where does the Coroner
30         say that?
31   MR.   GLOVER:       It will actually be in either the mini-inquest or
32         the main inquest.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        He said that at the mini-inquest,
34         did he?
35   MR.   GLOVER:       I am not sure quite sure, I think it was the main
36         inquest when he said it.       The second part.   I am not quite


                                          11
 1         sure.
2    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     He may have said that
3          identification by clothing is not very satisfactory?
 4   MR.   GLOVER:    He said it was very weak identification.
5    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Did he say that in relation to Ian?
 6   MR.   GLOVER:    To Ian.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      He did?
 8   MR.   GLOVER:    Yes.   But the thing is once I got the copy of the
 9         statement for going to a judicial review Fogitt actually
10         says in his statement that he identifies Ian through
11         clothing and photographs, video photographs.      That was the
12         VR/2, it's called, the gymnasium.      That's where he
13         identified him and the policeman that was allocated to
14         look after my son was actually a mate of P.C. Fogitt,
15         another policeman.
16              There was no way he could have been mistaken but I
17         just don't know what's gone on with it, but it's all in
18         them papers there.
19                 The other stuff I've got, I don't know way I'm going
20   -     to be able to sort with you because I know —        If I could
21         give a little for instance.       When we sent for evidence I
22         sent for photographs and this is what was sent back to me.
23         If you would just like to have a look at them.
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      These are the photographs which
25         were on the body file?
26   MR.   GLOVER:     No, these are separate photographs where I was
27         trying to trace my so n 's movements.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Nobody can identify anybody on
29         that, can they?
30 • MR.   GLOVER:     No, that's what the police sent me.    They said
31         they were the copies of what was used at the inquest
32         because I specifically asked to give me proper
33         photographs. Once I received them I actually contacted the
34         Coroner and told him that it was a disgrace what they'd
35         sent me and then they sent me these.       This is the way
36         we're being obstructed, this is what I am trying to say to


                                        12
 1         you.    T h e y 're exactly the same photographs.
2    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Can you just help me, does anybody
 3         purport to identify Ian on any of these photographs?
 4   MR.   GLOVER:    Oh yes.   I've got him on this one here as well.
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Which of these is Ian?
 6   MR.   GLOVER:    The reason I sent for them is I've got Joseph on
 7         the fence here, that's actually Joseph there, he's talking
 8         to Ian in the pen.     This is the business about the 15
 9         seconds of being crushed, you see, because it didn't
10         happen like that.
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Is this right, none of these ones
12         C327/328---
13   MR.   GLOVER:    My son is actually on the fence but they are that
14         far away on these photographs I can't actually spot them,
15         but on that one you can.
16   MR.   BONE:     That's Joe there, he says, Ian's behind the fence
17         and Joe's talking to him.
18   MR.   GLOVER:     He's talking to him but then Ian actually comes
19         out of the sitting, you know, where he's being crushed, he
20         said you got crushed for 15 seconds, you went unconscious,
21         then you died, but it was not the case because my son
22         actually got out of that situation and we've got him by
23         the main gate here where he tried to escape.        Now, this
24         was on a hill, this, coming down and when he got to the
25         bottom here all these people are in like a well or a pit,
26         now to get out of that situation, you can see levels, you
27         have to come up 3 steps, people got trapped by them steps
28         and that's how they died, that was the escape route.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       This is pen 3?
30   MR.   GLOVER:     That's pen 3, yes.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       That's the door there and this is
32         where the barrier collapsed, somewhere here?
33   MR.   GLOVER:     The barrier would be round this area, yes, but
34         the barrier had nothing to do with it because my son was
35         standing on a body at twenty past two.        Them pens were
36         packed out at twenty past two.


                                         13
 1   MR.   BONE:     He was standing on a body?
 2   MR.   GLOVER:     Yes.   Can I show you this for one   second.   I was
 3         actually inside that police control box there and you can
 4         see everything.      All them police officers in there
 5         couldn't see this, look, they are all empty.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       When were you inside the control
 7         box?
 8   MR.   GLOVER:     We went with the jury.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       You have got a perfectly good view
10         of the terraces from there?
11   MR.   GLOVER:     Yes, what I actually done I asked    the operator to
12         zoom in, it was actually Houldsworth, they       brought him in
13         for a day, you see, once he zooms in you could pick a
14         little blackhead up on the girl that was standing in the
15         pens.     There is hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
16         hours of video photographs but you don't see Chief
17         Superintendent Duckenfield on one of them.        Where was he?
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Just help me about this.    When you
19         were looking out of the window of the box could you see
20         clearly in the pens?
21   MR.   GLOVER:     No, what I'm saying is they actually broken these
22         offences down, it was empty.
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Yes, of course, but you have got a
24         good view of them from there?
25   MR.   GLOVER:     Unbelievable view.     I could see people in the pen
26         through the zoom facility like I was talking to you people
27         now.      But they couldn't see nothing wrong.    Duckenfield
28          saw nothing untoward, nothing wrong at all but he retires
29          under post-traumatic stress disorder.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Is there anything else that you
31         want to say?
32   MR.   GLOVER:      Quite a bit, to tell you the truth but I would
33          like you to read this statement, sir.       This is the type of
34          thing we were up against.       I have actually shown this to
35          Alun Jones and he says it's against the law for the
36          pathologist to read statements, now, th a t ’s in this


                                         14
 1         document.     Just if you could read that about the alcohol
 2         part.     This is an overall view by Dr. Usher, the
 3         pathologist.        That's a biased statement what he made
 4         there.
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Yes, thank you.
 6   MR.   GLOVER:     How can a man make a statement like that when he
 7         wasn't at the match, he only come in at the nighttime, he
 8         only done it by reading police statements which is
 9         supposed to be illegal, isn't it?
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I think we have pretty well run out
11         of time.
12   MR.    BONE:     I'm afraid we have,    Sir Murray, yes.
13   MR.    GLOVER:    I have got about 25 more things in the paper.
14   MR.    BONE:     Can we leave it, Mr. Glover, that you have left us
15         with a     lot of interesting things to think about that we
16         should follow up and we may come back to you later on.
17   MR.   GLOVER:     We were told that you would scrutinise all the
18         evidence and I have got more evidence, you see.           I
19         actually read the Coroner's law book and it is illegal for
20         the Coroner, the jury to visit the scene together.            We was
21         in lifts together with them and everything, going up to
22         the canteen.
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I think you have made this point in
24         your letter.
25   MR.   GLOVER:     But,    you know, at times they was maybe 10, 15
26         yards separating the jury from the Coroner but I felt at
27         the time, the Coroner, by the presence of them with the
28         West Midlands police were putting pressure on the jury
29          inside the ground when we visited there.
30   LORD JUSTICE      STUART-SMITH:    I have got the points,    I understand
31         the concern about that.        Thank you very much for coming.
32          If we need to       get in touch with you again we will do so.
33   MR.    GLOVER:    Okay, fair enough, yes.      Would it    be helpful if I
34          got all    my other stuff wrote down and sent       it in to you?
35   LORD JUSTICE      STUART-SMITH: If you want to send        it to me, yes.
36   MR.   GLOVER:      I've    got some very good stuff there which needs


                                            15
 1         to be sorted out.
 2   MR.   BONE:      I think what we need, Mr. Glover, is a    summary of
 3         what you have got with        themain points taken out and set
 4         out.
 5   MR.    GLOVER:    I understand.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Are you a member of the Support
 7         Group?
 8   MR.    GLOVER:    I am.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          Let me assure you that the
10         submissions have been made very thoroughly by counsel                and
11         solicitors on their behalf.          I do not think they have
12         overlooked anything.
13   MR.    GLOVER:    I know for a fact    that they haven't got   this
14         other stuff what I've got.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Would you let me have that in
16         writing then?
17   MR.    GLOVER:    I'll get it alltyped outproperly to      send       to
18         you.     I didn't want to mention anything about yesterday
19         but there has been quite a lot of media coverage on it.                    I
20         think I can explain, if you read this couple of sentences,
21         why we were in that position, because this is the South
22         Yorkshire police saying this in 1992, I think.           (Judge
23         reads)      They are still blaming the supporters after the
24          Taylor Inquiry.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Can I say something about what
26          happened yesterday.        I explained at the time that I
27          regretted the remark that I made.         It was not intended to
28          be taken seriously in any shape or form, simply a
29          conversational thing.       The truth of the matter is that so
30          far from making up my mind against the Liverpool
31          supporters, that their conduct outside the turnstiles led
32          to the loss of control,       I have actually said now on two
33          occasions that Lord Taylor considered this question, it
34          was a very controversial matter before him.         Lord Taylor
35          rejected the police explanation as to why they lost
36          control.


                                           16
 1              I said yesterday, and I say again to you, and I said
2          it to your representatives when I saw them last week, I
 3         can see no reason at all to review or re-examine that
 4         issue.    It appears to me that Lord Taylor had evidence to
 5         support his conclusion on that.      I can see no advantage
 6         whatever in reviewing that fact.      So, therefore, so far as
 7         I am concerned I agree with Lord Taylor on that point.
 8              The evidence which I am looking at does not relate to
 9         what happened outside the ground at all.      It relates to
10         what happened inside the ground.      The most important
11         aspect of it is probably the points about the video
12         evidence, which I am sure you      are familiar with. That
13         bears on the     police knowledge of the state of the pens 3
14         and 4.    That is an important issue and one which I have
15         very much in     mind.   The other evidence relates to the
16         questions of     what happened to people between the time that
17         they were crushed and the time that they died.      That is
18         something which, in the case of each individual who raises
19         the point, I have obviously got to look at.      It has got
20         nothing whatever to do with the conduct of the supporters
21         outside the ground.         So I hope you will accept it from
22         me that not only am I not prejudiced against the Liverpool
23         fans from that point.
24   MR.   GLOVER:    I didn't say you was.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      But people have been suggesting
26         that I am.     Actually it is exactly the opposite, it is the
27         other way round.     In so far as I have made up my mind
28         about anything I have made up my mind on that point in
29         favour of the Liverpool fa n s .   So it is very ironical to
30         me that I am being misrepresented in this way.
31   MR.   GLOVER:    I listened to a couple of telephone calls on the
32         radio last night, a phone-in, they were still saying that
33         they all got there late.      I know they know no different
34         but the truth is when they brought a statistician in he
35         proved that the amount of Liverpool supporters couldn't
36         get in that ground before half time because they only had


                                        17
 1         7 turnstiles to go through.
2    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:   Y e s , I know that.
 3   MR.   GLOVER:   I felt like, Taylor, he done like a fairly good
4          job on it when I read the report but I don't think that,
 5         they should have been allowed to go right through the
 6         inquest for 80 odd, 90 days talking about drinking all the
 7         time because Popper had already read the Taylor report.
 8         They had no right to do that.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    Thank you very much.   We will have
10         to break off now.

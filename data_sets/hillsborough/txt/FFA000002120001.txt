            Th e N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t fans w e r e a l r e a d y a r r i v i n g in
the v i c i n i t y of the g r o u n d b e t w e e n 12 a n d 12.30 w h e n we

L i v e r p o o l s u p p o r t e r s w e r e s e r i o u s l y d e l a y e d on the M62:
this f r o m R o g a n T a y l o r of the F o o t b a l l S u p po rte rs
As s o c ia tio n.

      My a t t e n t i o n was d r a w n to fans sc a l i n g the p e r i m e t e r
fence b e f o r e the ne ar m i s s when, appare ntl y, B e a r d s l e y hit
the cro ss b a r at the o t h e r e n d - I d id not see this be c a u s e
I was l o o k i n g at the crowd.

      A p o l i c e o f f i c e r a t t e m p t e d to speak to the L i n e s m a n
on the n e a r side, but the L i n e s m a n c a r r i e d on w i t h play;
another p o l i c e m a n then cam e into the p i t c h from b e h i n d the
goal and the r e f e r e e s u s p e n d e d p l a y at six m i n u t e s p a s t
three.

            A f t e r abo ut 15 m i n u t e s I w e n t to the Polic e C o n t r o l
Box w h i c h ir onically, a f f o r d s w h a t one w o u l d have t ho ugh t
was a p e r f e c t v i s i o n of the t e r r a c e s in q u e s t i o n l ook ing
d i r e c t l y a l o n g the goal line f rom the c o r n e r of the
stadium. C l o s e c i r c u i t t e l e v i s i o n c a m e r a s scan the t err ace s
and the e n v i r o n s of the ground.

            T h e y t o l d me that a g a t e or gate s h a d been f o r c e d a n d
s h o wed m e a p i c t u r e w h i c h p u r p o r t e d to r e p r e s e n t this.
Th eir i n d i c a t i o n was t hat the m a t c h w o u l d have to be
a b a n d o n e d be c a u s e the re h a d b e e n fatalities.            The P o l i c e
C o m m a n d e r was present, t o g e t h e r w i t h the A s s i s t a n t Chie f
Co n s t a b l e Mr Jackson.

            So me 25 m i n u t e s a f t e r the s u s p e n s i o n I c o n v e n e d a
m e eti ng of the thr ee C l u b s c o nce rne d, the Re f e r e e a n d the
Police C o m m a n d e r in the m a i n B o a r d Room.             Th e l i k e l i h o o d
was still that the m a t c h w o u l d have to be abandoned, but
the P o lic e s e e m e d to ha ve m o v e d s l i g h t l y aw ay f r o m the
pr os p e c t of a b a n d o n m e n t a nd w e r e not r u l i n g out the
p o s s i b i l i t y that the m a t c h w o u l d go on.          I think this was
p r o b a b l y b e c a u s e t hey w e r e f e a r f u l as to w hat w o u l d ha pp e n
if the full ext e n t of the s i t u a t i o n b e c a m e kn own at that
time.         T h e r e then f o l l o w e d a long p e r i o d of u n c e r t a i n t y
with p e o p l e of all th ree C l u b s a n d the m e d i a m i l l i n g a rou n d
not k n o w i n g w hat to do or w hat to say as it beca me a ppa r e n t
that the f ata l i t i e s wer e increasing.

      I a s k e d the Pol i c e C o m m a n d e r to stay in close c o nta ct
with the R e f e r e e w ho was in the c h a n g i n g room area for
obvious reasons, but I think that there was a last direct
contact they had for the best p a r t of an hour.

                In the i n t e r v e n i n g time the two t e a m m a n a g e r s we re
    taken to do a t a n n o y e d anno unc eme nt, but I d id not hear
    this.         Nor d i d I see for the m o s t p a r t w h a t was ha p p e n i n g
    on the p i t c h be c a u s e I was b e h i n d the scene s trying to mak e
    sure that n o t h i n g u n a u t h o r i s e d w a s done or said.         I
    u n d e r s t a n d th at there was no u r g e n c y show n in any r e s p e c t
    out on the f i e l d nor that any m a t e r i a l i n f o r m a t i o n was
    given out o v e r the tannoy.

               The M a n a g e r of N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t s ent out w o r d that
    he was ta ki n g his p la yer s home at one s t a g e a nd I w e n t into
    the d r e s s i n g r o o m to say to h i m a n d to the p l aye rs that,
    al tho ugh th e r e was a less than 5 0 / 5 0 c h a n c e of the m a t c h
    being resumed, there mus t be no i n d i c a t i o n fro m a nyb ody

t   that the gam e h a d been a b a n d o n e d un t i l the p o l i c e ga ve the
    say so.        E v ent ual ly, at about 4.2 5 p.m. I u n d e r s t a n d that a
    t an n o y e d a n n o u n c e m e n t was mad e to the e f f e c t that the m a t c h
    had b een ab andoned, that there h a d b e e n a seriou s in ci d e n t
    and p e o p l e w e r e r e q u e s t e d to k e e p the ir places.

            At that point, in the u n d e r s t a n d i n g that there had
    been about 50 fatalities, I felt able to spe ak to the m e d i a
    who h a d b e e n c l a m o r i n g ar ou n d for some ti me and I d id
    interviews w i t h B.B.C. T e l e v i s i o n a n d B.B.C. Rad i o a n d gave
    a short p r e s s c o n f e r e n c e to the w a i t i n g r e p o r t e r s at abou t
    4.40 p.m.

             I u n d e r s t a n d that all t h r o u g h this time the b a c k r o o m
    staff, m a n y of t hem you ng boys a n d gi r l s at S h e f f i e l d
    Wednesday, w e r e inv ol v e d in s u p p l y i n g hot w a t e r and
    st ret che r f a c i l i t i e s a nd it w o u l d a p p e a r t hat they g ave a
    superhuman p erf orm anc e.             For t h e fi rst ti me we had a r r a n g e d
    that the h ost C l u b Doc t o r be s i t u a t e d in the tunnel area,
    so as to p r o v i d e quic k and eas y a c c ess to the pit c h in v i e w

t   of w h a t h ad h a p p e n e d to                      of M a n c h e s t e r Cit y
    recently, b u t I was not aware w h a t a c t i o n the Doct or was
    invo lve d in.         I have to say that the o n l y p e r s o n t h r o u g h o u t
    the e p iso de that I saw acting w i t h any d e g r e e of u r g e n c y
    was the S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y p h y s i o ,                     \ wh o was
    runnin g up a n d down the pit c h in the m i d d l e tending to the
    injured presu mab ly.

               Aft e r the two Clubs h a d le ft the C h a i r m a n of
    S h e f fi eld W e d n e s d a y was p e r s u a d e d to leave the g r o u n d by
    his relatives.

               In the m i d d l e of the e v e n i n g I w a s c a l l e d to a
    me e t i n g of the r e m ai nin g D i r e c t o r s of S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y
    together w i t h the Club Secretary, G r a h a m Mackrell.                        I felt
    that, in v i e w of the c o n t i n u i n g m e d i a presence, their and
    our interests wo uld be best s e r v e d by t h e m leaving the
    grou nd so tha t one c o u l d not be p i c k e d off as a gai nst the
    other in m a k i n g c o n f l i c t i n g s t a t e m e n t s a n d in view of the
    fact that the Secr eta ry w o u l d h a v e to r e m a i n there anyway.
    We had p r o m i s e d to make o u r s e l v e s a v a i l a b l e to E.B.C.
    T e l evi sio n for the m i d - e v e n i n g N e w s and for Match of the
    Day later, bo th of whi ch we did.                     On the i nterviews we gave
our i mpr ess ion s of what h a d happened, we s a i d there were
two v e r s i o n s as to wha t h ad happened, one that the gat es
had been forced, the ot h e r that the ga tes h a d been o p e n e d
by the p o l i c e a n d the p e o p l e we re let in w i t h o u t h a vin g
their t i cke ts c l o s e l y c h e c k e d or the c o u n t e r f o i l s t orn off.
There is m u c h evi d e n c e of c o u n t e r f o i l s not h a vin g b e e n torn
off.        It w a s r u m o u r e d t h r oug hou t the e v e n i n g that Col in
M o y n i h a n w o u l d be on his w ay to S h e f f i e l d but de s p i t e
numero us t e l e p h o n e cal ls to G o v e r n m e n t c o n t a c t s we w e r e
unable to a s c e r t a i n w h e t h e r this was so.             In the event,
pu r ely by chance, I s aw h im arri ve in the o p p o s i t e c o r n e r
of the g r o u n d w i t h the P o li ce at abo u t 10.4 5 p.m.               I met
h i m on the t err a c e s and we i n s p e c t e d t h e r e l e v a n t areas.

            The s t o r y was that there h a d b e e n a v e r y real
p o s s i b i l i t y of an ac cid e n t ou t s i d e the t u r n s t i l e s b e c a u s e
of the v o l u m e of L i v e r p o o l s u p p o r t e r s c o m i n g at the last
minut e and a d e c i s i o n h a d been m a d e to o p e n a c o n c e r t i n a
type door a nd a l l o w th em through.                 T h e y w o u l d then have
gone th r o u g h into a ho l d i n g ar ea a n d t h r o u g h a 15 y a r d
a p p r o x i m a t e l y long tunne l onto the t e r r a c e s f i l t e r i n g
either to thei r left or righ t at the ir w h i m into on e of the
two mid d l e s ect i o n s of the terrace.                 T h e r e w a s an e x i t gate
in e ach of the two sec tions of the p e r i m e t e r fencing.                         The
p e r ime ter f e n c i n g a p p e a r e d to have b e e n b r e a c h e d in a
number of places, but it m a y be that this h a d been
d e l i b e r a t e l y cut by me m b e r s of the Fir e S e r v i c e who
attended.

            The scen es of d ist res s w ill r e m a i n w i t h me forever,
of anger, bit terness, frustration, b e w i l d e r m e n t .                The
ne arest r o o m to p e o p l e c o m ing away f r o m the t err a c e s and
the p l a y i n g a r e a down t h rou gh the p l a y e r s tunnel, w as the
Referees' c h a n g i n g room a nd a l t h o u g h this is on ly small,
the Re f e r e e and L i n e s m e n m a d e it a v a i l a b l e to act as a
haven for a sit down for those p e o p l e w ho c ame t h r o u g h and
w i s h e d to do so.          The co n d u c t of the R e f e r e e and his
Line sme n was impeccable, gi ven the d i f f i c u l t i e s he h a d in
m a i n t a i n i n g a f low of i n f o r m a t i o n fr om the P o l ice and
pa s s i n g this on to the two teams a n d g i v e n the fact that he
had nearl y a do zen F.A. P e r s o n n e l l o o k i n g o v e r his s h o u l d e r
as it were.            I don't k n o w w h a t he c o u l d have been e x p e c t e d
to do u n d e r the c i r c u m s t a n c e s but he w a s a n xio us to
offi c i a l l y p o s t p o n e the game at the e a r l i e s t o p p o r t u n i t y in
v i e w of the fact that the p l a y e r s h a d by then been off the
field for an hour and I b e li eve by the e n d of the d a y he
was c o n s i d e r a b l y shaken.       I t h o u g h t the co mm e n t s of C o l i n
Mo yni han w e r e e nti r e l y a p p r o p r i a t e in s p e a k i n g of t ho s e who
had been b e r e a v e d and h a d re l a t i v e s of f r i e n d s in j u r e d and
not e n t e r i n g into any debat e about the v a r i o u s side issues;
in fact, I though t he was as sha ken as a n y b o d y by the
enormi ty of what had happened, p o s s i b l y b e c a u s e he was one
of the few who spoke to r e l ati ves of the bereaved.
            I p r o m i s e d T.V. A.M. that I w o u l d be a v a i l a b l e at
home at the e n d of the te l e p h o n e to r e s p o n d to q u e s t i o n s on
Sunday morning, but in the e ve n t I d e c i d e d to go to the
Studio a nd p ick up any p o i n t s at the e nd of an hou r and a
half p r o g r a m m e w h i c h I felt h a n d l e d the d i s a s t e r w i t h
c o n s i d e r a b l e c are and sen sitivity.

        I then w e n t to the O f fi ce to c o n s u l t those M e m b e r s of
the M a n a g e m e n t T e a m w ho had c o m e in.

      We d e c i d e d to call in a d d i t i o n a l M e m b e r s of Staff in
order to h a n dle the M e d i a and to d e t e r m i n e a p l a n of acti on
over t h e ' c o u r s e of the nex t th ree or four days.

            I then spoke to the o f f i c e of the P r e s i d e n t of The
Fo otb all Assoc iat ion , The D uke of Kent, w h o was due b ack in
L o n don fro m the W est Indies in the m i d d l e of Sund ay

that The F o o t b a l l A s s o c i a t i o n would, w i t h o u t preju dic e,

        On S u n d a y m o r n i n g I sp oke to the Ch airman, I sa id

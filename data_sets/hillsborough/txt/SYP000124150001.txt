 «
 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

                DEVESTATION ON THE PITC                       *S ABANDONED,   ONE

PHOTOGRAPHER WAS TAKING PHOTOGRAPH                            _KNEES IN THE CORNER     IN

FRONT OF US ON THE PITCH, HE HAD A                            SAW ABOUT 3 FANS GO UP

TO HIM AND THEY STARTED KICKING OU                            'IS WERE THROWING OBJECTS

AT HIM.      A POLICEMAN CHASED THE LA         *WAY



DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

<^jjER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

YES,WHILST THE DESTINATION WAS GOING ON I SAW A POLICEMAN "BIG H A T 11 STANDING

ON THE STAIRCASE NEAR TO ME, THE ONE NEAR NO 2 PEN.            THE POLICEMAN WAS

SHOUTING TOWARDS US "YOU F O R C ED THE BLEEDING GATES OPEN YOU B A S T A R D S " OR

WORDS TO THAT EFFECT.            THE CROWD ALL AROUND ME WERE GETTING VERY ANGRY AT THE

P O L I C E M A N ’S COMMENTS.   EVENTUALLY A POLICEMAN WITH A FLAT HAT SUDDENLY

APPEARED AND THE POLICEMAN WITH THE BIG HAT LEFT THE STAIRCASE AREA.                THE FANS

ON THE PITCH WERE RUNNING THE SHOW.            THE EMERGENCY SERVICES WERE SLOW IN

REACTING TO THE SITUATION.            I SAW THE FIRST AMBULANCE DRIVE VERY SLOWLY

AROUND THE PITCH,         HE TOOK AGES,   WHEN HE COULD HAVE SIMPLY DRIVEN ACROSS THE

PITCH.     THERE WAS A TOTAL LACK OF TANNOY COMMUNICATION TO THE FANS.

 Q34

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 YES - THE LEPPINGS LN END OF THE GROUND WAS TOTALLY INADEQUATE FOR THE

 SUPPORT THAT MUST HAVE BEEN EXPECTED IN VIEW OF LAST.YEARS CARBON COPY MATCH

 AND ITS ATTENDANCE.       I DID ATTEND THIS         GAME LAST YEAR IN 1988 0 0 0 0 8 8 ,   IF THE

 POLICE OPENED THE GATE TO THE TERRACES              IT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION AT THE TIME.

 THE POLICE EMPHASIS WAS ALL OUT OF THE              GROUND ON THE MATCH ROUTES AND         NOT ON

 CROWD SAFETY WITHIN THE GROUND.

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 r ^ N O T H I N G AT ALL.

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE SUPPORTERS THAT WERE CLIMBING OVER THE FRONT FENCING WERE BEING TOLD BY

 POLICE TO.GET BACK          IN.   I THINK THIS WAS BECAUSE THEY JUST D I D N ’T REALISE

 THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM INSIDE THE ENCLOSURE.              I SAW 2 POLICEMEN IN THE

 STANDS LOOKING DOWN BUT I D O N ’T THINK THEY KNEW EITHER.

 054

       THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I THINK THERE WAS A MISTAKE IN THE TICKET ALLOCATION.                IN SOME WAYS I FEEL

 GUILTY I WENT INTO LIVERPOOL AND WITH A FOREST TICKET.               IF TICKETS HAD B E E N

 CHECKED I WOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED AWAY AND I AM JUST WONDERING HOW MANY OT HER

 PEOPLE GOT IN IN THE SAME WAY.

 THE FOREST FANS AS TO HOW SERIOUS THE SITUATION             WAS   BUT THEY SANG

 AND CHANTED AT FIRST             WHICH CAUSED ANGER AMONGST THE   LIVERPOOL

 NO


Q18

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS H A N D L E D ,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE POLICE OFFICERS AT THE FRONT SEEMED TO BE WORKING ON THEIR OWN

 INITIATIVE.           INITIALLY THE POLICE WERE STOPPING PEOPLE GETTING OUT

 OF THE PEN BUT ONCE THEY REALISED THE PROBLEM THEY WERE HELPING FANS

        OF THE PEN,,

 Q34

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I THINK THAT LIVERPOOL SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED THE OTHER END OF THE

 GROUND.     THE ORGANISATION OUTSIDE THE GROUND WAS VERY BAD.          THE FENCE AT THE

 FRONT SHOULD HAVE MORE GATES AND THE TOP SHOULD BE SHAPED DIFFERENT.             IF

 THE OUTSIDE GATE WAS TO BE OPENED THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN POLICE OFFICERS

 BLOCKING THE TUNNEL MAKING THE FANS GO TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT TO THE TERRACES

 T^pRE SHOULD NOT BE ANY SIDE FENCES AT THAT END.            THE FENCE AT THE FRONT

 SHOULD NOT BE AS HIGH AS IT IS.                               ~

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STORED?                                      (J2o
 THERE APPEARED TO B E A LACK OF ORGANISATION FROM THE STEWARDS AND POLICE.

 AS FAR AS I WAS AWARE THERE WAS NO DIRECTION FROM THE PA SYSTEM TO INFORM

 THE CROWD OF THE SITUATION..


<319

 G34

 £     THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 LACK OF POLICE ORGANISATION INITIALLY OUTSIDE THE GROUND.      THERE WAS NO

 DIRECTIONS GIVEN BY THE STEWARDS AS TO WHERE FANS COULD HAVE GONE TO

 OTHER PENS,    IN THE TERRACES.   THE FENCES THAT SEGREGATE EACH PEN ARE

 UNNECESSARY AND SHOULD BE REMOVED.     AND THE FENCES ON THE ANTI-INVASION

 FENCE MUST BE BIG ENOUGH 80 THAT A LARGE CROWD CAN BE CLEARED QUICKLY.

CRUSHED.    IT WAS ONLY THE OCCASIONAL SMALL CHILD WHO THEY LET OUT.                THE

MEDICAL FACILITIES WERE NON EXISTENT.          EVERY INITIATIVE WAS MADE BY THE

FANS, THE POLICE JUST DID NOTHING.         LIVERPOOL SHOULD HAVE HAD MORE TICKETS

AND ALLOCATED THE FOREST END STAND.

BOLT CUTTERS SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE AVAILABLE AND KEPT BY THE FENCING IN VIEW

  HAMPERING THE RESCUE ATTEMPTS,             PEOPLE WERE RUNNING TOWARDS HIM TRYING TO RIP

  HIS CAMERA OF HIM.           HE WAS EVENTUALLY MARCHED OUT OF THE GROUND BY THE

AT THE TIME I WAS AT THE ENJRtfNCE TO THE GROUND,             THERE WAS A LARGE CROWD

(j^JSIDE AND A CRUSH I N G O I N G   ON BETWEEN THE WROUGHT IRON GATES AND THE

A GOpD^ftfar, BECAUSE IT STOPPED THE PROBLEM,            I SAW AND HEARD PEOPLE SHOUTING

 INSTINCTS TOOK THEM,    (TOWARDS THE       TUNNEL AND TO PENS 3 & 4).

 I ALSO THINK THE MAJOR FACTOR WAS          THAT PEOPLE ONCE IN PENS 3 & 4 C O U L D N ’T

MOVE FROM THE DIFFERENT PENS,        AND    IT APPEARED TO ME THAT ALL THE CROWDING         WAS

ONLY IN PENS 3 AND 4, YET SOME OF THE OUTER PENS HAD GAPS.                 I THINK THAT IF

THE GAME WAS GOING TO BE HELD AT THIS GROUND THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER

 ALSO OUTSIDE THE GROUND IT WAS A COMPLETE BOTTLENECK,          POLICE SHOULD HAVE

 FILTERED THE CROWD FOR NON-TICKET HOLDERS AND CORDONED OFF LEPPINGS LANE

 THAT SHEFFIELD OFFICERS LEFT ALL THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR FAN CONTROL TO MOUNTED

 MERSEYSIDE OFFICERS.

                                     s t at es :



             1   .     I was born



            2.         I joined the Sheffield Corporation Ambulance Services at

             Corporation St, Sheffield,                        leaving in 1973 to join Long ley Ambulance

            Station where 1 am now based.



             3.        /I am a qualified
                               ^         ambulance m a n .                     I have attended and obtained

             the Miller          certif i cate following completion of the compulsory

             residential          course.          I have since received in-house training and

             attended refresher              courses.

                                                                               S3365

4.     On Saturday 15th April         1989 (150489),      I was not due to report

for duty u nt i 1 2200 h o u r s .   I was on the night shift working from 2200

hours through to 0600 hours the following m o r n i n g .



5.     I was watching television at home on the afternoon of Saturday

15t h,<130489) when I saw the TV r ep or t , the incident at Hillsborough

Football Ground.        I realised immediately that there was a major

inci den t.    I tried to contact control by t ele ph one .          I was unable to

get through as all the telephone            lines we re b u s y .   I left home and

drove to Longley Ambulance Station.              I arrived at Longley Ambulance

Station at approximately 1520 h o u r s .         I used the direct line to               1

control.      This   1ine was busy.       I 1 istened to control on the radio

receiving equi pment at Long 1ey Station.             I was joined by

and I radioed to c o n t r o that I was taking a vehicle to Hillsborough.

I spoke to                      who confirmed that I should do t h a t .



                         and 1/each took a vehicle            The vehicle   I took was

a day vehicle and I booked out of the Station.                 I was listening to the

messages from control which I did not ac kn ow le dg e, X simply proceeded

to Hi 11sborough.       I was told to proceed to the gate on Penistone Rd

and was told that it was the casualty clearing point.                   I switched to

the ERC channel and was unable to make contact because of stat i c .                  I

returned to channel 2 on whi ch I could receive m e s s a g e s .



7.       I drove down Herries Rd S.          There were problems with the

radio.     I drove into Penistone Rd to the first entranee on the left

I parked the vehicle which had call sign S 4 0 3 .             I went   inUr the area

adjacent to the gymnasium where I was nu*t by an ambulanceman from

Middlewood Ambulance Station          (                              had a patient

that was bleeding h e a v i l y .    At this time a Policeman asked me
                                                                                             PAGE
                                                                                             S3365

          to move my vehicle to let another vehicle in the ground get

           clear.       The traffic was being marshalled by the Police.             There were

          many people screaming for attention.                 I stayed wiah the man from

          Middlewood Ambulance Station and we loaded t<Ke casualty onto the

          am b u l a n c e .   Once the casualty was loaded/into a cot cardiac

           pulmonary respiration techniques were applied as was a bag and mask

          to help the casualty breath.



          8.                   who told me he was running short of ai rw ays .      I gave him

          half my supply of airways.               The scene which greeted me on arrival was

          a mass of fans, many in shock and many people moving around in a

                                         confined
                                               who area,
                                                    told me saw
                                                            that the priority was to clear

          serious casualties.            The situation about me seemed chaotic.         1 do not

          know who was in control.               I did not see any senior officers from the

          ambulance service although I did see senior Police Officers.                    There

          were some Police vehicles parked adjacent to the gymnasium which I

          considered to be an hinderance to the casualty clearing operation.

          There were many vehicles,              emergency vehicles and Police vehicles

          parked in Penistone Rd and the gym area which made access and exit

          from the ground very difficult.

                                             y

          9,         l saw                   who then gave the keys to the vehicle to a

          Police Officer ai\j/ f to Id him to drive,                   was carry ng out cardiac

           pulmonary respiration and 1 was using the bag                        k to keep the

          casualty breathing.            I considered the age             e casualty to be

5 < M £ i r r between 12 and 15 years old.            1 thought thlr casualty was dead.       The

          journey to the Northern General Hospital was via Penistone Rd and

          Herr ies Rd and not He r r ies Rd S and throughout                   and I continued

           cardiac pulmonary res pi rat ion and bag and mask t e chni gnp^_ although

          there was no improvement               in the patient

10.      We did not have a minute man on board the ambulance.        Day

vehicles do not usually carry minute m e n .



11.      In the back of the yehi cle travelling to the hospital there were

three people; a polii                        and I.    A Policeman was

driving.     He was inexperienced and had obviously not had much

experience of driving ambulances.         It was very difficult to work on

the patient as we were constantly being thrown around in the rear of

the vehicle.



12.      I was aware from the outset that I was attending a major

incident.     I had heard control on the radio also say that the

situation at Hillsborough had been declared a major          incident.



13.      The journey to the hospital was rough.       It was conducted at high

speed.     I have no idea if we had a Police escort,       I was too busy

attending the young boy and the only time I looked out of the vehicle

window was when I had picked myself up off my knees after a near miss,



14.      The driver of the vehicle was complaining how bad the traffic

was and I was continuing to ask                       if we were getting a

response.     I should estimate the journey took five or ten minutes.

The traffic was bad and we drove into the Barnsley Rd entrance.              There

was a bottleneck of traffic    into the Barnsley Rd entrance of the

hospital.     The casualty department was in chaos.       Doctors and nurses

were screaming that they could not take any more patients.           A doctor

was requesting someone to telL control not to send any more casualties

to the Northern General Hg^pital and suggested they should a l 1 be

redirected to the Roya     Hallamshi re
                                                                             PAGE
                                                                             S3365



15.    Our vehicle was       parked in the yard because there were so many

vehi cles waiting for casualty.            Once a vehicla moved away from

casualty our vehicle reversed into a bay aiya we unloaded a patient

into casualty.      A doctor examined the b o y and declared him dead on

arrival.     We took the body to the p 1as\^er room, the temporary mortuary

at the hospi t a l .



16.     I tried to contact       contro1 on returning to our vehicle.        I

eventually contacted control who told me to return to Hillsborough.

At this stage I do not remember who was in the vehicle with me.



17.     I drove to HilIsborough using Herries Rd S which was c 1e a r .

There was a Policeman on every junction.             I entered Penistone Rd and

was di rected by Police       into a queue of ambulances waiting to gain

access to the football ground.             My return journey had been very swift.

The Police had kept the road very clear.



18.     I wan.ted probably ten minutes         in the queue and Station Officer
                             y
P a ul P ARSON l.hpn tn 1rl mjr t.n pull   in very close to a Police vehicle and

                                 stood in the road directing traffi c around

me.   I parked t h ^ vehicle as directed and I was told by Station

Officer EASON to remove two cots.             I unloaded the cots.   I had the

keys to the vehicle and I handed the cots to a fireman in the

gymnasium area.



19.     An injured boy had         en placed on the vehue’tfle and I was told to

take him tq/the
          o/th Royal^-ial lams hi re Hospital.            grabbed an assistant

                  who was my attendant on the journey.         A Policeman

offerel^assistance and c1 imbed i n .          I was being harassed to move the

ambulance because a Police emergency vehicle wished to pass me.



20.       As I drove down Leppings L n , a huge crowd of people were at a

junction in the road.            The Police traffic controllers waved me through

the traf f i c lights and progress towards the Royal Hallamshi re

was reasonably good although the traffic was very heavy,                  particularly

at Hi 1lsborough corner.           I moved as best     I could through the traffi c

and the journey took me ten or fifteen m i n u t e s .          I realised quite

early on that I was in the front of a convoy of several ambulances

together with Police vehi cles providing escorts.



21.       On arrival at the Royal Hal laiymi re the casual ty department was

well organised and was accepting jrasualt ies into the orthopaedi c a r e a .

The doctors were           able to assist the casualties very quickly.



22.          There were a lot of people on hand at the Royal Hallamshi re to

give us assistance.



23.       I handed over the casual ty at the Royal Hal larrishi re and reported

to control that I was cl ea r.           I was asked to switch to channel 4 and

told       to stand by on the Netherthorpe Rd dual          carriageway.



24.          I joined a queue of 4 or 5 ambulances and others pul 1edin

behind m e .         I waited there for a w h i 1e .   There were St J o h n ’s

Ambulance people and Red Cross ambulance               people in the area t o o .



25.       I contacted control and tried to find                                   I

reported to control that                         was with me and acting as

a tt e n d a n t .
                                                                               PAGE     7
                                                                               S3365

26.       Control      directed me to the fyoyjj   Hal lamshi re to transfer

patients from there to the King Edward Hospital.



27.         I returned to the Royal Hallamshi re and met

the Standards and Efficiency Officer, who was co-ordinating operations

at the H a 11amshi r e .      She was the only Off i cer that I    saw at the Royal

Hallamshi r e . Whilst at the Royal Hallamshi re we           we re approached by the

pr e ss .     We refused to answer questions and told         them to seek any

information they wanted from a Seni or Off i c e r .



28.       A Police Officer told us that only one third of the Poli cemen on

duty had radios at the Hillsborough Football G r o u n d .         The radios are

apparently only issued to men on an 8 hour s h i f t .



29.       The pat i ents were collected from the Hallamshi re and the Police

Constable          (named John)   gave a hand to load.   We had four patients who

were to be transferred to the King Edward hospi tal .



30.       The pat ients we re handed over and I reported to c ont ro l.

Control ordered us to return to b a s e .          I believe the time was now

about       1930 or 1945 h o u r s .



31.       I requested permission to go to the Northern General H o s p i t a l .

The Police Constable with us wanted to collect equipment from the

ho s p i t a l .   Control   requested that on our attendance we should collect

a patient from the Northern General Hospital and transfer the patient

to the Royal Hallamshi re CT scan uni t .



32.       We attended the Northern General Hospital and dropped off the

Police Constable who went to a Police car in the g r o un ds .
                                                                              PAGE
                                                                              S3365



33.             and I collected the patient.        We were originally told to

collect patient            15, however, we eventually collected patient number

32.       The patient was loaded with a full medical CT scan crew

including a doctor, a nurse and a sister.              The patient was about    15

years of age and he was transferred to the Royal H a ll am sh ir e .



34.       We had a trouble free journey to the Royal Hallamshi r e .          The

patient was delivered to transit and transferred to one of the

Royal Hallamshire cots and handed over.             I waited for the

doctor,     nurse and sister to return to the vehicle before returning to

the Northern General Hospital.            On return,   I cal1ed control who

ordered me to return to base.



35.       I returned to base at approximately 2230 hours and left

the base at 2235 or 2240 hours.



36,       I am aware of the major        incident plan and procedures.   I

am not aware of any major incident plan for the Hi 1lsborough

           Further to my statement I made to the Trent Health Authority

           Solicitors at Rotherham,      I wish to correct     certain items in the typed

           copy which appear to be incorrect.

           On page two in paragraph seven it says that I saw                        with a

           patient who was bleeding heavily,          this is completely wrong,    I did not

           see anyone bleeding heavily.

           This could have been breathing heavily, I certainly did not see anyone
                              —
           bleeding.               asked me for some airways as he was running

           short,   I gave him some.

           I then moved my a m bulance to a better position and I was then joined

           by                  an Operation Superintendent who said there was a

           casualty to go to the Northern General Hospital.           On the instructions

           of                  I gave my ambulance keys to a Police Officer who was to
                                                                                        PAGE   2
                                                                                        S3365A
        drive the ambulance.

        I took over the bag and mask from                        and assisted

                  to work on the casualty.           1 considered the age       the casualty

        to be between 12-15 yrs,        he was wearing a white     *T ' shirt and blue
clLV'
        jeans,   I think he was dark haired,         he was certainly not blonde.

        There was a Police Officer driving the ambulance, myself and

                  in the rear with another Policeman,          I think thei       re

        other people in the ambulance but I cannot            remember who,

        We worked on the lad all the way to the Northern General H o s p i t a l , but

        to me he appeared t o b e d e a d .

        On arriving at the hospital we entered by the Barnsley Road entrance

        and reversed up to the casualty department.             It was chaotic,    the place

        was full of ambulances and people rushing around.             It was fairly early

        on in the incident and was just starting to get organised.

        We unloaded and took the cot inside the hospital and a Doctor                  came to

        our cot and took one look at the casualty and told us to take him to

        the plaster    room.    I am familiar with this hospital and know that the

        resuscitation room is on the left just inside the main entrance.                   We

        did not take this casualty into this room but to the plaster room

        which is again on the left but at least three            rooms further along the

        corri do r.

        On going into the plaster room we were met by a lady Doctor/I                  do not

        know her name.      She told us to place the casualty on a pilaster room

        bed. We placed the casualty on a bed,            I cannot remember which one.

        I then left the plaster room and took the cot on which we had moved

        the casualty on, back to my ambulance.My ambulance had been moved across

        the yard away from the casualty entrance.             I loaded the stretcher       cot

        into the a m b u l a n c e , and am almost   certain I drove back to the Football

        Ground on my own.

        This was the only casualty I took to the Northern General Hospital

           Further to my statement dated 21st April                    1989 I would like to add that

           today I have been shown photographs and video by WPC                                       and

           Inspector LAYTON of the West Midlands Police.                        These photographs and

           video footage relate to the Hillsborough Football                       disaster which

           occurred 15 April       1989 (150489).

           I have viewed video reference MAP/1 at time 14.56.33.18                            (data b a s e )

           (Exhibit No          ) and I am ninety five per cent sure that my late

We spoke. I apologise fo r not yet having written to you about Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith’s wish to see Ms Appleton and M r McCombie - 1 shall do so
shortly.

Meanwhile the Judge is as I said to see Debra Martin this afternoon. Ms
Martin is a form er Special Constable from South Yorkshire police. She
made a statement after the disaster - DJM1 attached - which mentions Kevin
Williams, who was one o f the people who died. This says that while he was in
her care (at about 1600 hrs) Kevin sat up and said (M um \ Later, Ms
Appleton took from her a statement - DJM2 - which omits this and says that
her (Debra M artin’s) memory o f the day is ‘vague and confused’.

We have a third statement from Ms Martin in which she claims that Ms
Appleton pu t pressure on her. This is also attached, and the Judge will be
asking M r Martin about it this afternoon. I should be grateful fo r any
observations Ms Appleton has so that the Judge can pu t these to Ms Martin.

 is ‘shocked, upset, and hurt’ by DJM’s statement and what she said in the Cook report
 (and sounded it).

 Says she thinks the interview with DM went very well. She knew how DM and the
 Williams family felt, her own sister had died in an accident just before. She was
 family liaison officer in the enquiry, so used to dealing with people upset by H ’boro.
                                                                             !
 Purpose o f her going was to establish the truth of what happened. Crooner had asked
 her to go, he didn’t believe that Kevin could have said ‘Mum’ given his injuries.
 Julie was very sympathetic to Debra. Debra was distressed, though atmosphere was
 ‘lovely’. Had coffee & biscuits. Mother left room after a while. No other police
 officer was with her.

 Second DM statement does not contradict the first one.

 Julie felt the Cook Report was a lot of lies, very angry about it.

Interview lasted a couple of hours. No pressure applied. Julie did not say, as quoted
in Cook Report, that police did not believe DM was at Hillsboro - she obviously was.

O:\HJLLS80R\MISC\S/D.DOC
I am Debra June Martin, a former special police constable with South Yorkshire
Police.     There is now produced and shown to me exhibit ‘DJM1 appended to this
my statement.        This exhibit is a statement which I made on 8 May 1989, in relation
to my involvement at Hillsborough Football Stadium on 15 April 1989.


I confirm that the contents of the statement dated 8 May 1989 are true.


In relation to exhibit ‘DJM2’ appended hereto, I would like to point out that the
statement contained therein, dated 17 March 1990, was compiled by WPS 7844
Appleton, a member of the West Midlands police force. WPS 7844 Appleton visited
me at my home on 17 March 1990 and tried to convince me that my original
statement dated 8 May 1989 was untrue.


After exerting considerable pressure on me WPS 7844 produced a dictionary which
she referred to whilst compiling a statement which I believe is the one appended
hereto as exhibit ‘DJM2’. In relation to exhibit DJM2 I was unable to read the
statement prepared by WPS 7844 Appleton due to my state of distress brought on by
her behaviour.


I signed the statement which she had prepared because of the pressure exerted by her
and because I wanted to put Hillsborough behind me.


          This statement has been signed
          by ex-SPC D J Martin

            Further to my prsvicus scatenents I utuld like to add the following,

            Cn Saturday 15th April 198? (150489) I wcarted in the capacity of

            Special Constable at toe F.A. Seni-Fip.al fcctiall match between

           Uvsrpccl F.C. and Nottingham Forest F.C. which was being played at

           the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield.

           «y ceccllection of the events of that day are vacue and confused.




              - re-uit cf this I feel that mv memory, my recollection of that day

          is ocssicly inaccurate.           I am unsure cf what time I arrived at the

           \ -i-.c_ La._ entrance to the crcunri or even hew I came to be cn the
         pitch but I. did.

         Ey t i . I set cnto toe pitch it seeded to b. M                 confusion, thar*

                police officers and supporters a U over toe place.                I could see

        P « ? l e who appeared to te injur- ar.d ptssiily dead, lying on th.

         X was In a state of shcck. I didn't knew what to do but my
pic--n
  ,coral instinct was to help these people in the best way that I could.
n<2
r C2n*t describe to you in any detail my exact movements over the next

half an hour cr so.       I knew that I approached several people lying on

the pitch and assisted if j»ssible.        I did not give any of these

people nouth-to-mouth or heart massage.

I dacided that there were enough people dealing with the situation

at the Leppincs lane end of the ground and made my way to the Scion

Kcp end of the ground.
I could see that hxxiies were teing carried frcm the Repines Lane end

to the Spicn Kcp end of the ground and then being placed on the pitcn.

I assisted to carry a number of dead and injured people frcm the Spicn

Kop end of the pitch, into the gymnasium where a temporary mortuary

hac been set up.       I was talking to seme of these people, c a m o r t m g

then and trying to reassure then.        I am unable to describe 'any of

these people in the detail.

By this time I really was in a state of shcck, I couldn t believe wnat

I was seeing.    I seered to be on automatic pilot.        My memories are

vBxy confused   clug   dis'ccirt.sd.

I can recall carrying a youth who I new knew to be, Kevin Daniel

WILLIAMS frcm the pitch to the gymnasium.         He was the last person tha.

 I assisted in carrying.        I first saw Kevin WILLIAMS lying cn e e pi ten

near to the gcal area at the Spion Kcp end of the ground.            At that

sta^e he wasn't on a hoarding or a s<— =tche_.

 x rHnH*cer that there ware several people around where he was lvmg.

 I can't recall anyone giving him mcuth to mcuth.          With the help of

 othsr people, who I can't recall, Kevin WILLIAMS was placed onto a

 hoeaiing and carried into the gymnasium.         Someone instructed me to

 stay with the body.
                       DEBRA   JANE


I didn't knew what to do.      I didn't want to believe the boy was dead.

I didn't knew if he was dead or not but I decided that I had got to

attHHDt to revive him.    I started to give him mouth-to-mouth but

sar.aone, I don't knew who, touched me cn the shoulder and told me he

■was dead.    By this time my head had gone, I wasn't aware of what I was

ddirig or what was really happening.

At 16.06 hours (1606) Dcctcr CURPEN examined Kevin WILLIAMS and

certified him dead.

I rHnsmber a detective officer,                     |helping me to

corolete the GEN 18 form (sudden death form).                          _ .

I s caved with the body until the -early hours of Sunday 16th April

(160489) when I escorted Kevin WILLIAMS, who at this stage had not

been identified, to the Medico Lecal Centre.

I identified the bedy by the number allocated, which in the case was

Nuircer 51.    I had no further dealings with Kevin WILLIAMS.

This statement is rede to the best of my recollection and I belie/e it

to be the truth.    However, under the circumstances I cannot be

positive that the details are accurate.      I have been quite badly

aff=ct=d by the whole incident and I am trying to erase it frcm rnv

mzrory.

I have marked on a plan of the pitch (Reference D.J.M.l) the

accroximate location where I first came into contact with the

deceased, Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS. .

          At afcut 2.50pm (1450) there was trouble at these turnstiles when the

          any way they could to get in, this included paying money to the

           police inside were passing fans back out over the turnstiles ard

           there was a very large numter of fans trying to get in still, so much

           that irounted officers and their horses « r e being pushed up against

           the wall.       The next thing I t o      is a large blue gate was opened and

           a large majority of the crt^d pushed their wav into the ground.                        I

            found myself being carried along with the era*! unable to resist.                         A

full cr static.    My radio was handed back to me and I ran to the

Lecoings Lane end of the ground.        Ambulances   and police cars were

rus.iinc tc that end of the ground.       When I get to the Leppings Lane

end of the around I saw a vast crcwd outside the turnstiles trying                 j

to ^et in, it must have been abcut four times larger than the crcvd                j

Kcp end numbered abcut 1000 plus and I would estimate about 4000                   ^

outside Leppings Lane end.

I can't really remamber hew, but somehow I got inside the ground,            ;

thrrucn the large     blue gate which was open,and I ended up on the         , „

pitzh.    I did not   go through the tunnel.

Ones on the pitch     I saw a lot of people who were obviously injured

anc I can renencer a man caning up to me shouting, "THERE'S TV© DEAD

YCU EASTARD".     I then saw people who appeared to be dead.      Peccie

wer3 scresmina and shouting and ambulances were driving onto tJ.-e pit— h.

I assisted ether police officers with dead and injured people ard

helced to take them cn stretchers to the gym, and I can remerber

sesinc officers frcm E2 (WCCDSE-ATS) everywhere.

I tock abcut 6 dead to the gym,        as well as m 2 nv injured and whilst I

was trvinc tc revive a ycung bcv I remember seme thing hitting me cn

the back of my head, but I didn't really notice until much later when

I frunc a large swelling.       I cculd see many bodies being put cn the

pitrh, sane of them appeared to be dying.         I lost count of the number

of bodies I helped carry into the gym.                                             J

I h 2 lced carry a ycunc bcv into      the gym frcm the pitch nearby.   He         j
stcrrced breathing so I cave him       the kiss of life, and heart massace         j

and a doctor also helped.       He started breathing and opened his eyes,

his only word was "MUM' and then he died.

At 4.06cm (1606) Dr CURFEN certified death and I stayed with him.            I

would describe him as white male, 5'6-5'7, 14-15 yrs, slim build and

brcvn hair, with a cut under his chin.          He had slightly crooked

teeth, there v«re no other marks cn the body.           He was wearing a white

shirt, areen sweat shirt, beige trousers, white socks, white Reehcks

and green and white boxer shorts. He had a gold metal chain with a

gold horn, a bus ticket, a train ticket and an entrance ticket.              He

hac no identification or money.         I later found cut the n u m b e r giver,

to this boy was 51.

I stayed with the body and at 5.20am (0520) Sunday 16 April

(160489) an ambulance arrived and I went with the body together with .

DC PCNT and GRIFFITHS to the Medico Legal Centre, WATER LANE,

Sheffield.    I stayed with the body until he was stripped and details

tak=.n from me.    I finally went off duty at 6.30 (0630) cn Sunday

16 April 1989 (160489).

At about 6.30pm (1830) Monday 8 May 1989 (080589) I saw PC's

anc          frcm West Midlands Police at my heme.         PC ? shcued to me a

partially completed report of death form that I identified as being

the fcrai I filled in whilst in charge of the tocy, details of name

anc other personal details are missing because there had been no

identification mace by the time I went heme.          All I can say is this

forr e l a t e s to bccv 51.   I new knew this is Kevin David WTLLL^MS,

b. 27.5.73 (27051973) of                              Formty, Merseyside.

 1.      I Paul Taylor will say:



 2.      I make this statement f u r t h e r to my statement d a t e d 4th

May    1989 to the H i l l s b o r o u g h E n q u i r y   (Appended h e r e t o ) .



3.       On page 4 of that st a t e m e n t I refer to a girl w h o                   I pulled

out of the mass of bodies and t r i e d to resuscitate.                            I als o r efer

to a boy who I helped.



4.      A p p r o x i m a t e l y 4-6 w e e k s a f t e r the d i s a s t e r I spoke to

Mr and Mrs Hicks.             It be c a m e a p p a r e n t that the girl to w h o m I

referred was V i c t o r i a Hicks.              I t old Mr and Mrs Hicks tha t w h e n I

lay the y oung boy next to V i c t o r i a a y o u n g po l i c e o f f i c e r w e a r i n g

gloves came along.             He felt for a p ulse in both V i c t o r i a and the

boy.     He then told me to leave b oth bodies as they w e r e dead.                             I

had not m e n t i o n e d a n y t h i n g a b o u t this police offi c e r in my e a r l i e r

statement nor did I s p e c i f i c a l l y m e n t i o n V i c t o r i a as at the time

of m a k i n g my statement I w a s not a ware of her identity.



5.     Mr and Mrs Hicks wer e k e e n that I added this i n f o r m a t i o n to

my earlier statement.              I t h e r e f o r e r e c e i v e d a v isit at home fro m

DC M c C o m b i e the Wes t M i d l a n d s P o l i c e o f f i c e r a s s i g n e d to the

Hicks'    case.      I exp l a i n e d w h a t   I w a n t e d to add to my e a r l i e r

statement.        He told me that unl e s s           I kne w the name and n u m b e r of

the polic e officer that I w o u l d be c o m m i t t i n g p e r j u r y if I m ade

another statement.            He told m e I c o u l d go to jail for c o m m i t t i n g

perjury.       At the time                                                      I was

frightened by what
DC McCombie was saying to me and a g r e e d that I w o u l d not m a k e

another statement.     I did not want to                                    j

did not refer to any of this when I gave evidence at the inquest.



Dated the             da y of September 1997.

 KOF, the turnstiles were shut dcwn.

 At about 2 .50pn (1450) there was trouble at these turnstiles when the

 Notts Forest fans, realising they were being locked cut, «are trying

 any way they could to get in, this included paying money to the

 turnstiles stewards and trying to buy tickets fron the touts.         The

 crcwd became very abusive and angry and I had to assist in the

 r^oval of fans t a n the ground. . I was cn the road sice and the

 police inside were passing fans back out over the turnstiles and

 there was a very large number of fans trying to get in still, so muon

 that irounted officers ard their horses were teing pushed up against

  the wall.   The next thing I knew is a large blue gate was opened and

  a large majority of the crc*d pushed their wav into the ground.         I

  found myself being carried along with the crcwd unabie to resist.            A

  ireunted officer grabbed mv collar tut has to 1 -       . <

full of static.    My radio was handed back to me and I ran to the

Lee pings Lane end-of the ground.     Ambulances and police cars were

rus.iinc to that end of the ground.     When I got to the Lappings Lane               j

end of the around I saw a vast crcwd outside the turnstiles trying                j

to ^eti in, it must have been abcut four times larger than the crcwd              !

I laft at the other end, so that would mean the crcwd at the Spicn

Kcp end numbered abcut 1000 plus and I would estimate about 4000                  \

outside Leppings Lane end.

I can't really rerember hew, but sanehow I got inside the ground,             :

throucn the large blue gate which was open, and I ended up on the         ^.

pitch.   I did not go through the tunnel.

Onca on the pitch I saw a lot of people who were obviously injured

and I can renenber a man caning up to me shouting, "THERE'S TTO DEAD

YCU EASTARD".     I then saw people who appeared to be dead.    Peccie

war a screaming and shouting and ambulances were driving onto the pitch.

I assisted other police officers with dead and injured people and

helced to take them on stretchers to the gym, and I can remencer

seeing officers frcm E2 (VOCDSEATS) everywhere.

I took abcut 6 dead to the gym, as well as many injured and w n n s t I

was trvinc tc rev ive a ycung b c v I remenber seme thing hitting me cn

the back of mv head, but I didn't really notice until much later wr.en

I found a larce swelling.     I could see many bedies being put cn the

pitch, seme of then appeared to be dvinc.       I lost count of the r.umcer

of bodies I helped carry into the gym.                                            I

I halted carry a ycung bev into the gym frcm the pitch nearby.       He

steeped breathing so I gave him the kiss of life, and heart massage

and a doctor also helped.     He started breathing ar.d opened his eyes,

his only word was "MUM' and then he died.

At 4 .06pm (1606) Dr CURFEN certified death and I stayed with him.            I

    would describe him as white male, 5'6-5'7, 14-15 yrs, slim build and

    brc*/n hair, with a cut under his chin.      He had slightly crooked

    teeth, there were no other marks cn the bcdv.       Ke was wearing a white

    shirt, crree.n sweat shirt, beige trousers, white socks, white Reebcks

    and green and white boxer shorts. He had a gold metal chain with a

    gold horn, a bus ticket, a train ticket and an entrance ticket. He

    had no identification or money.       I later found cut the number giver,

    to this boy was 51.

    I stayed with the body and at 5.20am (0520) Sunday 16 April

    (160489) an ambulance arrived and I went with the bccy tccether with .

i   DC FONT and GRIFFITHS to the Medico Legal Centre, ViATSR LANE,

    Sheffield.   I stayed with the body until he was stripped and details

    tak=n frcm me.   I finally went off duty at 6.30 (0630) cn Sunday

    16 April 1989 (160489).

    At about 6.30pn (1830) Monday 8 May 1989 (080589) I saw PC's      j
    anc          frcm West Midlands Police at my heme.     PC ? snowed to me a

    partially completed report of death form that I identified as being

    the form I filled in whilst in charge of the body, csi^aiis of name

    anc other personal details are missing because there hac been no

    identification mace by the time I went heme.       All I can say is this

    for7i relates to bcdv 51.     I new knew this is Kevin David WILLIAMS,

I s caved with the body until the early hours of Sunday 16 th Apr_l

(160489) when I escorted Kevin WILLIAMS, who at this stage had not

been identified, to the Medico Legal Centre.

I identified the bedy by the number allocated, which in the case was

Nurrcer 51.    I had no further dealings with Kevin WILLIAMS.

This statement is made to the best of my recollection and I believe it

to be the truth.     However, under the circumstances I cannot be

positive that the details are accurate.       I have been quite badly

affacted by the whole incident and I am trying to erase it frcm rnv

mHTory.
I have marked on a plan of the pitch (Reference D.J.M.l) t.*e

accroximate location where I first came into contact with the

decsased, Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS.

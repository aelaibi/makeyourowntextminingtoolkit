You wrote to the Home Secretary on 25 April 1989 enclosing one
from Mr       ]about the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster. Miss
Bannister, in her letter of 28 April 1989, mentioned that your
letter and your constituent's had been forwarded to me as the
Secretary to the Inquiry.

I have shown the correspondence to Lord Justice Taylor who has
noted it.                              \y

     Thank you for your letter of 25 April enclosing this one from
Mr                   a District Councillor who is a constituent of
^ ^ r s , giving an eye witness account of the tragic events at
Hillsborough.       We spoke about it in the House and, as you
requested, I have read the letter myself.


     I have great sympathy for Mr                 feeling of horror at
the events he witnessed.       Clearly the Inquiry which, as you know,
has been set up under the Chairmanship of Lord Justice Taylor to
investigate the events of Hillsborough and to make
recommendations will want to take careful account of eye witness
accounts such as this.       I have therefore forwarded your letter
and a copy of your constituent's to Mr Robert Whalley, Secretary
to the Inquiry, who can be contacted at this address.




                                                                           I

Dear Douglas,

       I enclose what I judge to be such
a useful eye-witness account of the events
of  Hillsborough   by  a District Councillor
who is a constituent of mine, that I thought
you would wish to read it personally.

                 Yours sincerely,




Rt.Hon. Douglas Hurd, C.B.E., M.P.

REVIEW OF ALL-SEATING

I am grateful to David Webb for sending me a copy of your
submission of 15 May on this subject to Ministers at DNH.

I was slightly surprised that, at paragraph 16, there was no
mention of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) on the
list of those you would wish to consult during the exercise.    I
am sure this was just an oversight.        If we can be of any
assistance in this matter, you will no doubt let me know.

s 1owly      the       pen    started           to       fill       up as          n o r m a l , we           mai ntai n e d        our

position.              I /6anyn,         be     sure          of    the       times          exactly           but     I would          say      that

by a b o u t     2.40ypm           I was        starting                to    feel       a    little           u n c o m f o r t a b l e , by

u n c o m f arta.'Une        I mean          that        I was          feeling          very          ho t    and     I noticed             that

the    crash       barrier          wasnt           at    our       backs          any more,                there      were       people

behind       me a n d        in    front        of       the       barriers,             I had also                 moved        towards         the

fencing,                          was    still           standing             to m y         immediate              rig h t .       I think

that    there was             a    gap       in th e          fence          to m y      left          at     the    very        back      of    the

pen,    th e     pen     to m y         left        wasn't          full       and       I could              easily        see     pieces          of

terracing,             I didnt          at    any        time       see a n y         police            officer          or      s t e w a r d at

this    exit       point          into       th e    next          pen,       I heard             people        saying           things

like,       “T h i s    is    bloody          silly"           I was          feeling             c o n c e r n e d at        this       point.

I ha d m y       hands        and       arms        in f r o n t         of    my     chest            and     I had        no    control           over

my    movements,             the    other           fans       were          being       packed             in t i g h t e r      and      tighter

and    I was       finding          it       difficult              to       breath /easily.

At    this      poin t       I recall           fans          climbing             over^he              fence        to m y       1 eft      into

the    ne x t    pen,        the    game        had       started             by    this          time,        but     I cant          remember

the    start       of    the m a t c h          or a n y           of    the       play action,                  I can        re c a l l     looking

round and             seeing          fans        being          pulled          out       of     the    pen       into    the       seating

area     above         us,       I couldnt               in a n y w a y           concentrate                 on    the    g a me,        X was

feeling          scared a nd was                    concerned about                        loosing        my       footing        on      the

te r r a c e .

All     of a s u d d e n          there           was       a s                                          , I. can o n l y            describe

the     surge         as    being        massive,                I                                        this       was     accompanied                     by

any     shouting            as    is     the        case w h e n a goal                      is    scored,          all    I can          re c a l l         is

that      people           were       screaming              and        shouting,               I dont        know what           though™

I c o u l d n ’t c o n t r o l           my m o v e m e n t s              at all,           we    moved       forward and                to       the

left     and      then          the    crowd           settled again,                      I looked           to m y      r i g ht       to w h e r e

Stuart          should          have     been,           he w a s n t         there          any    m o r e,       then    suddenly                I sa w

his     red top,            I grabbed               at      him and           put      my a r m         round       him.

I cannot          recall          any        feeling             of     not      being          able     to    breath any                more          I

just     felt         very       unsafe.

I did       not       see a n y        gate         opened            in the          fence        at    the       front     of      our       pen          but

1 did      see        the       gate    opened              at       the    fronton               the    pen       to my     left,            I was

cons c i ous          of    people           climbing                o v e i ^ n i ' fence          at    the       front       of       our       pen,       I

saw a man             c l i m b on      top         of      ths^fence             and        then       turn       round and             he    passed

a   small        child who             took         hold         of     the      man       round        his    neck and           was         taken

onto     the      pitch.

1 then          thought          how     bad        the      pressure             of       the     crush       had       been     for         me       and    1

thought          of    the       people           at     th e        front       of    the        pen,    I heard          fans          chanting

and    shouting             lo u d l y .

I looked          towards             th e    pitch and                 I saw         tw o      supporters           on th e         fence,                they

were     on      top       of    the    first            section            of    fencing           in the          bottom        left         hand

                At    this     time        th e    crowd          r o u n d me       had    eased          and       my       feeling        of      being

                                                                                                                                         S1047

pulled       through          the        hol e .

There       was    a    lot       of     shouting            from          the      pitch        as     more      and more         people          got

onto    it,       people          were       shouting             to       be    c arried away,                 there       were     so m a n y

people       at    the       front          that       it w a s        impossible                fo r    me     to    help,      there

were    literally             hundreds                of    people          on t h e        pitch.

At    one    stage         the      police            set    up a          cordon along                 the     centre       line      of     the

pit c h ,    th e N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t                fans       were       taunting              the L i v e r p o o l     f a ns,         I

was    aware       of a g r o u p            of       some       two       hundred          or    so      fans       in the      right        hand

corner       of    the       pitch          charging             towards            the F o r e s t          fans,     when      the     Forest

fans    realised what                    was      happening                then      the       taunting           stopped,         the

Liverpool          fans       didnt          get       to    the       Forest          end       of     the     pitch.I        didnt        see

anything          t h at     wa s      of a       criminal             nature.

Because       neither                             or       I could          help       in      the      s i t u a t i o n we     decided           to

leave       the    g ro u n d ,        we    walked          through             the      tunnel         and     attempted           to w a l k

out    of    the       gate       next       to       the    turnstiles                we      entered          t h o u g h we     couldnt             do

this    so we w e n t             o ut      of    other          turnstiles               to     our      right       (marked Nos             1-16)

we    walked       back       to       our       car       and    drove          home.

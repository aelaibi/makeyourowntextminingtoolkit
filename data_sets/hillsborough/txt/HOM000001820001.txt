Dated




              On    Saturday         15 A p r i l   1989,          I came       on    duty     at    Barnsley        Police      Station

              at    8.00     a.m.       and    travelled          to   West         Bar    Police     Station         Sheffield,

               parading        there      at    9.00      a.m.      that       day.




               My     initial      duties       were      an S e r i a l       16 u n d e r    the     supevision          ot

                                                    and      we    were    d e p l o y e d at        Midland       Street       Railway

               Station        to   supervise         the      arrival          of    fans     at     the    station       and    to   escort

                them    to    tneir       respective          buses       to    the       ground.




                These       duties       we    carried       out    until       about       2.30      p.m.    Most    supporters           we

                dealt       with    at    the    station          were    good        humoured        and    not    under       the

                influence          of    drink.        The    only       trouble           I encountered           were    supporters

                not    wearing          team    colours,          trying       to     get     into    the C i t y    Centre.




                Carrying         out     this    duty      I was       paired with

                and     1 wa s     issued       with    a Police           radio.
At     2.30     p.m.        our      serial           and     others         were       transported             to     the      ground          on

a Yorkshire             Traction              bus.          On    route         to     the    ground        from about               one       mil e

away     there         was     a     lot      of      activity          with         numerous        fans        heading           towards

th e    cjr o u n d    wh o    were         boisterous,                but      generally           good        humoured.




The     closer         we     got      to       the    Leppings            Lane        end    of    the     ground,            the    denser

the     amount         of     supporters               became          and      the     more       boisterous           they         became.

On     turning         right         to     go     past       th e     Leppings           Lane      entrance           to      the    gr o u n d ,

I could          see     thousands               of    supporters,                most       of w h i c h       were     in th e          area

between          A and        C and         onto       th e      road.          These        supporters           were         chanting,

jumping          up a n d       down        and       being       generally              rowdy.        The       time       would         be

about       2.50        p.m.           I could         hardly          see      any     Police       Officers           around            the

area      of     m e     entrance               probably          due      to     the     numbers          of    fans       outside            the

ground.           I remember                                                                                    js a y i n g    to me,

" T h e y * 11    not       get        that      lot     in U,



We     then      went        round         to    the     ground         and        into      the     gymnasium           to     await

further          instructions.                     Almost         immediately                we     were    deployed               onto    the

 track        in f r o n t        of      tne    West       Stand.




 Wa     went     onto         th e     track       and       walked          up      in f r o n t    of    the N o r t h           West    area

 of     the    West      Stand..                                                             deployed           us a l o n g        the    front

 of     the    West         Stand.          The       time       would        be      exactly 3.00              p.m.     as        I remember

 the     game         ki cki ng        off.



 1 walked             along        th e     front       of       the    stand,          I could       see       the     central

 section         was        full,         but      1 could           see     that       there       was    a    lot     of     room        in    the

 North Section                 and        the      South Section,                    especially           towards           th e     front.

As     I walked           past      the       Central             North       Section            and Central             South       Sections

I could            58S    a great         swell           of       people,          many     at       the    front       were        screaming

out         about     being        squashed,              but        I initially                put    this      down      to    the    fans

behind            them    surging         forward               and       chanting          as    the       game    had     just

started.             As     I reached               the      end      of     the     Central           South       Section,           I turned

to     face        the    crowd         and         stopped.               It w a s        then       I could       se e    many

children            and     females           being           crushed           against          the wall          and     crash

bprrierrs.                At     the      front          en d      a number           of    people          were    screaming            and

shouting            for     us     to     get       them        out.         One      man       shouted       from       about        the

      idle        that    there         was        a man        at    hi s      feet       who    was       dead.
IT! 1 U i




     t this         point       I realised               that        this       was       not     just      the    normal        sort         of
A
 crowd            surge    and      that          nobody          could      move         in t h i s     section          of    the     crowd.




 I shouted               over      to    the       officer           at    Gate       3    to     open      the     gates       in     order

 lo         5ut    >r, l e a s t    some          of     the       fans     ou t     and     to       escort       them     back       i nt

 area         ai    gates        1 and        2     in    the       Southern          Section.              At     this     t i me     the

  seriousness              of      the    situation                 was      no t    cl e a r .




  0n        the    gates       opening             it w a s        a mad        dash and a number                   fell        forward        ana

  were        having        to     be     pulled             out     by    officers.




     Initially            I was         escorting             fans        who      could walk            away      from        the    gate         and

     sitting         fans       down      against              the     crash         barrier          who    were        obviously

     injured.             A number            of       the     fans       who      were     coming          ou t w h o     w e r e n â€™t b a d l y

     injured         were       almost            hysterical              and       were     being       abusive          towards           myself


     and      other       officers.



     At      this     point        I could             see      that       the      incident was              far m o r e       serious            than

     I first          thought           and       with       an      Inspector             I went       onto       the     Ditch       in     order
to     stop         th e   game       and     to       stop    tans     from        running             onto    the    pitch.




A    number          of    fans       did     ru n      onto     the     pitch and              with       other      officers         I

formed          a    line       across        the       IS y a r d     l ine.       Tne        f a ns    were    angry       and    aiming

their       aggression                first        at    Police,         t h e n at        rival         Nottingham          fans       in

th e      Kop       end    of    th e       ground       and     also        at    c a m e r a me n who         were       photographinc

th e      incident.              I assisted              to     pull     a      number         of    cameramen         away       from       the

area       and       away       from        the    Liverpool           f a n s.



A     -short        time     later          many       more     officers           came        and      I assisted          in    forming

a     cordon          across         t he    halfway          line     being            positioned            toward       the    players

t u n n s 1.



Many       of        the    Liverpool             fans     who      came        onto      the        pitch were        crying          or

hysterical.                  A       number       of     them     also       showed        all       the      symptoms       of     being

drunk,          their           eyes    were       glased,          their         r;v.-a*:h wa s         slur.red,         they    were

unsteady              on    their       feet       and        their     breath           smelt        strongly        of    intoxicants.




    The   overwhelming                  opinion          I got       from         the    supporters             I spoke      to was          tha-

    the   F.A.        was       to    blame        For    them       not     being        given         the    other       en d   of     the

    ground.



    â– -or o v e r       ha l f    an     h o ur,        fans     roamed around                  the      pitch,     some     obviously

    looking          for    trouble           as       they     roamed        about        in g r o u p s ,      running          from       one

    section           of   the       ptich        to    the     ether.




    As    the       fans    started           to       disperse,         I attempted                 to f i n d m y     serial         as     I

    had    become           detached          when       I was        instructed               to    stand       in   the    cordon.              I

     eventually             joined          up w i t h     Serial          14     under        the      supervision          of \                 \

            towards       Penistone          Road.        rlost of' t h e        supporters were                  quiet       and

            subdued       as   they     walked         away     t rotri the      ground.




             I eventually          re-joined           Serial        16 o u t s i d e    the     main       entrance          to    the

            ground     on P s n i s t o n e       Road    at    about       6.00       p.m.      From       there        we      returned

             to   Barnsley        where      we    were       stood       d o w n at    6.30      p.m.




            My    radio     had    been      taken       f r o m me       shortly        after       the g a m e       had s t a r t e d   by

            Superintendent            Murray.




             I must    comment         that       at    the    time       of   the      incident          I heard       no

             instructions          over      the       radio    due       to   th e     noise     from the            cro w d.      The

             radio    had      been    working         well     up    to    then and          r a di o    messages

      *      were    received         very    clearly          up    to    going      onto     the       tr a c k .

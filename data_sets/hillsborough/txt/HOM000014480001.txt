Property crime had fallen significantly in 1988 but there was
still a worrying problem of an increase in violent crime.       The
Government's twin track approach on sentencing seemed to be
having some effect: there was perhaps some ebbing of the demand
for heavier sentences all round, which opened the way to the
development of non-custodial alternatives.       Progress had been
made in encouraging the theme of individual responsibility and
the role of the active citizen.       It was right that Ministers and
senior officials should now take stock of the position reached.
In particular, they needed to decide whether there were any fresh
ideas about crime prevention which might sensibly be launched, or
whether the priority should be to carry through and to present
better the measures which were already in hand.

3. Mr Faulkner said that the schedule to his submission showed
that a great deal of action was already in hand.  But there was
evidence that much of this was not well known and that the
Government's overall strategy was not as clearly understood as
was desirable.  There was also a need to keep up the enthusiasm
for the projects which had been started.  All these factors
suggested that the priority should be to concentrate on measures
already underway, looking to improve their delivery and
effectiveness, and to make known more widely what was being done.
Mr Lidington agreed that this was one important strand.  There
was a need to devise a multi-faceted presentational strategy. On
the policy front he detected three priorities:

             FAXIMILE TRANSMISSION


             Dear Mr Astling
             HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY
             Thank you for your letter of 6 June enquiring whether the Chief Constable of
             South Yorkshire had invited the Chief Constable of West Midlands to provide
             mutual aid under Section 14 of the Police Act 1964 or indeed any other
             provision.
             The stance of the Police Authority is that the West Midlands Inquiry is now
             reporting exclusively to Lord Justice Taylor. While the first Initiative to
             call in an outside force to enquire into the events at Hillsborough was made by
             the South Yorkshire Chief Constable, the circumstances surrounding this action
             could not in any case fall under either Section 14 of the Police Act 1964 (a
             point which Mr Addison appears to acknowledge) or any other section of this or
             any other Act.

             Furthermore, the subsequent action by the Home Secretary in establishing the
             Taylor inquiry, the considerably wider remit of this inquiry than what would
             have been originally entailed and the lines of reporting observed by the Chief
             Constable of the West Midlands have taken the inquiry completely out of the
             hands of the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire and the Police Authority.
             I sent you earlier a copy of my note of an officer level meeting held at the
             Home Office on 18 May and now attach a further copy which may be of assistance.
             Yours sincerely

            FAXIMILE TRANSMISSION


            Dear Mr Astling
  ^         HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY
            Thank you for your letter of 6 June enquiring whether the Chief Constable of
            South Yorkshire had invited the Chief Constable of West Midlands to provide
            mutual aid under Section 14 of the Police Act 1964 or indeed any other
            provision.
            The stance of the Police Authority is that the West Midlands inquiry is now
            reporting exclusively to Lord Justice Taylor. While the first Initiative to
            call in an outside force to enquire into the events at Hillsborough was made by
            the South Yorkshire Chief Constable, the circumstances surrounding this action
            could not in any case fall under either Section 14 of the Police Act 1964 (a
            point which Mr Addison appears to acknowledge) or any other section of this or
            any other Act.

            Furthermore, the subsequent action by the Home Secretary in establishing the
            Taylor inquiry, the considerably wider remit of this inquiry than what would
            have been originally entailed and the lines of reporting observed by the Chief
            Constable of the West Midlands have taken the inquiry completely out of the
            hands of the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire and the Police Authority.
            I sent you earlier a copy of my note of an officer level meeting held at the
            Home Office on 18 May and now attach a further copy which may be of assistance.
            Yours sincerely

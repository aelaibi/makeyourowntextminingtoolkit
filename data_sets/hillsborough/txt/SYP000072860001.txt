minutes          only.           We       didn't       experience                 any      delays        on the w a y         to

Sheffield,                arriving          between          10.45          (1045)           and      11.00 am        (1100)        in

Sheffield             it sel f.            We    parked          by a       pub       called          the P h e a s a n t     on a si de

road,       off L e p p i n s             LN.        As we       came       out       of     this      road a n d         looked        down      the

hill,       we       could       see       some      Police           in the          road,        but      I didn't        see     any

barriers             or a n y        c o nes     in the          road       channelling                the     crowds       as     such.          We

didn't          receive          any       physical          Police             direction             from     t he P o l i c e ,       there

were       plenty about,                   standing          in twos              and      threes        and      on m a j o r     traffic

poi n t s ,      but       not       doing       anything             with        the      fans.            There     was     no    hassle          in

the    crowd          on the          way       to    the    ground,              everyone            was    in a g o o d m o o d a n d

looking          forward             to    the       match.            I mean         on     d ay s     like      t his    y o u ’ re

chatting             to    people          you've          never          met     before.             I didn't        see     any       one

drinking             in the          crowd,          it was          very well-behaved.                        We w a n t e d      to       take a

look       at    the       ground          and       our    entry          p o int      to    save       time      later.          This       was

about       11.30 am             (1130)          and       there were              about         fifty       to    one     hundred           people

standing             round.           Plenty          people           buying         programmes             and     probably           taking

in the          atmosphere.                 I bought             a     programme             then.          There     were       s m a ll

groups          of P o l i c e        there          but    they were              probably            j ust      keeping        their        eye

on    things.              We    came       down       form          the R a i l w a y        bridge         end,     towards           a

We    asked a             taxi-driver                for a       pub,       and       he     pointed         to    thsyjy^ehive, j^ h i c h

I looked across                     into       the    n ex t     Pen and            said       t o t h a t                 the      fans       in

happening             and      I had       to       get       out.      About           four    minutes             of    play      had       g on e

a    crash       barrier            had    gone,          I    d i d n ’t h e a r        any    metal          breaking,            but w h e n

they      flopped             forward and             never          came      back       I knew          something             ha d

was     unaware            of a n y o n e       being          killed         or    injured.              I had          become        separated

I stood          on      the     railings            and       reached         up       for    him.         He      came       over      head

           everything           was     so      quiet.        After         about       twenty minutes,                  St ev e n and Ray

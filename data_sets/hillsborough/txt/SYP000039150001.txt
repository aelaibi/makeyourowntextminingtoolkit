                a c o n f u s i o n of heads            arms and          legs.      I sa w one m a n who was               obviously

             seemed to be           communication         problems.           It s e e m e d that m a n y          d i d n ’t know

POLICE CONSTABLE 115



HACKENTHORPE POLICE STATION



At    8.30    am on       the    date    shown,   I commenced duty at Hackenthorpe                 Police

Station.       We were then taken to Hillsborough by bus arriving at the ground

at    approximately        9 .00 am.        I was    detailed     to work      in   Serial   16 under

Inspector Purdy and Police Sergeant 1288 Payne.                          At 9*55 am the briefing

was given in the North Stand.

Our    serial was         to be deployed directly            outside     the 7 turnstiles A-G at

entrance B at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

At    11.15 am,       we made       our way around       to the rear of the West Stand                  in

preparation for the turnstiles being opened about 11.45 am.

At    11.45    am,    I    commenced       duty directly       outside    turnstiles    A    and    B   in

company with Police Constable 607 Taylor.                       In the early stages there were

just small numbers of fans entering in l's and 2's.                         I turned various fans

away, who had either no tickets or tickets                       for the Kop.         All    fans were

being searched at this time, the mood was friendly and jovial.

From approximately 2.00 pm onwards, the number of fans entering the ground

at    this    end     steadily       increased.       During    this     build   up   the    number     of

officers       in    our        serial   were     steadily   depleted     by     officers    escorting

prisoners through to the Detention Area, so much so that from about 2.30 pm

onwards it seemed that there was only myself and Police Constable Wright

left directly outside the turnstiles.
                                           -   2   -




After   2.30      pm,   the   crowd outside        the    turnstiles     appeared     to    swell

enormously within a few minutes and from the queues being orderly and well

defined, it suddenly became one large mass pushing towards the turnstiles.

I found myself being          pushed into the wall at the side of the                 turnstile

entrance.      A Police horse came up to the entrance in an effort to regulate

the crowd but this had very little effect as the pressure from the back of

the crowd grew.         Eventually myself and Police Constable 2980 forced our way

into the turnstiles and into the ground.                   We went w o u n d the back out of

the large Exit Gate C and continued to try and control the crowd, which

seemed to be trapped into the area between Exit Gate B and a single blue

barrier which runs away from the turnstiles.

From my position at the side of this barrier I could see that the crowd

pressure was becoming severe.         People near the barrier were red in the face

and straining to push back.         Some fans were panicking. Many were shouting

and pleading at us to         do something.    There were punches           thrown assome fans

came w o u n d the barrier and tried to join the crush n e w e r the turnstiles.

A small boy was passed over the head of the crowd to us.                    1 pushed a small

space to allow a young lad to escape the crush, but he wouldn't come under

the barrier shouting at me that he wanted to see the match.

Behind me there were a large number of fans standing away from the main

crush just outside Exit Gate C.           Many fans were shouting and pleading for

the gates to be opened to ease            the crush.            I could see that there were

numerous fans climbing on top of the outer wall and entering the ground.

There was some talk amongst the Police Officers present and Inspector Purdy

informed    the    officers    directly   outside        Gate   C that   it was     going   to be

opened.     The Gate was opened a short                time afterwards from inside and a




                                                                                                    7
                                              -   3   -




large number       of fansrushed inside, someone              stumbled as they went through.

The gate        was then closed again.       It had been opened for approximately 30-60

seconds.         It had the effect of clewing the area directly outside the Gate

but did nothing to ease the general crush at the turnstiles.                         The situation

continued to deteriorate,          people were in distress, many fans continued to

shout for the gate to be reopened.                That they all had tickets.                It seemed

that    it      was only a matter of       time   before       someone      was   injured,       if not

already.        Many fans were helpless in the crush and could hardly move as the

pressure from the fans behind forced                  themtowards the turnstiles.             I could

see 3 or 4 Police horses up near the                  large iron gates bordering on Leppings

Lane,     the    crush of    the   fans   seemed to stretch well             into Leppings Lane

itself.         Most of the Police Officers I could see were between the blue

barrier and the temporary barrier guarding the sterile area at the rear of

the South Stand.

With the situation getting worse the                  Exit Gate C was opened again from the

inside.      This time there was a muchlarger influx offans into the ground.

The majority of them weren't running but all were anxious                            to escape the

crush and get into the ground.              I positioned myself directly outside Gate C

in the flow of fans who had to pass either side of me.                        They were told not

to rush, to take their time.              Hundreds of fans must have passed me.                  Only a

few running,        the others     were orderly.           The influx died down to a small

trickle after a few minutes and the Gate was narrowed to allow one fan at a

time,     and    this time   each showing their tickets to a steward.                        The area

outside the turnstiles was now clear.                     I regrouped with officers from my

serial.          Almost   immediately      someone        reported   that    there    was    a    pitch

 invasion.        In company with other officers, I went in through Gate C past




                                                                                                     8

the tunnel to the Centre section of the terracing into the South Stand and

onto the pitch.           There were many people walking and standing on the pitch.

There was a lot of confusion as to what was happening.                                    I could see that

there were      numerous Police Officers                   near    the perimeter fence behind the

Leppings Lane end goal.             I couldn't see the crowd beyond.                       Next the Police

Officers began to pass             injured people              from an open gate           in the fencing.

Along with others           I took them from these officers                       and placed them in a

safer    position        further   on     the   pitch.          Many    seemed short        of breath and

distressed but each person I helped was alive and conscious.                                  I helped one

youth    who    said     to me     that    people      were       dying      in   there    pointing at the

terrace.       At this time, due to the number of people on or around the fence,

I still couldn't            see through to the terracing.                     I moved closer and I saw

that there was a            mass    crush of bodies just inside                    the    fence.   It was a

confusion of heads, arms and legs.                         I saw one man who was obviously dead

but he was held upright by the crush and his body moved with the crowd.                                  By

this time I was directly outside the small open gate.

Officers inside the terracing were passing the injured onto the pitch and

giving     first    aid,     if necessary.             I worked myway             across    to between the

ambulance which had pulled onto the track and the perimeter fence which had

been     forced apart.           I continued          to assist        in carrying injured onto the

pitch.

After a short time, I climbed into the terracing through the hole in the

 fence    and   assisted      in    carrying     people           to   the    fence.       I assisted with

 approximately 10 people, all of whom were already dead.

 Eventually,       the      Centre section of the terrace cleared.I remember that

 soon after this           an announcement was broadcast that the match would not be




                                                                                                              9

continued.       Whilst   I was in the terracing and on the pitch helping the

injured,      many   Liverpool   fans   were   directing   their anger at the Police.

Calling us murderers and that it was our fault.             Others thanked me.

After   the    terracing had cleared,       I joined other officers on the halfway

line.   Eventually we made our way back to the North Stand via the Leppings

Lane terracing.

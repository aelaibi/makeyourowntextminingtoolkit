MD   OF   REPORT
Memorandum to DCC, Mr. Hayes                 26 June 1989


HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - MEETING WITH COUNSEL AND MISS NORCLIFFE
OF THE HAMMOND SUDDARDS SOLICITORS - 1.15 pm MONDAY 26 JUNE 1989

1.      THE CHIEF CONSTABLE'S RECOMMENDATIONS

         The question of recommendations being put, on behalf of Mr.
         Wright, to the Inquiry was discussed. Mr. Woodward recalled an
         earlier conversation with the Chief Constable when this matter was
         considered. Counsel now advise that any submission on behalf of
         the South Yorkshire Police along these lines should wait the
         interim report of the Taylor Inquiry and that, after ths
         publication of the report, there may be little benefit in
         submitting any written recommendations.

2.      FINAL SUBMISSION, ON BEHALF OF THE    SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE, TO THE
         INQUIRY

         Oral evidence will be concluded this week. Counsel for the
         various parties to the Inquiry are then invited to submit, on
         behalf of their clients, a written summary. Peter Metcalfe, on
         behalf of Hammond Suddards, has submitted a list of points that
         Mr. Woodward may wish to consider. We have submitted to Mr.
         Woodward our schedule of 'Inquiry Comments' together with the
         'South Yorkshire Police View’ of such commentary.  Counsel claim
         that these documents will be of interest whilst giving no
         indication of any intention to utilise them in his final
         submission.

        Chief Inspector Bettison has a made request of Counsel that we
        have sight of his written submission before it is lodged with the
        Inquiry. Whilst not displaying reluctance there was a sense of
        hesitation in that Mr. Woodward claimed the time scale may not
        permit. Miss Norcliffe feels that such a request is a valid one
        and she recommends that we diplomatically pursue such a request at
        Chief Officer level.  She confirms that Counsel would normally be
        expected to draw up his own submission but the Inquiry is not a
        normal situation and she is aware that we, as a dedicated enquiry
        team, have a knowledge of events and arguments that might be
        useful in any final submission to the Inquiry.
                 ,*
3.      BARRIER THEORY

        Inspector Spencer has been pursuing a theory arising out of
        extended viewing of the video recording of the Hillsborough
        disaster. The theory postulates the view that the failed barrier
        has collapsed at a time before the police were obliged to open the
        gates at Leppings Lane turnstile. Mr. Woodward is planning to
         attend Snig Hill on the afternoon of Tuesday 27th June to view the
         video.  In the meantime a request has been made through the West
         Midlands enquiry team to investigate this theory and provide Lord
         Justice Taylor with their opinion.

4.      CONSPIRACY THEORY

         The 'Conspiracy Theory' report -complied by Detective Inspector
         King was submitted to the Inquiry on Thursday last. The paper was
         well received and, in particular, Lord Justice Taylor requested
         that any further information that may come to light after the
         cessation of oral evidence should nevertheless be submitted to
         him.

5.      CRIMINAL LITIGATION

         At a very early stage of the Inquiry the question of Criminal
         Litigation, against individual officers or the South Yorkshire
         Police organisation, was raised with Counsel. They, in turn,
         raised the matter with Lord Justice Taylor through Treasury
         Solicitor Mr. Collins Q C . His Lordship's response at that time
         was that such a question appeared to him 'unrealistic'. The
         interpretation being that officers and the Force were not in
         jeopardy as a result of giving evidence before the Inquiry.

         In the light of recent news that members of the crew of the
         'Herald of Free Enterprise' are now being indicted for
         manslaughter, the point was again raised with Mr. Woodward.   Mr.
         Woodward's opinion is that the situation remains unchanged.

6.      TIME SCALE

         The undue haste which seems to have been prevelent throughout the
         Inquiry continues. Latest feedback suggests that Treasury
         Solicitors are hopeful of concluding oral evidence by Wednesday of
         this week. This seems, at this stage, overly optimistic but we
         have, in the past, been proved to be wrong when the Inquiry is
         determindly pursuing a deadline.  For our part, the enquiry team
         will be disbanded,as discussed, at the end of the week unless
         there are any developments which dictate otherwise.

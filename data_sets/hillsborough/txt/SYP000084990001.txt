As    the     time        got       closer            to    the        start          of       the       football           match       there          were       a

considerable                 number             of    supporters                 very          much       under        the       influence             of

alcohol          and     were          carrying             large           quantities                   of    beer,        lager,          cider       etc?


as    they       made        thsir          way       to    the        ground.




All     supporters                that          I    found       in       possession                 of       alcohol        I    either

bottles          and      cans         were          poured          down        a    drain.             ' During          this       time    I    was


approached              by    a     person            claiming              to       be    a    Nottingham                 Forest       supporter


who     did      not     have          a    ticket.              He       enquired              of       me    where        he    might       find          a


ticket        tout.           1     was         unable          to    assist              him,       he       merely        stated          that       he

would       do     as    he       had       the       previous              year          and       bribe        a    turnstile             attendant


to    allow        him       to     climb            over       the       turnstile.




At    3pm     (1500)          our          serial          was       to     stand          down          from        our    position          and       go       to


take     refreshment.                       By       this       time        there          was       a    considerable                 quantity             of


empty       beer        cans       at       our       feet       which           were          disposed              of.     I    then       joined             the

It    was     roughly             3 . 0 5 pm         (1505)          a nd    we      were           directed           into       the       ground          in


the     belief          that       a       public          order          situation                 was       taking        place.           As    I


entered          the     ground             I       saw    thaft      the        football                match        was    not       taking          place

and     there         seemed           to       be    n o / m o r e ^.than            a    bit       of       activity           at    the    Lepping

Lane     end       of    the       ground




Upon     arrival             at     that            end    of    the        ground             an    Inspector              told       us    to    form          a.


cordon        approximately                         five    yards           from          the       perimeter              fence.           There       were

a    small       number           of       supporters                on     the       pitch          and       some        officers          were

assisting             supporters                    over    the       fence.               Also          there        were       supporters             b e in*:


lifted        by      people           on       the       balcony           into          that       area.

                   several        bodies          which       appeared         to    me     to    be   deceased.




                   I refer        first          to   the     body    on     the     floor        of   the    ’e n c l o s u r e ' .     This

                   person        was       lying      on     the    floor      of    Pen     4    lying      close     to    and       parallel          to

                   the     perimeter             wall.        The    body      was    face        up   and   was     to     the    right

                   hand     side       of       the   pen,     as    you     face     it     from      the    pitch,        ie    near       to    Pen    6.

                   I     cannot       be    certain          but    in m y     opinion           the   man   wafs d e a d .

those       that        died       in    the       Hillsborough                disaster,           but        am       unable          to

identify           the       person          to    whom       I refer.




In m y      original           statement                I    refer       to    entering          the      enclosure                and       pulling

a    body     to    the       wall       where          I handed          it       to    other     Officers.                    The     body          was

passed        through          a    gap       in    the       fencing.              The    fencing            was       rolled          upwards

and    tied        up    with       orange          rope.              I am    happy       that      this             was   Pen        4.




I have        no    recollection                   of       this^sody          and       can gi ve       no       descriptions!                   again

I have        viewed          photographs                   and    also       video       without         being able                   to

identify           the       body.           In    fact       thinking          about       it,      I    cannot            be     certain

that     the       body       was       passed          out       of    the    Pen       through         the          fence       or    through

the    gate.




I    refer       in m y       original             statement             to    then       moving         two          further          bodies.

In    fact       I think           now       I moved          only       one    further          body,            that      of     a    child.

This     child          was    aged          about          12-15      years        of    slight         build          and      male.            I

cannot        recall          any       clothing            or     hairstyle.




I am     of      the     opinion             that       this       child       was       dead,     but        I       cannot       be       certain.

I handed           the       child       to       other,         unknown,           Police       Officers               either          at    the

gate     or      the     open       fencing.                 I am       fairly          certain      it       was       through             the

fencing,           as    I    recall          having          to       raise       the    body     over           a    wall.           I do       n ot

recall        any       steps.




Having        then       left       the       enclosure,                I went          onto the     pitch.                 I     recall

assisting           fans       and       Police             Officers          to    carry a       body        off           the    pitch and

place       it     underneath                the    stand          outside          the    gym.




The    body        was       that       of    a    well       built       male,          I do    not      recall            any        clothing.

                                                                                                                                       S2925A

                 I think       the   body    was     laid         face    down,      on    an       advertising          hoarding.




                 I have       examined       video      footage          a n d /ft   ( R e f M A P 7? (E x h                    ) Tape

                 I can    identify       a   Police          Officer,        balding,           with       a    full    beard.        I am

                 almost       sure   that     it    was      this    Officer         who    assisted             to    carry    the    body    to
w
                 which    I have      just       made     reference.            I am       sure       that       this    man    was    dead.

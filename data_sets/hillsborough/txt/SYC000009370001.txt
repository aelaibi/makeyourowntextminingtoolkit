         Dear Mr. Frazer,

         Re William Roy Pemberton - Hillsborough

         Thank you for your letter of the 25th of October.  I am very sorry that I
         have not replied to this before.  I really do not think that I can take this
         matter any further at this stage and I suggest that you address the matter
         directly to the West Midlands Police.

         You will I am sure be aware that the video footage, although in the
         possession of the West Midlands Police may well not belong to them, and it
         may not be quite as simple as all that to release it. However, I think this
         is really a matter for you to take up directly with them.  Similar
         considerations apply of course to the photographs.

         Yours sincerely,




         S.L.Popper,

Dear Dr Popper

RE: WILLIAM ROY PEMBERTON                                     -          (HILLSBOROUGH)

Now that the D.    P.    P.    has announced his decision not to institute
criminal proceedings following the Hillsborough Disaster Mr & Mrs Pemberton
have asked me to repeat their request that they should be allowed to have
copies of certain photographs which are in the possession of West Midlands
Police.

For the avoidance of doubt they would like copies of                                                                                                              photographs DB16/30,
PR6/2A and AH/11.     They are of course prepared                                                                                                                 to pay for the copy
photographs should you wish them to do so.

Mr & Mrs Pemberton have also indicated a wish to have access to all the
video footage which is in the possession of West Midlands Police and they
understand that this desire is shared by a large number of families.

If you would be prepared to authorise the release to us of one master copy
of thevideo footage we would make arrangements for those families who wish
to see     itto viewit under our control. If you would rather this request
came from the Steering Committee please let me know and I will arrange for a
separate letter to be issued.

If a mastercopy is to be made available perhaps you would give us some idea
of the cost involved before forwarding it and we will discuss with Mr
Pemberton and his colleagues how that cost should be met.

If you feel that the request for copies of photographs and the video footage
should be more properly addressed to West Midlands Police then please let me
know and I will be happy to make the approach that way.

Yours^ iry^r^l y

        Dear Sirs,

        Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


        If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
        of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
        on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
        due course.

        I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
        evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
        coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
        inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

        Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
        under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
        witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
        this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

        Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
        to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
        appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
        consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

        May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
        attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

        I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
        names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
        to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for m e .

        I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
        heard from you by the end of SeptenjijeT I will assume you have no names to
        submit.

        Yours faithfully,                ^ —

Post Mortem
1.   The Deceased’s height is recorded at 5'8". Mr Pemberton is adoment
     'that his son measured almost exactly S'. Is it possible to explain
     this substantial discrepency?________________________________________




Summary
1.   The phrase "none detected" in relation to alcohol causes some concern.
     Other reports are marked "negative" it is the word "detected'' which
     causes concern ....... there is a suggestion that alcohol was being
     actively sought after.  Can the word "negative" be substituted.

2.    Can the family please have copies of photographs D B 16/30: PR6/2A and
     AH/11.

3.   In interview with a polics officer at Allerton Police Station, Liverpool
     Mr Pemberton was shown a photograph in which he believes his son can
     be seen lying on the pitch near the rear right hand corner of the
     goal when viewed from the pitch.  His son was wearing a white jacket
     and jeans.  A label could be seen on the jeans.  The offier offered
     to have the label enlarged to see if it could be positively
     identified as being the label on Mr Pemberton.  That enlargement has
     never been provided.  Can the officer and photographs be traced and an
     enlargement provided.

    Dear Dr Popper,

    RE:   William Roy Pemberton

    I have seen Mr and Mrs Pemberton and been through the Summary with them.

    They have a number of questions, a copy of my questionnaire is attached
    with the questions and requests set out.

    Mr and Mrs Pemberton will attend to hear the Summary presented.

    I trust the information and photgraphs they are asking for can be
    provided without too much difficulty.

    Yours ^.nce^e^y

As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990*

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not- to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,



S.L.Popper,
H.M. Coroner.

         Dear Sirs,

         You will "be aware that I do not normally release post mortem
         reports until the resumption of- the Inquest, when they are
         in fact put in as evidence.

         However, in view-of the numerous requests which I have received,
         and the obvious distress which delay is causing to your clients,
         I have decided that subject to certain conditions set out below,
         I am prepared to release to you upon request, the post mortem .
                 >f your cli 2nt(s).

         The release of these post mortem reports are cn the basis that:-

                   a.    They have to be treated as provisional, and therefore
                         subject to amendment or alteration until such time as
                         they are given or produced in evidence at the Inquest.

                   b.    They are to be used only for the purpose of bereavement
                         consalling of the deceased*.s relatives or for proper
                         legitimate purposes in connection with any legal proceedings
                         in which solicitors may be engaged.

                ■c.      Subject to tha~afe§ve} they are to be kept confidential until
                         they come into the public domain at the resumed Inquests.

         I have your request for the post mortem report to hand in respect .
         of each of the persons listed on the attached sheet, and on the
         assumption that you will confirm that the .report in respect of
         each of your respective clients is accepted on the terms set out   .
         above, and in order to save further delay and upset to your client,
         I enclose a copy of the relevant post mortem report.   If for any
         reason you cannot agree to the contents of this letter, please return
         the post mortem report to me, without of course making any use of it.

         The cost for the copy post mortem report(s) is        per sheet (total £ 1                          C   )
         Please make your cheques payable to the City of Sheffield.

         Yours faithfully,

4th July 1989

Dear Mr Popper

I write following my very helpful conversation this afternoon with Mr Thompson
from your office to confirm a number of points.

Firstly, I understand that you are favourably inclined towards the requests
that you have recieved from a number of Solicitors to release copies of
the Post-Mortem Reports on the victims of the Hillsborough Disaster in advance
of resumed Inquest Hearings and in this regard might I ask you to let me
have copies of the Reports on the deceased named in the attached list the
families of whom I respresent.

There is a strong feeling from many of the families that early receipt of copies
of the P.M. Reports would be beneficial both in terms of answering some
hiterto unanswered questions and also in perhaps reducing the anguish which
might be suffered when full details of the cause of death become known at a
public hearing perhaps some weeks or months hence.

If payment is required for copies of any of the Reports then needless to say
I will be happy to deal with this.

I understand that the relative positions of approximately 50 of those who
suffered fatal injuries has been established at or immediately prior to the
estimated time of death, this information is being generally discussed and
although I am not asking you at this stage to release the names of the 50
involved I would be very greatful if you would confirm that this information
is correct, perhaps the number has increased from 50? Would it be your intention
to release this information prior to reopening of the inquests?

Finally, I confirm that I will speak to my fellow committee members tomorrow
(Wednesday) about the issue of 'block representation' of the bereaved families at the

Dear Mr. T. King.,

Please   find  enclosed  copies of  statements with details
(hi-lighted) underlined which in our opinion needs further
investigation and answers given to the questions which we are
herewith submitting.

(1)    West Midland   Police   report   into   the   death        of   Roy
        Pemberton.
                 (

        His Life was pronounced extinct at 1600 hours in the
        temporary mortuary   by DR. CURPEN (Appendix a Page 1)
        as we have no medical evidence to the contrary we can
        only assume Roy was alive untill 1600 hours.

(2)    We wish    to ask the Coroner why when our son was a
        diabetic and he had two cards leaving his name and
        address etc., on his person# and was still wearing all
        his clothes, and yet we still had to look at all the
        photographs of the deceased and there by being kept in
        a state of intense distress until midnight. (Appendix
        B Page 9)
(3)    We refer to the Statement of Philip Martin Saxton* St.
        Johns Ambulance Service (Appendix c) All this statement
        is very revealing.     Some deaths must have occurred
        later   than  IS-15  hours  especially   th e ’ paragraph
        refering to the resuscitation of a young man at 15-50
        hours (Page 16)
(4)    Now to    statement (Appendix D) of Andrew J Byrne
        Consultant Anaesthetist, when he states quote "I was
        approached by a Senior Police Officer and asked to
        start certifying the dead people as there may be some
        still alive and aiso to clear space (Page 3)

(5)    We move    on to statement    (Appendix E) of Leading
        fire-man Housley of Central Pire Centre.    Ouote "Upon
        attendance at approximately 15-22 hours had difficulty
        in gaining access to the ground etc (Page One)
(6)    The last statement (appendix F) given by Dr. Naderasaen
        Carpoosary Curpen# who in his own personal observations
        (on pages 4 & 5) are that medical assistance should
        have   been    requested on the     loud   speaker system
        immediately   casualties were noticed#   up to the time I
        entered the   gymnasium/ no request had been made on the
        public speaker system.

        (7)           Our final point to the H.M. Coroner is why all the very
                      seriously injures! or dying# this also includes those
                      who appear dead did not got to hospital in the very
                      first available ambulance? and why the serious accident
                      response vehicle not called out to the stadium as we
                      are lead to believe ?

    Dear Dr Popper

                                     15.4.89 - Hillsborough Football Stadium. Sheffield

           Following our telephone conversation with regard to the death of this
    young man, I enclose a formal histology report on the pathology seen in his
    right lung at the time of the post-mortem examination.

                    You will see that the histology confirmed m y         initial   impression



           I am sorry that this investigation was left                       uncompleted    and    hope      it
    enables you to tidy up any loose ends in the enquiry.

                    With best wishes,
                    Yours sincerely,

I refer to your recent conversation with Superintendent
Sleath concerning the release of the deceased persons from
the Hillsborough incident to their respective next of kin,
following the adjournment of the inquest.

After consultation with Professor Usher, I have no objection
to this course of action.
 PTT.Tg NOTE BATED 5.3.90.


Dr. John Clark telephoned to say that he was willing to do a supplemental
report on Pemberton.    They had tried to measure the height from the
photographs and he thought it could well be 180 i.e., 6 foot.
He confirmed that he had not re-measured Mir. Pemberton but had
taken the figures from the records and on the leg.    He also
confirmed that the book also recorded him at 173*    He thought it
was probably a transcription error.
I said that on balance I thought it would be better if we dealt with
this viva voce at the Inquest.    I didn't really see any particular
diffiiculty with that matter.

Bear Sirs,

jtl J S m H U Q I PfiHBBRTOH.

Thank you for your letter of the 5th of April. I hare noted
the questions vhioh are raised and no doubt you will be
bringing then to ay attention at the Inquest.. They will be
dsalt with Insofar as it is possible to do so.

With regard to the photographs this is in fact a very
difficult problem, and I would not wish to mislead you
into thinking that these will in fact be available.

Whether it wiffeldbe possible to Bake arrangenents for a supply of
copies at soate .point in the future I think has to be deferred.
for the time being.


Tours faithfully,

Dear Dr Popper,

RE:   William Roy Pemberton

I have seen Mr and Mrs Pemberton and been through the Summary with them.

They have a number of questions, a copy of my questionnaire is attached
with the questions and requests set out.

Mr and Mrs Pemberton will attend to hear the Summary presented.

I trust the information and photgraphs they are asking for can be
provided without too much difficulty.

Yours ^.ncei^ely

Questions (please keep these
brief and confine them to
matters arising from the
Summary and Post Mortem
Report only)

Post Mortem
1.   The Deceased's height is recorded at 5'8". Mr Pemberton is adoment
     'that his son measured almost exactly 6'. Is it possible to explain
     this substantial discrepency?




Summary
1.   The phrase "none detected" in relation to alcohol causes some concern.
     Other reports are marked "negative" it is the word "detected" which
     causes concern ....... there is a suggestion that alcohol was being
     actively sought after. Can the word "negative" be substituted.

2.    Can the family please have copies of photographs DB16/30: PR6/2A and
     AH/11.

3.   In interview with a police officer at Allerton Police Station, Liverpool
     Mr Pemberton was shown a photograph in which he believes his son can
     be seen lying on the pitch near the rear right hand corner of the
     goal when viewed from the pitch. His son was wearing a white jacket
     and jeans.  A label could be seen on the jeans. The offier offered
     to have the label enlarged to see if it could be positively
     identified as being the label on Mr Pemberton.  That enlargement has
     never been provided.  Can the officer and photographs be traced and an
     enlargement provided.

If you have queries to raise please ensure that this form is returned to us
and copied to H.M. Coroner, Medico Legal Centre, Watery Street, Sheffield
as soon as possible and in any event no later than 10th April 1990.

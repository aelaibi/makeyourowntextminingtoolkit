intermittent,           but       of good qual i t y and easily understood,.

X saw four        people            trying     to get       out    of this    gate     onto        the    pitch.

Three men were at                   the    front.      One was almost           out    of the gate,              but      rn

right        leg was         bent    back    inside     the       centre   pen at an unnatural                   angle

and trapped           by the         people     behind him.          this ma n was       screaming.



A second man was                lying       half    out of the        pen on the        perimeter           track.

        Teams        4    & 5 were             INSIDE             the       ground,    controlling              turnstiles             which

        give    access              to    the       South          Stand       lower       deck.

        Teams        1 &       2    formed          the       half          serial    under        PS    COX,    T e a m s 3,         4 &    5    formed

        the    half        serial          under          myself.

        During           the       period       11.30am                to    1pm    (1130    -    1300     h r s ) , the         officers

        remained           on       their       points             but       were    almost       inactive           as    virtually             no

        people           entered          the       ground             during       this    period.

        At    approximately                    1pm       (1300hrs),                supporters       began        to       enter       the    ground

        in    increasing                 numbers.                 By    2pm    (1400hrs),          the     South          Stand       lower       deck

        was    about           half       full       when          both       Football       Teams        went       out    to    inspect             the

        pitch.            Together             with       PC 1926            McGuiness       &    PC495     Pursley,             I went          down       to

        the    pitch           level       of       the       South          Stand    to    prevent        any       supportersgetting

        onto     the       pitch          due       to    the          presence       of    the     players.

        There        were          no    public          order             problems    in    that        area.

        At    this        time,          I could          clearly             see    that    the        Spion    Kop       was    virtually

    the    South           Stand       lower          deck       nearest          to       the    West          Stand.           I s a w _________

     & a    male           officer             climbing          into      the        South       sTand             lower       deck.           I

    ran    to     them       &    they          told       me    that       they       had       seen          Liverpool             fans

    climbing           from       the          West       Stand       lower       deck       into          the       South       Stand          lower

    deck.         The       fans       had       gained          access          by    climbing                from    the       outer          pen

    nearest           to    the       South          Stand       across          the       fence       which          separates                the       two

    stands.

    I    looked        into       the          West       Stand       &    could       see       that          the    pen       on    the       lower

    deck     nearest             to    the       South          Stand       was       not    full.              There       were          a    large

                           people          inside          but    th                                   or       many       more.              This       part
                                                                                  I-t-7_     \

    I    immediately              deployed                team    3,       PC157       West       &    PC2417          R o t c h e 11          from          the

    turnstile              area       to       the    South       Stand          lower       deck          &    positioned                them          at    the

    fence        seperating                the       lower       decks       of       the    West          &    S                     ds       to       prevent

supporters                  climbing             the       fence.

  (1500hrs),           I saw          several          Liverpool                   supporters                   try       to    clirnb         over       the

 turnstile            box    which          seperates                the          rear          of    the       West       Stand          lower          deck

 from     the        rear    of       the    South             Stand          lower             deck,       i . e . .T u r n s t i l e s            21    & 22.

 I stopped            them       from       doing          this          by       climbing                the    steps          to       the    Police

 Control         box    &    shouting             to       them,             telling             them       they          would          be    ejected          if

 they     came        down       in    the       South          Stand.

 As     far     as    I could          see,       these             supporters                   made       no       effort          to       try    to

 enter        the     outer       pen       of    the          West          Stand          lower          deck          which       is       adjacent          to

 the     turnstile           box       that       they          were          trying             to       climb.           All       ran       off       to    the

 rear     of     the    West          Stand       w        h    e        n    i        .

 At     approximately                 2.50pm          (145i.1st              engaged                 in   the        above          action,

 I. c o u l d    hear       what       appeared                to    be       urgent             radio          t r a f f ic.            I attempted                to

 listen         clearly          to    this       but          was       jostled                by    three          Nottingham                supporters,

 who     clearly        found          the       sight          of       a    Policeman                   with       a    finger          in    ech       ear

 rather         amusing.              I was       unable             to       hear         any        further             radio          traffic          from

 this     point        until          approximately                      4.00pm             (1600hrs)                due       to    crowd          noise       &

 loosing         my    radio          earpiece             at       an       early          stage          in    the       events             that       follow.

 At     3.00pm        (ISOOhrs),             as       the       game          kicked             off,       I went             to    the       top       of    the

 gangway         of    the       South       Stand             lower          deck          nearest             to       the    West          Stand       to

 locate         the    officers             from       Team          3       for       their          phase          two       duties          (i.e.

 during         the    course          of    playing                time.              All       officers                had    been          deputed          to    a

\oangway         during          this       period)

 WhehvI         reached          the    top       of       this          gangway,                I saw          that       several             officers

 from     Serial        1 were          near          to       the       gate          lea'                     om       the    centre          pen       of    the

 It     appeared        that          the    gate          was       open          &       supporters                were       getting             out       onto

 the     pitch.         I    immediately                   ran       down          to       the       pitch          level          of    the       stand,

 butt    could        not    clearly             make          out       what          was       happening                          turned          to    go

I    rafl w i t h      these          officers           around          the      pitch        to     Gate          3Nof       the    West        Stand

On    arriving          there,             I saw        that       t h i s ^vfcen w a s        crammed              with       people,        many

of    whose       faces          were       being        crtihs^ed a g a i n s t              the     fence.              I    pushed        to    the

front       of    a    group          of    Constables              &    found         myslef         directly                outside        gate          3.

I there          saw    that          four       people        were          trying       to    get      out         of       this    gate        onto

the     pitch.          Three          men       were     at    the          front.           One     was       almost          clear        of    t he

gate,       but       his       leg    was       pinned            insidethe             pen    by p e o p l e         behind          him.            A

second          man    was       lying          half     in        &    half out         of    t h e gast e , h i s            chest        on     the

track       surrounding                the       pitch.B e h i n d            these            two w e r e \              woman       w hose       arms

were       at    her    sides.              She    was        clearly            havinggreat             trouble               breathing.                  A

third       man       was       next       to    her,     arms          outstretched                above           his       head.

All    of       these       people          were       pinned           down      by    an     enormous              weight          of     people

frota, b e h i n d .            Together          with        another            young       officer,               who       I believe           is
                       MrS'                                                              \
PC298Q          Wright          from       E2   Subdivision,                  I attempted               to      pull          these       people
                                                                                                                Co (g

Despite          our    best          efforts          for     more          than      five     minutes,              we       were       unable           to

move       the    people              atth e      front       at       all.

As    we    continued                 to t r y     to    pull p eo p l e           out,        I saw      the        woman        described

above       beginning                 to t u r n    grey       & then            blue.         I saw      that            there       was     no

movement          from          other       people        near          to    the      fence,         who       did       no    respond           to

our    shouting             &    encouragement                 to       try      to    move     back.

After       several             minutes         more      of    fruitlessly                   trying           to    move       the       people           at

I searched                for       other             members        of    Serial          S.        I found       PC3235               Roberts          &

of    the       casualties                   had       been        carried       away.

I then          met       Inspector                   Darling,          who     instructed             me    to    try         to       reform          the

After       remaining                   there          several          minutes,           we    were       i n s t r u c t e d to         go to

noted       that          the       time          was       4.13pm        < 1 6 1 5 h r s ).

Some       time       later             the       Officers           in    the       North       Stand       were          stood         down.           I

WhilstXl                personally          saw       many    officers          acting             selflessly             to    assist      the

ifigured,               Xfeel        that       the    contributions                of    two       Officers          stand       out.

Pol i c e ^ r g e a n t              1855       of    the    Nottingham             Constabluary             was          at    the

forefront                oN^ a t t e m p t s     to    remove       the       injured          at    Gate    3.           This    officer

was       alone          amongst          Officers          from    a    strange          force,       yet    remained                in

contrast            &    successfully                directed       the       people          around    him.
               n    :
Police             Constable             2980    Wright       was       present          at    Gate    3 when             I arrived

there.             His        efforts       in       attempting          to    pull       people       free       were          extreme      &

tireless.                 During          this       period    he       continued             to    present       a       calm    front       to

the       people          he       was    trying       to    assist,          trying          to    encourge          &    reassure

them.          When           it    became       apparant          that       our    efforts          there       were          proving

fruitless,                he       entered       the       centre       pen    at    my       instruction             without

hesitation,                   despite       being          faced    by    a    panicked             crowd    in a          small      area.

As       the   situation                 progressed,          PC2980          Wright          continued       to          try    to   assi't

the       injured             in a n y     way       possible.           When       the       situation       had          calmed

somewhat,                I again         saw     PC    Wright       calming         &     reassuring          his          fellow

officers                who    appeared          to    be    distressed.

I feel         that           the    efforts          of    Police       Cosntable             2980    Wright             are    worthy      of

the       highest             praise.

I submit                this       report       for    your    information.

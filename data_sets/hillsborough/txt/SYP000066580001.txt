              At about 2.45pm on S a t u rd a y                15th April       1989 I was t r avelling along

              Dykes Hall          Road?   S h e f f i el d    in the general             d irection of Worral         in my

              own motor         car.                                           /             n „ . —,
                                                                                D i c e s ucfizaAQ.
              As     I drove along         the    road       I went   pas#" the Beehive Public House which

              was      on my    right hand       side.         I saw/standi ng outside                the Public House a

              g roup of about          fifty or sixty F/ootball Supporters.                            I saw that many of

              the S u pporters were wearing                    /ed and white Liverpool                 regalia.       Most     of

              the Suppo rte rs we re drinking.

              I continued driving aloraj the                       road and as           I a p p ro a ch e d the j un ct io n of

              Dykes Hall          Road and Wads ley Lane.                 I saw the Horse and Jockey

              public      house which         is sit ua t ed on the           corner.             The Horse and Jockey          is

              about 250 yards             from the Beehive, I saw sitting                         outside   the   pub large

              groups of Liverpool                suppo rters who
                                                                                                               PAGE            2.
                                                                                                               S 1084

             were    drinking.        There were also          large    numbers      of Supp or te rs      sitting        on

             the grass verge           on the opposite         side    of the     road who/^ere also

             dr i nk i n g .

             I would estimate           the    number    of supporters         in Vne area outside            the

             Horse and Jockey to be about                 three   h u n d r e d ./ A lt ho ug h   I only had the

             suppo rt er s      in view for a few seconds              t p e y a p p e ar e d to be in good

             spirits and         I w it n es s ed    no disorder.

             I continued driving along Dykes Hall                      Road for about         half a mile.          As     I

             glanced to the sides              there were      still    small     groups    of supporters

             walking         down towards Hillsborough.

             I am a S he f fi e ld W e d n e s da y Suppo rt er s and          I have a tt en de d H i l l s b o r o u g h

             on numerous occassions.                  In my opinion      it w ould take about            half an

             hour    to walk      from the Horse and Jockey to H jA 1s b o r o u g h .

             1 thought         it was strange         to see   such    lanxe    numbers     of S up po rt er s a

             distance        from the ground so close to ki/k                  off time

                                                                                                              SIG N E D

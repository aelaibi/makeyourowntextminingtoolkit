                    I was      unable            to     get     one       from Anfield.

                    ticket.             He      said      he    would         try     to       get    one    for    me a n d      he    did m a n a g e      to.

                    The     ticket            was      for     the S p i o n K op              standing          area,    I was        happy       with    t hi s

then      walked          to    th e       ground.           There       were        many        other       f a ns    heading         for

the     g r o u n d at         this        time    and       the P o l i c e      that         we    passed were             giving

directions            to       some        fans    who       were     unsure         of w h e r e       to      go.      I do       remember

keeping         a watch          on        the    supporters             who    were          drinking          th ere.        The     pubs

I think         they were              a    little       worried about                   how many          people        had     started

              faint a nd         I remember             a    large        m an who            was       standing          just      in f r o n t     of me

              who    h e l p e d me.        He    tried         to m a k e r o o m        for       me,             I r e m e m b e r his    name        was

                           Another          man       just      in f r o n t       of me,           thenf a in te d and               I     p a s s e d out

              where     I stoo d.            I vaguely              remember          being             dragged        out     through        the

              tunnel       to    safety.

              I came       to a g a i n s t       a wall        just        at    the         b ack      of    the     West      Stand,

              was    w i t h me.

              T he   scene       around          me    was     total        chaos.            People          were     walking           round

              screaming          that       they       had     lost       relatives                or     friends.           I saw         policemen

medical          help      but    I wanted                 f i nd

I. t r i e d     to get         b ack    down       the    tunnel        to    the       pen a r e a        but w a s            stopped

by a b o u t      3 or 4 p o l i c e m e n .          They       refused         to      let me        down          saying       only

emergency            personnel           could       come       through.            As    I stood           by       the    tunnel

other       Liverpool            supporters           were       carrying           bodies           out    from       the       tunnel.

The y were           placing          them     on    the       ground      just       outside          the       tunnel.           Those

that    were         dead were           covered          up    but     some     were       still          alive,          if o n l y

just.          I saw       supporters           frantically              giving          heart        message          and       mouth     to

mouth       to    the      .injured.           The Police             were     asked        to       help       out    but       appeared

too    dazed and             shocked.           It w a s        obvious        that       I wasn't              going       to    be

allowed          back      into       the     pen    so    I/'oecided          to     try and          help          the    injured.             I

gave    mouth          to m o u t h a n d       h^afrt m a s s a g e          to a b o u t       3    people,          in

him    for a b o u t         5 minutes,             but    in the        e n d we        had     to    leave          h i m as     he w a s

dead.

I wandered             around again             trying          to    help any           injured           fans.           As    I did     so

I saw       the P o l i c e           there     receive          s ome    terrible             verbal           abuse.           Most    was

borne       out      of    frustration.               The       f ans    wanted          someone           to    vent       their

frustration               on.     The        police       took       this a b u s e       very        w e ll.         I noticed          t hat

two    gates         t hat      led     to    the    seating          area     of     the      West        Stand were             locked.

Fans    were         literally           trying           to    break     open        these          gates       in a n         attempt      to

come    out       of      the    stand.

All    of      the     time      there       are     more       bodies        being       brought           out       of    the    tunnel

obviously            dead.

Between          about       3.50pm          (1550)       and    4.20      (1620)         I spent           my       time       wandering

             around        lifting        the     coa t s     off       dead       bodies       seeing        if a n y w e r e

             I didn't       find       him    here       a n d at       about       4.25       (1625)       the     gates          to    the        West

             Stand    seats        were      ope n .        I immediately                run to      try      to    s    e    e    f    r    o     m

             the    stand.         It t o o k     me     some      time       to    get    a      good      view        o ver      the       pitch

             but    eventually          I managed            to    see                    on the        pitch.           He was          with          a

             group    of    other       people         using       advertising             boards        to    carry          the       dead and

             injured across             the     pitch.

             I left       the    g r o u n d at    about          4.45pm and met                up w i t h                        >here we             h ad

             got    into    the      ground.           We   went        straij 4Tt back            to    the       car       and    came

             straight       home,

             In m y   opinion         there       wasn't                 gh    police          on d u t y     outside           the      ground             to

             prevent       any     problems        ther             I was a pp a ll ed             that       there       were          no   police

             or    stewards        inside       the/ground actually with                           the      fans.            The    police             did

Thank you for your letter of 23 November.  The West Midlands
Police hold copies of the statements made to them. As you know,
some of those statements were made available in the course of the
public hearings at Sheffield, others were considered by Counsel
and Lord Justice Taylor but were not made publicly available.   I
suggest you get in touch with the West Midlands Police.  It may
well be that, pending the conclusion of the other inquiries
additional to those for Lord Justice Taylor with which they are
concerned, they may not be able to release the document you are
seeking.  But the best thing is to write to Mr Mervyn Jones at
West Midlands Police Headquarters.  To assist consideration of
your case, I am copying to him your letter and this reply.

                                       v

Dear Mr Whalley,

I have recently been consulted by Mr George Glover of
I
__________________ | Lancashire who wishes me to persue a claim for
damages on his behalf, in addition to receiving physical injury himself
he lost his son Barry in the Disaster.

I need a copy of Mr Glover's statement made to Officers from West
Midlands Police on 6th May 1989, can you oblige please?

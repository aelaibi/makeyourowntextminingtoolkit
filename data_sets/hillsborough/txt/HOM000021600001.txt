I had hoped that I may have met you for a few min ut es at Chelsea
but I am sure your time was fully committed on more import ant matters
                                                                                                                                       ■    iic
Having been conce rn ed at the standard of first aid cover at major
Sports .Grounds for a co ns id er ab le number of years it was ap pro pri ate
that I should submit views to the Po pp l ew el l Commi tte e following the
B r a d f o r d fire. I am p l e a s e d to say that many of these were rec omm en de d
in the interim report but u n f o r t u n a t e l y were diluted in the final report.

However, in co nj un ct io n with the Gr eater Lo ndon Council I was able to
assist in the p h r a s i n g and content of p a r a g r a p h 26 in the Safety at
Sports Grounds Safety Li cences issued before its disbandment.                 When
handed over to the 33 London Boroughs they followed the same pattern.

As a result I had close contact with 12 Lo ndon Clubs; Li ce nci ng Officers;
Police; Fire Brigade etc., at the same time ke ep in g the statutory
ambulance service informed.

All the London p r o f e s s i o n a l football clubs; 2 cricket clubs; 1 rugby
club; and W i m b l e d o n All En gland Tennis Club c o - o pe ra te d to implement
the conditions.           In fact 3 Clubs prior to H i l l s b o r o u g h were to build
new first aid posts before the start of the pre se nt season.

Wi th in 48 hours of the S h ef fi el d dis as te r all the major clubs in London
had been in touch with me a i m m e d i a t e l y agreed to a substan tia l increase
in capital first aid equipment.         This was ba s i c a ll y as submitted by our
National HQ some 6-8 weeks later and which has now become the re co mm en de d
equipm en t throug ho ut the country.

At the same time I submi tt ed m i n i m u m sizes of rooms as I had found out
on a survey of all football clubs in the co untry that condit ion s left
much to be desired.

In p r i nc ip le I fully support all the me di ca l r e co mm en da ti on s put                                                  forward
in your report and in p a r t i c u l a r the ur ge nc y stipulated.

I am p l e a s e d to say that all Lo ndon Clubs have com pli ed but six need
to enlarge a c c o m m o d a t i o n - the m a j o r i t y will do so the end of the
season.

                                                                                              /C o n t .
May    I respectf ull y make       the   following    comments

1)    No me nt i o n of St. John A m bu lan ce is made in the rec om me nd at io ns
      alth ou gh both your int eri m report and the Pop pl ew el l report
      give high       praise.             Can the role of the es ta bl is he d v o l un ta ry
      first aid       o r g a n i s a t i on s be fully recogni sed ?

2)    Except for Cate go ry A ma tch es could not the ratio of trained
      first aiders by 1 per 1,000 up to 15,000 and then 1 per 2,000.
      A m i n i m u m of 2 should always be on duty at a d es ig na te d ground.

3)    The term 'trained first aider' should be calrified.               We in
      London deem this to be a 25 hour        H.S.E. Ce rt if ic at e with
      s u p p le me nt ar y training. For some clubs we are also carrying
      out the training of Stewards in a 16 hour public first aid
      course with examination.

4)    Am b u l a n c e provision.    A l th ou gh this has been int erp re te d as
      statutory          am bulances we in London have pr ov id ed (at the request
      of the Lo ndon A m bu la nc e       Service) our front line ambulances.
      Five were on duty last Sat ur day at Chelsea.             These ambulances
      are ann ua ll y in spected by L.A.S. and all per so nn el training is
      to L.A.S. standards.             Could therefore your re co mm en da ti on
      add "approved front line am bulances from St. John Ambula nce
      or other ac ceptable vo l u n t ar y or ga nis ati on" .

      May I also suggest that the pr ov is io n of front line ambulance
      be amended to when a nt ici pat ed crowd will be 10,000 but that a
      st atutory liaison am bulance officer be pr e s e n t for crowds over
      50,000.    Ex c e p t i o n would be Ca te gor y A matc hes or when Police
      consider specific reason.


If you would so wish I would be ple as ed to meet you to discuss
further the points I have made and also any other relev ant matters.

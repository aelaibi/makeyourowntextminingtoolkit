I s lo wl y became a ware                 that      something was        ser io us ly wrong,        and saw a

mans    face         pushed up a g a i n s t ^ t h e      f e t ^ c e ^ yes f a r i n g          ancl in obvious

diffi cu lt y.           I, w ith PS        1771 J o h n s went               to the gate to the             right of

the goal.             PS J o h n s o n    ent^ed/Che          compound,        I began to       pull    people

t h r ou g h     the gate.           IsawCgft        least one man        in this        compound      land at the

foot    of       the wall,         at the      front.     He was        certainly unconsious,             and

p ro ba b ly dead.            Several       of the      fans were a b u s i v e and a g gr es si ve

to wa rd s      us,    but    it    is difficult          to say whet he r        this was       due to alcohol

or the effects               of the s i tuatj/dn.

I re ma in ed at that               gate    e vacuating         fans,    until    the Liverpool          fans

ch ar ge d a cross           the gerund
                                 g Z ^ n d towards            the N o t t i n g h a m Forest      supporters,

wh en we        ran a fter         them and swept          them back over          the     halfway      line.       The

m oo d of       the     fans was         very a g g re ss iv e and a small             m in o r i t y were

c o n t i n u al l y abusive,            and some      fans     in the N o rt h Stand a pp e a r e d          to be

fi gh ti ng a mo ng st          themselves

I did not            see an y stew^/d s             t hroughout    this       incident

W hi l st at the gate               I a sk ed a S u p e r i n t e n d e n t    to get officers          to the

rear     of the         compound to take              people away and           relieve       pressure at the

front.          He    told me       he was       trying    to    do just       that,    but    c o u l d n ’t get

t h r ou g h on his          radio,      and     in fact      1 saw him shout a message                 into the

radio,         without       gain.

I did not handle a ny bodies.

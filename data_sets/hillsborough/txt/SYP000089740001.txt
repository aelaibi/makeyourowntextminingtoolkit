          to     three     (1443).            I was      immediately                behind a          crush         barrier        in this

          position.             I generally            stand        behind          crush       barriers            at m a t c h e s     because

          it a l l o w s me        to    stand a         couple          of    steps        above       the     people          in front.

          This      enables        me    to    get a        better          view      of    the m a t c h as           I am       not    that

              climbing            out     from        pen three,                         became         very annoyed.                   At    some        stage

              I said        to     hi m a r e         you      going       into         the    pen      to    help       the      pe o p l e .      The

              policemen            said         t h at     he w a s n ’t.           I then          s a i d wa^tl        I ’m g o i n g       to    give           us

              a b un k      up.          The P o l i c e m a n         then        g a ve     me    a bymk         up o v e r       the      fence        and       1

              went       back      into         pen      three.                     came       b ao s     into      the     pen at           the    same

              time.         I don't             think         I would        have        gone       back      into       the      pen.        If the

              Police        had     g o ne       in the r e,           I think           it w a s       their       refusal            to    go    back        in

              that       made      me     go     back         in.      I climbed              back      into       the    pen at            virtually              the

              s am e     sp o t    that         I originally               climbed            out     from.         I have          marked         t h is      spot

              on    the     separate             grid         plan     using        the       figure         two.        I would            estimate           the

              time       to h a v e       been        quarter          past        three       (1515).             It w as        s till      fairly           full

              Very       shortly after                   getting          b ac k    into/the            pen,       1 saw a m a n             lying        on the

              down and            started          leaning            towards           the    man.          As    I did       so      I heard

             Whilst           I was        s t il l    by       that mart,           I remember            seeing       a h a lf       caste        lad wh o

             was       carrying            a girl          over       his     left        shoulder.            Th e    girls        h e a d wa s

             against           the     lads       back.            The      h a lf     caste       had    emerged         from       the     front       of

             the       pen,     possibly              t he      bottom        left        hand     c o r n e r as      you      look       from    the

             st an d .         Th e    h a lf     c a s te        y o u th was         carrying          the    girl      at a q u i c k          pace       up

             the       terracing            towards             the     tunnel.             He    walked       inbetween            the     collapsed

             barrier           and     the      barrier            on the          same      line as          the     collapsed            barrier.              I

             w a t c h e d as         he w a l k e d         past me          up     the     terracing          about        four      f e et     a w a y.           I

             d i d n ’t w a t c h          hi m a f t e r         that.          The      half     caste       lad w a s        aged about             twenty

             and       h ad    short a ffro                hair.         He      had a       dark       coloured        t o p on.           The    girl

             t h at     he w a s       carrying              appeared            unconscious,              possibly          dead.          In f ac t        I

             would        say t h a t         she w a s           dead      due      to     the w a y     that        he w a s      carrying           her,

             The       girl     had        long       blond        hair       which was            all    matted and             soaked         in s w e a t

             and       dirt.          She ap peared                to    be y o u n g .           I only       got a q u i c k         look at          the

             girl       and     d o n ’t r e m e m b e r           any      of     her      clothing.           Whilst          s t il l    in the       same

              position w hic h was                     a     couple         cf     fe e t    behind       the m i d d l e        section          of    the

             man       was     about        six       f e et      away      f r o m me.           The man was            l ying      on the

             terraces           at a n a n g l e .                His    feet        were        near    to    the     left      hand       section          of

             the       broken         barrier,             t h a t ’s as y o u            look     from       the     stand,        and     his    body

             was       at a n a n g l e         towards            the      tunnel.              I could       see     t ha t    he w a s       dead and

             d i d n ’t go a n y            closer           to    him.          This       mans    lips       were also            blue.         What       I

             distinctly               remember             was     the m a n s         body.        The       mans     shirt        was     fully       open

              r ight      s i de      of    the       mans        body      fully         exposed.            There     wa s     one       huge    bruise

             man    had a white                  top    on.        I ’m    pretty           s u re       it w a s     a    plain          shirt,

             remember            what       he    had      on his         feet.         Having            seen      t hi s      man       I suddenly

             thought         about                                        I became           concerned about                     what          may     h av e

             become         of    him.           X decided          to     go    onto        th e        pitch      to     look       for

             gate     in the           front         perimeter            fence/and            got        onto      the      tr a c k ,        and     then

             onto     the        pitch.

                             At       the      same     t/ime      I was        trying         to        console          people          if    they

             appeared            in n e e d       of    it,       perhaps        give        them a          cigarette               if    they wanted

             one.      There           were       P o l i c e m e n and a m b u l a n c e m e n who                   were       trying           to    revive

             people         and       fa n s     s h o u t i n g at       them,       being          aggresive.                 They weren't

             violent,            ju s t     showing          emotion.            Whilst           I was         s t il l     looking            for

             I        saw        people          trying       to    resuscitate                two        people who             were          lying      close        to

             from     the H o p           end,       two     to    three        feet        in f r o m       the g oa l          line.            There         was

             a young         girl         and a young              lad.         There        were         St J o h n s       ambulancemen

             trying         to    resuscitate                them.         Neither appeared                      to       respond          to     their

             efforts.             The       gi r l     was white,              with     brown            coloured          hair,          she was         young,

             nineteen            to    twenty.             She     had a        red     t o p on w h i c h w a s                rolled          up     towards

                  During        the    course        of    the a f t e r n o o n         I did      not w i t n e s s       anything        that          I

                  would        consider        to    be a       criminal         offence.

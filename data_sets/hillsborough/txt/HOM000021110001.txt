    Football Spectators Bill: amendments for report


              We have been considering a number of amendments;                                            this letter contains
     instructions       on    most     of    them.They    result                from              undertakings              given           in
     Committee, points raised from within the Department, discussions with the Home
     Office    and   others,       and yet. other matters                  wnich           came up             in    the    course          of

     debate.                  ••




     1.,        To require,.the Secretary of State to discuss with the FMA the matches
     he plans to .'designate.before .laying':theX)rder before Parliament (Col 180 - 4 th

     Sitting),        •


     We do not want           the Secretary       of State            to      be       obliged            to    undertake             formal
     consultation with the FMA about whether matches ^ h o u l c be designated, but we
     do wish that the FMA should have the opportunityjtb make representations which
      can then be taken into -account by                 the Secretary^of State                                     when making his

      decision.




      2.         - To     specify      the    constitution          and        composition                 of       the    FMA      (eg      to
         include supporters' representatives, an "independent" Chairman) (Co-i 29^ ~ 6 oh
      Sitting and Col 336 - 7th Sitting).
ye explored such a proposal with you some time ago and your letter of 4 July
refers. We prefer one of the prscedented approaches mentioned in parasrath 5
oi your letter.


          (i) We wish it to be specified in the Bill that the FMA must have an
          independent Chairman ie. a Chairman who has "no such financial or other
          interest as is likely to affect prejudicially the performance of his
          functions" (Schedule 2, paragraph 2(a)).


        ' -(ii) The FMA to have between 4 and 8 members, 30% to be nominated, by
          the Secretary of State                 and the rest           to be       approved by          him - both
          initially and also when changes in the membership of the Board occur.


             (iii)    In   considering          the   nomination        of    members         we    also    want     the
          Secretary of State to be obliged to consult such people as appear to
          him to represent the interests of Football supporters.


 In view of the requirements mentioned above it seems to us that it would' be
 appropriate for the Secretary of State not                         to designate              a body      as the FMA
 unless       satisfied       that       the   Articles     enabled          him    to    ensure --that            those
 requirements         could    be        fulfilled.    (Were      the    Articles- to              -be   changed     the
 Secretary of State could, as you suggested, withdraw designation).




 3."          - To require the Secretary of State to lay a report before Parliament
 on any decision to withdraw designation of FMA within a certain period                                              (Col
 309 -7th Sitting).


 We want the Secretary ;ofiS-tate to be obliged to lay a report before Parliament
                                    h.
 in    the    event    of him’;,withdrawing           the   designation            of   the    FMA.        We   do   not
  consider however that this should be required to be done within a specific
 period.       It might be., for example, that the reason for withdrawal is connected
 with matters         which are subject           to Court action or Police investigation,                             in
 which case it would be inappropriate                       for   the Secretary           of State         to report
 immediately.
  i                   - To             require          the    FMA       to      consult,               in t e r - '& I i s ..         tne   weisr.            r.-.      do   .   ore

          with another particular                             club or clubs,                   and we would therefore wish that it
          could be a condition of the licence that away supporters be banned even though
          they are members of the scheme.                                         If you agree that at present the Bill does
          not include provision to do this we would be_ grateful for an amendment giving

          ‘that:


                         a) ■provision should be made in the :Bill to require the FLA to notify
                         the applicant for                       a licence if it is proposed                                            to refuse                 to grant' a
                         licence -unless certain conditions are complied with.


                         b) if the FLA refuse                            to grant a licence,                                they must give reasons                                   for
                          doing           so       in         writing,             and        an          opportunity                    must         be              given          for
                             representation to be made against the refusal similar to                                                                            those which
                             are set out in Clause 12(4) (b) in respect of revocation or suspension

                             of a licence.




             8.        We have discussed with the Home Office the imract of the FLA's powers
             on the procedures of local authorities under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
             \ z ~~, .  Section 4(6': cf tne   :z *-~~

authority under Section 4(£) should be made unnecessary.


Vie are still          considering the question of appeals under Section 5 o:                            —
Act.     It is not clear to us to what extent (if at all) these provisions apply
      the event of action by the FLA under Clause 13(2) - can you help?                                  The Kone
Office    considers       that the        right of     appeal by           the   interested parties            there
mentioned ought in those circumstances to lie to a magistrates'                                  court, but we
 would not wish to hamper the use by the FLA of its powers under Clause 13..
 They might need to be used quickly-.                    Further discussions will no doubt take




 9.          The Home Office have been anxious to provide a defence,                                 ora further
 defence, in relation to the offences created by Clauses 2,9 and 10. This has
 been raised in debate - see                 the Report            on 5th Sitting,        col 215.           We    have
 agreed that it should be a defence in each case that the person concerned was.
 acting on" lawful authority.'             However, this-defence is not to be available to a
 person charged under Clause 2 if that person was at the                                 ^.ime of the        oj.i ence

  disqualified-from being -a -member-of -the .scheme-.




 10.       We wish in .particular •to. enable the'police; to" override the scheme in
  case of emergency.. "Thd^;'' . a g a i n . , " b e e n a .recurrent 'theme in -debate.                     Thus if
  the police'-.officer in charge, fearing serious disorder outside a ground, were
  to order the gates to be opened., no offence would thereby arise except under
  Clause 2 in relation to a person disqualified from membership.                                 If the "lawful
  authority”       defence       would    not   have     this          result,   we    wonder    whether          Clause
  5(2) (i) is wide enough to enable -the Secretary of State to require the scheme
  to    allow     the     police     to     override       its         provisions.        If    that      again            is
  insufficient, could we please have an amendment to achieve the result we want?




  11.      During discussion on defences,the question was raised as to whether a
  turnstile operator could be a "responsible person";                              the Home Office expressed
  the view that he could.                 We would not want a turnstile operator,                        or anybody
  else at a similar level of the hierarchy,                             to be a "responsible ‘person"                  who
     could be charged with ar. offence under Clause 10 cr 11, particularly since the
     defences     available    under   those   Clauses     do       not    seem   appropriate      to   such    a
     person.      If you consider that such a person could be £                       '"responsible person",
     is it practicable to anend the definition sc as to exclude him?                               If that is
     not practicable, we would need to consider what defence ought to be available
     to him.




     12.        We .have also discussed the commencement and running of the mandatory
     bans (Clause 7(3))-'        We have agreed that the ban should c.ommence at the date
     of conviction, rather than as determined under the scheme.                             It follows that
              ban may run     concurrently with     a longer              custodial    sentence.        A Court
      cmvicting a person of a relevant offence should be required to notify that
     person of the commencement and effect of the "ban.




     .13-      --We wonder whether the reference               to    "designated agencies"          should be
      removed from the long title..                             ..




-               Two further sets of'amendments will be the subject of separate letters:

                (b)      Possible   amendments    to     enable           the   admission    of    unspecified
                non-members of the scheme -at designated matches-.                         This    follows     the
                Minister1s"statement (.Hansard, 4th sitting.. Col. .16?) that the range of
                -measures -which the ELA .might wish to see for an international match at
                Wembley "may not include the use of membership cards".

FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL:   PART I - APPEALS AGAINST FLA DECISION

In case you have not seen it I attach a copy of Parliamentary
Counsel's advice about appeals under section 5 of the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act) in the light of clause 13
of the Bill. We have now to resolve with DoE the policy and give
instructions to Counsel so as to clarify the appeal position
under the Bill one way or another.

2.   DoE and ourselves have not so far agreed on the policy.   We
wish to ensure that there is a right of appeal against a term or
condition in a safety certificate imposed by the FLA. This would
be consistent with the existing rights of appeal under the 1975
Act (the first part of paragraph 7 of Counsel's letter of
21 September refers). This would give the holder of the safety
certificate, the police and either the fire authority or building
authority a right of appeal. DoE are not anxious to give anyone
a right of appeal against any decision taken by the FLA.

3.    Before we go back to DoE I would be grateful for any advice
you may be able to give on how you feel the police might view
this.    They, along with the others mentioned above, would be
consulted over the terms and conditions to be imposed or amended

HILLSBOROUGH:   CAPACITIES

You asked for further clarification on the calculation of crowd
capacities for the Hillsborough Inquiry.

The RLSD Report.

Paragraph 222 of the Green Guide was quoted in the RLSD report
and this was used to estimate the maximum allowable capacity for
Pens 3 and 4, assuming that all the criteria laid down in the
Guide for the barriers had been met.  (Although we knew in fact
that these criteria had not been complied w i t h ) . We did not, at
this stage, attempt to interpret the Guide for this situation.

The reason for this was as follows:  the capacities stated by
Eastwood and Partners on the drawings were in excess of even the
maximum value determined from the Guide and hence they could be
said to be erroneous without recourse to detailed interpretation
of the Guide.  This was the approach recommended by members of
the Inquiry during our discussions and agreed by us.

Following the RLSD Report.

Following issue of the RLSD report, the recommendations of the
Guide were interpreted by us for the situation where the
barriers do not comply with the stated criteria.     This led to
the production of the block diagram by M r ____________ the
intention being to include this in a subsequent report.

However, in the course of the Inquiry, one of the QCs produced
capacities for Pens 3 and 4 which he claimed had been arrived at
by interpretation of the Green Guide.    These figures were
inaccurate, due to some arithmetical errors and the confusion of
percentage (%) and degrees, and Mr ________ |sought to refute them
by reference to RLSD's "interpreted figures".    Dr Nicholson was
sitting next to Mr ________ Iat the time and thus the block
diagram (attached) was produced at the Inquiry and circulated
although without the detail of how it had been constructed. (An
explanation is attached here.)

This is the explanation of the existence of two sets of RLSD
capacities for Pens 3 and 4. There is no conflict between the
two since one set is based on a simplistic application of the
Guide as described above and the other is based on an
engineering interpretation of the criteria stated in the Guide.

The main point is that the capacities to which Sheffield
Wednesday FC worked were optimistic by any standard.

HILLSBOROUGH - CAPACITY OF PENS 3 AND 4


You asked for my comments on the extent to which the Green Guide was
used in determining the capacities of Pens 3 and 4 as stated in the
RLSD report.

Paragraph 222 of the Green Guide was quoted in the RLSD report and this
was used to estimate the maximum allowable capacity for Pens 3 and 4,
assuming that all the criteria laid down in the Guide for the barriers
had been met. Although we knew in fact that these criteria had not been
complied with, we did not, at this stage, attempt to interpret the Guide
for this situation.

The reason for this was as follows: the capacities stated by Eastwood
and Partners on the drawings were in excess of even the maximum value
determined from the Guide and hence they could be said to be erroneous
without recourse to detailed interpretation of the Guide. This was the
approach recommended by members of the Inquiry during our discussions.

Following issue of the RLSD report the recommendations of the Guide were
interpreted for the situation where the barriers do not comply with the
stated criteria. This led to the production of the block diagram by Mr
            the intention being to include this in a subsequent report.

However, in the course of the Inquiry, one of the QCs produced capacities
for Pens 3 and 4 which he claimed had been arrived at by interpretation
of the Green Guide. These figures were inaccurate, due to some
arithmetical errors and the confusion of percentage (%) and degrees, and
Mr         sought to refute them by reference to RLSD's "interpreted
figures". Dr Nicholson was sitting next Mr         at the time and thus
the block diagram was produced at the Inquiry and circulated without any
explanation of how it had been constructed.

I hope this explains the existence of two sets of RLSD capacities for
Pens 3 and 4. There is no conflict between the two since one set is
based on a simplistic application of the Guide (as directed by the Inquiry)
and the other is based on an engineering interpretation of the criteria
stated in the Guide. The point is that the capacities to which Sheffield
Wednesday FC worked were optimistic by any standard.




18 September 1989
INCIDENT AT SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB’S HILLSBOROUGH STADIUK:
RLSD’S ESTIMATION OF THE MAXIMUM SAFE CAPACITY OF PENS 3 AND 4 OF THE
WEST TERRACE
Eastwood and Partners Drawing No 1610/64E, dated Jan 1980, shows the capacity
of the Central Pens to be 2,200.

RLSD report IR/L/ME/MM/89/1 states that, "if 54 people per 10 sq tn is assumed
as the allowable packing density for the West Terrace then the the capacity of
Pen 3 is 1015 and Pen 4 is 1036 making a total of 2051 for the combined area".
I knew that this capacity was based on the available plan areas of Pens 3 and
4, without any reduction for departures from the recommendations of the 1986
edition of the Home Office/Scottish Office publication "Guide To Safety At
Sports Grounds".

I used information given in this Guide as the basis for my calculation of the
maximum crowd capacities of Pens 3 and 4. I also used the dimensions shown on
Drawing No 1340/02 Rev A, which is a plan of Pens 3 and 4 of the West Terrace,
together with Drawing No 1340/03A Rev A which is a longitudinal section
through the West Terrace. Both drawings were dated 3/5/89, and were prepared
for HSE by Ralph Brade & Associates, Consulting Engineers, Midland Bank
Chambers, 3 Sharrow Lane, Sheffield Sll 8AE.

Drawing No 1340/02 Rev A showed the locations of the crush barriers in Pens 3
and 4, and the lengths and heights of these barriers. The heights of the
barriers were generally less than the suggested values of 1.02 m to 1.12 m.
However, I did not discount any of the crush barriers when calculating the
crowd capacity. The departures in height were within 20% of the suggested
values and the Guide states that it is intended to be "an aid to, and not a
substitute for, professional judgement and common sense".

The loading tests made periodically on the crush barriers were designed to
simulate a force of 6 kN/m (400 lbf/ft). The barriers therefore appeared to be
intended to conform to the "greater strength requirement" of the Guide. The
spacings shown in Columns A of Table 1 of the Guide were therefore
appropriate. I classified Pens 3 and 4 as being ’peak’ viewing areas, because
they conformed with the description of such areas in the Guide.

Drawing No 1340/03A Rev A showed the slope of the West Terrace to be
13 degrees 40 minutes. I interpolated between the values shown in Table 1 of
the Guide for gradients of 15 degrees and 10 degrees in Column A for ’Peak
Viewing’ to obtain the maximum spacing between rows of crush barriers on a
terrace with a slope of 14 degrees. My interpolation suggested that the
spacing between rows of crush barriers on the West Terrace should not be more
than 3.9 m. The spacing between rows of barriers in Pens 3 and 4 was generally
3.5 m, i.e. the spacing was generally within the suggested maximum value.

The Guide suggests that the crowd packing density should not exceed 54 persons
per 10 sq m of terrace area, i.e. 5.4 persons/sa in. I calculated the plan area
behind behind each barrier, and behind the perimeter wall and perimeter gates,
using the depth available if it was less than 3.9 m, or a depth of 3.9 m.
I multiplied each area obtained in this way by 5.4 and truncated the product
to obtain the number of persons who should stand in each area.

The attached Figure depicts the result of my calculations. I obtained the
total crowd capacity of each Pen by summing the capacities of the individual
areas within that Pen. The crowd capacities estimated by this method were 822
for Pen 3 and 871 for Pen 4; i.e. the total capacity of the Central Pens was
1,693.

Dear Mr Jones

HIIISBOKXJGH INQDIRy - SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF ER EASTWDOD

My comments an the above document are as follows:

Paragraphs lfiK 8 and 9: This submission contains no mention of corrosion, or
its assessment, which should have formed part of the inspection procedure.
Dr Eastwood agreed in his evidence (day 26 pl09) that barriers which contained
corroded holes would have been condemned. The collapsed barrier contained
corroded holes (HSE Report para 3.4) which would have been visible at the 1988
inspection.

Paragraph 10: Since deflections were not measured on each span (day 26 pll3
Collins/Eastwood) how can it be said that both spans passed?

Paragraph 11: Dr Eastwood stated (day 26 pll3) that "there has been an error
in testing" and hence this paragraph is confusing.

Paragraph 1?; It was accepted eventually by Dr Eastwood that deflections could
get larger with successive load applications (day 26 pll7) and hence it is by
no means certain that the span requiring a re-test would have passed.

Paragraph 13: It has not been proved that barriers 128 and 137 were deformed
on or before 15/4/89. The test results supplied to HSE by Dr Eastwood
(covering letter Eastwood/James dated 1/6/89) state that for barrier 128 the
"first load application, up to 1.4 tonnes resulted in a 75% recovery after
release of load" which suggests that, for this barrier, plastic deformation
occurred at less than 1.2 times the design load for a new barrier (5WJ/m).
Eastwood's data require explanation.

Recent HSE results (not available when the report was issued) indicate that the
crowd density was similar in pens 3 and 4 and hence "crush pressure" would also
have been similar in the two pens.

Paraar^rSh 14: The Green Guide does not quantify "crowd pressure" and hence
this statement could be challenged.

Paragraph 16: A definition of "significantly'* is required here. Certainly
barriers which were as much as 18% below the minimum reccanmended hei^it wesre
not replaced (eg barrier 136 pen 3).

                                         1
           Paragraph 18: Most barriers at the Lappings Lane End had been positioned so as
           to prevent spectators standing on the same step as the barrier. The examples
           chosen by Dr Eastwood were not typical (day 27 p61).

           Paragraph 20: Some spectators have stated that they were pressed over the _
           barriers, thus compressing those on the lower side. The height of the barriers
           is therefore very relevant.

           Paragraph 22: The alignment of gaps in successive rows of barriers is
           specified in the Green Guide. This does not appear to have been considered by
           Dr Eastwood. Some of the gaps in the lines of barriers were well in excess of
           the Guide recommendations. For example, the gap between barriers 136 and l36A,
           immediately above the collapsed spans of 124A, was 57% larger than the Guide
           maximum.
           Paragraph 33: I do not agree with this statement. In the absence of radial
           fences, spectators would have spread more uniformly along the Ieppmgs Lane
           Terrace, thus reducing crowd density in the central area.

           Paragraph 42: In Pen 3, a configuration of barriers complying with the Green
           Guide would have led to a reduction in pressure on specific barriers
           (particularly 124A) and hence barrier collapse may have been averted. Crushing
           injuries may still have occurred but the death toll would, in my opinion, have
           been reduced substantially. The situation in Pen 4, where the barrier
           configuration was better, and the crowd density was similar, supports this
           view.
           Param-aphs 45. 47, 48 and 50: The capacity of Pens 3 and 4 is not given,
           although that of Spion Kdp is! It is not credible that "a loss in capacity"
            (para 47) or "the effect on capacity" (para 48) could be quantified or
           rj-jp-ncg/ari unless the original capacities had been calculated already. Likewise
           the only sensible way of allocating spectators to a particular pen would be on
           the basis of a known and agreed capacity. The term "visibly full" (para 50) is
           meaningless in this context.


           Do not hesitate to contact me if you require clarification of any of the above
           points. I expect to attend the Inquiry tomorrow (14th) from 9.30am onwards.

           Yours sincerely

2.        Following the firm's          appointment by the Club in December

          1978,    Dr Eastwood prepared plans for improving the safety

          of the ground and a report on ground capacity (core bundle

          page     48).      These were      submitted to         the     Officer   Working

          Party.


           The    proposals     in   relation         to    the   West    and- Borth   West

           Terraces were approved by the Officer Working Party at a

           meeting with representatives                   ot the Club on 2 April       1979

           (core bundle pages 69, 71) and were duly implemented.




     4.    Subsequently Eastwood 8c Partners



            (i)            Carried out an annual inspection and tests                    and

              Authority and to the Club.



;ii)          Attended at the bi-ennial or annual inspections

              of the ground by members of the Officer Working

              Party;


(iii)         Acted        and    advised      on    behalf         of    the        Club   in

               relation to any other matters in which they were

               instructed.



in     preparing        the    1979    Scheme       and   in    giving          subsequent

advice to the Club, Eastwood & Partners owed a duty to the

public as well as to the Club, but they were Sfit engineers

to the Licensing Authority,                   nor were they responsible for

the     way   in       which     the   Licensing      Authority           exercised         its

statutory powers.


 The Licensing Authority acted through the Officer working

 Party,       which       included      an     engineer         from          the.    Building

 Surveyors'            department,      to    whom    the      Licencing             Authority

 looked        for        advice        on     e ngineering              matters.           (For

 confirmation see the evidence of Mr Bownes:                                  day 29, pages

  Eastwood         S     Partners      were    not    members            of     the    Officer

  working Party and did not attend its meetings                                  (other than

                           both spans passed.                On the alternative interpretation,                           one

                           span passed and the other required a retest,                                although its

                           recovery on the third application load was 1 0 0 %.

                               which^ suffered permanent                 deformation           on   15 April     showed

                               that the weaker did                  not start to deform plastically until

^                         ^ subjected to a                 load of approx^ 7. 5101 /metre, i.e.                  1.5 times

                               were in pen 4.               It is probable that the crush pressure in

                          ^ pen 3 was even greater.



                    14.         Dr Eastwood concluded that the barrier which collapsed                                         on

                                15        April     did     so      because        it     was       subjected         to        a

                                para. 113).         This conclusion has not been challenged.



                    Height of Crush Barriers



                     15.        The crush barriers designed                    by Dr Eastwood complied with

                                the Green Guide's recommendations as to height.                                     The pre-

                                1979       crush barriers           on the West           and North West Terraces

                                were lower.



                     16.        Where       a     crush    barrier      was    significantly            lower       than   the

C’6 y ~ ~                       minimum           height    recommended         in       the    Green      Guide,     it   was

                                    removed or modified (core bundle pages 98 and 121,                                122).


                                                                           - 5 -
17.   The    Green      Guide       recognised       that       although    new     work        or

      reconstruction           at    football        grounds      should    not     be     to    a

      standard       lower     than       that    set    out in the        guidelines,          in

      assessing whether existing situations provided adequately

      for the safety of spectators the criterion was that of a

      reasonable        degree       of    safety.        (1976    edition        para,    1.5;

      1986 edition para. 8 ).



18.   No    uniform     height       of    crush     barrier      will     suit    everyone.

      Adopting the criterion of a reasonable degree of safety,

      the    height      of    the    pre-1979          crush    barriers    on     the    West

      Terrace was no less safe than that of the post-1979 crush

      barriers.         The former may indeed be preferable,                      especially

      if    the   height      is     to. be measured            from the nosing of the

      step behind the barrier                    (as in the Green Guide),             for the

      reasons given by Dr Eastwood (day 27, pages 61 - 63).



19.   The    Officer       Working        Party considered          the    height     of    the

      pre-1979       crush barriers on the West                   Terrace     (core bundle

      65,     66)    and      subsequently approved                Dr    Eastwood's        plans

      without        requiring         the       height     of     the     existing        crush

      barriers to be raised.



20.   It    has   not    been suggested that               the     height    of the        crush

      barriers has any relevance to the events of 15 April 1989.

            21.        Dr    Eastwood's        original arrangement             is     shown     on    drawing

                       11427/7.



            22.        The    horizontal        spacing was          closer     than     the    Green    Guide

                       required.            The gradient of the terrace was modest and the

                       distance         from        front     to    back    relatively         short.          All

                       barriers        were    brought up to category A standard.                         These

                       were        "plus"     factors.         On the      ••minus"    side     the    existing

                       terrace had no gangways,                    and Dr Eastwood considered that

                       the     introduction           of     gangways      on   that    terrace        would    be

                       unsafe        and/or     impractical          for   reasons      which    he     gave    in

                        evidence.           His arrangement closed the gaps between certain

    c:..                crush        barriers,       but     left    certain     other       gaps, to     allow

^          ^ '          movement.           In his     interim report           (core bundle pages              36,

                        40-41)       Dr Eastwood drew attention to the possibility that

                        some of the barriers close to the exits might restrict the

                        passage of spectators unreasonably (as subsequently proved

                        to be the case).              He also drew attention to the absence of

                        gangways        and recommended that capacity should be reduced

                        on that account by                  10%.     This was     a reasonable approach

            7           and        accorded     with        the :criterion      of     the     code,    viz.     to

                        provide a reasonable degree of safety.



                 23.    Dr     Eastwood's           plans    and    report on ground capacity                  (core

                            bundle    page     48)    were     considered       by     the   Officer     Working

                            Party      at     two     meetings       at     which      the     Club     and      its

                            representatives were not present (12 February and 30 March

                            1979    - core bundle pages              5 7 and 65)       and at two meetings


                                                                   - 7 -
between the          Officer Working Party and representatives                        of

the Club including Dr Eastwood (2 and 18 April 1979 - core

bundle     pages         69    and    74).      The    Officer      Working     Party

concluded that it would be unreasonable to insist on the

provision       of       gangways     or     additional     exits     (core    bundle

pages    5 7 and 60) and the plans for the West Terrace were

approved.



The subsequent            alterations        to the barrier arrangement on

the     West    Terrace        are    shown     on    drawing    11424/8.        They

comprised:



(a)     the introduction of radial barriers,                     two in 1981 and

        two in 1985,           coupled with the removal in 1985 of two

        sections          of   rail     from    what    would       otherwise        have

        become one continuous barrier across the whole width

        of pen 3;



 (b)    the removal of barrier 144 in 1986.



These alterations arose from requests by the Police,                             based

 on problems which they were encountering,                       and received the

 approval of the Officer Working Party and authorisation of

 the    Licensing         Authority.           Eastwood     & Partners        were    not

 authors       of the proposals              but did not oppose them           (in the

 way     that       Dr    Eastwood     opposed,       for   example,     the    Police

 terrace on either side of each radial barrier:                         core bundle

2 6    Although the Police were not engineers,                                      their views          were

       entitled          to     considerable             respect       in     matters        concerning

       their experience of crowd control and maintenance of order

       at the ground.



Radial Fences
2 7.   Prior        to    the       introduction          of radial           fences,       the terrace

       was     "open          plan"        and     the        policy        with     regard        to     the

       distribution of spectators was one of laissez faire.                                              This

       failed       to work          at     the Tottenham Hotspur v Wolverhampton

       Wanderers semi-final in 1981 when crushing occurred at the

       corners.               The        Police    diagnosis           of     the     cause       was     the

       refusal of fans to move (core bundle page 138,                                       139).        They

       proposed as a remedy the introduction of radial fences in

       order     to       divide          the     terrace       into        three     sections,          each

       served       by its          own     entrance,          and so        allow     a more       active

       system of control of spectators.                               Eastwood & Partners were

       instructed             to    prepare        the    necessary           plans        (core    bundle

       page     145)       and       the proposal             was     approved        by    the    Officer

       Working Party                (core bundle page                 153).         The proposal          was

       logical        and reasonable,                  provided that the control                     (which

       it     was        the       purpose        of     the     scheme        to     introduce)          was

       exercised.               Radial          fences    were      also      recommended           by    the

       Green        Guide           (1976       edition,        para.         18.1;        1986     edition

       para. 206).                  Conversely           if     the     Club        had     refused        to

       introduce radial fences and a repetition of the 1981 semi­

       final had occurred,                      they would then have been criticised

       for     failing              to     introduce          radial        fences     'despite          past

      experience,       the    requests         by    the    Police,         the     approval       of

      the Officer Working Party and the recommendations                                      of the

      Green Guide.


      The same paragraph of the Green Guide stated that ideally
29.
      each section should be self-contained and serviced by its

      own    entranee/exit,           refreshment            facilities             and     toilets.

      This ideal would have been achieved by the 1985 scheme(s)

      prepared     by     Eastwood          &     Partners,            but     which        did     not

      proceed.


      At the same time as the 1985 scheme was under discussion,
30.
      the    Police     with     the       support      of       the    Licensing         Authority

      wished     to     extend       the     system         of     radial          fences    by     the

      construction of two new fences, which would (a) divide the

       central    pen     into       two    (pens      3     and       4)    and    (b)     create       a

       buffer zone between pens 4 and 5.                          The Club was now in the

       first    division       and     the       Police      were        experiencing            fairly

       large     crowds       (Inspector         Calvert,         day       30 page       20).      The

       suggestion of a further radial                        fence dividing pen 5 into

       two     (core   bundle page           235 para.            (c))      was     opposed by Dr

       Eastwood because          he saw no sufficient                        reason for it           and

       the idea was dropped.                    There were,            however,       sensible and

       logical     reasons       for       the       introduction            of     the     other    two

       radial     fences.        The reasons for the buffer zone were set

       out in Dr Eastwood's letter to the Club dated 17 June 1985

        (core    bundle       page     252).         The     radial         fence     dividing       the

        central pen into two was intended to enable the diversion

        of   spectators        into    either half               and so permit .controlled

      Inspector Calvert,               day 30 page 60).



31.   The    advantages          and    disadvantages         of    the    radiai    barriers

      involved a balancing exercise.                          Evidence that their pros

      and cons were weighed is to be found,                          for example,         in the

      minutes       of the meeting of the Officer Working Party which

      approved their introduction in 1981 (core bundle page 153)

      and     in    Dr   Eastwood's           letter     to   the    Licensing      Authority

      dated 26 January 1982 (core bundle page 169).



32.   The    raison d' etre            for the introduction of radial                     fences

      was    that there          should be controlled               filling    of the pens

      which the radial             fences       created.         The method of control

      was described by Inspector Calvert (day 30 pages' 20C,                                26C,

      30B).        It was     not       as    good    as the scheme proposed by Dr

      Eastwood in 1985.                However,        it was believed by the Police

      to be,       and was,       viable so long as the intended method of

      control was          exercised.           Dr Eastwood held the same belief

      and    no problems          were brought to his                attention after the

      introduction          of    the        radial    fences      apart    from    the    local

      blockage caused by barrier 144.                         The cause of the tragedy

      on    15 April        1989       was    not     that the      system of       controlled

      filling was          not viable,          but that it was not implemented.

      No attempt was made to monitor the filing of the central

      pens,    and Gate C was opened when they were already visibly

      full.



33.   If    there    had    been       no radial        fences      but Gate C had been

                  difficult to see how, a tragedy of the same kind would have

                  been    averted       (especially         in view of the                1981 incident).

          Bftwinval of Barrier 144 in 1996.
          34.    in     his     initial        report      to    the        Club,    Dr     Eastwood         had

                  foreseen       the    possibility         that       central       barriers         close    to

                  the      exits       might        restrict      the        passage        of    spectators

                  unreasonably and require to be removed                                 (core bundle page

                   36, 40).          To retain a barrier which caused blockage of the

                   central           entrance/exit               would         conflict           with        the

                , j recommendations            of    the   Green       Guide        as    to     ingress      and

                 ) egress      (1986 edition,         Chapters 5 and 6 ).



          35.      The reasons         for the Police request for the removal of two

                   spans      of barrier        144 were given in evidence by Inspector

                   Calvert (day 30 pages 21-3,                   51-3,       56-60).        They considered

                   it to be a matter of safety as well                              as convenience.             In

                   summary:
                   (i)     There were repeated complaints by the Police Officers

                              that     the     barrier          was    causing           blockage       of     the

                              entrance,      despite       attempts         to make spectators               move.

                              This led to a build-up back up the tunnel, ill temper

                              and disorderly behaviour.

                              N. B. Similar blockage had,                   according to the             Police,

                                      been the cause of the crushing in the 1981 semi­

              The problem was discussed at the meeting on 7 August 1986,

              including         the     possible      effects         of           the           removal            of     the

              barrier          (Inspector    Calvert,        day         30,            page           249)         and    the

       37.             The suggestion that the removal                             of barrier                   144 created a

y \               diagonal route towards barrier 124A is incorrect.                                                      Such a

                  route already existed.


                  It is not clear whether it is suggested that the response

                  to     the   Police      request     for    the           removal                of       barrier         144

                  should have been
                   (i)     to do nothing.          This would have been irresponsible.

                   (ii) to      re-site     the      barrier.             This               was       considered            and

                           rejected for good reasons.

         the     Licensing      Authority       authorised        the    removal       of    the

         barrier as      requested by the             Police,     the    Club would have

         been    open to       criticism if         they    had   not    carried out the

         work.


40.      The tragedy on 15 April 1989 was not caused by the removal

         of barrier      144,    but by the admission of spectators                       at an

         uncontrolled        rate     into     pens    which      were    already      visibly

         full.


41.      On the assumption that the inflow of spectators was to be

         controlled      by     turnstiles       and       that   the    pens    were     to      be

         closed when full, the decision to remove barrier 144 was a

         rational      decision in the           interests        of safety as well               as

         the maintenance of order.



          On     the   other    hand,     if    spectators        were     admitted         at    an

          different      configuration          of     barriers      might      have    altered

          pressure      point(s),       but    no     configuration       could have             been

          expected to prevent severe crushing, somewhere.                          If barrier

          144 had still         been in place,             many of the casualties                 may

          have been in the tunnel and there would have been strong

          criticism       of    the     failure       to    remove      barrier    144.           (Dr

           in summary,    the primary evacuation route from pens 3 and 4
44.
           was through the tunnel and allowed evacuation well within

           the time prescribed by the code.                     The perimeter gates and

           the gates in the radial fences provided a secondary escape

           route which would enable the pens                     to be evacuated within

            the    prescribed        time,    as    well    as    allowing        access   for

            security.     The width of the perimeter gates was a matter

            considered     and       determined       by    the    Licensing        Authority

            through      the        officer    Working       Party:         Dr     Eastwood

            statement paragraphs 58 and 59.                 Past experience had shown

            them to be satisfactory                (Inspector |                  day 30'
            18).     However,        they were not designed or intended for a

            situation in which           there was         such gross      overcrowding of

            the pens as to make movement impossible.



 r.apacitv
  45.        In his initial report to the Club (core bundle page 36) Dr

             Eastwood     described          the    way    in    which     the    Green    Guide

        \ calculated spectator capacity.                        In the report and

 7      (    further report (core bundle page 48) he suggested capacity

        I    figures and set out his reasoning.



     46.     The Licensing Authority through the Officer Working Party

              considered       Dr    Eastwood's      report      and   exercised their        own

              judgment.        The    number       of spectators       certified for Spion

              KOP was     16,850       (core bundle page           117),    compared with Dr
                       Eastwood' s        suggested        figure      of    16,000         (core bundle       page

                       56}.



                       Subsequently              when     radial        fences          were    introduced       Dr

                       Eastwood       and Mr I                  (pointed out to the Club and the

             ?         Licensing Authority that the removal of barrier would mean

                       bundle       pages    160,       162,    169.        Unknown to Dr Eastwood the

                       Police expressed the view to the Licensing Authority that

                       there was          no need to reduce the certified capacity                             (core

                       bundle page 165).



                 48.   Similarly,         in relation to the removal                        of barrier    144 Dr

                       Eastwood' s evidence               was    that       Mr                 reported to him

                       after the          meeting on 7 August                1986 that the question of

                       the effect on capacity was                      considered and a similar view

                       expressed by the Police (day 27, page 54f).



                 49,   The decision whether to reduce the certified capacity and

                       if so by how much was not the responsibility of the Club

                       or     its     engineers,           and     they          were    not    privy     to     the

                       discussions          of    the     Officer      Working Party on the               subject

                       except at ground inspections.



                 50.   On the day in question,                   the opening of Gate C meant that

                       there was          no way of limiting the number on the West and

                       North West Terraces to the certified figure whatever that

                           figure    might       have    been.         In    the      event,    the   Health      and

                           Safety Executive's            best estimate of the total                   number who
                       entered through turnstiles A to G and Gate C is 9,734,                  ie.

                       lower   than    the    certified    figure.      The    tragedy   was   not

                      caused by       the    admission    of   too   many   spectators    to   the

                      ground, but     by     theadmission of         ari uncontrolled flow of

HTT.LSBOROUGH TNOUIRY - QUESTIONS TO DR EASTWOOD

Where possible these questions are related to the relevant paragraphs in
Dr Eastwood's statement.

para 14: Were you consulted in the preparation of the Guide?

           Did you ever use the 1973 version of the Guide?

Para 20:    What did you know of the history of the crush barriers on the West
           Terrace when you took over responsibility?

           Did you know what material the barriers were made from?

Para 27: What account was taken of gaps in the lines of barriers?

           Did these gaps comply with the Guide?

Para 29: Were these gaps in the lines of barriers taken into
         consideration in calculating the capacity of the West Terrace?

Para 31:   How can you be sure that barriers 128 and 137 werebent during
& 109      the incident on 15 April 1989?

           Were the barriers inspected for damage after each game?

Para 32: Do you have a written procedure for the testing of barriers?

           How are your operatives trained?

           How is the degree of corrosion assessed?

           What criteria are applied to determine when corrosion is excessive?

           Do you apply any acceptance criteria in addition to those in
           the Guide?

           Do you consider that your test method is suitable for barriers
           with wrought iron tubes? Have you done any calculations of
           collapse load?

           Have you had discussions with other companies which test
           barriers?

 Para 33: How is deflection measured?

           What is the accuracy of deflection measurement?

           Is the deflection of each span measured?

 Para 36: Why were five yearly tests specified rather than four yearly,
          as recommended in the Guide?
Para 40: Was there anything unusual about the test results from barrier
& 113    124A in 1988?

          In what condition was barrier 124A after the test in 1988?

          Was the horizontal tube permanently deformed?

          Was the degree of corrosion assessed?

          After the 1988 tests you recommended replacement the rails on
          barriers 144 and 133, why was 124A not recommended for repair?

Para 45: When the radial fences were planned how was the capacity of
         each individual pen calculated?

          Were any barriers split into two e.g by removing one span
          at this stage?

          And, if so, why?

Para 109 :You also tested barrier 136 on Sunday 16 April, what happened
          the first time a force of 6kN/m was applied?

          Was there any permanent deformation?

          When a force of 6kN/m was first applied to barrier 128 was
          there any permanent deformation?

          What did you deduce from these tests about the forces to which
          these barriers had been subjected prior to your tests on 16th?

Others:   Did you modify your test procedure when the Guide was re-issued
          in 1986?

          Did you ever measure the heights of the barriers in pens 3 and 4?
HTT.T.SROROUG'H TNOIJIRY - NOTES ON QUESTIONS TO DR EASTWOOD

Para 14: There was a suggestion, by Supt Taylor, that Dr Eastwood had
         been consulted during formulation of the Guide.

         Dr Eastwood does not acknowledge the 1973 Guide in his statement.
         In this version the crush barrier test calls for one load
         application only.

Para 20: The design of the "old" barriers suggests that they were
         considerably more than 20 years old. I would have expected
         a competent person to consider the materials from which the
         barriers were made before devising/applying a test procedure.

Para 27: Allowable gaps in the lines of barriers are given in the Guide
& 29     (paras 114 and 115, 1986 version) and, where these gaps exceed
         the requirements, the capacity should be reduced (para 226, 1986
          Guide)

Para 31: Barriers 128 and 137 could have been bent during a previous match.

          Barriers should be examined after each event (para 39, 1986 Guide)

Para 32: I would expect a competent person to have a written procedure
         for carrying out crush barrier tests. Other companies have
         written procedures in order to ensure consistency and
         repeatability.

          The Eastwood barrier test reports indicate that barriers
          are rejected occasionally on the basis of excessive corrosion.
          This is highly subjective and ought to accompanied by residual
          thickness measurements and a design appraisal.

          Other companies, being not entirely happy with the barrier test
          procedure in the Guide, have added additional requirements e.g,
          a maximum allowable deflection irrespective of recovery. Other
          companies also test the vertical members in addition to the
          horizontal tubes.

          The yield stress of wrought iron is so unpredictable that some
          permanent deformation of the tube could occur during testing.
          This would reduce the capacity for further plastic deformation and
          introduce the possibility of strain age embrittlement (brittle
          failure under impulsive loads).

          Two other companies that test barriers have been contacted
          during the Inquiry. One appears to carry out tests in accordance
          with the 1973 version of the Guide (a single application of force)
          and the other interprets the Guide to mean that one test
          consists of three applications of force and deflections are
          measured from the original datum position. The latter is consistent
          with HSE's understanding of the current procedure but differs
          from the interpretation apparently adopted by Dr Eastwood. The
          latter carries out three tests, each consisting of one
          application of force, and the datum is re-established after the
          removal of each force. This point is critical since HSE's
          interpretation of Eastwoods 1988 data indicate that barrier 124A
          would have failed the first test and a re-test (3 more applications
          of force) was therefore required.
                Deflection under load   =   36nnn
                Permanent deflection    =   17mm
                Elastic deflection      =   19mm
                % recovery              —   53%

Para 33: These questions were put to Dr Eastwood by Mr       (HSE) and the
         answers were not satisfactory. I would expect that the deflection
         of each span would be measured at its mid-point. It is hard to
         believe that the Eastwood method is capable of accuracies better
         than +lmm

Para 36: Dr Eastwood's statement does not give a reason why the
         recommendation of the Guide was not followed.

Para 40: The notes under Para 32 are relevant here also.
& 113    The amount of permanent deflection exhibited by span 1/2
          on barrier 124A during the test in 1988 was 17mm. Only barrier
          144 was worse than this and Dr Eastwood recommended that the tube
         be replaced.

         The tube on barrier 133 was described as "badly corroded" and
         was replaced, yet no comment was made about the condition of 124A.

         Dr Eastwood's statement that barrier 124A passed the test
         "very satisfactorily" is highly questionable.

Para 45: The capacity of each individual pen should have been calculated
         when the radial fences were installed. There is no indication
         in Dr Eastwood's statement of how this was done.

         The capacities of 1200 and 1000 for pens 3 and 4 respectively,
         shown on Eastwood's drawings, would have been optimistic even
         if the gaps in the lines of barriers had complied with the Guide.

         The numbering and position of the barriers suggests that 136 &
         136A, and 124 & 124A, may originally have been joined.
         Separation may have been achieved by removal of one span and, if this
         was the case, then a gap in excess of the guide requirement was
         created.

Para 109:Eastwood's report on the tests carried out on Sunday 17 April
         suggests that barriers 136 and 128 deformed permanently the
         first time they were loaded. This indicates either that some
         deterioration occurred since the last test or that the tests
         have poor repeatability.

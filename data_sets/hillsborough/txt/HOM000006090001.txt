Dear Mr Fanner

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - COMPENSATION PAYMENTS

I attach a copy of a letter from Mr Walker, Solicitor to the
South Yorkshire Police Authority, about the possibility of the
Authority making compensation payments above the "statutory"
compensation provision.

We will be considering whether such payments would warrant for
51% police specific grant and we have asked Mr Walker for further
information on what seems the Authority have in mind and the
number of persons entitled to such payments.

In the meantime I wondered whether your department would have any
views on our funding settlements above the statutory bereavement
provision.   Mr Walker mentioned oh the telephone that a figure
of Â£10,000 had been discussed at recent meetings.     If possible
the Police Authority would like to be able to settle the claims
without matters going to Court, and they feel such an offer would
be right.   I should be very grateful for your comments.

                                    Yours sincerely




                                    (MS) P RANSFORD

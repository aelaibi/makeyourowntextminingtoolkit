 1                                         Tuesday. 7th October, 1997
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:   While we are settling down I would
 3        just like to say something about what happened yesterday,
 4        about this unfortunate remark that I made to Mr. Hammond.
 5        I have to say that I think what I said may have been
 6        seriously misunderstood and misinterpreted.
 7             It seems to be thought that I have made up my mind
 8        that the cause of the â€”     are you listening, Mr. Hicks,
 9        this quite important and I want you to understand this,
10        that I have made up my mind that the reason why the police
11        lost control outside the turnstiles was because the fans
12        turned up late and so on.
13             I explained to you when you came to see me last week,
14        and I tried to explain yesterday, that so far from that
15        being the case the exact opposite is the case because Lord
16        Taylor made a finding of fact about that.     I indicated to
17        you last week and yesterday that I can see no basis upon
18        which that finding should be reviewed.     I have read all
19        the evidence that was given at his Inquiry.     There is
20        ample evidence there to support his findings and to my
21        mind it would be very undesirable to re-open and inquest
22        and raise all those issues again.
23             All the evidence that has been put before me does not
24        relate â€”   let me put that differently.    None of the
25        evidence that has been put before me relates to what
26        happened outside the turnstiles at all.     That is simply
27        not an issue in my Scrutiny at the moment and I hope that
28        it will not be.   All the evidence that I have been asked
29        to consider relates to what happened inside the ground.
30        As you, are well aware, probably the most important issue
31        is this question of the videos and that I have well in
32        mind and I am looking into it.
33             Most of the other problems relate to what happened in
34        individual cases between the time that they were taken
35        from the pens or seen in the pens until the time they were
36        found to be dead and so far as I can I will investigate


                                       2
 1         that insofar as it has not already been done.     A number of
 2         people have been concerned that in their particular case
 3         there was evidence that some resuscitative measures were
 4         taken or no measures were taken or what have you.
 5              None of that relates to what happened outside the
 6         ground and insofar as I have made up my mind about
 7         anything in this case it is that I see no reason whatever
 8         to review Lord Taylor's finding about that.     It is
 9         therefore somewhat ironical to me to find that the
10         position has been really completely, I have not read any
11         of the publicity, but it seems to be put forward on the
12         basis that I have made up my mind against the fans on this
13         point.   It just is simply not true.    I think, Mr. Hicks, I
14         hope you will recognise that that is not true.
15   MR.   HICKS:   Can I comment, sir?
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Yes.
17   MR.   HICKS:   All I would say to that is we are to here today.
18         I obviously have two jobs to do, if I may use that phrase,
19         one is Chairman of the Group, where I am expected to act
20         on behalf of the majority, and the other one is obviously
21         Jenny and I are aggrieved parents, so I am here as a
22         bereaved father today.
23              I am conscious of what I believe is your position in
24         respect of Taylor and obviously I am pleased to have that
25         indication from you because I happen to believe that
26         Taylor got it right in the round.      One of the things I
27         will say briefly today, not to revisit Taylor, is that I
28         am still convinced to this day that it was Superintendent
29         Greenwood on the steps, we do not need to go into the
30         evidence.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I know the point about that.
32   MR.   HICKS:   But it is all irrelevant to some extent to where
33         we are now.   Similarly, we would like to make a comment.
34         Jenny and I and the girls were at the 88 game and so we
35         were involved in both outside the ground, but obviously
36         much earlier than the times when the problems occurred.


                                       3
 1         But the comments that I made to Taylor, and tried to
 2         introduce at other times, was that there was a different
 3         policing arrangement outside, very different.          In 88 we
 4         had to walk a long distance, all the way round the side
 5         streets and come back from Penniston Road roundabout.
 6   MRS. HICKS:      Far better organised, wasn't it?
 7   MR.   HICKS:     Exactly and it was totally different.       So again to
 8         take that point we believe that Taylor got it right and
 9         that the principal cause of the disaster was the loss of
10         police control.
11                  I always try to be a fair and reasonable person, in
12         fact I sometimes get criticised for it both within and
13         outside of the Group.     There are people who believe in
14         swift and dramatic action.        I have come today.    I on
15         behalf of the Group accepted your apology yesterday and I
16         am on record in most of the newspapers I think as saying
17         that we accepted your apology.       We do have an arrangement
18         within the Group though, and this is for your education if
19         you like, in that individual families are free to do and
20         say what they wish on behalf of their family only.             Myself
21         and Phil Hammond are the only two people authorised by the
22         Group to make public pronouncements on the Group's behalf.
23          So all I would say on that, sir, is we were deeply hurt by
24          it, as I made the comment yesterday.       I am sure you
25         appreciate, as much as we, it is probably a remark better
26          not made but, sadly, it was.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I quite appreciate that.
28   MR.    HICKS:     It obviously gives a great concern.    Again, no
29          disrespect to yourself, we find ourselves here nine years
30          on nearly not having had a very good shake of the stick
31          from the legal or the judicial system.       So to some extent
32          part of the reaction is due to the fact that people feel:
33          here we go again, forgive my language, we're about to be
34          shafted yet again.
35                  So I think one of the lessons that you've probably
36          learned from that exercise is we are talking about people


                                         4
 1         here that it really does matter to.          One of the issues
 2         that comes up regularly is this is all about vengeance or
 3         compensation and we were going to open with a statement
 4         that both Jenny and I do still have PTSD personal damages
 5         claims outstanding.
 6              We were involved, as you know, in test cases, which
 7         were not of our volition but we did agree that the girls'
 8         cases would be used as test cases.          I in fact inherited
 9         Â£167,000 bill.   So the judicial system has not only failed
10         us, it has damaged us in many ways most of the families
11         feel.
12              So I think, sir, part of the reaction that you see is
13         a response to the past as well as to that statement.             It
14         just illustrated the sensitivity.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I think I fully understand that.
16         You were one of the people who had a Personal Traumatic
17         Stress Disorder claim because you were there and you
18         witnessed the events.
19   MR.   HICKS:   That is right.    If we deal with that, and this is
20         irrelevant I suppose to your inquiry but it is background
21         information, and another thing that galls the families
22         and, if you like, Jenny and I in particular is there's has
23         been out of court settlements, as you know with the police
24         officers, and yet if I take Jenny, for instance, and I
25         will speak on her behalf, she can speak for yourself I can
26         assure you.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I got that impression.
28   MR.   HICKS:   Jenny is unable to         work, she's had an extremely
29         difficult time of it, she's currently under medication and
30         obviously this is extremely difficult for you.
31   MRS. HICKS:    I find it very difficult trying to go           through----
32   MR.   HICKS:   Hence the reason I tend to do most of the talking.
33
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Mr.       Hicks, if I may say so, I fully
35         understand all that.      I do not particularly want to get
36         involved in the civil litigation side in any way at all.


                                           5
 1         I tried to explain to your members yesterday what the
2          difference between criminal and civil liability is.       I
3          suspect some of them understand and some of them do not.
4    MR.   HICKS:   I think the point I was making, sir, is not to
 5         expect you to, we just want you to appreciate, if you
 6         like, that we're declaring an interest and we're declaring
 7         that from the point of dispelling any argument that the
 8         Hicks' are only there for the money or whatever.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I have never thought that, Mr.
10         Hicks.
11   MR.   HICKS:   It's an understandable argument, as I say, but
12         again the law is made to look an ass when there's of court
13         settlements and yet the families are taken all the way to
14         the House of Lords and basically dragged kicking and
15         screaming all the way.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     If it is any consolation to you,
17         the claims by the police officers which have been
18         contested are going to the House of Lords.
19   MR.   HICKS:   There has been a number settled already though,
20         sir.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I know there has.
22   MR.   HICKS:   Can I say that we're obviously not here--
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I do not think we ought to get
24         bogged down.
25   MR.   HICKS:   It was just a case of trying to explain the
26         background so that I think you understand there are a lot
27         of people who are bitterly disappointed and I think,
28         you'll hear some of the comments we're going to make
29         ourselves, we have been in the forefront of the disaster
30         from day 1, again not through choice.    I think Chris made
31         a comment when I was talking to him about the video.      What
32         you saw in Hillsborough video is in fact in my view
33         understated, not overstated, as has been said.
34   MR.   BONE:    In terms of press interest in you.
35   MR.   HICKS:   You saw the interest yesterday, I didn't get home
36         until 11 o'clock last night.    Obviously most of the people


                                       6
 1         were trying to get us to rubbish yourself and this
 2         Scrutiny     and everything else.    There are differing
 3         schools of thought, as I'm sure you are aware.       My view is
 4         that we are here to make some points to you.        I will, with
 5         your permission, sir, give you a written submission in the
 6         next few days summarising what we say, you will have the
 7         transcripts anyway.      But there are some documents which
 8         with yesterday I didn't get chance to get them
 9         photocopied.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Shall we get on with that now?
11   MR.   HICKS:     Yes.   We've declared our position, as I say, so no
12         need to cover that.       I think there are a couple of issues
13         that worry us.      The first one is mainly inaccuracies and
14         discrepancies within the body files.       We have only just
15         received those.       This is something which we look back and
16         we should have maybe had a couple of years ago.        I did
17         find a letter, which unfortunately I have misplaced again
18         at the moment, from South Yorkshire Police refusing to
19         give us to them.       I won't submit today other than to say
20         that we have had an extreme difficulty throughout the
21         years of getting information.
22              We have now got them, we have had them for about a
23         week and we are even now finding discrepancies and some of
24         those will come back to me in a minute.
25   MRS. HICKS:      I'm having problems going through them anyway. MR.
26              HICKS:       Again, this is as I mentioned to you earlier,
27              Jenny does have a difficulty with it at the minute.
28              The timing is something that's our problem and not
29              yours.
30   MR.   HICKS:     We also wish to state to you as a representive
31         society we are on record as commending West Midlands
32         officers for their care and attention to us at the time.
33         We are now of the opinion that that has been almost a
34         cynical manipulation of u s .      I will expand on that in a
35         minute.     So we want to formally withdraw those
36         commendations.


                                          7
1               We also want to state that we appreciate there are
2          problems with the coron5(al system.      So this may or may not
3          be part of your report.     Obviously I've studied this in
4          great detail, we knew nothing of most of these issues
5          before we became involved in this disaster.       There are
 6         some specifics, which we will go into in a second, in
 7         terms of errors.
 8              There are witnesses we feel should have been called.
 9         There are other witnesses who we know, and we will be
10         giving you a new statement signed by Paul Taylor, who I
11         think you may be aware o f .
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Yes.
13   MRS. HICKS:     I think he has a mention in my letter to you.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I have that.
15   MR.   HICKS:    One of the reasons we are withdrawing our comments
16         about the West Midlands police, and I will elaborate on
17         that both in terms of my alleged incident with the
18         ambulance man, Tony Edwards, who again we have been in
19         contact v/ith and we have had discussions with and I also
20         want to mention PC Marshall, whose name and transcripts
21         appear.
22              We are moving on into the medical notes.       I
23         appreciate, sir, that many of this could be argued is not
24         fresh evidence and it again falls into this grey area of
25         is it fresh to the families?       Is it fresh to the inquiry?
26         I have to say that many of these are small inaccuracies,
27         if you like, in terms of timings and whatever, but we find
28         them a little bit difficult to accept and, again, this is
29         where, believe me we are not paranoid, but we are
30         beginning to smell a rat, if I could use the cliche, in
31         that we had not seen the body files, as I said, until this
32         week.
33              There is a lot of stuff in there which I am appalled
34         by and this this is where I think that the evidence
35         gathering has been at the least unfair and it's my
36         opinion, and I think Jenny agrees.


                                          8
 1   MRS.   HICKS: I do.
 2   MR.    HICKS: That there has been an element of skulduggery
 3          going on in the way the evidence has been gathered.      To
 4          try and give a generality, if you like, and I think this
 5          came up yesterday, there are subsequent statements added,
 6          I mean, one of the best examples is a year later which
 7          goes to great lengths to explain how I was a ranting,
 8          raving lunatic, swearing at the police and everything.        I
 9          accept that I was pretty fired up on the day, as you would
10          expect me to b e .
11   MRS. HICKS:       That was only because of the way we were being
12          treated.
13   MR.    HICKS: That was a combination of the circumstances,      of
14          course, we were aware that we'd lost Victoria at the     time
15          and were not aware that Sarah was dead.
16               As Jenny has already pointed out the way we were
17          treated was abysmal.     It was the subject of police
18          complaint and, again, as an illustration of our
19          reasonableness, if you like, we accepted most of those
20          being settled by informal resolutions where basically we
21          accepted the apologies of the officers concerned.
22               We did not see any point in, if you like, making
23          major issues out of some of these things.     Whether that
24          was wise or not you will appreciate, sir, we were not in
25          exactly the frame of mind to deal with these things as
26          coolly and calmly as we might do today or even a few years
27          later.
28               If I could deal with some of the specifics now and
29          perhaps we should take Paul Taylor first because he is the
30          one which we have the most concern about.     Again we will
31          give you documents to save you a lot of time.
32   MRS. HICKS:       He has done a signed statement.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH ^L'ARSE:      You have got a signed
34          statement?
35   MR.    HICKS:     We actually haven't got it, i t's on its way to us,
36          I should have collected it from the Hillsborough office


                                         9
 1         yesterday.    If we can give you the basic bones or
 2         structure of where we're coming from.        Paul Taylor was on
 3         the terraces--
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     He was a Liverpool supporter?
 5   MR.   HICKS:   He was a Liverpool supporter, he was in fact a
 6         witness but it was only afterwards where we discovered
 7         that there is a major discrepancy between the evidence
 8         that he gave, his statement and what he claims happened.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Discrepancy between?
10   MRS. HICKS:    The evidence that he gave at the inquest and what
11         he claimed happened.
12   MR.   HICKS:   That's a matter of, again, duress placed upon him
13         byâ€”
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      This is Mr. McCrombie?
15   MR.   HICKS:   This is McCrombie.        Can I just say that McCrombie
16         and Julie Appleton became almost friends of ours at the
17         time, they gave us their telephone numbers, their bleeper
18         numbers.     When I had to give evidence at the Taylor
19         Inquiry they appeared to help with the Press and at the
20         time we were most grateful for it.         I have to say---
21   MRS. HICKS:    That hurts even more to know that they were not
22         quite as they seemed.
23   MR.   HICKS:   We can't prove it, all I am saying to you, sir, is
24         it is our belief now that that was a bit more cynical than
25         we believed at the time.      We thought it was all very
26         genuine and it was both to the credit of them and to the
27         police generally the way they were trying to support us in
28         our hour of need, if you like.
29               We now believe that that probably had a hidden agenda
30         to it, it doesn't give me great pleasure to say that and
31         obviously we think it came from a higher authority because
32         for this to be true then there has to be a fairly
33         widespread attempt.
34               One of the comments I will make in the end, I think
35         you are aware of this report, I think it's a scandal.
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Which report?


                                         10
 1   MR.   HICKS:   This is the Philips Report by the Deputy Chief
 2         Constable.    Again, as I said earlier, sir, we were there
 3         on the day.    There are basically two things I can cannot
 4         forgive the police for, regardless of what your report
 5         says or wherever we go from here.
 6              The first one is failing to recognise what was
 7         happening and this comes back to the videos, to what you
 8         could and could not see.    I have been a football supporter
 9         for many years, I have stood on the terraces, I've sat in
10         the seats.
11              You are probably aware from my statement that I was a
12         director of a security company that sold CCTV equipment, I
13         wouldn't class myself as an expert witness but I certainly
14         was at least average to slightly above average.    It was as
15         plain as a pikestaff what was going on and it was not a
16         pitch invasion and it was totally the wrong response and
17         obviously vital minutes were lost.    I wouldn't like to put
18         a quantum figure on those minutes but vital minutes were
19         lost by the wrong response.. That is unforgivable.
20              The other unforgivable thing is the way that we in
21         particular, and I can only speak for us because obviously
22         we became somewhat insular that afternoon, but the way -we
23         were treated in the immediate aftermath was absolutely
24         appalling.    Even the social workers who were with us, and
25         they were both from Sheffield, have said many times that
26         they could not believe the way people were treated.    I
27         know this is comment.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     It is not comment, it is obviously
29         something which has deeply affected you, and, if I may say
30         so, I entirely understand why.    I think I do have to say
31         that the questions of the way the police treated
32         individual families, and so on, at the time is not
33         something really that I can deal with.
34   MR.   HICKS:   I am making the comment to give an illustration to
35         what we believe was the mind-set, we are back to the
36         controlling corporate body, if you like.    I appreciate


                                       11
 1          it's not hard evidence, that's why I used the term--
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         What you are talking about now is
 3          what happened in the immediate aftermath, the way you were
 4          treated on the day?
 5   MR.    HICKS:     Yes, this is on the day, you know, it's all in the
 6          statements, you may not get time to read them all, I fully
 7          appreciate--
 8
 9
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:I have read a great deal of them.
11   MR.    HICKS:     This is why I    have some sympathy, I made the
12          comment yesterday that you       have been at this a couple of
13          months, we've been at       it 8 years.   Our grasp of the detail
14          is obviously going to be significantly better than yours,
15          totally regardless of accumen or anything else.
16                   So to return to Paul Taylor, if I may, we first met
17          him after the inquest had started, he in fact approached
18          us through his social workers.        Was it through our own
19          social workers?
20   MRS. HICKS:       Liverpool, because we lived in north London at the
21          time.
22   MR.    HICKS:     He himself was having a great difficulty over
23          guilt basically of not attending to Victoria, I will give
24          you the story very briefly.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          I have got the outline of this in
26          your wife's letter.        What I would like to have is the
27          statement.
28   MR.    HICKS:      This: is why I felt it better that we give you a
29          bundle and save you some time, I think.
30   LORD    JUSTICE      STUART-SMITH: What I would like, Mr. Hicks,     I
31          would like the documents that you are referring to.           I
32          would like a summary of the points that you make and
33          references to the bundle of documents where the points are
34          made.      That would be very helpful to me.
35   MR.     HICKS: We will give you that in a couple of days.
36   LORD    JUSTICE      STUART-SMITH: Can I say this, if, when I have


                                           12
 1         looked at them, I need to come back to you I shall do so,
 2         either in writing or I shall come and see you again or ask
 3         you to come and see me.
 4   MR.   HICKS:   I felt that was better because it would save your
 5         time today.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I have got a lot of people to see.
 7   MR.   HICKS:   We are trying to limit this to bullet points.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     If we can get to the bullet points
 9         today that would be helpful.
10   MR.   HICKS:   So we are concerned that Paul Taylor basically -was
11         coerced into holding back what we felt was a key piece of
12         evidence and that is what happened to Victoria in that
13         first few minutes.
14              In the body files there is another reference to
15         possibly Sarah also being taken out through the tunnel to
16         the yard at the back.
17   MRS. HICKS:    It's the first in eight and a half years we've
18         heard of it.
19   MR.   HICKS:   Again, that is something which has come up with
20         the cross-reference through another body file.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Can I just interject here.   I think
22         I have made this point when we met the other day.     There
23         is bound to have been a certain amount of confusion in
24         these cases.    I think I am reasonably clear that in the
25         case of Mr. Roberts, subject to any further development of
26         that point, that the police officer who says that he
27         identified him in the Leppings Lane area and being put in
28         an ambulance, and so on, is probably mistaken.     I may have
29         to take that further but I think that is just an example
30         of how some of these statements are undoubtedly, I think,
31         likely to be confused.
32   MRS. HICKS:     I think with the girls, with respect, there was 7
33         females died at Hillsborough and 2 of them were our
34         daughters.     I think in respect of the young, I mean the
35         majority were males, white males, I would say aged between
36         18 and perhaps mid-thirties, so there could be some


                                       13
 1         confusion there but I don't think there is a lot of room
 2         for confusion when it comes to my daughters because we are
 3         only looking at 7 females, I don't mean only, but there
 4         were 7 females and I don't think there should be as much
 5         confusion with the girls as there would have been with the
 6         youths.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I take that point.
 8   MR.   HICKS:    We will push on.    On the same subject PC Marshall
 9         has been something which has bothered me throughout the 8
10         years.
11              You will accept, sir, I hope, that in the aftermath
12         of Taylor I got quite a grilling and again at the inquest
13         and even I began to doubt my own memory, which you will
14         appreciate--
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I have not taken on board PC
16         Marshall.     Is he the person who said that you behaved very
17         badly to him?
18   MR.   HICKS:    He is, sir, and he's one of the comments where I
19         think that the files have been written in such a way that
20         I find insulting.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Did PC Marshall give evidence at
22         the Taylor Inquiry?
23   MR.   HICKS:    I think he gave evidence at both, I will have to
24         check that.     I don't believe that Marshall did half the
25         things he is claiming.       Two   of which, and we'll cross-
26         refer, it is impossible, he        claims to have carried
27         Victoria out.     He then alters his statement later, and I
28         accept some of my statement will have errors in it, so I'm
29         not trying to claim and have everything dogmatic like I'm
30         sure you are getting from some of the families, I'm trying
31         to talk in the round here.
32              I have no recollection of PC Marshall either on the
33         pitch or in the ambulance.         Now, I do have a very clear
34         recollection of PC McGuinness and,        in fact, I stand by
35         everything I said, he was a model, he helped on the pitch,
36         he helped in the ambulance.


                                         14
1               To give an example, Marshall talks about having the
2          strength of 10 and how he carried Victoria out and put her
3          straight in the ambulance.        She never went on the pitch
4          where we now know that there is documentary evidence.
5    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I have not seen PC Marshall's
 6         statement as far as I am aware.       What is the kernel of the
7          point?
 8   MR.   HICKS:   The kernel is that I don't believe he was involved
 9         with either Sarah or Victoria and the tone in which his
10         first statement was written, and even more so the
11         supplementary statement where he talks about me being very
12         abusive and all the rest of it, I do not accept that he
13         was involved.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I do not know that I will be able
15         to resolve that issue.
16   MR.   HICKS:   Sir, I was making the point in the general context
17         that there are things wrong with the body files, which now
18         we've got our hands on them we are able to tackle in a
19         more scientific way.     We don't have the summaries in our
20         two, I think I mads this comment to you.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      The summaries were given at the
22         mini-inquest.
23   MR.   HICKS:   Yes.
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      We can get them.
25   MR.   HICKS:   We can get at them but--
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Do you not have a copy?
27   MR.   HICKS:   I have got them because we, in fact, got them from
28         an additional as well method because the girls had been
29         involved in Justice Hidden and in the pre-death trauma
30         cases, they were in the bundle there.        We have been
31         pulling together bits of information.
32              The point I was making is that I accepted your
33         comment of what your impressions were but when you
34         actually get in among them, for instance, we now have the
35         Neville Uddall, who was the mortuary attendant who saw to
36         Victoria both in the plaster room.        That is not contained


                                        15
 1         in the body files and we have never heard of his name
2          before.   So the point I am making is that we are still to
 3         this very day not aware of the many of the facts.
 4               I would accept your view is that: okay, that is not
5          part of your inquiry perhaps.     What we are trying to point
 6         out is that we have every right to have known all of these
 7         things and we can see no purpose in us not knowing.      As it
 8         happens Uddall's statement has not got anything
 9         particularly controversial in it, so why not let us have
10         it?
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I think that you have really put
12         your finger on the problem.      I absolutely understand the
13         burning desire of parents to know in the greatest possible
14         detail what happened, who had anything to do with their
15         children and so on.    The West Midlands Police put together
16         these body files, and I have to say that I think in many
17         cases they have taken a great deal of trouble over them.
18         Whether they are foolproof or not is of course an entirely
19         different matter.     I have no doubt that things were
20         omitted, there were mistakes made and so on.
21               Those are matters of obvious regret, if they can be
22         put right in the sense that you now have much more
23         information than you had before because the body files
24         have been disclosed, and I will try and get hold of      the
25         ones in relation to other people who have not seen them,
26         then at least that will be something.      What I do want to
27         do emphasise to you is that it may not make any difference
28         to the inquest verdict.
29   MR.   HICKS:    Sir, I think I accept that.    I think the point I
30         am making, and this is why I am trying to use these as
31         illustrations rather than labouring each individual point,
32         is that you can forgive us when we start to suspect      almost
33         an orchestrated attempt to keep things from us.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Yes, that is perhaps something--
35   MR.   HICKS:    One can give mistakes, one can forgive oversights,
36         particularly under the terrible administrative burden that


                                       16
 1         would have been on at the time, but it is my opinion, and
 2         I think that is really what I am saying and I think Jenny
 3         agrees, that it goes beyond reasonable doubt in terms of
 4         the odd mistake, the odd administrative cock-up, the
 5         duplication or lack of things.
 6   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        That is no doubt something that I
 7         shall to have look at and form a view about.
 8   MR.   HICKS:    In the same light we point out a couple of
 9         specific errors.    It is a matter of accepted fact that the
10         ambulance which contained Victoria didn't leave the ground
11         until 15.37, 3.37, and it's something like 5/7 minutes I
12         believe to the Northern General.        The staff nurse's
13         statement talks of working on Victoria for something like
14         15 to 20 minutes, which again fits totally with my
15         recollection.    Yet we also have certification of death at
16         1600, 4 o'clock.
17   MRS. HICKS:     She actually states 20 to 30 minutes for working
18         on Victoria so the timings are impossible.
19   MR.   HICKS:    Again, one could fob it      off as   an inaccuracy.    I
20         think also we were toldin the very        early days thatthere
21         were no medical record and yet, as you know, Dr. Walker
22         has seen some of Victoria's records, they are not as full
23         as they should be, but we were actually told that there
24         were no medical records on Victoria.
25   MRS. HICKS:     It was categorically stated at the mini-inquest.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Have I seen those?      I have seen
27         some medical records.
28   MR.   BONE:    We have seen some medical records.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I think not on Victoria.
30   MR.   BONE:    We have seen Lee    Nichol.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        And have seen Philip Hammond, I
32         think.
33   MR.   BONE:    Yes.
34   MR.   HICKS:    Again, sir, we would accept that at a time like
35         that it is far more important to treat the patients than
36         it is to stand and write the notes.         But there is an


                                          17
 1         obligation to at least have something but we were
2          categorically told, and we will find a reference to it--
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Have you seen them now?
 4   MR.   HICKS: I haven't had     time yet.      No, in fact they wouldn't
 5         let Ann Adlington, she went across to the hospital with
 6         Dr. Walker the other week, you'd given her a letter of
 7         authority to see Victoria's notes, but she wasn't allowed
 8         in.   They allowed Dr. Walker to see--
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Was Dr. Walker one of the people
10         who treated Victoria?
11   MR.   HICKS: Yes, he was.We are not sure whether he actually
12         treated Victoria or not.     He didn't,    sorry.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I certainly said that Dr. Walker
14         could see the notes in relation to the patients that he
15         treated.     That is what I said.      I regard Dr. Walker as a
16         witness of fact as to what he did, I do not think that it
17         is helpful to have his comments on the notes in relation
18         to people other than those he treated.
19   MRS. HICKS:      We were told there weren't any, that was our
20         point, that there weren't.         Actually Dr. Popper went into
21         great detail with Dr. Denmark, the pathologist, to find
22         out if Victoria had any burn marks on her chest, what were
23         the two needle marks in her arms, and into great, great
24         detail     because he said Dr. Denmark had to make all the
25         points     on that because there were no medical records on
26         Victoria at all.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I will look and see what medical
28         records there are.
29   MRS. HICKS:       Yet I've got a nurse here in a statement, which I
30         haven't seen for eight      and a half years, stating the
31         treatment that Victoria received.         Yet Dr. Popper,
32         obviously that nurse was there at the time, Dr. Popper
33         went into great detail with the pathologist asking him to
34         stress what the marks on her body and signs of
35         resuscitation and things as there weren't any medical
36         records, which we found very distressing, didn't we?


                                         18
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Can we leave this point on the
2          basis that I will make a point of looking at the medical
 3         records and seeing whether they--
 4   MR.   HICKS:   The other point we wanted to make, sir, is that I
 5         believe under those circumstances one of the bones of
 6         contention was always that I have a recollection of the
 7         ambulance man, who we now know to be Tony Edwards, and
 8         myself feeling a pulse on Victoria in the ambulance and
 9         for them to work 15 to 20 minutes or 20 minutes to 30
10         minutes as the staff nurse claims then they must have felt
11         that Victoria was redeemable, if you like.     It may well
12         have that because she was young and she was female.       Our
13         suggestion is there may have been an element of it not
14         being quite as far as gone as was said, which would fit in
15         with my recollection far better than what was actually
16         stated in the inquest.
17              That is another critical issue.     Our bone of
18         contention again comes back to this definition of crush
19         asphyxia and traumatic asphyxia.     I have found in my files
20         when we have been going back the report by Dr. -Russia, VJsVve
21         this is the one which was withdrawn and re-claimed by the
22         South Yorkshire Police but we kept a copy, which again I
23         will put in the bundle, sir, I don't know whether you have
24         seen it.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I am sure I have seen a report by
26
27   MR.   HICKS:     You may not have seen this particular version.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:: I have I think, I recollect reading
29         a report which was said to have been withdrawn.        Can I
30         just make a point on this traumatic and crush asphyxia.         I
31         know that some people draw a distinction between the two
32         but I think it is rather more a semantic distinction.
33              Trauma means injury and in that sense the asphyxia
34         which they suffered was undoubtedly traumatic in the sense
35         that it was not self-inflicted, it was not anything of
36         that sort, it was caused by outside forces over which the


                                        19
 1          victim had no control.     Whether you call that traumatic
2           asphyxia, which is I think the generalised term, or
3           whether you call it the more specific type of crush
4           asphyxia I think does not really alter the position.
5                  The Coroner was well aware of this distinction
 6          between the two.      I have read a passage only the other day
 7          where he deals with this     point and I know Dr. West draws a
 8          distinction about     it and I think you have drawn a
 9          distinction about     it and other people do, but I have to
10          say that my own feeling is that this is probably a matter
11          of terminology and that traumatic asphyxia in the language
12          of many of the pathologists includes crush asphyxia.
13   MR.    HICKS:    I wouldn't dispute that, sir.   I think where I
14          would come away from it is that we believe that there is a
15          difference in terms of this 5 seconds to unconsciousness.
16          The reason we declared an interest in terms of not wishing
17          to re-run the pre-death trauma cases or anything like that
18          was that that would be an argument if we tried to put
19          forward that there is evidence and it was put to Taylor
20          and was put to the inquest and in fact was very badly put
21          by Ben Hytner to Mr. Justice Hidden of Sarah holding
22          Victoria up and, again, be it crush or be it traumatic
23          asphyxia literally the best description, as I said .to you
24          before, is being trapped in a lift-shaft and the lift
25          falling on you where literally you are crushed
26          immediately.
27   LORD    JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:   That is a very extreme example.
28   MR.     HICKS: Exactly, but I think it illustrates this.       I see
29          it â€”     I'm not really bothered whether you call it crush
30          asphyxia, in the case of Sarah and Vicky the results was
31          the same.
32   MRS.    HICKS: In a crush, apparently,    can come and go.
33   MR.     HICKS: Again, sir, if you have been on the terrace and if
34          you have been in the circumstance, and it is my belief,
35          with what I was seeing on the day, is it was not a one-off
36          hit, the lift example, and there would be a degree of


                                         20
 1         pressure on, pressure off, crowd moving about and I
 2         believe the statement of the boys who didn't know Sarah
 3         and Victoria, except possibly visually and obviously only
 4         got to recognise them from the press coverage afterwards.
 5         They don't have a reason to seek publicity, they have not
 6         sought it, we have had to seek them out where we have
 7         spoken to them--
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    I think the problem is that
 9         although there undoubtedly was pressure on, pressure off,
10         and, as I understand it, it not infrequently happens in
11         football crowds and the thing relieves itself and nobody
12         is really any the worse.   What was happening here was that
13         you were getting the crush and not much relief and in the
14         worst cases no relief, people were being crushed against
15         barriers, against the fence, some people fell to the
16         ground and were either trampled on or crushed under bodies
17         and so on.   In those cases the duration of the crush was
18         too long for them to survive.
19   MR.   HICKS:   Yes, we accept that when we reach the point of no
20         return, if you like, that there was an element of that.
21         The concern that we have is where are we on that scale.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    I follow that, I understand that.
23   MR.   HICKS:   So again we make that point.   Again, Paul Taylor,
24         the reason why we knew Paul Taylor was telling the truth,
25         or we believe he was telling the truth is he gave us an
26         almost perfect description of Victoria, which he wouldnâ€™t
27         necessarily have got from the press coverage.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I will read through Mr. Taylor's
29         statement and if need be I will see him.
30   MR.   HICKS:   A couple of other things which I would like to,,
31         again I will put these in the bundle,   sir, I don't have
32         copies, I have retrieved these from my own files over the
33         last couple of days.    I did in fact write to Dr. Popper on
34         24th August 1990 registering our formal concern as a group
35         with the proceedings laying open, I won't read all of it,
36         I will pick out a couple of key points.    Some families


                                      21
 1         have openly expressed their reservation regarding the
 2         accuracy of the summary, I think you have heard this
 3         before, and the degree to which it reflected the fuller
 4         evidence fairly and accurately.
 5              I will put this in the bundle, you can have a full
 6         copy including Dr. Popper's reply which was basically
 7         dismissive and told us to talk to our lawyers.      But by
 8         then we had gone too far. These are exhibits to add to our
 9         position and not necessarily hard evidence as such.
10              The other one I would like to draw attention to, and
11         this again comes from my discussions with yourself, I have
12         now got the copy from Peter Robinson, who is the Chief
13         Executive of Liverpool     Football Club, of his statement,
14         which again the police     were reluctant to give us but Mr.
15         Robinson's given it, I know him very well.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       What bearing does that have?
17   MR.   HICKS:     The final paragraph,   "Finally, I observed the
18         location of the closed circuit television cameras which
19         should have enabled police officers to observe closely the
20         packing of that area and any discomfort which spectators
21         might experience."
22              The point for wishing to put that in, and I am not
23         sure whether you had it or not, is that Peter Robinson has
24         been in football for many years, he makes that comment
25         earlier in the statement, he's an expert witness in my
26         view in the rights and wrongs of the shapes and formats of
27         football grounds.      Again, I will put that in the bundle.
28                  The other comments I think can all be made â€”     I don't
29         think I have anything to say.       Is there anything you want
30         to say?
31   MRS. HICKS:       Particularly on the girls' case mine is just a
32         general comment.      My comment is, why this verdict can't
33         stand in my opinion is that the police let those extra
34         2,000 people into that ground without checking that there
35         was adequate facilities in space for them to go to.          They
36         didn't direct them to the places at the sides where there


                                        22
 1         was adequate space.    They should have closed the tunnel
2          gates so that people went to the sides.
3    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     This is the crux of case.
4    MRS. HICKS:     I think this is the crux of matter, you can go
5          into all the bits and bobs but at the end of the day, and
 6         I think that's how Dr. Popper should have summed it up,
 7         it's quite simply as simple as that, they did not check
 8         that there were adequate facilities to take those people
 9         and to me that is where they are guilty of not accidental
10         death but something more.
11   MR.   BONE:    Lord Taylor says that.
12   MRS. HICKS:    Yes, and I totally agree with him and I can't
13         understand how an inquest followed on from such an eminent
14         person as Lord Taylor, he went on to be the Lord Chief
15         Justice, a very well respected man and yet an inquest was
16         not allowed â€”    his findings were not allowed at our
17         inquest and I just think you made an excellent point
18         yesterday when you said that in cases like this, in major
19         disasters it should be not run by the coroner but by a
20         High Court Judge as Taylor or as yourself and then
21         whatever you got from there would be more reliable.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     That happens to be my personal
23         view.
24   MRS. HICKS:     It's my personal view too, I hope this Government
25         do something about bringing that in.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I believe there is some inquiry
27         about it.
28   MR.   HICKS:    There is a working party.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Who has set that up?
30   MR.   HICKS:    By the Home Office and effectively the
31         recommendations of that working part is that effectively
32         the Attorney-General would give the coroner a certificate
33         which would allow him to hand his responsibilities to the
34         judiciary carrying out the inquiry.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I might add a bit of weight to
36         that.


                                       23
 1   MRS. HICKS:      I would ask you if you would do that.
2    MR.   HICKS:     We appreciate that one of the difficulties in this
 3         case is the cororf^al system, the gap between accidental
 4         death and unlawful killing is far too wide and in fact the
 5         group will be making recommendations on the working party
 6         which I think will ultimately become law and should do so.
 7
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I have read Mr. Scraton's book
 9         about this, he makes this point very firmly.
10   MR.   HICKS:     The problem is that as we've seen, and we believe
11         it's the final draft of the working document, is that
12         there is still a problem with the range of verdicts.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       We might perhaps try and get hold
14         of that.     This is entirely off the record, but I have felt
15         quite strongly about this for some time now.       It seems to
16         me to be quite possible to have the same ground covered by
17         two inquiries, one by a very high powered judge or, at any
18         rate, a very experienced judge and one by a coroner who
19         may have done nothing more complicated than traffic
20         accident cases and people dying in hospital.
21              That is not to say that the criticisms of      the Coroner
22         in this    case are necessarily made out, I think he had a
23         very difficult task.       He may have done his best, he may
24         not have done his best, I do not know, but that, I think,
25         is in many ways the crux of the problem and we have this,
26         as I tried to point out yesterday, we have different sorts
27         of legal proceedings with limited objectives, the broadest
28         inquiry was Lord Taylor's undoubtedly.       The inquest,
29         although it took such an inordinate time, and having read
30         some of it I can understand it because the same questions
31         seem to be asked time and time again.
32   MR.   HICKS:      That, sir, is one of our comments.
33   LORD JUSTICE     STUART-SMITH:    There it is, it took a very, very-
34         long time and, no doubt, you think a lot of evidence which
35         was irrelevant was given, I'm sure that is probably right,
36         but that has a very limited scope, as you very well know.


                                         24
1               Then the question of prosecution is again an entirely
2          different question from that of civil liability.           The
3          question of civil liability is complicated by the fact
4          that there can be contribution proceedings between various
5          potential defendants, each one of those defendants beiag
 6         one hundred per cent liable to the plaintiff.            I am not
 7         sure that that is appreciated.
 8              If you had chosen to sue the Club alone and they were
 9         held to be negligent you would recover one hundred per
10         cent damages from the Club.         They might then have sought
11         contributions from other people concerned.         That is a
12         concept which I think lay people find quite difficult to
13         understand.       Then of course, finally, there are the Police
14         Complaints Authority problems.
15   MR.   HICKS:    Sir, I give up.     We felt we had a particularly
16         good case.       As I said, I believe we had the good grace to
17         accept informal resolution where it was appropriate and we
18         stuck to our guns where we felt it wasn't.         Then, if you
19         like, for them to be allowed to retire, and again I've
20         made this comment openly and I have said it--
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I understand--
22   MR.   HICKS:    It is appalling that the Chief Constable, he gave
23         me his word on the telephone.         In fact, for the
24         stenographers, I will tell you that I telephoned him when
25         the announcement was made by Murray.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        This is the point you made?
27   MR.   HICKS:    Yes, I will elaborate on it.       I told him he was a
28         "lying bastard" on the telephone and I probably would
29         never speak to him again.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Which one is this?
31   MR.   HICKS:    This is Richard Wells.
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        The present one?
33   MR.   HICKS:    Yes.     Again, sir, we met him in the early days,
34         he'd moved from London, where he came from at the time.
35         His wife's friend knew Victoria through the haberdasher
36         school.


                                          25
 1   MRS. HICKS:     A friend of his wife's went to--
 2   MR.    HICKS:   We had great hopes that when he arrived as Mr.
 3          Clean, if you like, that he would get among it and sort it
 4          properly and he very quickly fell in line with everybody
 5          else.
 6               There was one document I did forget to mention,       I
 7          know again we're pressed for time.     This   is an
 8          illustration of what I believe to be the bias of Popper.
 9          It was a letter he wrote back to Hill Dickenson Davis
10          Campbell on 5th December, 199--
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Who were they?
12   MR.    HICKS:   They were, you may have heard reference to a Peter
13          Jackson, who was a solicitor who represented very briefly
14          the football supporters.     Effectively he wanted a letter
15          put before the jury on the grounds that the supporters
16          couldn't afford to be represented at the inquest, the same
17          as the families gad great difficulties funding our one
18          barrister.   Popper basically wrote back:     "It is not my
19          intention to place the letter which you have sent me
20          before the jurors.    It is my clear understanding that a
21          publication of your letter in the media would constitute a
22          serious contempt."    Then he goes on to quote the case.       I
23          will give you copies of this.     We believe this was a
24          reasonable attempt to place certain matters before the
25          jury and again â€”     it's a four page letter and there's a
26          load of supplementary stuff.      Again, I would like to
27          include that in our bundle as an evidence of where we
28          considered that Popper was out to re-write Taylor and
29          whitewash he job.
30   MRS.   HICKS: Which to me is unforgivable.
31   MR.    HICKS: I will say, sir, he was extremely caring
32          throughout the proceedings and as---
33   MRS.   HICKS: I would have preferred him to have been horrible
34          and done the job properly.
35   MR.    HICKS: The other comment I have already made is       that I
36          have now read most of Mr. Phillips' report, which I


                                         26
1            understand you have a copy of, and I just think it's
2            disgraceful.
3      LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I think I have already said to you
4            that I am not re-opening what happened outside and I think
5            that is very important.       I may have submissions from the
 6           police that I should do so, I do not think they are likely
 7           to get very far because to my mind that issue has been
 8           decided.    As I said to you yesterday, I do not regard as
 9           fresh evidence simply something which supports a
10           contentious side which has been put in evidence before.
11           In other words, I am not interested in more police
12           officers saying there were more drunken fans, nor am I
13           interested in more supporters saying: we were all like a
14           Sunday School outing.
15 '              That issue is not going to be re-opened, it will.not
16           do not any good at all.       This is why I am actually so
17           cross that my silly remark has have been put out of all
18           proportion.     Tha:nk you very much indeed.   I will look
19           forward to having your further written submissions.
20     MRS. HICKS:      Just one last final question.    You are going to
21           look at this issue, aren't you, of what the police were
22           aware of, the state of those pens.
23     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: Of course
24     MRS. HICKS: Before those before 2,000 and the lack of
25          precaution.
26     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        The question that I am looking at
27           is this question of the video evidence, that is I think
28           probably the most important aspect of the Scrutiny.
29     MR.   HICKS:     Central to us all.
30     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I am going to look at that.
31     MRS. HICKS:      It's crucial.
32     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Thank you very much for coming.
33     MR.   HICKS:     Sir, on the back of the remarks yesterday
34           obviously we will be formally putting a letter in, but the
35           main issue there is what we see as a problem with your
36           terms of reference.        It is no disrespect to yourself but


                                             27
1         we see a major stumbling block with the Divisional Court,
2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    I think that may be so.
3   MR.   HICKS:   I don't expect a comment, it is just to give you
4         the courtesy of telling you.

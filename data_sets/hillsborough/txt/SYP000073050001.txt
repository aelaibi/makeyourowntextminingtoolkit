                                                                                                                 S1731

One    of the s u pp or te rs             told me that           it was     not      possible      to get        into the

ground.         I looked         round a n d saw a large                 crowd standing            o ut s id e    the

L e p p i n g s Lane      e n t r an ce    covering most of the                 road.       T here w er e        now large

n um bers     of supp or te rs w a l k i n g             past me to the L ep p in g s Lane                entrance,

a n d at     the same time,               m ore and more         s u p p or t er s     were     coming     back, past

me,    to    stand on the bridge.                     I saw a crowd of about                 one h un d re d

s t a n d in g on the bridge,               some of them were               the s u pp or te rs         that     had been

to the ground e n t r an ce a n d had then w a l k e d                        back,      I then saw a few

p o l i c e m e n on h o r s e b a c k     push this        crowd back          towards the L e p p i n g s Lane

entrance.           T here were a lso               police on foot.              This     h a p p e ne d a few

times       b etwen 2 . 2 0 p m     (1420)          and a bout 2. 4 5        (1445).

At a b ou t 2. 3 0 p m        (1430)       I n ot ic ed that         the numbers           of s up po r te r s

walking        to the g ro un d w ere             i nc re as in g    rapidly.           I thought        that     either

the    coaches       or the trains              had      just arrived.               I was very busy a nd

d idn't      take m uch notice at the crowd                       problem.              At a bout 2.4 5          pm one

of the s u p po rt er s who was w al k i n g                 back from the entr an ce                   to the bridge

told me that           the gates had been o pe n ed a nd that                         e v e r yb o dy    was     going

into     the ground.             A short          time      later I pack ed up my               items a n d      went

back     to my van.

While       I was    sta nd in g      in L e p p in g s Lane          I saw that most             of the fans were

happy,       some of them had been d ri nk in g                      but     I only saw one or two

s u p p o r t e r s who     I would        de sc r ib e as being           drunk,      most     of them w he re

singing.          I did not see a ny s u p p or t er s                 f i gh ti ng    or being too

disorderly.            As    I was        st an di n g    near    to my van a s u pp or te r             came out of

the g ro un d and told me                  that    the m a t c h had been a bandoned.                     I s w i t c he d

the    radio on in the van a n d h ea rd that                          the m a t c h had been a b an do ne d,

then two of my friends,                     who    don't want          to be seen,           came out of the

ground,        both were         crying and very upset,                    they told me that              e v e r y on e   is

getting        crushed,        there are          people dead          in there,         a nd that d ea d bodys

are    being      carried.          I then h eard on the                 radio that          people had died at

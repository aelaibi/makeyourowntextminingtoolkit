HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY COSTS

Thank you for your note of 16 August enquiring whether we are
likely to bear any part of the salary etc costs of the Inquiry
Assessors.

2.   Neither Assessor has so far indicated to us that he will be
expecting the Home Office to defrayKis salary costs. But in the
pressure of time during the first part of the Inquiry, I was not
able to discuss the matter properly with either Assessor.  I will
try to do so at the first convenient opportunity, but I do not
know when this will be. For the present, it seems prudent for
you to maintain the provision which you have currently made.

    HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY:   COSTS

    I should be grateful for your advifi.e about whether we are likely
    to bear any part of the salary etc costs of the inquiries
    assessors.

    As you will recognise, the information is needed to allow us to
    estimate future spending levels (which, as you know, is being
    found from other parts of the Home Office).
                                        /

              I am a S e r g ea nt             in the S ou t h Y o r k s h i r e Pol i c e F orce at            present

              Hill,    Sheffield.

              On Saturday,             15 April         1989,     I p e r f o r m e d duty at the Football

              A s so c i a t i o n Cup S e m i - Fi na l        m a t ch b e t w e e n Liverpool        and Nottingham

              Forest at           the H i l l s b o r o u g h Football         Stadium,         Sheffield.

              1' paraded for duty at 0 9 3 0 that                         day at the Driv i n g School,               B r ightside

             Lane,     S heffield,              from where,        together       w i t h other       officers,        1' made my

             way to H i l l s b o r o u g h           by Po lice     transport.

             At    1000 that           day      I a t t en de d the b r i efing           given by Chief

             S u p e r i nt en de nt        D u c k e n f i e 1d and other       o f f icers     in the N o r t h Stand.

              1 was    part        of S u b - S e c t i o n 2 0 w h i c h     con s i s t e d of three m a r k e d Transit

             vans     containing               u n if or me d officers.          One      of these mobile          patrols was

             Serial         51,    call        sign    'Tango Six*         of w h i c h    I was     in charge.            The

             serial         co n s i s t e d    of five      constables.

             Our w ri tt en          i ns t r u c t i o n s were     to    patrol      the G r e n o s i d e area,         paying

             special         attention           to    licensed      premises.            My   immediate      supervisory

             officer was             Inspector Robinson.

             After     the mai n            b r i efing    I c o llected a personal                radio,    meal     tickets          ,
                                                              "                 '                                   PAGE

etc and' had a brief                   c o n v e rs at io n w i t h     Inspector R o b i n s o n as to our

e x p ec te d duties           before       leaving H i l l s b o r o u g h         to patrol        in the

G r e n o si de area.

From approximately                 1100 to          1445 hours we             paid passing a t t e n t i o n to

public      houses        in the G r e n o s i d e area.                It is fair          to say that           there

was    very        little      evide n c e       of Li v e r p o o l    supp o r t e r s    d r i nking     in that

are a and the whole                period         passed with o u t           incident.

It    is perhaps          p e r tinent       to note that              personal       radio     communi c a t i o n s

from the gr o u n d were                often broken and                it was       obvious     that

c o nv er sa t i o n s were        being m i s se d as a               result a l t h o u g h    I           no

ne c e s s i t y    to   contact         G r o u nd Control            during       the    period and tomy

k no w! e d g e     they never           attempted          to    contact me.

At about           1445 hours we            drove      down Foxhill            R o a d and     parked       near to

Wads 1ey Bridge             R a i l w a y S ta ti on w i t h the             intention of         remaining         there

before      going        to C l a yw he el s Lane           for meal          at    1515.

Al m os t    i m me di at el y     I     heard S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Marshall as k i n g              for    a gate

to    be opened at L e p p i n g s Lane                  end of the ground.                  T here a p p e a r e d to

be some        c o n fu si on from Gr o u n d Control                   as    to w h i c h gate       should be

opened and the              i nc re a s e d urge n c y of the t r a n s m i s s i o n s              gave    the

impr e s s i o n     that      there was. a crowd                problem outside             the L e p p i n g s Lane
                                             V

turnstiles.

I    i n structed the           driver       of my transit              (PC 2609 Morgan)              to    proceed to

the Leppi n g s          Lane a rea        to see        if we     could be of any a ssistance.                       We

were     not d i r ec te d       by radio           to a t t e n d the ground.

On arrival           the a rea was           still       very     con g e s t e d with Liverpool

suppo r t e r s      and having           parked on L e p p i n g s Lane              I got     out    of the van to

walk     towards         the    turnstiles.             From      rec o l l e c t i o n this w o u l d       be about

1455 hours.

On arrival           it a p p e a r e d that         the    problem          heard over the           radio       had been

resolved and there                 se e m e d to be s u f f i c i e n t            officers     in the are a Xo_
cope w i t h those            s up p o r t e r s     still       mill i n g    ar o u n d    so after a few minutes

I instr u c t e d my serial                   to    return to the van and we                     then      left the area.

I told PC M o rg an             to go to C la y w h e e l s Lane where                       I intended         to allow

m y serial to start their m e a l ti me at 1515 hours.             The m a t c h had
            fe--
               i
o b v i ou sl y c om me n c e d and this course of a c t i o n complied w i t h our

written         i ns tr u c t i o n s    regarding m e a l i n g a r r a ngements.

Almost      i m m e di at el y on our arrival                     at C l a y w h e e l s Lane        I heard a radio

t r a n s m i s s i o n asking          all    a va il a b l e    personnel         to go s t r aight away to

the ground.             We    resumed          im m e d i a t e l y and       returned to L e p p i n g s Lane,

parked near            the    river       bridge a n d           I walked        towards        the ~t~gggfis t i 1 e

area.      As      I approached               the area       I saw about            12 people          laid out on the

tarmac      roadway w h i ch             leads from L e p p i n g s            Lane     round the          back     of the

S ou t h S ta n d and mai n              entrance        of the         ground.        They were           laid near          the

railings w h i c h form a b o u ndary to the                             river.         It was       immediately

a p p a re nt    that     they were            dead.        Some     police       officers         were a l r e a d y

being     used as a           cordon          to protect          the    bodies.            I got my serial             to

assist      in form i n g a human barrier                         b e t w e e n L i verpool        fans and the dead

bodies.          There was a lot of verbal                          abuse      being        d i r e c t e d towards      us

by some Liv e r p o o l           supporters.               At the same           time some          injured fans

were    being        brought        out from the             ground and           it was        d e c i d e d to    place

them on the            opposite          side       of the       roadway       to the dead bodies.

I c o nsidered the              p ro t e c t i o n of the           dead bodies             to be of       paramount

importance and               c o- or di n a t i o n of those             injured was            being     supervised           by

Inspector Sykes               an d other            officers.           D oc t o r s were       tend i n g most         of the

injured and s ho r t l y a f t e r wa rd s                  about 3 a m b u l a n c e s a r r i v e d         in quick

succession.

The    nature        of the       roadway           is such that          there       is only        room for one

vehicle at a time                t r a v e ll in g     nose       to tail       and as each a m b u l a n c e

s to p p e d the       rear     doors were            being       opened       by fans and their                friends

and    relatives were              being           placed    in that amb u l a n c e            irr e s p e c t i v e   of______
 their medical                 condition.         V ain a t t e m p t s     were      being made          by some

 of f i c e r s     to    rationalise          the    use of each ambulance.

 X recall a doctor who was rendering first aid complaining that as an
              jil
 a m b u la n c e a r r i v e d an d sto p p e d on the roadway the nearest casualty to

 the    rear doors was                 being    placed       in the        vheicle       either      by    relatives/

 freinds          or by police           officers w it ho ut           concern for            the    injuries       of

 that     ca sualty            c o m p a re d with others          waiting         to be     conveyed to

 hospital.               I n spector Sykes           was    doing    his     best      to    p r ioritise     the

 casualties              but    beca u s e    of the       narrow    roadway          it was almost          impossible

 to achi e v e           success,

 A number           of other         constab les          had by now a r r i v e d at the             scene and the

 cordon           was     o b vi ou sl y a d e q u a t e    to   protect the          bodies.

-vi- left         the     cordon a n d found PC M o r g a n and                   inst r u c t e d him to fetch          the

 Transit          van to the           track a rea at the            rear        of the L e p p i n g s Lane

 t ur n s t i l e s      with    the    i n tention of using               the vehicle         to t r a nsport       some

 of the       injured           to hospital          as    it seemed        there were          insufficient

 ambulances              to    cater    for    the    casualties.

 By the time PC M o r g a n                  returned to me w i t h our Transit                      van other

 ambulances              had a r r i v e d and       it became       obvious          that my original

 i n tenti on of t r a n s po rt in g             c a sualties       had         been s u p e r s e d e d by events.

 As    the        a m b ul an ce s     cleared       in f;ront of us all              the    injured had been

 r emoved to hospital                   leaving       only the       dead bodies             still    g u a r d e d by the

 c ordon of           police      officers.           I e s t im at ed      there were         between       12-1S

 bodies       a lt h o u g h     I never a c tu al ly            counted them.

 Rather       than atte m p t a difficult                    reversing m an o e u v r e          1' instr u c t e d PC

 round the            block      to get       back    to L e p p i n g s    Lane.       At    this   time     there

 was just           the       two of    us    in the vehicle,              the     rest of the        serial

Fr om there we          r e t urned to L e p p i n g s Lane where                 I was       rejoined        by those

of my serial           who    had not got           involved         in other       duties.          We then

they were m a in ly o r de rl y an d o b v i o u s l y subd u e d by the events                              of the

day.     As they        clea r e d        the area       I got PC M o r g a n to take             tHfc t o

C l a yw he el s Lane        to a l l o w the officers               on my serial            to w a s h and

â€¢freshen t h e m s el ve s          up.

On arrival         I was met          by S up er i n t e n d e n t     B r o u g h a m who    invited us          to

have a hot        drink and sit and talk                     to a number          of    police       offic e r s who

I recog n i s e d were          from the B a rn sl ey area.                  He   informed rne that               they

had been on duty              inside        the   ground on the             perimeter         track    near       the

railings where            it se e m e d most            of the Liv e r p o o l      s u pporters       had died.

They were        o b v i o u sl y    d i s tr es se d and      he a s k e d rne to sit w i t h them and

just    listen to their a c c o u n t s                 of the    events       leading        up to the          tragedy.

I remained at C l a y w h e e l s            Lane       for about 20 minutes                 doing    this       before

re-com m e n c i n g    a m o b i le       patrol       in the area.           Traffic was           still       very-

co ngested an d         I found that we were                  being       stopped by police                officers

on foot who         had off          duty doctors and             nurses wit h them who were                      trying

to get    to the N o r t h e r n General                 H o s pital    in answer        to a request             for

their a tt en d a n c e       w hi ch had been b r oadcast                 over    local       radio.        We

es c o r t e d several        of them to the              hospital        if they had their                own    cars

or took      them      in the        back    of the transit             if they were           on foot.

We   remained on general                  mobile        patrol    in the a rea until             about       '1845

hours.      By this          time     traffic was           light and there were                few supporters

left   in the       v i c i ni ty     of the ground.

           I returned to C la yw h e e l s             Lane     from where my serial was                    stood    down.

           I booked off duty at the Driving School,                                  B r i g h t s i d e Lane at    1900 hours.

           In conclusion,               1 feel    it nec e s s a r y       to    r e â€” i ter ate   that    prior    to the

           match      I Viad not w i t n e s s e d any          public          order   incidents         involving

           s upporters           from either       team but f o l l o w i n g my arrival                  at the L e p pings

           Lane     roadway a r e a at about              1303 hours             to form the         cordon of      police

           officers        s u r r ou nd in g    the   bodies      I was         s u bj ec te d to more         verbal   abuse

           from L i verpool             s u p p o rt er s who were         o b vi ou s l y   the worse      for    drink than

            I have     ever w i t n e s s e d     in 26 years              police    service.

            I think        it    is fair      to say that         if the         c i r c umstances       had been

            different           n u m erous   a rr e s t s w ou l d have         been made         but   I am    c o nvinced

            that     sufih a c t i o n w ou ld have           inf l a m m e d an a l r e a d y difficult           and

            distre s s i n g      s i t u at io n an d w ou l d only have               been counter        productive.

            For     that    reason and for             that    reason only those               involved were          politely

            but     firmly       told    to move away          from the area.

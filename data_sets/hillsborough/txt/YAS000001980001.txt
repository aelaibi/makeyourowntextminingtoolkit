                            born 23.12.60 am 28 years old.     I am
an ambulance woman working for SYM A S .          I am based at
Middlewood.        I have been with SYMAS nearly 4 years.


I usually work at day shift 0800 to 1630 hours but on
Saturday 15th April 1989 I was on leave.


At about 1510 hours I was listening to the radio when I
heard that there was some trouble at Hillsborough.          To find
out more I turned the television set on to see that there
was some Incident taking place.


I watched      for a while and soon realised that It was
something serious and thought I had better contact control
to see If I could help.        I tried several times by telephone
but could not get through so I made up my mind to report In
anyway so I went to Middlewood I arrived at Middlewood at
about 1615 hours.


As I arrived at Middlewood I joined ____________        [   She had
already Informed control that she was there, she also told
control I had arrived.       We were quickly joined by two others
             and


We were told by control to standby which we did.        Very soon
afterwards           and         were sent out with an ambulance.
They received their Instructions by telephone.
At about 1645 hours                and I were contacted by
Rotherham Control and Instructed to attend a casualty on
Parkside Road.        We attended and took the casualty to
Northern General hospital.     The patient was attended to by
            and I drove the ambulance.       The patient was
accompanied by two of his friends.     We handed him over to
the hospital staff.


Peter then contacted control by radio and we went "green".
Control told us to return to base,        which we did.     We
remained on standby until we were directed by control to
attend a lady who had fallen at           ~| Social Care Home.
We attended and took the patient to the Hallamshlre
hospital, at the direction of control.     We radioed "green"
again by radio and were told by control to return to base.
It was by now early evening.


I think it would be about 1930 hours when we were told by
control to make a transfer of a patient from Northern
General to the Hallamshire for a scan.       We completed the
transfer without difficulty, and again returned to base.


It would be just before 2100 hours when             contacted
control.   He was on days and had to be back at 0600 the
following morning.     He pointed this out to control and he
was told to stand down.   This meant I was also stood down so
          I signed off and went home.



    11.   Traffic was very heavy on the first trip and we had to use
          the blue light to progress quickly to the hospital, as we
          did not have an escort.   The second trip was normal.




    Dated the            day of                       1989

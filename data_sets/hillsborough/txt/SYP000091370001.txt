               I a t te n de d the game as a supporter                  of \ ^ v e r p o o l   Football      Club.

               I got my ticket             for    the game from Liverpool              F.C.     using my season

friends     of both rnV brothers




                  , I don't know where                         lives.

We    left L iverpool          early on the morning              of S at u r d a y    13th April    1989

(150489)     to travel          to Sheffield.          I can't         remember w hich         route we took

but we t ra ve ll ed on motorways,                 we did get delayed because we mi ss ed

our    turning        off    the m ot o r w a y and got        lost.

We a rr iv e d    in S h e f f i e l d about 2 . 0 0      pm    (1400)    and    parked the van by a

School     w hich was about            twenty minutes walk away from the ground.

We never     received any escort                 or d irections         from the Police         to the

ground but we knew w hich way vDygo and just walked along wit h the


crowdB-                                o o w -    a M h
We stop pe d o ff at a pub on the uay^to                        ,.he ground and had a couple of

pints,     the    pub was       full    of other L i v e r p o o l supporters who were having

a drink.         We    left    the    pub at about S . 35 pm            (1435)       and went    to the

ground,     w hen we         left the    pub mo<j>t ot'ijTe supporters were also                    leaving

to go to the ground.

Du ri ng   our walk          to the ground        I never      saw a n \ sort         of disorder    or

fighting     1    never       saw anyone who a p p e a r e d to be oK^unk.

We a r r i v e d at the           ppi ngs Lane      entrance        to the groEHidf \at about S . 45

pm    (1445),     we all       had t'lsckets for       the terraces            except                      who

had a ticket           for    the seats.

W hen we a r r i ve d outside           the Lappings Lane              entrance       to the ground       it

was    chaotic        there were       no queuesSjj^st a mass             of    p e o p l e stretching     back

into the area of the                 road.

We j oined       into this mass          of people        to try and get             towards    the terrace

turnstiles.

Once we got           into the       crowd   I c o u l d n ’t see anything,

                       1 couldn't say if there were any Police                          or Stewards
                                                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                                                      S3563

             jtrying to organise          the    crowd.

             In a mongst       the    crowd    leading       up to the turnstiles           people were           being

             c rushed a nd there was a lot of sideways m ov ement w hich made                                it

             d ifficult       to keep on your feet without                   grabbing     hold of     people

             ar o un d to s teady yourself.

             E v e n t u a l l y by a time     I woud guess          to be about S. 57        pm <1457)          or S . 58

             pm   <1458)      we found ourselves about                five    feet away from the turnstile

             s it u at e d on the extreme         right hand side of the terrace                     turnstile          block

             as you look at the turnstiles                       from L ep pings Lane.       There was a

             pol i ceman s tanding        by us on          tiT&xother side       of   a blue      barrier (hand

             there was a gate           open ar qu nd the           right    hand side     of the turnstiles

             and at about 2.5 9 pm (1459)                   I entered the ground through the turftstile

             handing my ticket           into the turnstile               operator.

             As   I got    into the      courtyard area (Sf the ground side                       of the turnstiles

             I looked to my right              hand side and          I saw a P o l i c e m a n    closing a large

 I. believe when we first                    got onto the terraces               that the game was about

 to kick off,            but    I can't be sure because                   1 couldn't      see anything         of

 the   pitch.                                                         \

 H aving        got onto       the    terraces and got             into    p e n ’\number four we tried to

work        our way over         towards       the N orth West Upper               teKrace      we only m oved

a few feet and found that we                         could not irjove any furthXjf.J              I can

 only estimate            thaiXthe         time when we found oitr selves                 in this    position

w ould have          b e e n a bout \ Q 2 , ptri. (1502)             I have marked this           position

                (Ex. Ref.            /I)

 In this          position      I was      s urrounded by muc h taller               people and      I was

 being       crushed quite            s e v e r ly to such an extent             that   I was    having

 d i f fi c u l t y breathing,             I was not aware         that     I was    being m oved ar ou nd          in

 the   pen.

 I was       s u bjected to this             severe    crushing       for a time        that    I can only

 estimate          to have      been about          five    or six minutes,          when fina ll y      I found

that        I was    starting         to vomit,       the    sick was       getting     caught    in my throat

and    I was        beginning         to    choke    on it.

My two brothers and                                    were    still ar ou nd me,         as    far as    I am

aware        they    could see         I was    in d if fi c u l t y and they pushed me up out

 of the         crush.      Whe n     I was    pushed upwards             I fell    forwards     onto the

 heads       of the      crowd       in front.

 It was         only at this          time    having got out          of the       crush that     I realised          I

was    only about           fifteen feet away from the front                        perimeter     fence.        I

 have m arked this              position on the seperate                  grid     plan using a figure two,

 I cannot          be sure about           the time        I got    push upwards        out of the       crush

 but   I can say that w hen                  I fell    onto    the    heads      of the    people    in the

 crowd at the front of                     pen number       four    I looked onto the           pitch    I saw

lhat    the game       had sCo-ftped there were                   no    players     left on the      pitch only

a   lot of s upporters                on t h V s j p i t c h a ro u n d the area of t h e     L iverpool       goal,

I m a n ag ed to      crawl          forwards      ov\r     the   heads of t h e        crowd and with the

help of a supporters who was                       h a n g i n g over    the    perimeter     fencing    from
                                                                   crtT -

trousers whilst                climbing       over    the      perimeter       fence.

Once    I got out onto                the    pitch I stood by the               left hand side       goal    post

of the Liverpool                   goal as you       look at the         pitch from the terracing.                   I

stood there          -har a bout          one minute        to try and get my breath back.

I   saw some        lads wmt, were            trying      to    pull    up a sect io n of the        p e r im et er

f enc i ng s it uated a fewvfeet                   to the       right    hand side of the gate           in the

perimeter       fence of             pen nunv&er^ four as you                look from th^. pitch.          I went

ayer    to help these                lads.        There were       only about          four or f\ve of them,

I gra'&ia^CK ho 1 d of the                fence    to try and          pull    it up and then a K p l \ c e m a n

got    hold of m e , he said something                         to me    like,    “Get away from the fence

you wont       do    it,       go and stand on the grass."                      I went    back and stood

back    by the N o rt h S tand side                  goal      post of the Liverpool          goal.

At this    time       it was about               ten past or quarter             past    three,    (1510)   or

(1515),    I was       standing             by the Liverpool            goal    post    (North S tand Side)

when    I saw a lad                lying on the       pitch,      he was       laid out about      ten feet to

the N o rt h S t an d side             of the goal          post where         I was    standing and a few

feet    onto    the    pitch.             This    lad was       lying    on the     pitch on his       back,     he

was m o ti on le ss and a pp ea re d to me to be dead.                             I c a n ’t remember much

more about          how he a pp e a r e d other             than his m outh was           open.     I would

describe       this     lad as a white male,                    aged 20 to 25 years,           quite    tall     I

w ould say over            6       feet tall,      and was slim          in build,       he had fair     hair,

light    brown       I think which a pp ea r e d to be bushy,                       I think    he was wearing

blue jeans and a grey top,                        I am almost          sure    one of his training shoes

was     missing and he was wearing a pair of                                 red socks.

               knees.        I c a n ’t remember what             he was wearing.

               I then m oved to the area of the                       pitch    in front of the Liverpool                  goal

              a nd    I met my brothers                           and             and

              We did not stay on the                   pitch or assist any of the dead or                        injured

               persons we          left the       pitch and went          into the N orth Stand.

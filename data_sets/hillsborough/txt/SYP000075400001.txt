             I am                              and I live at the above address with my

             parent s.

             I am a Liverpool F o o tball Club supporter a nd on Saturday 15 April            1989

             <#i>Q489)    I decided^to attend the Liverpool F. C. match against

              ottingham Forest F. C.         I obtained my ticket from Liverpool F. C .

             ground and paid £6 for the ticket, which was for the Leppings Ln

             standing area in the W Stand of Hillsborough Football Club, S he f f i e l d .

              ust after^ O a m y 1000) on Saturday 15 April           1989 (150489),   together

              ith                              ___________________ Tewkesbury,   I caught the

             train from Cheltenham Spa Railway Station to the main railway station

             in Sheffield,         arriving there about         Ion (1200) .

            On getting of the train we saw Polic£"0fficers directing both sections

            of fans to different          parts of the station to catch buses to
                                                                                     PAGE     2
                                                                                     S 1966

take them to the ground.            I knew where to go as it was the same set-up

as the yjptfV before.

         it the bus to the ground and other than normal traffic problems

  rived at the ground at about               "Ipm (1300). There was nothing of note

on route to the ground,            except the amount of fans who were chanting

and we would chant back to them.

The bus dropped us off at the Leppings Ln end and there was a moderate

crowd around the Leppings Ln end,                people were sitting on the

    Is surrounding the ground and there was about one Police Officer on

each turnstile w ho were searching               people as they went through. The

Police were also directing people who asked them where to go.

I knew from previous experience which turnstile to go into and

approached it with ease, as there was no more than a normal                    crowd.

Prior to going through the l^urnstile numbered A-G, which was at about

•1.30pm,    I was searched by a Police Officer and as I then went through

the turnstile         I handed in the counterfoil            section of my ticket.

On going through the turnstile               I did not see any gates open,      other

than the turnstiles and did not see any persons entering the ground

i.11 egal l y .

Upon entering the rear of the stand I did not notice any signs

directing people to the standing areas, although                     there were signs

directing people to the seats.

I purchased a programme and a drink of tea and then went through the

             ferds the standing area.            I had a free passage through the

LW^/but           c a n ’t recall seeing a p ^ P o l i c e   or stewards at this point.

  m re was no one I saw drinking alcohol and there was no signs of any

aisorder.     Upon going through the tunnel              I went to the right of the

fence into Pen 3 and I stood behind a crash barrier which was about

two thirds of the way down the pen towards the front fence and

approximately 10 foot from the fence separating pens 3 and 4.
                                                                        PAGE      3
                                                                        SI 966

I sat down and drank my tea and looked at my programme, as it was

relatively empty at this stage.

At a£ou>*1g73Qprri / 1430)    I stood up and took up my position to watch the

g/m>e. TmajM^'was still      room to move at this stage and I felt

comfo rtable.

               45 pm yi 4 4 5 ) when they announced the teams I noticed it was

                             i our pen. There was minor crowd surges which

were   like normal jostling that take place at most games         prior to the

start.

As a result of one of the surges        I manoeuvred myself to the front of

the crash barrier,     as by this stage it was getting tight and I d o n ’t

like being behind a crash barrier.

         who had entered the ground with me and stood by me stayed

behind the crash barrier.

On moving   in front of the crash barrier       I became aware of people

pushing closer and closer towards me,        there were people behind me, to

the sides and in front of me and although it was very tight,           in fact

my arms were pinned by my side,        I could still breathe comfortably as I

was head and shoulders above the crowd around me, as I am appro;< 6*5

t^al1. I was    in fact sideways on and the     only way I   would have been

able to move would have been by force.

It was at this stage that        I noticed a lad in front    of me who appeared

crushed very tightly and start to panic         and at this time a man about

the same age as me was passed over the heads of the crowd towards the

front of the pen. He was wearing a red Liverpool shirt and had blonde

ha i r , I managed to free my arm to help pass him along as he appeared

unconscious.     However at this stage    I was not concerned, as it was a

hot day anyhow and I thought he had just passed out.

I again then saw the lad in front of me he was by now sweating and

looking very frightened and shouting,        "Get me out mate."

        xK1 I grabbed him by the scruff of his collar and sort of pulled him up

             enough to allow him to move out of the crowd. He then climbed across

             the heads of a few people in front and over the top of the front fence

V            railings. He then got onto the pitch. This lad was about my age and

             had dark hair,    but I c a n ’t remember anything else about him.
    y,       I then became aware of a voice from behind shouting,       "Let me climb up

             your back," or words to that effect.     I bent my legs so that he could
    &
             get a foothold and then bent down to allow him to get over me, which

             he did,    I have no idea where he went then or what he looked like.

             By now the game was well started a nd I noticed the Police shouting at

             the fans    in our pen to get b a c k , at the same time people were climbing

             over the pens, spilling onto the pitch and the crowd in our pen were

               outing for the match to be stopped

               then looked behind me to see how             was and saw that he had a

             very pained expression on his face. He was pinned against the crash

             barrier by his stomach and I was unable to move to help him.

             I noticed that the people around me were all having problems,        they

             seemed very crushed together and having trouble breathing.       I however

             was okay due to my height.

             JUst    prior to the game stopping   I noticed the emergency gate at the

             front of the pen opened and the Police then shut it

             think they realised what was happening      in the pens, and thought    it was

             just a pitch invasion. However 2 or 3 people managed to get out.

             Just as the g^me was bought to a halt the emergency gate again opened

             V"d    I think it was at this stage the Police realised what was

             happening and started to climb the fences,      trying to tell the fans to

             move backw ard s.

             By now Liverpool    fans had also climbed the fences and were helping

             people over the railings onto the pitch.      I stood where I was and

             gradually the crowd around me subsided and I was able to move freely
                                                                                 PAGE     5
                                                                                 S 1966

         again,    approximately 15 minutes later.

         I was very concerned for my friend             , as I had not see him since

         he was bent over the barrier and he was not there when I looked again.

         I did not notice any persons collapsed or dead around me in the pen,

         arid prior to the ambulance arriving on the pitch I was able to leave

         [the pen by the tunnel at the rear of the pen.      It was by the tun nel on

                way that I met up with            As we went through the tunnel

        \{£ % a the rear of the stand I saw people laid out and persons

          droinistering mouth to mouth resuscitation.      It was only at this    point

          hat I realised how serious the crush had been.        I had thought that

         people had only passed out,      I then realised that poeple were dead.

         I feel that the hot weather,      plus the   amount of people in the   pens

         contributed to the seriousness of the situation.

         I feel that the Police did not realise what was happening quick enough

         because the fans appeared to grasp the situation quicker. The Police

         also appeared to distance the mse lv es,      leaving the fans to deal and

         help the persons    leave the pens. However    I do not blame the Police,

         but feel that the organisation outside the ground was very poor,          there

         was nothing to assist fans to queue for the tur nstiles.

                                                                                SIGNED

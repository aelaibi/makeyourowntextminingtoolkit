         All    we did was           look     for    the    letter            ’8 ’ w hich was            right above            us.

         about        2. 05 pm and      came    back       shor t l y            after and                said, " You had better

         h u r r y up.           Its getting a bit               busy        the r e . "

         We    both then went            down the tutyrfel and at                           this     time there were                no

         as    I could see.

         As we        got    to the     end of/'t he tunnel                   there was a large                   g a t h e r i n g of

         around        the       ground.      There was              no singing             and    no-one        drinking.           There

         was    no     pressure       and     infact       there was             one        girl    sitting        down with a

At a bout            this         time        there was a couple                               of surges                 in the            crowd for                some

W h i l s t we were                 stand i n g            there         the       pressure                of      people was                 such that

the      people             in front             of us were                forced g r a du a l l y sideways                                   towards               the

My son had got                      himself               in a p o s ition where                           he was             being         s u pported               by

There         didn't           seem          to be m u c h doing                      for a while arid a few min u t e s

later         the      teams          came        out        onto        the       pitch.                 The      crowd was                now quite

unbearable                  and     I was         having             some         d i f f i c u l t y moving                      in any        direction™

I had a l r e a d y got my arms                                 out and            I began                to feel             that         they were

s t a rting          to ache            from fending                     off       other           fans.              1. did at one                    stage          get

my     left        thumb          caught          in between two                            fans and              couldn't            release                it.

F o r t u n a t e l y my son m a n a g e d            to    prize     them apart           and get my thumb out.

I then saw the                teams         lining     up for        the    start.         I did not a c t u a l l y see

the    kick     off      but         I looked up to see               that     the       play was moving          towards

the    o p p osite       end of the             ground,        that    being       the area        that N o t t i n g h a m

Forest       were       defendim

I saw the         ball        ty tl     the    cross       b a r , after      being       struck    by a Liverpool

piayer ,      who T       T      7      since       found out was Beard s l e y .                 There was a surge

in the       crowd then and                   this    re\e g y e d    the     pressure        on me for a split

second,       but       it g,ot w orse w h e n the surge a b a t e d .

It was       then that               I became a w a reydf            a uniformed           person at       the    front,              who

I believe         to be an a m b u 1a n c e y m a n »                He was       s t a nding     on the     pitch side

of    the    fence and a c t u a l l y               on the     fence       holding        himself     onto      it.        He

was    1eaning          over         the    top and waving            his arms           in a pushing m o t i o n .             11

At    the    same       time     the        q a te s i n t he f en c e o p e n e d a nd I saw another

P o 1 i c e m a n , who was             wearing       plain glasses,              an d    I got the      impre s s i o n

that    his     shirt was               being       pulled    off,     he was          trying     for soorfnTime t U

pull    someone          out,          thro u g h    the    gate,     by his arm,

At about        this       point           there were        people        in n u m b e r s y f 1 imbing     o v er the

and    into     the      stands            o ut of the       crowd.

T here was a lot of s h o uting                        going     on now and              I must    say that       it was

bordering          on hysteria.

Play     had now been s t o p p e d and                             there were             alot       of Police           by the

fence.        I also          saw a       line         of Po l i c e          come         down the           touch       line.       There

was a l o t       of    chanting          from the                  Forest fans and                 I saw a group of about

50 to 60 Li v e r p o o l            fans         start             running         towards           them.         The    line of

Police       then m o v e d         i n between them and kept them s e p e rated,                                            although

some     fans      did get          through.                I       d i d n ’t see a n y thing                of them after              that,

but    it    did       quieten       down a fter                    only     a f e w minutes.

By    this    time       there       was       about            a    quarter          of    the       pitch        covered       by

Spectators             and    several            had    been           plucked           out     by     the    people       in    th e

stands       above.           This       did      nothing             to    ease         the     crush        where       I was

started       moving          towards            the    right           and      through          a     gate.        We    were

eventually             able    to    move         ourselves                and    did       in     fact       go    underneath           the

crash       bar    arui go         out    througn               trie g a t e      and       unto        the    nex L pen         to    tne

We    stayed       until       about       4 . 4 0 pm when we                    saw alot             of other        people          leaving.

We    left    to get          to a phone               to       call       home w h i c h          took       sometime       as most wer

In my time             in the       ground and                  inside        the Pen            it was        impossible             for me

to    understand             or see       the      s eriousness                  of      the     si t u a t i o n    inside       the     pen.

             good    job and you have                 to take your f \ats off         to them but     I do think

             that after       the    initial           small   arnou/t of trouble         there were a lot too

             m a n y Police    Officers              s t a nding a/ o u n d doing    n o thing when they       could

             have    been as s i s t i n g

             I think also          that      the      situation      could have      been e a s e d , if not

             prevented,       if s omeone             oru j/ne s t a d i u m staf f had have    been obs e r v i n g

             the    crowd and       ther e b y        noticing      that    both the side     pens were    v i rtually

             empty    in c o mparison               to the   centre    p en s.   If this     had been done       the

             crowds      could have          been d i r e c t e d    into    these   pens.

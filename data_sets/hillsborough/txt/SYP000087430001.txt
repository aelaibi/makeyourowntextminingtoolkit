                I am employed by the Trent Regional                       Hea lt h A u t h ority    in S h e f f i e l d as

                the                                                                       land have       held this

                position since Fe b r u a r y          19S9    (000289).



               On S a tu rd ay     15th April         1989    (150489),      I was out     having my normal           day

                off work and was visiting my mother at her home                            in Barnsley.          At about

                4pm     (1600)    I became aware         through a radio           programme       that a large scale

                disaster     had taken       place at Hi ll s b o r o u g h St ad iu m      in Sheffield,          where

                Liverpool        were    playing No tt in g h a m Forrest,          in the semi-final           of the FA

                Cup     competition.



                As a result of this information, I contacted, by telephone, my boss,
                     t/l4
                Mr            and it was then decided that I should go to the ^Northern
General         Hospital       in S h e f f i e l d and act as a ____________________________ I

am aware         of the existence          of a major disaster         plan to be used at          the

hospital s        in this       region    in the event of any disaster.              My   role would

be to up-date membe rs               of the    press with      casualty    lists,    organising

pools of         photographers and          reporters     to visit w a r d s , to talk to those

patients         expressing a wish          to meet with the        press.       A room on the

ground floor            of the hospital        in the ou t- patients       department      had been

set aside         for membe rs       of the    press and this was         clearly mar ke d as a

press      room.



I ^arrived at the N o r th e rn General                Hospital    at about 5 . 4 0 p m   (1740)   and

wor ke d       conti nuo usl y until at        least    1Q.3Qpm    (2230).



At no time did            I ex perience       problems wi t h the      pres s^     I can remember

ci rcu lat ion of a rumour               in the hospital       to the effect       that   supporters

of Liverpool            Football     Cl u b had   "roughed up" a pressman.            I attempted

to find out the            identity of anyone           from the    press who may have

w i t n e s s e d the    incident,       to discover     the   identity of the pressman

"roughed up",            but    it is fair to say that          I could not find the att ack ed

p r e s s m a n ’s identity or an yone who had wi t n e s s e d the              incident.    I would

have expected someone                in the    press    room to have      first hand knowledge,

if the         incident    had taken       place,   but was     not able     to find such a

pe r s o n .



Du ri ng       the aft er no on of the disaster           the number      of members      in the

press      room varied between 50 and               100 persons.        Some of the       local

pressmen were            known to me,       but others     I did not know ar ri v e d from the

national         media.



At about 6 30pm            <1830),       that afternoon,       about 6 un iformed Police
                                                                                                        PAG E      3
                                                                                                        S3169

           Off ice rs     visited the hospital.         I was     informed by the Police            that    they

           had been called to at te n d a disturbance                between the        press and

            relatives      of casualties       inside the hospital.            I explained to the

           Poli ce    that    I had e x per ie nc ed no problem with the waiting                pressmen.

           The Police        expressed an opinion that          it would be better           for all

            concerned      if the    pre ssmen and w o m e n stayed       in the      room set aside       for

           them and did not stray outside              of the     room,     so as to a vo id any

            possible      confrontation.



            I can state that during my duties               that a f t e r n o o n   I had e n co unt ere d no

           dis tur ban ce    of any kind.



            I believe      that the Police      only att en de d at the No rt he rn General

           Hospital       once that a f t e r n o o n to deal wi t h    reported disturbance.



            I wo uld add that        I spent my time       between     casualty and the         press    room

           without       incident.     If an    incident occurre d elsewhere              I have no

           knowledge       of it.

                                                                                                      SIG NE D

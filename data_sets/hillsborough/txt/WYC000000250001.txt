Dear

Thank you for your letter of the 23rd December, which I have received today.

May I say at the outset that anyone of the least sensitivity must have sympathy with those
who hold strong views on such an emotive and delicate subject. I expressed this to Father
Morrow at the inquest.

I can understand why you say what you do but you imply, as is indeed the case, that I was
bound by the High Court judgment. You are also right that Tony Bland was injured at
Hillsborough. The intervening events were covered by a proper process of law as far as I
can see, but of course one cannot expect the outcome to satisfy all shades of opinion.

I do however thank you for writing and expressing your view.

Yours sincerely,




J. A. Turnbull

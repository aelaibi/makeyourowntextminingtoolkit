           On arrival             I went      down        to   prepare       the    kit     and    I went        on the       playing

           minutes          before      kick-off.              I went       and    stood     at    the     dugout.          Within

           seconds          I saw      climbing           over    the    fence       behind Liverpool's                 goal,       I s aw

            was     r o om at     the       sides    but    the m i d d l e    part    was    jam-pack         ti gh t.       I was

             concentrating            on the        run    of    play   but    I saw    the    build-up          of    fans       o n the

             pi t ch .     It w a s     getting       out       of   hand and       I said,    "There's          going       to       be

            trouble        down    at       that    end,"       - serious      problems       I thought.              I saw       the

             Inspector       go    on a n d        play    stop —       I went      down with       the    team.        Came          back

            about        ten min ut es        later,       it w a s     complete      chaos    -    r un n i n g ,    lying,

             complete       chaos       -    in t h a t    ten m in ut es      the    numbers       had m u l t i p l i e d       a

             hundered       fold -          I went    back       down   to    the    players       then    u n ti l    the    match

            was     abandoned.

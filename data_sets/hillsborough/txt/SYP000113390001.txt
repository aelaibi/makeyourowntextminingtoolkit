alternative             ends      of    the    ground         to    the     1988 S emi         Final.           In    relation

Liverpool            supporters             would    travel.            These      areas       were      therefore

allocated            on t hi s      basis      and any          alteration            would     h ave      resulted          in

opposing         fans       crossing          each       other,       therefore,          increasing             the

likelihood            of    disorder          and,       in a d d i t i o n ,     excessive           disruption         to       the

arranged         on 2 2 M a r c h           1989,    similar          to    last y e a r s      meeting          with    both

the     Chief      Superintendent,                     Operations                    and     Traffic         Division,               t o ok      on

th is    t a sk    and       prepared           his       own      plan s.             These        duties           were       undertaken

in this        way      in     1988 and             1989.

In a d d i t i o n      the     staging             of the         event             at      Hillsborough              of n e c e s s i t y

affects        the      c ity       c ent r e       and      once          again       the       role       of    the H i l l s b o r o u g h

commander          cannot           be    diverted            to       t ak e        c on tro l     of      t h is     aspect.              As    a

consequence             a separate              plan         is    prepared                for     dealing           with       city         c ent r e

problems          associated with                    the      semi          fin a l ,        and    this         a c t i o n was           embarked

upon     in b o t h       1988 a n d           in    1989.

The     three      areas        of       command maintain                         contact          through           r a di o       and      land

line     com m u n i c a t i o n s        and       through            this          method        flexibility                 for

re-deployment                is a d e q u a t e l y          catered             for.

An    example        of      the     flexibility                  of       the       p lan    can be         drawn         from          the     fact

that     in the         D Division              Order         officers                are     allocated              to    escort           duties

of    public       transport              vehicles            travelling                   from     the M i d l a n d           Station           to

the H i l l s b o r o u g h         ground and               the       contingency                 plan      is      t h at     when         these

officers          have       completed              their         allocated                t ask    they         remain available

for     re-deployment                at       the    g r o u n d as             an a d d i t i o n a l       resource               at     the

ground      gymnasium.                   On    completion                  of    the m a t c h        the        officers            are       again

Taking       into a c c o u n t        the    three          aspects       of    policing          - Traffic,            D

Division        and Hillsborough                   - the        t o tal    manpower          available          for

To   ensure      the        football         supporters             were       made       aware    of    the

arrangements..              Letters          were       sent     to      the    Chief       Constables          of

Merseyside           and Nottinghamshire                      requesting             the    widest       possible

circulation            (Appendix            C).

When     all    the     planning            was    completed             I received a             copy     of    the     F

Division        Hillsborough                Order       and     I was      satisfied with                the a r r a n g e m e n t s

made.

At 0 8 . 4 5 a m       on S a t u r d a y ,       15 A p r i l      1989,       as    senior       officer           on w e e k e n d

I updated myself                 about       the     previous            nights       work     and      dealt        with    the

morning        m ail    and      correspondence.

Sometime        during        the      morning          I spoke          to C h i e f      Superintendent               Nesbit       I/C

Operations           and     discussed            the    traffic          flow       to    the N o t t s     Forest/Liverpool

about     1.00       pm to       go    to    the     football            ground.

About     1.00       pin I w e n t      into       the       incident          room at        Force      Headquarters

Everything               seemed           to    be    going          well      - the          traffic           flow was          busy          which

was     to      be       expected          on.su ch an               occasion.

About        half        an     hour       after        th at        Chief         Superintendent- Nesbit                         a r r i v e d at

so    that       Chief          Superintendent                   Nesbit            could          encourage          vehicles              to    use

two     lanes            inwards          to    the     ground.               We    then          continued          our j o u r n e y           and

he    dropped             me    off       at    the D i r e c t o r s          car       park          entrance         on P e n i s t o n e

R o a d.        I walked             through          the      Directors                car       park    to      the      far    en d      of    the

ground and went                      through          the       g at e    up       to    the P o l i c e          Control         Room.

There        was         nothing          unusual         and        I took         the       view       everything              wa s      going       to

plan.

In the C o n t r o l             Room          I met      Chief          I n s p e c t o r 'McRobbie               and      the       officers

manning          the       video          and    ra dios.              There        was       a    c ord ial       exchange             and

little          else       when       I noticed Chief                     Superintendent                      Duckenfield               the

officer          in       charge          of    the       operation            and       Superintendent                    Murray          come    up

after        2.00         pm.        Mr.       Duckenfield               said       that          he    had     been       to    see       the

referee          to       discuss          police          procedures               and a general                  discussion               took

p l ac e     about         the       operation             which         was       progressing                satisfactorily,

I recall             a    comment          being          made       about         the    Notts          Forest         f an s     coming

early and                there       was       s till      a    lot      of    people             to    e n ter     the N o r t h          Stand

for     Liverpool               Supporters.                    It wa s        considered                t hat     there         was     plenty         of

t ime      to    get       the       supporters                in.       I left          the C o n t r o l         Room         and went          to

the     Directors               lobby where                I saw         the       Club Secretary,                   Mr.        Mackrell.              I

made       comment             about       the       Liverpool             fans         coming          late r      than        the     Notts

Forest          fans       and       he    said       that        the      gates         h ad      been       opened        at     12 m i d d a y

to    let       them       in,        I. t h e n w e n t          to     the       Directors             box      and      sat     in the         seat

reserved             for       the    police.

The     North Stand                  seemed          to    be     filling           up v e r y well               towards          the      start

mortuary           was       arranged           in the         gymnasium.

should        not       be m a de .           Mr.      Dalglish           asked     if t h e r e      was     anything             he

could       do a n d         he was       requested               to m a k e    an a n n o u n c e m e n t        for    the

Liverpool            fans      to       keep     calm        so     the    police      could         deal     with       the

situation.               He    did       so a n d       both managers               left     the C o n t r o l          Room.

Some      time       after         this       I went         to the        pitch and         spoke         to C h i e f

At     that     time         there       was     a     lot     of    shouting         at    the L a p p i n g s         Lane       end a n d

restlessness                 creeping           round        the     gro u n d .      We    decided          t ha t     it w o u l d       be

helpful         to      calm       everyone            by m a k i n g      an a n n o u n c e m e n t      t hat      the     game       had

been abandoned                 and       as k    the      fans       to    remain where              they were           u n ti l       all

the      casualties            wEre       taken away                from    the     gr o u n d .      We     then made             a

request         via      the       Police        Control            Room     for    this     to      be    done.

I then        returned             to    the     Police           Control       Room.        Detective             Chief

E N D OF   REPORT
WALTER JACKSON
ASSISTANT CHIEF CONSTABLE (OPERATIONS)
POLICE HEADQUARTERS
SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE




I was promoted to the rank of Assistant Chief Constable, Operations, in the

South Yorkshire Police on 1 May 1985 and have played a major part in the pre­

planning and overseeing of operational police work.




In 1988, Hillsborough Football ground staged the Semi Final between Nottingham

Forest and Liverpool and a planning team was set up under the command of the

Divisional Commander, Chief Superintendent Mole.




Following consultations with all interested parties which included the Football

Association, the Club, Fire and Emergency Services, Transport representatives

and Traffic Management and the examination of available intelligence, the

manpower level and operational plan was produced for the Semi Final and the

manpower for policing was determined and set at 940 officers for the

Hillsborough Operation.




The event took place with little or no difficulty and was described as a

successful operation.




On 20 March 1989 South Yorkshire Police were approached by the Sheffield

Wednesday Football Club Secretary with a view to the Semi Final being staged at

the Hillsborough ground on 15 April 1989 with the same teams being involved.

Bearing in mind the previous years experience, it was agreed that the event

would be staged in the same way.   Approaches were made for the Clubs involved to

be given alternative ends of the ground to the 1988 Semi Final.   In relation to
this approaches to the Kop and the South Stand are from the South, the area

where the vast majority of Nottinghamshire supporters would travel, and the West

Stand and Terrace, and North Stand are approached from the North, the area from

which the vast majority of Liverpool supporters would travel.     These areas were

therefore allocated on this basis and any alteration would have resulted in

opposing fans crossing each other,   therefore, increasing the likelyhood of

disorder and, in addition, excessive disruption to the residents of Sheffield

causing traffic problems before and after the event.



This decision was in accord with the recommendations of the Popplewell Report,

regarding the need for opposing fans to have a clear differentiation of spacial

separation and physical containment of opposing groups.




This decision was accepted by the FA, the Clubs and other interested parties.



Mr Duckenfield at that time was Deputy Divisional Commander on D Division and

was due to take over responsibility from Chief Superintendent Mole on 27 March

1989.   He had considerable experience in policing major events and his division

included Sheffield United Football ground.    I   was extremely confident regarding

his ability to police the Semi Final.   In the initial stages Chief

Superintendent Mole reviewed the planning arrangements with the previous years

Police planning team and so as to ensure continuity a meeting was arranged on 22

March 1989 similar .to last years meeting with both Chief Superintendent-Mele a n d -

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, and the previous years planning team, present.

The meeting also included Chief Superintendent Nesbit, Operations and Traffic,

who was to take full responsibility for the traffic arrangements.




The planning then continued through division by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield

and the same Police planning team as the previous year.     Chief Superintendent

Nesbit, Ops & Traffic, liaised with the division concerning manpower
requirements and both officers kept me updated regarding developments. During

the planning period I was informed by Chief Superintendent Nesbit that it was

necessary to look for mutual aid in respect of horses and dogs.     It was

therefore decided to utilise mounted officers from Nottinghamshire and

Merseyside as they would have a thorough working knowledge of the supporters in

their respective areas.     Arrangements were made for 12 mounted police officers

from Merseyside and 8 from Nottinghamshire to be supplied and work under the

supervision of the Inspector in charge of the South Yorkshire Mounted Police

Section.   Twelve dog handlers from West Yorkshire and 8 from Nottinghamshire

were requested and worked double manned with South Yorkshire officers,       that is 2

officers in each vehicle.




The method of raising manpower for events such as the Semi Final and all other

operational matters within South Yorkshire is based on the policy which reflects

that the division upon which the event is to take place should identify the

manpower it can raise and then inform Operations Division at Force Headquarters

of the additional manpower which is required.     The additional manpower is then

raised from across the Force area from duty and off-duty time officers and is

notified to the host division for an allocation of duties and in terms of the

operational order this is submitted to me as Assistant Chief Constable

(Operations).   This procedure took place.




The determination of manpower levels in connection with any operational event is

of necessity to be based on information available and the intention of any plan

made in this connection is to ensure flexibility in the deployment of resources.

In this respect the manpower involves that utilised in policing the actual

events at Hillsborough under the command of the Divisional Officer, and may

include other available resources,    for example,'traffic patrol officers assigned
to Semi Final duties and those officers from D Division who were assigned

transportation/escort duties of fans from the city centre.



Following previous experience it was decided two years ago that the Divisional

Commander responsible for Hillsborough could be more effective if he did not

have to be concerned with the logistics of directing traffic and escorting it to

the ground.   In view of this the Chief Superintendent, Operations and Traffic

Division, took on this task and prepared his own plans.   These duties were

undertaken in this way in 1988 and 1989.



In addition the staging of the event at Hillsborough of necessity affects the

city centre and once again the role of the Hillsborough commander cannot be

diverted to take control of this aspect.   As a consequence a separate plan is

prepared for dealing with city centre problems associated with the semi final,

and this action was embarked upon in both 1988 and in 1989.



The three areas of command maintain contact through radio and land line

communications and through this method flexibility for re-deployment is

adequately catered for.




An example of the flexibility of the plan can be drawn from the fact that in the

D Division Order officers are allocated to escort duties of public transport

vehicles travelling from the Midland Station to the Hillsborough ground and the

contingency plan is that when these officers have completed   their allocated task

they remain available for re-deployment at the ground as an additional resource

at the ground gymnasium.   On completion of the match the officers are again used

for escort duties back to the railway station in the city centre.
                                   5



An examination of the 1989 requirements having regard to the Operation in 1988

revealed that a reduction in manpower on the peripheral areas could be carried

out and these are shown on Appendix A.     It will be noted that the reduction at

the ground is relatively small and absolutely minimal at the Leppings Lane

turnstiles and terraces.   Appendix B.




Taking into account the three aspects of policing - Traffic, D Division and

Hillsborough - the total manpower available for deployment was as follows




                    1988            1173

                    1989            1133



To ensure that football supporters were made aware of the arrangements.     Letters

were sent to the Chief Constables of Merseyside and Nottinghamshire requesting

the widest possible circulation (Appendix C)




Letters were also sent to the person responsible for preparing match programmes

(Appendix D ) .




Letters were went to the Chief Ambulance Officer and Chief Fire Brigade Officer

(Appendix E ) .




When all the planning was completed I received a copy of the F Division

Hillsborough Order and I was satisfied with the arrangements made.
At 08.45 am on Saturday 15 April 1989 as senior officer on weekend cover I

attended at Police Headquarters and went to my office.




I updated myself about the previous nights work and dealt with the morning mail

and correspondence.




Sometime during the morning I spoke to Chief Superintendent Nesbit I/C

Operations and discussed the traffic flow to the Notts Forest/Liverpool football

match being staged at Hillsborough Football ground, kick off at 3.00 pm.

Everything was going to plan and he agreed to pick me up about 1.00 pm to go to

the football ground.




About 1.00 pm I went into the incident room at Force Headquarters handling the

match information and spoke to Superintendent Anderson.    Everything seemed to be

going well - the traffic flow was busy which was to be expected on such an

occasion.




About half an hour after that Chief Superintendent Nesbit arrived at Police

Headquarters and took me to Hillsborough Football Stadium via Penistone Road.

This road was still busy at this time and we stopped so that Chief

Superintendent Nesbit could encourage vehicles to use two lanes inwards to the

ground. We then continued our journey and he dropped me off at the Directors car

park entrance on Penistone Road.     I walked through the Directors car park to the

far end of the ground and went through the gate up to the Police Control Room.

There was nothing unusual and I took the view everything was going to plan.




In the Control Room I met Chief Inspector McRobbie and the officers manning the

video and radios.     There was a cordial exchange and little else when I noticed
                                        7




    Chief Superintendent Duckenfield the       officer in charge of the operation and

    Superintendent Murray come up to the       terrace to join me in the Control Room -

    this would be just after 2.00 pm.       Mr Duckenfield said that he had been to see

    the referee to discuss police procedures and a general discussion took place

    about the operation which was progressing satisfactorily.




    I recall a comment being made about the Notts Forest fans coming early and there

    was still a lot of people to enter the North Stand for Liverpool Supporters.           It

    was considered that there was plenty of time to get the supporters in.        I left

    the Control Room and went to the Directors lobby where I saw the Club Secretary,

    Mr Mackrell.   I made comment about the Liverpool fans coming later than the

    Notts Forest fans and he said that the gates had been opened at 12 midday to let

    them in. I then went to the Directors box and sat in the seat reserved for the

    police.




    The North Stand seemed to be filling       up very well towards the start of play, but

    there still looked as if there was some room       when the players ran out on to the

    field prior to the commencement of the game.



•    -

    Just after the game started I had occasion to look towards the West Terrace and

    saw a number of fans had come out on to the pitch.       More fans came on and I

    immediately went to the Police Control Room where I saw Chief Superintendent

    Duckenfield.   He was unable to say what had happened at that stage and I

    recollect the game had been stopped.




    I decided to go down on to the pitch to see what the problem was and on getting

    there I saw Superintendent Greenwood who informed me that he was dealing with

    the situation and he said we had injuries.       The crowd had got bigger on the

    pitch and I ran back up to the Control Room to make use of communications - a
fleet of ambulances had been requested (3.07 pm).   Because of the seriousness of

the situation and together with Chief Superintendent Duckenfield we gave

instructions to the Control Room Staff for implementation of the major disaster

plan.   There would be considerable pressure on our controller at this time - but

I knew we were being monitored by our Force Incident Room dealing with the match

to link to the major incident and I remember being asked to confirm operation

support (3.10 p m ) .




In the meantime rescue operations were taking place on the pitch and I

specifically requested that Superintendent Torr be requested to take charge of

the Casualty Bureau and Detective Chief Superintendent Addis, head of CID to

attend to see me so that the cause of the incident could be investigated.   Mr

Duckenfield was continuing to deal with other matters with our radio controller

and we requested that he broadcast for people to leave the pitch and keep calm

so that we could deal with the injured.




A request was made later for Mr Duckenfield to attend the Board Room and

something was mentioned about the game being abandoned - it was important not to

make any announcement until we dealt with the casualties so that we could get

them to hospital whilst it was clear outside.




I went to the Board Room and Superintendent Murray was left in charge of the

Control Room.    Mr Duckenfield spoke to them - I reinforced the need to get the

casualties away before any announcement was made and we returned to the Police

Control Room.




At about 3.35 pm Detective Chief Superintendent Addis made contact via telephone

at the Control Room and I briefed him regarding the situation at the football

ground and requested him to attend and see me.
We were made aware that there were fatalities and a temporary mortuary was

arranged in the gymnasium.



The managers of Notts Forest - Mr Clough and Liverpool - Mr Dalglish came into the

Police Control Box and asked whether the game was postponed.       They were told it

would be, but an announcement should not be made.      Mr Dalglish asked if there

was anything he could do and he was requested to make an announcement for the

Liverpool fans to keep calm so the police could deal with the situation.       He did

so and both managers left the Control Room.




Some time after this I went to the pitch and spoke to Chief Superintendent

Nesbit    who had been involved in the rescue operation. At    that time there was a

lot of    shouting at the Leppings Lane end and restlessness creeping round the

ground.    We decided that it would be helpful to calm everyone by making an

announcement that the game had been abandoned and ask the fans to remain where

they were until all the casualties were taken away from the ground.       We then

made a    request via the Police Control Room for this to be   done.




I then    returned to the Police Control Room.   Detective Chief Superintendent

Addis arrived and I briefed him regarding the enquiry into the events to

commence and to ensure that the temporary mortuary and casualty bureau were

functioning.




All the casualties were cleared and then at approximately 4.45 pm Chief

Superintendent Mole came to the Control Room.      I briefed him regarding the

situation and requested him to control and co-ordinate remaining matters at the

ground so that I could go to Police Headquarters to continue enquiries and brief

the Deputy Chief and Chief Constable.
                                    10




    I left the Police Control Box with Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and

    Superintendent Marshall who had joined us and walked across the pitch to the

    Police Room.   We met Mr Barron, a Director of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

    on the pitch and he said the police had done an excellent job.   He was clearly

    upset and crying.




    About 5.15 pm Superintendent Marshall, Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and

    myself went to Police Headquarters.   I spoke to the Deputy Chief Constable and

    later, because of the amount of manpower that had been used, began making
m
    arrangements to ensure sufficient cover for the following day.




    Because of the impending visit of the Minister of Sport at 9.00 pm I liaised with

    our operational staff to ensure that appropriate arrangements were made and also

    ensured that appropriate staffing arrangements were available for temporary

    mortuary staff - casualty bureau and that relatives of deceased and injured

    would be sympathetically dealt with by counselling.




    I retired from duty about 0245 am.

     Dear

     NOTTINGHAM FOREST V LIVERPOOL - FA CUP SEMI-FINAL
     HILLSBOROUGH, SHEFFIELD - SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989 - KO 1500 HOURS

    In connection with the above fixture, it would be greatly appreciated if
    the following details could be given the widest possible circulation within
    your area.

    All vehicular traffic from Nottingham should approach Sheffield along the
    Ml motorway, leaving it at Junction 34 and taking the A630 towards
    Sheffield. Coaches and transit vans will park in Herries Road where they
    will set down their passengers and pick them up again after the match.
    Cars will be allowed to park on the numerous side roads in the Rutland Road
    area (please see attached maps).

    The route will be adequately signed by the AA and police officers will be
    on duty throughout the route and in the parking areas to assist in the
    arrangements.

    All supporters should time their journey to arrive at Sheffield between
    1030 and 1400 hours to'ensure that they are in the ground for kick off at
    1500 hours.

    fetes will be open from 1100 hours and pre-match entertainment and
    refreshments will be available inside the ground.

    Supporters may expect to be searched at the turnstiles and will not be
    allowed in the ground if they are in possession of bottles, cans or any
    articles likely to cause injury. A copy of Sheffield Wednesday's Ground
    Regulations is enclosed.

    There will be a strict segregation policy enforced on the day. Liverpool
    supporters will occupy the north and west side of the ground. Nottingham
    supporters will occupy the spion kop and south side of the ground. Any
- 2 -



supporter or group of supporters occupying other than their designated area
will be ejected under the ground regulations.

This is an all ticket fixture. Tickets will NOT be on sale at the ground
and any person not having a ticket should refrain from making the journey.

Your assistance is greatly appreciated.

Yours sincerely

Dear Sir,

Re:    Regina -v- H. M. Coroner for South Yorkshire Ex. Parte Stringer & Others
       High Court of Justice, Queens Bench Division
       5th November 1993

I refer to my telephone conversation this morning with a member of your staff and write to
request a copy of the transcript in connection with the above hearing, which I believe took
place on the 5th November 1993.

As I explained on the telephone, Mr. Turnbull, the Coroner for West Yorkshire (Western
District), is to resume the inquest into the death of Anthony David Bland, another victim
of the tragedy at the Hillsborough Stadium who died on the 3rd March 1993, and a date has
now been fixed for Tuesday, 21st December 1993. The Coroner would obviously like sight
of the transcript prior to that date and I would be grateful if arrangements could be made
to provide the copy as a matter of urgency. If you could please telephone beforehand with
details of the fee involved for providing such copy I would be very grateful.

Yours faithfully,




Administrative Officer

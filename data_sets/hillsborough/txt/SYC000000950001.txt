  Dear                    ,

  Re: Anthony David Bland, deceased

  I think I mentioned this to you when we met last Saturday, but now I am writing as a matter
  of courtesy formally to tell you that I am resuming the inquest into the death of Tony Bland
  on Tuesday, 21st December. I am expecting it to be fairly low key and to last about a day.

  Kind regards,

Bear Br. Howe,

1 refer to my conversations with you about Mr. Bland who I
understand from you is in & vegetative state but not brain
dead.

You indidated to me that in ycrur view and that of consultant
colleagues, there was no hope of recovery for this younft man
and it was felt in the circumstances efforts to prolong life
should be abandoned and that he should be allowed to pass
away peacefully• I understood t x m you that his family
are aware of your pevposed management.

In this connection, you mentioned that it was proposed to
discontinue medical treatment and also to withdraw food and
water which I presume is in fact being supplied by nasogastric
tube or possibly intravenously.

You contacted me in order to obtain ay views on your proposed
action. You had already spoken to Jfe. Turnbull, who had
suggested you speak to me.

I explained to you that I as coroner had no jurisdiction over
any living person, and that my jurisdiction would (assuming
that the ease were transferred to me) arise only when the young
man was dead.

I did however say that in my view your proposed course of conduct
was one which I could not approve and indeed I felt that you were
exposing yourself to a very serious risk of criminal liability.
I suggested that before you undertook any steps, you should obtain
clear legal advice, and that in any case X neither could condone
or approve your suggested course of conduct.

In a later conversation with you yesterday, you confirmed that you
would not take m y of the steps mentioned except that it was
your intention not to administer antibiotic therapy.

I have since had. an opportunity to consider the raaiief ftt-^hc-r
and discuss it with senior members of the West Midlands Police
who are engaged in the Hillsborough disaster enquiry.

In the light of these discussions X am now writing to you to
confirm that strictly, I as coroner am not involved in this matter
until the death has been repotted to me. However, as it has been
raised with me and X consider that it has serous implications
both ethically and legally, X must again make it clear that
X cannot countenance, condone, approve or give consent to any

                                                          cont*d
  i                                             2^th Av.gu.st       89.

action or inaction which co\ild be or could be construed as
Leirif’
      '
      ;designed or intended to shorten or terminate the life
of tbi.ri young man. This particularly applies to the witholding
of tlie necessities of life, stash as food and drink* slothing
and vanath and, on reflection, this includes medical care,
including antibiotic cover where necessary*

1 would be grateful if you could please reply by return and
confirm that this is understood, and that no such activity or
inactivity will be undertaken in relation to this patient.

I am aware that there are occasions vfhen fpople are terminally
ill, as,y froia cancer, that a clinical decision nay be taken not
to seek to prolong life by heroic aedioal intervention, and
this aay include the withholding of say antibiotic drugs.

    problem in this case is that although this young nan may
bs severely brain damaged, it is clear from what you said that
he is not brain dead in accordance with the published criteria.
In fact, X am very concerned whether it is possible, in the
light of the information you have given me, to even considers
this patient as terminally ill.

I am in some difficulty, as I have never seen this patient and
m not responsible for his clinical management, and in any case
hare no jurisdiction, as he is not dead. However, it must be
apparent that there most be a difference if he dies as a result
of say hypoxic brain damage or if he dies as a result of some
"new act or omission” implemented because it is thought that
his prognosis and quality of life are such he might be better
dead than alive.

You will also appreciate that any clinical decisions which you
may take are of course your sole i-esponsibility, and you have
always to be in a position to defend them and to show that they
comply with the law of this land. X have no doubt that your
legal advisors will be able to guide you further in this matter.

X think that X might just mention that if you feel that you need
clarification of the legal position with regard to any or all of your
proposed actions, then&t mi$ht be worth asking your legal advisors
whether it would be possible to make an application to the High
Court for directions and guidance.

Please note that a copy of this letter is being sent to Mr. Turnbull,
Her Majesty's Coroner for West Yorkshire, the Solicitor to the
Regional Health Authority, the Secretary of the Medical Protection
SAoiety (who X understand axe your Defence tfnion) and the West
Midlands Police®

Dear Mr. Dorries,

 Re: Tony Bland - Hillsborough Disaster

Thank you for your letter of yesterday’s date. I entirely agree with the course which we
discussed on the telephone. I have in fact sent a message through my officer to Tony
Bland’s parents that I would welcome a meeting, even at this stage, to discuss the present
position and they seem to have welcomed this. I will let you know the outcome.

I will certainly make it plain in due course that your involvement was peripheral but that,
in order to be absolutely correct, you have felt, and I have agreed, that it would be
inappropriate for you to conduct the inquest.

 I look forward to contact after your holiday and the planned lunch.

 Kind regards.

 Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr Turnbull

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
TONY BLAND____________

I refer to our telephone conversation on Friday morning and am writing to
thank you for agreeing to deal with the Inquest which will have to follow the
death of this young man.

As I indicated to you over the telephone I had some involvement on the day of
the disaster (primarily the care of relatives) through my work for a
voluntary agency.  I was subsequently involved in both Lord Justice Taylor's
enquiry and the Inquest giving advice to a Medical Defence Union.  Although
my role was fairly peripheral, I am sure it should still be regarded as a bar
to me hearing any further Inquest relating to the disaster.

I must confess that even dealing with the requests from relatives for copies
of statements gave me pause for thought, but I took the view that there was a
considerable difference in the administrative matter of dealing with
paperwork (which has to be in my possession) and any form of normal judicial
function such as an Inquest.  I have even discussed this with Gillian
Harrison at the Home Office who agreed that there would be no conflict of
interest provided I was not making decisions about statements of former
clients.

Nonetheless, I am a little cautious about the choice of wording that might be
used in any explanation given publicly as one is aware that certain people
are very ready to take things out of context.  It may well be that everyone
will regard it as perfectly natural that you deal with the case but if an
explanation is requested I would be grateful if you could make it quite plain
that my previous involvement at Hillsborough was purely peripheral.

Very many thanks for your assistance.  When I return from holiday at the end
of September I will telephone you with a view to lunch one day.

Yours sincerely

TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH MR. ROGER HARRABIN B.B.C.   RADIO
Tel: 061 200 2113.


He rang to say he wanted to speak to be about my interpretation of the
law relating to Anthony Bland.

He rang while I was out, I called him back.  I explained that I was
not in a position to discuss the law because it was outside my province,
that I dealt with people when they had died and not while they were
still alive.  I pointed out to him that what he was really asking me
was to give him a explanation of the law on euthanasia and that his
own legal experts should be able to do that.

He asked again whether I would be willing to give him my understanding
of the legal position and I said that I didn't think that would be
appropriate.  He said that there were some Lawyers who seemed to indicate
that if the feeding tube were removed this would be alright whilst others
took the view that it would n o t . I said it was precisely because of
this problem that I wasn't willing to give him a comment.

I also pointed out to him that the issue as to whether or not a crime
had been committed would not be one primerily for me but for the D.P.P.
He asked me whether if the feeding tube was removed and the case was then
refered   to me  having died whether I would refer  it to the D.P.P?
I said I would though I qualified the reply by saying that this was based
on some assumptions and of course it all depended on the circumstances.
I then pointed out to him that I could not go any further than that.
He asked me why it was that I had got involved at all with Anthony Bland
and why I had been consulted in the first place.   I explained to him
that Anthony was not in my jurisdiction, that if he now died another
Coroner would have to deal with the case, the only reason why I had
come involved was because at the time when this issue was raised Iwas in
the middle of the Hillsborough Inquests and if Anthony had died then no
doubt the other coroner would have asked me to take the case over and
deal with it as part and parcel of the whole proceeding.   The situation
of course has now completely changed.

He asked me whether I thought that other Coroners would take the same
view as I did with regard to referral and I said I could not possibly
answer that.  He wanted to know if I was a Chief  Coronor in Sheffield
I explained to him that each district had  one Coroner though there
were deputies and assistants, that the country was divided into
districts and that all Coroners within their own districts were of
equal status.

FILE NOTE DATED 1.9.91.

Mr. Limb from the Yorkshire Post phoned me in the previous week, I think
on Wednesday.      He wanted to talk to me about Anthony Bland.       He assured
me that there wereKt publishing any articles about the matter because
the Blands didnt want it nor was he seeking to obtain an interview, but
merely trying to get some background information.£?n the strict
understanding that anything that I said would not be published.
I agreed to talk to him for a few minutes.           He asked me whether the
Blands had been in touch with me about Euthanasia for Anthony.
I said as far as I could recollect, I had not had any direct contact
with the Blands (I said I would have to check the files to be absolutely
sure) but I had been in correspondence with a doctor who was looking
after him on this issue.
I made it clear to the reporter that at the time when this was raised
which was quite a few months ago, I had indicated that no way could I
possibly countenance^iny^action which would constitute a criminal
offence.      Furthermore I had no jurisdiction in the matter because I
d i d n ’t deal with cases until after a person had died and in any case,
the case was outside my jurisdiction now.           Indeed it was then, but I did not
correspond about it because I was in the middle of the Hillsborough
inquests.      The situation is of course now different.
I did recollect j-n erenvcro-a-t-i'on w rth- h-±m that I made a reference to
Anthony Bland at the Interim Inquests on the 4th of May 1991 and that
one of my officers I think contacted the family to check that they would
not object to him being mentioned.         Again I said I would have to double
check the files.      I made it quite clear that I was not in a position to
give legal advice either to him or to anybody else on what could or
could not be done in certain circumstances.           That it was a matter for
the clinicians to be satisfied that they were doing the right thing and
they were complying with the law and that they should contact their own
 legal advisors if they wanted to.        He asked me what I thought about
witholding antibiotics if a chest infection occurred or witholding food.
I repeated what I had said about legal advice and the clinicians getting
their own legal advice from their own lawyers.           I said that it was not
unknown that terminally ill patients were not aggressively treated.
 That each case had to be decided as appropriate.          In any case I could
 see a very substantial difference between witholding food and not
 treating somebody with antibiotics for say p n e u m o n i a     . that person
being in a terminal state.       He again tried to press me on this and I
 refused to get involved in any legal argument-!* I did say that I was
very very sorry for the Blands.         That it was a dreadful situation for
 them to be in, but that it was clear that as Anthony was not on a
ventilator but was breathing spontaneously, he obviously did not fulfil
 the brain stem criteria of death.        Mr. Limb then wanted to know whether
 I could perhaps help him with anybody who might be able to give him some
 legal advice on the ins and outs of the problems associated with
Anthony.      I said that I couldn ’t though Dr. Howard might be able to
help.      An alternative would be to get in touch with the Law Society and
 ask them if they knew of any experts w h o m he could approach.
We finished the conversation by me saying how very sorry I was for this
 family and how in some many ways I would have liked to have seen them
 but it was a difficult problem in all the circumstances for me to do.

        Dear Dr Popper

        ANTHONY DAVID BLAND - DOB 21.09.70
        IN-PATIENT ON WARD 3, AIREDALE GENERAL HOSPITAL

        I am sure you will be saddened to know that there has been no change in poor
        Anthony Bland's condition. He    remains in a persistent vegetative state. His
        sister and mother only visit intermittently but his father still comes and sits
        by his body twice a week. From time to time, he becomes distressed and
        disturbed by his son's condition.   I see him for a I
        about once a month and I know he goes to see his general practitioner about
        once a month as well.

         I hope you find the enclosed viewpoint from the Lancet of interest.   If you
         have already seen it and read it, please forgive me for troubling you with a
         photocopy.

         Kind regards

         Yours sincerely

    Shank you very much for your letters of the 23rd and 31st
    of ^August. I have particularly nefcad the second paragraph
    of your letter of the 31st of August.

    :
     /
    We discussed this matter again on the 1st of September
    whan X spoke to you regarding our concern that the parents
    of Anthony felt that the police were in some way to blame
    for the management of this young man.

    You. very kindly fflade it clear.that you have explained to
    the Blands that this was not the case and that you would
    make it clear to them again*

    As you had raised the pacoblea of i^turedinanagement with
    me it -was essential that I should point out that this was
    outside ay jurisdiction and that clinical decisions and
    jaaaagement must he for you hut that they have to be reached
    or taken -within the tenas and provisions of English Law
    both civil and criadjaal* Shis of course is not only in your
    interests hut also in the interests of Tony’s family.

    I m obliged to you for the copy papex*s which you have sent.
    Although I would like to comment on these, I think in all
    the circumstances surrounding this matter it would be
    inappropriate for m to do so at the present time and I
    hope that you will understand the reason for this.

    Yours sincerely,

the circulation with Dr. Howe before I undertook it, and he

   Dear Dr Popper

   ANTHONY DAVID BLAND - DOB 21.09.70
   AT PRESENT ON WARD 3, AIREDALE GENERAL HOSPITAL

   Thank you for your letter of 24 August 1989 about     Mr Bland, which arrived this
   morning.

   This is just a short note to let you know that this young man's medical and
   nursing care continues unchanged from the course it has followed over the last
   four months. He remains unconscious and is being fed by nasogastric tube. He
   has recently had a course of antibiotic for a chest infection.

   I would be interested to hear your personal comments on the American
   Neurologists' statement on persistent vegetative state which I sent to you. It
   seems to me that there is an important principle to be tested in this and
   similar cases, but I do not think I am the man to test it. I will ask the
   Editor of the Journal of Medical Ethics if he would like to commission some
   articles on this subject in the hope of stimulating some discussion in the
   profession. The BMA Ethics Committee might also like to look into this matter
   or perhaps a committee of one of the royal colleges.  Patients like this have
   been kept alive in a vegetative state for periods in excess of ten years, at
   great personal cost to their families   and the care staff. They also consume
   resources which could be used for people who have a chance of recovery, or at
   least relief of their suffering, for there can be no doubt that someone who is
   unconscious can not suffer. It may be that, in time, the way to deal with this
   distressing condition will become clear but, for the moment, Mr Bland's family
   and the nursing staff at Airedale General Hospital will continue to suffer and
   are likely to do so for many years since the rest of his body systems are
   undamaged.

      Dear Dr Popper

      ANTHONY DAVID BLAND - DOB 21.09.70
      AT PRESENT ON WARD 3, AIREDALE GENERAL HOSPITAL

      Thank you for your very full and frank conversation today.

      In view of what you told me about the police attitude, we have not withdrawn
      artificial feeding in the unfortunate patient we discussed.

      Please find enclosed photocopies of two articles about persistent vegetative
      state after brain damage. The article from the Lancet in 1972 was the first
      thorough description of the syndrome and a proposal for a satisfactory name,
      which is now widely used. The second article is a statement of the American
      Academy of Neurology's attitude to the care and management of patients with
      persistent vegetative state and it is an attitude which I, myself, would want
      for me or my family or any patients with whom I am in contact.

      Our patient's family were satisfied that there had been no sign of improvement
      and feel very strongly that prolonging this boy's life by artificial feeding is
      no longer justifiable. They do not, however, want to see me get into trouble
      over it and so they are prepared to continue seeing him being fed but do not
      wish us to treat any infections, should they arise.

      I would be interested to hear your comments on the American Neurologists'
      statement and would also be interested to hear what the local police think
      about it as well. This is an important and distressing subject and it would be
      helpful if there were clear guidelines to help doctors and relatives deal with
      the problem.

      I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.

      Thank you once again.

      Kind regards

      Yours sincerely

Dear Br. Robson,

Thank you very much for your letter of the 1st of September,
the contents of which I h a w noted.

I think it would be very helpful if I could see a copy of
the booklet which you are preparing. This sounds a very
interesting idea and al#it well be of use in other situations
as well.

Dear Dr. Popper,

Thank you for your helpful letter of the 16th August which I received on
return from leave today.   There have been several developments since my
letter of the 27th July.

The situation about the report displayed in a library was clarified to me by
one of the parents. As you point out, this has now been withdrawn.

Several of the post mortem reports which you sent to solicitors have been
photocopied and sent to relatives for the purpose of bereavement counselling.
I have found this situation satisfactory and therefore now require no personal
copies of post mortem reports.

Following a request from social workers and parents I am preparing a glossary
of medical terms which are commonly used in post mortem reports. I do not
think this will interfere with any potential legal proceedings. However, if
you wish to have a copy before the booklet is distributed to social workers
and relatives please contact me as soon as possible.

Yours sincerely,

      Dear Dr Popper

      ANTHONY DAVID BLAND - DOB 21.09.70
      AT PRESENT ON WARD 3, AIREDALE GENERAL HOSPITAL

      Thank you for your very full and frank conversation today.

      In view of what you told me about the police attitude, we have not withdrawn
      artificial feeding in the unfortunate patient we discussed.

      Please find enclosed photocopies of two articles about persistent vegetative
      state after brain damage. The article from the Lancet in 1972 was the first
      thorough description of the syndrome and a proposal for a satisfactory name,
      which is now widely used. The second article is a statement of the American
      Academy of Neurology's attitude to the care and management of patients with
      persistent vegetative state and it is an attitude which I, myself, would want
      for me or my family or any patients with whom I am in contact.

      Our patient's family were satisfied that there had been no sign of improvement
      and feel very strongly that prolonging this boy's life by artificial feeding is
      no longer justifiable. They do not, however, want to see me get into trouble
      over it and so they are prepared to continue seeing him being fed but do not
      wish us to treat any infections, should they arise.

      I would be interested to hear your comments on the American Neurologists'
      statement and would also be interested to hear what the local police think
      about it as well. This is an important and distressing subject and it would be
      helpful if there were clear guidelines to help doctors and relatives deal with
      the problem.

      I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.

      Thank you once again.

      Kind regards

      Yours sincerely

FILE NOTE   1.9.89


Dr. Howe rang me at Q.M.C. I thanked him for calling.   I explained to
him that we were disturbed because apparently the Blands were blaming
the police for the fact that care of their son was proceeding.   Dr.
Howe said that he was very sorry about this.   He had tried to make"it
clear to them that this was not in fact a police initiated action but
that he obviously had not succeeded in putting this accross.   He would
try and see the Blands again and make it absolutely clear   that this did
not arise, or was not the fault of the police.

I repeated to Dr. Howe that one of the prime motovating factors had
been that we, I was very concerned that he should not imperil hims e l f
by undertaking or failing to undertake any actions which could lay him
open to legal process or even the Blands.  I pointed out that the
situation was bad enough, that it would be infinet|?y worse if such
consequences were to flow, Dr. Howe entirley agreed.

Dr. Howe confirmed that he fully understood the reason for the points
which I had made, that he had received my letter and that he had
replied to it.

He also mentioned that he understood that the Blands had been advised
that they perhaps should make their lad a Ward of Court and that they
might apply to the court in order to force him to take certain actions.
I said that this was obviously something which they would have to
  nsider for themselves,  Isaid that this was one of the reasons I had
f ntioned in my letter that he might like to consider making application
  for directions if he thought it was appropriate.

I expressed to him how much we felt for him and for the family in this
terrible situation in which they find themselves , but that ......... we
were very concerned that nothing should be done which could fall foul
of English Law.  He asked me if I had any views on the AmericanMarologists
position and I explained  that I was not in a position to comment on
that with all the circumstances.  He said he quite understood that.
We left it that he would go and ss the Blands in the evening and try
and make it clear that the police would not be blamed for this.   He
did in passing mention that the Blands on the whole blamed the police
anyway for the whole disaster and that this might be some of the reasoning.
He also indicated that on the whole they hads*tT been a very remarkable
family with very little i n In i t n I .

that t M s man was brain dead.   He had explained to Mr. Howe
that in the circumstances of tMs being a Hillsborough case,
he would wxpect me to take tMs case over and in those circumstances,
Mr. Turnbull would go along with aoytMng wMch I agreed with.
Mr. Turnbull made it quite clear that he had not understood
that t M s man was not brain dead and he would have taken a
different line if that had been in M s perception.      He also
said that Mr. Howe said that he was going to deal with the
matter when he returned from M s holiday wMch Jim found a
little surprising if in fact the man was brain dead, that he
had made no further comment on it.

Hr. Barker apparently had been a coroner in Dr. Price’s area in
London until he transferred to the M.P.S.     I said that I was
ringing because I was sending him^a copy of the letter to Dr. Howe,
one of his members. I wasn*t quite sure whether Dr. Howe had been
in touch but I felt it was important that a copy of the letter should
go to them.   I explained briefly the situation and I said that obviously
it was a matter for them, but no doubt they would want to consider
what advice if any they gave to Dr. Howe.     Hr. Barker thanked me
for getting in touch with him.   I explained that I was ringing so
that when the letter arrived in the morning there would be somebody
who would have some idea as to why it was sent, particular as I
did not know who Dr. Howe might or might not have contacted.
He. Barkea^aentioned that he had been one of the doctors supporting
a Dr/Handy^in the case in Derbyshire and that in that case quite
a loxHaSbeen made of the question of feeding and not feeding
the infant.   He mentioned that treatment of course was a matter
of clinical judgement but food and water was perhaps in a slightly
different class. I explained that I was not really in a position
to sake any comment on this, and that I felt perhaps in this case
even medical care should be maintained (see letter).    He felt
that it was obviously inappropriate for me to seek to give
advice on management apart from the sort of advice which I had
giTen such as to get in touch with the Defence Organisation.
He also could see the point that my jurisdiction did not arise
until after whoever was concerned was dead.

Telephone conversation with M r . J. Tyson of Linskills ______________

I queried his reference to Legal Aid for the inquest, I said that I
wasn't aware that this was available.  He said they had Legal Aid for
civil proceedings and he felt this covered getting information though
he realised it wouldn't cover him for attending the inquest.  I said it
was a matter entirely for him but I though I would just point it out.

Telephone conversation with Dr. Howe, Airdale                          Hospital 0535 5251
ext. 460 (secretary extension).

Conversation at about 11.00 a.m.                 23.8.89 re: Mr. Bland.

Dr. Howe rang to say that this was a Hillsborough individual who had
unfortunatly suffered severe hypoxic brain damage.  He was in a
vegative state.  He opened and shut his eyes he appeared to sleep, he
grunted but there did not seem to be any       — activity and what
is more there was no hope of a recovery.

Dr. Howe said that in consultation with the family they felt that the
kindest thing would be to allow this you ngster to die and they were
therefore proposing to cease all active medical treatment and in
addition to stop giving him fluids and food.

He said he had spoken to Dr. Turnbull who had said that he should
speak to me.

I explained to Dr. Howe that my jurisdiction did not arise until a
person was dead but that I was not at all happy with what he was saying
that no way could I give my consent to it.

Further more I considered that he was laying himself open to considerable
risk.

He mentioned that this matter had been discussed in America and that
the consensus of the conference had been what they were proposing had
been both ethical and legal.

I still maintained that although it was strictly nothing to do with me bet:
because I had no jurisdiction, nevertheless I certainly could not agree
with it and I didn't and certainly would not authorise it.   He said
that he would consult with the Regional Health Authority Solicitor
and also his defence union, legal people      I thought would be very
advisable.                               oUe*-
I said that I would be meeting with somebody late in the day and perhaps
raise the point with them.



  had a word with Malcolm from West Midlands Police and put the
to him, he entirely agreed with me that withholding his food and water
would lead the doctor open to various areas of charges.  I asked if he
would mention it to Mervyn and see if he had any different or alternative
views.

I felt that it was a dangerous pgesiTTSTtt it this was permissable and— eou-ld
cans.Q al 1. -e n d . I was not very happy with i t .



I telephoned Dr. Howe back at about 12.30 and explained to him that I
had spoken with the West Midlands Police and their view was that
withholding food and water was definitly going too far and would lay
him open to serious charges.   He expressed a little bit of surprise at
this view but he was grateful that I had rung and told him.   He said
that %5e-y would not do anything other that the withholding of active
medical treatment e.g. antibiotics.   In the meantime he had already
spoken to the regional solicitor who wasn't much help but he would
get in touch with his Medical Protection Society to get their advice.
He would also send me a copy of the article.

FILE NOTE   23.8.89

TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH DR. HOWE, AIRDALE HOSPITAL


I spoke to him and explained to him that I was writing him a fairley
firm letter in which I was reiterating my advice and that on reflection
I was very doubtful whether even the goal of antibiotics was
appropriate.   I said I would be grateful if he would take no steps
whatever of the nature which he discussed with me certainly until
he had seen my letter and even then, I didn't think that he should
do i t . My very strong advice was that he should not embark upon
the course of conduct which he had suggested as I thought he was
laying himself open to very serious criminal charges.

He mentioned that he was posting the document from America to me,
where they had seemed to have sorted things out.  I pointed out
that their legal system was different.  That the States varied
amongst themselves.  That their decisions were only persuasive and
that we were bound by what happened here.  I said that I realised
that he was motivated by wanting to help the lad.  He said it wasn't
even so much the lad but the family, as the lad was beyond help.

I said that I would send copies to the Medical Protection Society,
the Area Health Authority Solicitor who I had understood him to say
had not been very helpful.  He agreed with this and he also agreed
with me when I said that I thought that the Area Health Authority
ought perhaps to take an interest . He said he had not yet spoken
to the M.P.S. because having decided to take no steps, he didn't
see any need to consult them.  I said I thought it would be a good
idea if he did.
 The meeting was arranged in order to discuss the problem arising
 out of Hr. Howe’s approach to me regarding the management of
 Mr. Bland, a patient of Ms at Airdale Hospital, who had been
 seriously brain damaged as the result of the Hillsborough Disaster.
 I explained that Dr. Howe had contacted me yesterday. That I was
 aware that there was a patient up there because I had been informed
 by Vest Midlands of this some time agat I assumed that he would
 inform me that tMs patient had died.
 In fact what he told me was that the patient was severely brain
 damaged but not brain dead but that there was no hope of
 recovery for Mm. That he had, inconsultation with the family,
 felt that the proper course was to discontinue therapy and that
 he was proposing to not feed or water tMs young man, so that
 eventually he would die.
 I formed the impression that Dr. Howe was motivated by compassion
 for the family and for the young man. I explained from my
 experience in hospitals that it was quite likely that the iMtiatlve
 had come from Dr. Howe but that he would have tried to carry
 the family with M m before embarking upon any unusual course.
 I did say from m y experience that occasionally it happened that
 if the families were anxious, the treatment should not be unnecessarily
 prolonged in order to reduce the amount of suffering of the loved one.
 I also told themthat I checked with Mr. Turnbull. He had In fact
 spoken to Sr. Howe some three weeks previous and he had understood
 Dr. Howe to say that the patient was brain dead, but he did concede
 that he mi^it have misunderstood him. He agreed with me that if
 he was not brain dead tMs completely changed the situation. He also
 said that what he had told Sr. H owe was that on the assumption that
 he was brain dead, he would go along with whatever would be the
 right tMng to do.
 W e discussed the matter at some length. In particular we raised
 a question whether if the initiative had arisen from the family
 whether there could be some ulterior motive.
 I felt that it was quite possible the family would want to reduce
 the suffering of their son and also that tMs would also reduce
 their own distress 'as finality sometimes was a good tMng..
(Mr. Jones in fact suggested the latter point). On the other hand
 I did not think that there would be any financial advantage as it
 was likely that from the point of view of recovering damages ( assuming
 of course that damages were recoverable), the young manwas probably
 worth more alive than dead because of the various costs, looking
 after Mmetc.
 We spent some time discussing the question of whether tMs could
 possibly be a conspiracy and in particular whether the fact that he
 had discussed the matterwith me and Mr. Turnbull and the fiegional Solicitor
I pointed towards a conspiracy as opposed to it,
I had felt   from   the word go that the   inquirant Dr. Howe was   a   perfectly
innoceftt one.   That he was trying to sort out the medical, legal and
ethical issues involved with this case.       That he was testing the
waters and sounding out opinions and that I really didn't think
there was very much criminality in the matter except possibly in
the very theoretical way that if he had used the word proposed,
one had to decide whether in fact that was equivalent so to speak
to an attempt.      I didn't feel that this would cut very much ice
with a Jury and doubted very much whether a conviction could be
obtained, particularly as I had truthfully had to say that I could
not remember the precise form of wording which he used and my
impression was that he was telling me what he was intending me to
do and awaiting to hear my reaction.
Mr. Beechey particularly felt that generally speaking, with conspiracies,
matters *were kept quiet whereas in this particular case, it was perfectly
plaon that Dr. Howe was discussing the matter widely.        This of course
had the advantage that he was covering himself and obtaining some
sort of assurance or insurance regarding his conduct but on the other hand
it also pointed against any possibility         of conspiracy.
On balance we felt that this matter didnot really give rise to criminal
aspects provided of course that nothing untoward was done with
regard to the management of the young man.
We discussed the question of medical treatment briefly, but this aspect
of it is very difficult because of course we haven't got his day
to day management nor ever seen Mm, as I have stated inmy letter.
We discussed whether the North Yorkshire Force should be involved
and in the end decided that we would be best dealing with that aspect
of the matter if once I had written to West Midlands, they would write
to North Yorkshire to keep them informed, bearing in mind that this
issue is within their jurisdiction or area.
We also discussed whether I should get in touch with the Regional
Solicitor and Dr. Howe.     We felt that this might be a good thing
and /^?^ic^itri&ious that Dr. Howe should know that the letter
was coming because I had no wish to either upset or offend him.
We then discussed the letter.     A few modifications were made to it
in the li$it of the discussion, and the meeting then broke up.

at a o m m 10 past 5.


He said he was concerned about the conversation I had had with Dr. Howe.
He thought it was absolutely essential that I write to Dr. Howe and
make it clear that his proposed actions were not acceptable. He thought
this was necessary both to protect myself and also themselves.     He
wanted a copy of this letter.    He felt that if we had to ask for
confirmation in writing from Dr. Howe and this was not forthcoming
that one would have to take it up with the Health Authority etc.
I subsequently rang Mervyn again and had a further discussion with him.
He said that he had had a long talk with some of his colleagues
and they were very worried about it, though everything depended on
the precise form of wording which Dr. Howe had used.    In the end
he felt that the best thing would be if we met to-morrow at Sheffield
to discuss all the aspects and also decide what form the letter should
take.   I agreed to meet with him at 9.30.
I tried to ring Jim Turnbull but he was out.    Apparently he would
be available at 9 in the morning.

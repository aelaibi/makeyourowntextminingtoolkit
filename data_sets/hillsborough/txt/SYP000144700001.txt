                I am an Inspector in the South Yorkshire police currently serving

                with the Complaints and Discipline Department.

                On Thursday 12 December 1991, I prepared a sketch showing the inside

                of the Police Control Box which was in use at the Sheffield Wednesday

                Football Ground on 15 April 1989.                                                                    The sketch is a line drawing

                traced from photograph no.2 of a photographic album Ref MGL 2.

                Added to the sketch are details of the various CCTV monitors and the

                location of their respective cameras situated around the ground.

                I can identify the sketch plan by the label attached which I have

                signed.

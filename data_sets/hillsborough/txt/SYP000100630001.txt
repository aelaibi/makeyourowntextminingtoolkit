            On S a t u r d a y    '15 April        1989     I commenced            duty at D o n c a s t e r    DHG at 083 0

            hours.

            I was      in charge         of Serial          number 28 of the Semi Final                      detail       at

           Hillsborough,              the     r e s p o n s i b i l i t y of w h i c h was        close   off a number            of

            streets       off L e p p i n g s      Lane wit h b a r riers             to prevent          persons     attending

            The    fol l o w i n g    o f f i c e r s were     on my serial            and    performed        duties at          the

            In charge        of my sector was                I n spector S e l w o o d of E D i vision.

By this      time      the    first     supporters           were    beginning             to a r r i v e    in small

numbers.         By    12.30pm       large     numbers         of persons were m a k i n g                  their way

a l o n g L e p p i n g s L ane     towards         the ground.           M any of t hem wer e               d r i nking

fro m    cans an d        bottles and        carafes         of wine,          and     I saw      one y o u t h

drinking       directly         from a 7 pint             'party     can".           Many     supporters           were

asking      for the         nearest      pub and       o f f - l i c e n c e and whether               they were         open

to    suppo rte r s .

By about       2pm there were             hundreds          of supporters              in L e p p i n g s    Lane

standing       and sitting           on walls         etc.,     drinking,            m a n y w ere w a l k i n g        up

and     down asking          for spare t i c k e t s        from others              but     there were

apparently         very      few spare tickets              for sale.

I spoke      to m a n y Li v e r p o o l     s u p p o r t e r s and some Notts.                  Forest

s u p p o r t e r s who     had tickets        for     the L i v erpool            end.      M ost      were      f r i endly

and     in good humour a l t h o u g h some were                    drunk.           I advised          some      groups

in i t i a l l y that       they    w o u l d not    be   per m i t t e d     to     enter       the    g r o u n d either

w i t h alc ohol       or    drunk     but as       larger      numbers a p p e a r e d           it    became a

w a s t e d exercise.

To    the   best      of my k n owledg e        there wer e          no      incidents           of d i s o r d e r     in

the     vicinity       of my serials           points.          The m a i n         p r o b l e m was    one      of

litter w i t h        l i t erally hundreds            of    beer and          pop     cans a n d       bottles and

chip     papers       etc.    strewn about.

This was       c o m m e n t e d upon to me           by an e l d e r l y          lady    resident         of

B i c k e r t o n R o a d who      said she was           84 years a n d had lived                     there most            of

her     life and       had never see n suc h a mess                    of      cans       etc.    at a n y       previous

game     or event at Hills b o r o u g h .

By about 2.30pm              the bulk of the              s u p p o r t e r s who      had b een m i l l i n g a bout

in L e p p i n g s Lane       drifted t oward a n d             into the           ground.           There       was    then

a    lull   of about         ten minu t e s w h e n         it a p p e a r e d that         there       were      very few

supporters         left      outside      the ground.

At a b o u t 2 . 4 0 p m     there was a s u d d e n surge                  of s u p p o r t e r s     coming a wing

L e p p i n g s Lane     toward       the ground,            man y of w h o m w e r e            running.             Some

were    still    carrying            cans and         bottles        of    beer an d         I saw some              pouring

it onto the        road as           they were moving.                    At     this     time      I was        still    on

the    barrier at B i c k e r t o n Road.                A short          time      later      I became aware,                  via

radio messages,              of    problems at           the L e p p i n g s L ane           entrance.               I step p e d

out    into L e p p i n g s Lan e and             could see the                e n t r a n c e and       that       it was a

mass    of bodies fro m              the     t u rnstiles        right         back     to   the     road an d         that

more    and more were a d d i n g                to   it.       There were            still      large         groups

ma k i n g their way          to the ground and                  I attempted             to slow down several

gro u p s who were           running        by pointing             out    that       there was           nowhere        for

them to go.            The    crowd and           crush at the             t u r n s t i l e s was        clearly

visible     but they          continued           regardless          to       rush a n d add            to    it.     The

m a j o r i t y of these          persons were male                 in late         teens,       e a r l y twenties             age

groups.       There was            ver y    little       shouting          or     c h a nting and all                seemed

intent on getting                 to the ground.

I then heard,           via       radio,       of m o u n t i n g    problems           inside       the ground.                I

h eard a call          for o f f i c e r s      to the       perimeter            track      but     thought          that      it

was    fighting/pitch              invasion.           T here were             no t r a n s m i s s i o n s      to the

contrary.        After a short                 time    there was a radio m e s s a g e                        for    further

a s s i s t a n c e at the ground.                I then made my w a y to the L e p p i n g s Lane

entrance where            I joined a number                  of other o f f icers.                   T here w e r e       still

some    supporters m i l l i n g about                 outside        the gates and a few w e r e                        still

arriving.        As     I arrived           some      people were              starting        to    leave          the ground.

S o m e were o b v i o u s l y shoc k e d and               upset and wer e              crying.              O t h e r s were

abus i v e and began s h o u t i n g at the                     officers          outside.           Comments          such as

"Black bastards",                 "You ' v e    done     it this time",                  "You're          to blame        for

this",     "You should all                 be a s h a m e d "       "You sh o u l d all             be    lo c k e d up",

"Why aren't you              in there          doing     something,             yo u o nly want               the m o n e y "

myself         were    held      outside         to m o n i t o r     the    crowd        leaving.          I believe

the      instruction           was     given verbally               by C h i e f    Inspector           Purdy,        who

was      the    only     senior        officer       I saw       at    that       time.         After     the    call       for

assistance            there      was    very      li t t l e    of an       intelligible            nature       pa s s e d

by radio.             Persons         were    transmitting             over       eac h    other        interspersed

by    silences         whe n     no    instructions             or d i r e c t i o n      were    given.         The

officers         outside         the    ground,         including myself,                  had    no     idea

whatsoever            what     was     happening         inside.            Initially           persons       who     were

shouting         and     swearing          at us w ere          spoken       to    firmly        and     threatened

wi t h    arrest,       however,           as mor e      reasonable           persons           began     to emerge

and      explain       to us        some     of what      had       happened        inside        we    began       to

appreciate            the r e a s o n      for    the    anger        directed         at us.

When      the    re s c u e    operation          was    complete           all    officers         wer e     then

called         into    the     North Stand           a bout      5-00       pm•     Onl y       t hen   did I b egin

to r e a l i s e      the     scale     of    the    problem          inside       the     ground       and     I saw the

profound         effect        which       it had on           some    of my       colleagues.              We were

left      to p o n d e r      for     sometime       before         we w ere       given        a s hort      de-brief

and      adjourned          to C l a y w h e e l s   Lane       to r e - m u s t e r      our    serials        and      await

transport          to r e t u r n      to D o n c a s t e r .

The      mood    of o f f i c e r s     was      very    quiet,          some were o b v i o u s l y m o v e d            by

the      events       and were         close      to tears.

We    returned         to D o n c a s t e r      and r e t i r e d       from duty at 7 - ^ 5             Pm /7____

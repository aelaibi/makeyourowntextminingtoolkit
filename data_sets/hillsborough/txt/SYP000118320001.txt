                    officers for general          briefing to all officers.      Dressed in plain

                    black shoes.

                    1040 hours paired up with PC Mou 1ding             (F2 CID Aide)^ for observations

                    in connection with theft of and from motor vehicles from Hillsborough

                    car park,     this   in turn being situate within Hillsborough Park, access

                    gained via Parkside Road near to its junction with Penistone Road.

                    This duty scheduled to be worked before,              during and after the g a m e .

                    This duty to be worked on foot,           one radio between two of us which was

                    tuned into channel          19 which was being monitored by a mobile CID

                    communication vehicle.

                    At time show I left the ground on foot and due to lack of people in

                    area at this time had a general           patrol    covering Parkside Road,

                    Middlewood Road and entire park area.

                    Together with PC Moulding           I liaised with Park patrol officers who
                                                                          PAGE      2.
                                                                          R 193

were on static duty at Hillsborough car park at the location

previously mentioned.         At this t ime there were very few pedestrians

and vehicles      in the area.    We maintained foot patrol    in and around

the Park up to      1.50pm not i ci ng ageneral but not excessive build      up

of pedestrian®      in the area.

1350 started to make our way from the Park area towards the Football

ground.     We walked along Parkside Road onto Penistone Road at which

time Penistone Road was full of supporters making their way to the

ground, many of these supporters having or appearing to have consumed

alcohol of differing        levels.   Quite a large number of these

supporters      carrying   cans of beer or lager with t h e m . General attitude

of the supporters at this time appeared to be quite friendly.              Having

worked both inside and outside the ground for the last 16 years

(including several Semi Final matches)         the general   build up seemed to

be as normal, and where the supporters were carrying beer and lager

it was anticipated this would be taken from them as they attempted

entry near to the turnstiles to the ground.

1400 Entered gymnasium at rear of North stand at Ground for prepared

hot m e a l .

1440 Left gymnasium to resume duties as before with PC Moulding.

Penistone Road      heavily congested with fans entering ground.         Due to

this we walked along Penistone Road North,         turned left onto Vere

Road,    left again into Leppings Lane where we intended to reach the

park via Catchbar Lane, Parkside Road.          As we turned onto Leppings

Lane    I saw a heavy build up of fans who were        very noisy with

continuous streams of fans still approaching           the ground along

Leppings Lane both from the direction of Middlewood Road and

Penistone Road North.        Many of these were rushing towards the ground

in obvious attempts to enter as soon as possible.            From   where I was

walking I could see that the entire driveway           leading to the entrances
                                                                    PAGE      3
                                                                    R 193

to the ground from this side were totally packed with people.        I

could see the Police Land Rover    parked on the perimeter of the crowd

and could plainly hear its public address system in operation and

recognised the voice of PC Buxton appealing to spectators not to push

as people were being squashed at the front of the turnstiles.        It was

obvious that many of the supporters were taking no notice and I could

hear some jeering at the appeals.    Many of the supporters     in this

area seemed to be the worse for drink.     I was unable to assist due to

the sheet numbers and the fact I was    in plain clothe®.    Upon looking

around I could see numerous supporters on Catchbar Lane who were on

the roof of the Police section house and others who were       climbing up

adjoining buildings and trees.     I went with the intention of removing

these for safety reasons whilst en route back to Hillsborough car park.

We managed to remove the fans from the buildings and shepherded them

along Catchbar Lane towards Penistone Road and away from the general

direction of the ground.     The time now would have been approximately

2.30/2.5 5 p m .

Upon reaching the Hillsborough car park area we again liaised with

the Park    patrol officers who stated their section was only three

quarters full and everything there was all    in order.     We then moved

on through the centre of the Park heading for the second car park

situate within the Park at the Hawksley Avenue entrance.

Whilst we were heading for the second car park I heard numerous

emergency vehicle sirens and saw Police/Ambulance vehicles heading

along Penistone Road towards the direction of the ground.        At this

time I realised that something was obviously not right and together

with PC Moulding    I ran through the Park towards the ground via

Parkside Road and Penistone Road North.     At this time there were

still people approaching the ground along Penistone Road North

although not in great numbers.    The large driveway within the clubs
ground which runs at the rear of the South stand was        littered with

fans who were approaching the Penistone Road North away from the

direction of Leppings Lane.     I continued running along Penistone

Road North heading for the Police Control        room at the rear of the

North stand and I entered the ground through the large access gate

which is situated between gate    ’0* and Vere Road.      I could see

numerous emergency vehicles scattered around the area and as I made

my way into the ground I could hear people screaming,          crying and

moaning.   I was still making my way to the gymnasium when X was

greeted by people with make shift stretchers made of advertisement

boards which were carrying    people some alive,     some obviously dead,

other people were carrying persons by their arms and legs.           I went

immediately into the gymnasium and commenced to assist with the

carrying of bodies and laying them out on the gym floor          checking for

vital signs.   Almost   immediately Doctors were in attendance

volunteering their services and were administering first aid to some

of the victims and certifying others to be dead.         As the bodies were

being placed in the g y m , the officers assisting with the carrying of

a particular body remained with that b o d y .    To try and form some kind

of order I assisted in making rows of the corpses as the numbers of

dead bodies coming   into the gym kept    increasing.    I am unable to

recall any of the times from hereon due to the sheer urgency of

events, and full attention having to be paid to other matters.

When the flow of bodies had stopped coming       into the gym I was

instructed to pair up with one of the Uniform officer standing by the

bodies and assist him with the searching of and trying to identify

that particular body.    This particular body that of a white       male was

unknown and although carrying property       had no means of

identification.   The officer   in this   instance   was PC 172 of ’C *

Division who at my request made a full       log of the property, clothing
                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                 R 193

         and description of the body.     The body then had the officers details

         attached thereto, was placed in a body bag and remained supervised by

         the Uniform officer.     I then moved on and joined up with PC Bo eking

         <F 1 CID) and remaining in the gym together we in turn numbered 12

         bodies   <37 to 48) having liaised with the respective Uniform officers

         standing by the relevant body.     When all of the bodies had been

         numbered a form of reception area was set up within the gym where

         people wishing to try and identify bodies would enter the area.           Upon

         coming through the door they were then met by a CID officer who would

         ask them to view a photograph of the faces of the dead bodies.           These

         photographs were all numbered (relevant to the body numbers)       and were

         pinned together on notice    boards within the reception    area. Having

         done this the relative or    friend would then furnish details    to

         another CID officer who would log all of the details with the

         corresponding number for the selected photo referring to a particular

         body.    The photos were then taken by hand to the area     where the

         bodies were laid numbered    awaiting viewing.     The body would then    be

         trolleyed to the reception area,       behind screens, accompanied by the

         Uniform officer who had remained with the body throughout.        Having

         viewed the body the relative or friend would then leave the reception

         area with the Uniform officer and a CID officer in order to supply a

         statement.     I remained throughout    in the reception area dealing with

         identification of photos and bodies.

         The    last person waiting to identify was seen at about 3.40am after

         which I was informed to return to FI CID office, where       I went off

         duty at 4am.

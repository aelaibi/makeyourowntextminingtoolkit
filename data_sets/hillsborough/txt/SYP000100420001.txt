   noon       the       turnstiles            opened          to    allow           fans       to       enter.           At   this    timf             I

   could       see       two        male    uniformed              officers              carrying             out

   entering             through           turnstiles           1 and 2              in    front          of me.           Shortly         before

   the       turnstiles              opened        several          stewards              in       reflective             jackets         were

   joined          by    someone           who     appeared             to     be    an       official          with a         UHF    type

   radio       and       together           they        unlocked             an     internal             perimeter            fence       which

   divided          the        access       from        the N o r t h          stand          and       the    West       stand.          I

  questioned               the       man    with        the    radio           as    I was          concerned             that      fans

  entering              later        when     it w o u l d         be    busy        would          have       access         to    either

  side.            I was        told       that        they    had       wrongly              positioned             two      markers             outside

  turnstiles              9     to    12 a n d         fans    entering              for       th e N o r t h        stand         would          be

  entering              th e    ground        on the W e s t             stand           end.           I was       also      told    that             it

  was        too    late        to    take        them       down       as     they       had       been       screwed         in    position.

  A    small        portable              type     aluminium             barrier              had       been    positioned            to          th e

  left        of    turnstiles              9 to        12 a n d m a n n e d             by    further          stewards            who       have

  been        requested              by    th e    man with             th e      radio.

  By     this       time        I was       aware        that       th e       Serial          Sergeant,             S g t.    Edwards,                was

  not        in the       vicinity.                I returned                to     my    position             a n d at t h a t       time             the

  turnstiles               opened          and     fans       began          to     enter.

  At     around          2pm(1400)            I wa s         aware       that        two       f an s     had       been      brought             in

  through           the        gate       leading        to    the       North           stand          immediately            to    my       rig h t .

  They were              in     possession              of    several             hundred           pounds          in    cash      and       a

  number           of    tickets           for     the m a t c h         that        were          suspected             to   be    forgeries.

  They       were        conveyed           to     the P o l i c e           room.

  A    short        time        after       this        as    I was          searching              a    fan    entering            the

  turnstile              at     t.        I heard        one       of    the        ticket              collectors            shout from               the

  direction              of     turnstile              4 or 5       " H e ’s g o t            no        ticket”. I            turned       and           saw

  a young           lad        in a       blue     track       suit          running           from       that       direction            and          on

  seeing           me    attempting               to    run a w a y          from        me.

I detained                 the    youth          who      was      in      possession                 of    a    ticket         stub        which           he

agreed           was       not    his       and after              obtaining                his       details         he    was          ejected            via

the        North       stand          gate       w h i c h was          by      this        time       beginning            to       be b l o c k e d

The        y out h was           ejected           as     opposed            to       being       arrested            or    taken           to       th e

numberous              other          fans       were        causing            problems              in th e        area       of       the

turnstile.                  I had          to    intervene              several             times          between         turnstile                 1 and

 As    I ha d a p p r o a c h e d            the     area      behind          turnstiles                 A to          G at     the      rear       of

 the    West      stand           I observed             about       10       persons             climbing              along       the       top    of

 These     fans w e r e            progressively making                            their          way     towards             the     roofs         of

 officers         working              at    these       turnstiles,                a    large          number           of     fans      who       were

 in a n a g g r e s s i v e            and     noisy mood were                     congregating                    around        turnstiles                A

 to G a n d       the       fans        who     had      been       on    top       of       the       gate        earlier          were       by

 this     time     on       th e       roof     of    turnstiles               A    to       G and        were          increasing             in

 numbers.

 The    fans      on       th e    r oo f     were       waving          what       appeared              to       be    complete             tickets

 with attached               stubs,           they       began       to       jump       from          th e    turnstile              roofs         in

 increasing            numbers.                I was      by t h i s          time       on my          own.            I decided             to

 r e m a i n at    this           point       as     it w a s       appearing                to    be     having           greater            control

 problems         that       at        turnstiles             1 to       12 w h e r e         I had           been       earlier.

 I was     being           approachd            by    larger         groups             of    fans        some          of w h o m       had

 dimbed        the         outer        gate       and    gained          access             from       the        turnstile             roofs       at

 turnstiles            A    to     G.

 I can only            recollect               seeing         two    or       three          uniform           officers             standing

 beside      the       closed           main       gates       on    th e      South          stand           road       side       of    th e      West

 Sergeant         were        immediately                in f r o n t         of    turnstiles                 A    to G.

 Numerous         fans        some          of w h o m    were       intoxicated were                          screaming              abuse         at

 me,    stating            that        people        were      being          crushed             to    death           outside          on

 Leppings         Lane        by       the     crowd.          At    this          time       I was           frightened              fo r     my        own

 safety.

 Several       stated             that       it w a s     going          to    be       another           Hyesel           Stadium            outside

 the    turnstiles                and       pleaded       that       th e      main          gates        should           be    opened            to.

 save     lives.            I genuinely               believed            at       this       time        that          people        outside             on
Leppings          Lane       were       in      danger       of       dying.               I tried          to       position            myself

nearer       the       gate       and      turnstiles.                    A    large           number       of       fans     continually

hurled       abuse          and    threats            towards             me.           I observed              through         one       of    the

turnstiles,                I believe            turnstile             B       on    the        West       stand       entrance,            an

unconscious                young      lad       approximately                      11    years        of    age.         He     w as      dressed

in    red    and       was       being       passed         over          the       heads        of       fans       outside         the

turnstiles             towards          the      South          stand          road       entrance.                  I was      by       this       time

being       pushed          physically               back       away          from       the     gates          and    other         fans       were

approaching                pleading          t ha t    the       gates             should        be       opened.           Mature,            sober

men    were       in       tears      pleading          that          children                 and    women          were     being

crushed       to d e a t h         outside.             Some          fans          who        were    more          sympathetic

stated       that          they    ha d      heard      other             fans          state        outside          that      if       they

pushed       before          kick       off      and    caused                a crush           the       Police       would         have

to    let    them          in,    this       was      mentioned                by       o ne    fan       and    another            with

him    agreed,             all    the      fans       were       by       this          time     entering             through

turnstiles             A    to G      in     a distressed                     sta t e .

I saw       one    man,          male,       white,         approximately                       30    years,          5'8 " ,       slim       build,

dark    hair,          black       moustache,               thin          facial           features,             he    entered            through

turnstile          E and          was      in    a collapsed                   state           and    appeared           to     be       suffering

from    chest          crush       injuries.                As    I attempted                    to       assist       him      I saw          an    old

man    enter       through            these          same       turnstiles                 and       lean       on    the     wall        gasping

for    air.

I offered          to       take      the       injured          man          to    a first           aid       post     but        he    refused

stating       that          he    would         be    alright             an d      wanted           to    watch        the     match.

A number          of       fans    who       were      milling                around           behind       the       West      stand          again

started       shouting             at      me    on    seeing             the       apparently              injured           screaming              for

 As    s o o n as     t he       gates        opened          a flood              of     fans       came        into          the    ground,

 approximately               6    to 8 w i d e ,          they           rushed           towards           me      causing           me     to       run

 grassed       area      of       th e    pitch          which           is    normally              visible              from       where        I was

 standing.

 A lt h o u g h most         of    t he       fans       entered              in a        rush,        some         walked           in,     several

 were       obviously            distressed              and           appeared           to    be     suffering                from        breathing

 difficulties.                   Again        I was       subjected                  to     a torrent               of     abuse        and       pleas

 to    have    the      gates        opened             again           by    th e       fans       who     had       just       entered.

 They       stated      t ha t     although              we      had         let     a    large        number             in    the     problem

 was    j u s t as      bad a n d         again          reference                 was      made       to      it     being          ’A n o t h e r

 Hyesel       Stadium            outside’.

 Again       more     sympathetic               fans          were           arguing           on my        behalf             that     they

 s h o u l n d ’t b l a m e       me.         I was       asked              for     th e      name       of     the       officer           in

 charge       and     the        name     of    my       Chief           Constable.                  T he      fans        were       extremely

 distressed           and        from     what          I could              see     I feared             that        someone           would

 surely       die     outside.                I could            see         fans        continuing              to       climb       the     gates

  Mention          was     made       by     one       of    these          fans,          of    a    public          house-where                f a ns

  public        house         was     no t    known          to me          prior          to    being          mentioned             by    this

  f an.       To     date       I do       not     know       its          location             although           I presume               it    must

  be    reasonably              near       the     s t a d i u m at H i l l s b o r o u g h .

  I was       busy       dealing           with        these          f a ns     and       trying          to    console           and      appease

  them,       when       again        about        3    or 4 m i n u t e s             later,             the    same        gate       opened

 again,         and      although            further          fans          entered             it w a s        not     in as         many       numbers.

 At     this       point        I recall           a    uniformed                PC    calling             to m e       from       the      gate          and

 asking         me    to      help     push        th e      gate          closed,         which           I did.            I have

  considered             this       matter         and am             unsure          whether             I assisted             this       PC       to

  close       th e    gate       on    the       first        or       second          occasion.

 During         this       time       I was        aware          of       two     stewards               to m y      left       wearing             th e

 flourescent               waistcoats,                 one    of       them me nti one d                   to me        that       he      did       not

 know      where         al l    the       fans        would          go    as     the     West           stand       must       be     full.

 Also      whilst          the      crowd        entered              on    th e      first          occasion           I believe               that        I

 saw      the      juvenile                        whom       I had            ejected           from       th e      North        stand         gate

 at     around        Hpm       (1400),          he     was       in t he          centre            of    the     crowd         with       other

 youths         who      were       running            h a rd.         I formed             th e      impression              that         this

 group        did     not       have       tickets.               A    large          number          obviously              did      and       on

 entering            several          attempted              to       give       me    their          tickets           to    remove            the

 stub.          Due      to     the    circumstances                       several          injured             persons          staggering

 around         and      few     officers              I did          not      attempt           to       take     tickets            from       t h em.

 Had      I done         so     I would          most        certainly                have       been       pushed           out      of    the       way

 by     the     bulk       of    the       crowd        and       would          have       impaired             their        entry         which

 would        have       defeated            the       object          of      th e    exercise             that        is    relieving               the

 pressure            outside.

 GROUND         INCIDENT

 After        th e    gates         had      closed          on       the      second           occasion           it      seemed          strangely

 most       of    the m o r e         aggressive                fans       had       gone        and      I looked            around          to     see

 if    I could          see        any     of       my    colleagues             or       other        officer*.               There          were

 few       officers           around.               After       about        5 minutes               I saw a p p r o x i m a t e l y               10 to

 15    uniformed              constables                 run    past       me    from          the     direction              of    the       North

 stand.           Amongst            them       I s a w DC           Turner,              DC     F r i e n d , DC    Titterton                and

 other        officers             from        my    serial          (Serial              11).         They were running                     in      the

 direction           of       the     Police             control          room       at     the      side     of     the       West          stand.

At     this       time        I was        unaware             of    what       the       incident          was      and       on       joining

 these        officers             running           towards          th e      Police           control        room          I was          informed

 that       it w a s      a    pitch           invasion.

 I was        not a w a r e          of    the       time       and       I did       not        realise       that           the       game       was

 in f a c t       underway.                On       arrival          at     th e      side        of    the W e s t s t a n d           an

 internal           dividing              gate       at    the       rear       of        th e    Police room was                  opened            and

we     al l      had a c c e s s          to    the       side       of    the       South          stand.          On    entering             the

 first        aisle       leading              onto       the       pitch,       I was           aware      that         no    players             were

 on    the       pitch.            I could           hear       fans       state          that       the    teams         had       just       left

 the       pitch.

On     looking          across            towards          th e      front       of       t he      West    stand         to       my     left       I

 could        see P o l i c e         officers             in f r o n t         of    the        security           fencing             in    th e

 area       behind        the        g oa l     post,          numerous          fans          were       scaling         the       perimeter

 fence        and    dropping              over          onto       the    pitch.              It    became         obvious             that       it

was        not    a pitch            invasion,             people          were       staggering              from        the       perimeter

 fence        being       assisted              by P o l i c e        officers             and       other     fans.               They       were

 falling          onto        th e    grassed             playing          area       in       the     vicinity           of       th e      goals.

Women,           old men,            young          children          were       sitting             crying,         some          having

 difficulty             breathing.

 Togther          with        my     colleagues,                I went          directly             to    the a r e a         at       the       rear

 of    the       goal     posts.               To    my    left       a    perimeter                fence     gate        some          4 ’ wide          was

  teenage             male       fans.            They        were         pressed       firmly          against           the       perimeter

  fence          in a          standing           position.                 I estimated             initially              about       20

  obviously                dead       persons.                At      this       time    officers             were        climbing          the

  perimeter                fence          and     assisting                in    pulling          bodies       and        injured          out.    I

  immediately                   went       to     th e      open       gate       to    my    left       and       joined           a Police

  Sergeant              ( I . D .????).                He     was      attempting             to    pull       a    large           unconscious

  male          person          out       of     the       g a t e.        This    person          was    trapped              by    his    l e gs.

 He     was          wearing          a    white/light                 T shirt,          heavy          build,          blue        jeans    and

  short          fair          hair,       despite            attempts            he    was       jammed       tight.               Alongside          him

 was        a    conscious                young        woman          with       long    brown          hair       slim        build,

 approximately                       HO    to 3 0          years.           She    was       screaming             in     pain and          trapped

  by    her          waist       like          the     unconscious                man    by       her    si de.           She       could    not       be

  pulled             free       at    this        time.            I then         became          aware       that        at    least       another

 S     or       10    bodies          were        enmeshed             and       piled       up    behind          them        directly       behind

  the       gate        most         were        blue       and       appeared          dead.           The    crowd           were    still

  surging             forward             and     despite             shouting          at    them       to m o v e        back,       they

  obviously                could          no t    hear        from         the    noise       being       made          mostly        from    the

  rear          by a n g r y         and       aggressive              f a ns.         I could          see DC          1177        Davis,    he       was

  inside             this       area       behind           the       bodies.           He    had       lost       hi s    helmet.           His

  tunic          was       opened.

  I could             see       what       appeared              to    be a P o l i c e           officer          directly           behind       DC

  Davis.              He       had    been        lifted           physically            and       dropped          head        first       over       the

  crowd          and       disappeared                 amongst             them    some       10 y a r d s         from        the    front       of

  the       perimeter                fence        directly             behind          the    goal       area.

  Other          uniformed                officers            ran      in t h a t       direction.                 Officers           entering

  on    the          fencing          directing               obviously            uninjured             fans       to m o v e        back.        For

  the       first          10 m i n u t e s           or    so     the      fans       were       behaving          hysterically,                 some

  fencing           near       to    the       gate.           This       behaviour              seemed       to       ceate     relatively

  quickly           and    officers             formed          a    l in e      inside          and    outside           the    gate

  entrance           and       began       to      pass        bodies           through.

  A    large        number          of    injured and                distressed              persons          outside           the       West

  officers           and       St.       John      Ambulance              brigade.

  I was        passed          the       body      of a n       unconscious                 female          with       long     brown          h a ir .

  She       wa s    not    the       one       trapped          at       the     gate.           I with       others           (unknown)

  carried           her    to a          stretcher             nearby.            I believe             that        she    was       still        alive.

  I returned              and       was    passed an                unconscious              male,          he w a s      slightly             blue

  and       with     others          I placed             him       in f r o n t      to     th e      left       of    the     goal       post

  and       immediately              began         cardiac           and artificial                    resuscitation                 and       was

  quickly           joined          by    others,          one       I believe              a medical             student        and       a

  young        female          St.       John      Ambulance              first       aider         (approximately                   15

  years).            She       assisted            a n d at         my    request           went       to    ge t      an a irw ay         to

  assist           me,    on    her       return          I was          informed           that       all    the       airways           had

  gone.            They    didn't          have         any     more.

  This       apparently              dead       fan       was       male,       white        30     to 3 5 y e a r s ,          black

  thinning           short          h a ir ,    brown          eyes,       5 ,(? s t o c k y        build wearing                jeans.              He

  had a        thick       moustache               on     upper          li p    o n ly .

  I continued attempts                          to      resuscitate               for       some       15    to £ 0 m i n u t e s .             He

  proximity.               I recall             some       more          abusive        fans        swearing            and     blaming           th e

  Police           for    the       situation             a n d at        that      time         I was       aware        of    being          struck

  not       tell     whether             I was       kicked          intentionally                  but      it     occurred          whilst           the

, iiabusive        remarks          were       being       made.

  Through          exhaustion             I was       unable          to    continue            the          resuscitation                 and    I was

  relieved          by    someone             else    who       took       ove r .

  During       this       time       I was          observing          a young            Policewoman                   (shoulder             length

  black       hair       busy       at    bottom).              She    had       been      resuscitating                      a young          man,

  male,       white,       EQ's,          green       T    shirt       (tennis            style),             blue       jeans,          6'    tall,

  slim       build.        At       one       point       he    seemed        to     have       recovered                and       started

  breathing.              I recalll             thinking             that     she       was     doing          a    great          job

  bringing          him ar ou n d.              She       had       placed       him      on    hi s         side       in    the    recovery

  position.

  As    a    result       of m y         attempted             resuscitation               I had             been       left       dizzy       and

  after      a few m o m e n t s              I turned          to    see    that         the       above          described             fan     had

  stopped          breathing             again.           I then went              over        to       her    and with             he r

  assistance             I again          turned          him       onto    his      bac k ,        cleared             his    airway          and

  together          we    administered                cardiac          and artificial                        resuscitation.                    After

  a    few   minutes           we    were       joined          by a D o c t o r          and       a    nurse          who    took        over

  with       the    aid    of a n         ambulance             resuscitation                  mask          and    oxygen          tank.

  By    this       time    the       first          fan    that       I had a t te n d e d               to    on       the    pitch,          the

  fan with          the    moustache,                he    had       been     removed           by       someone             and    presumably

  taken       to    the S p o r t s           Hall    where          ambulances            had          by    then       arrived.

  I was       also       aware       whilst          resuscitating                 th e    first             fan    that       a    reporter

  (TV)       with a       cameraman             were       walking          onto        the     pitch          from          the    direction

  of    the S o u t h      stand.              The    behaviour             of     the     reporter                in    particular;

  (male,       white,          black          hair,       ? blue       suit,         dark       eyebrows,                E3 — 30 years)               was

  instantly          offensive.                 He    was       casually           walking              past       myself          and     other

  officers          and    fans          who    were       struggling              to     resuscitate                   casualties.               He

  was       adjusting          his       tie    as    if       to    prepare         to    be       filmed          and app ea re d              to

  As    a    result       roars          of    anger       could       be     heard        from          fans       who       were       likewise

  angered          and    disgusted             by    his       behaviour.                I was          aware          that       several

^Pplice       officers            removed            them        from       the    pitch.

 After       this     I looked               around        to     see       if    I could ass i s t                anyone              else          but

 by    this     time       everything                was     under          control.

 I made       my way         towards               where     the       bodies          had    been       recovered,                        at    this

 time       a number         of L i v e r p o o l          fans        were       standing          around          mainly                 at    the

 rear       of all        th e    bodies            had    been        removed          and Police                officers                 were

 beginning           to    collect             clothing           and       personal          items          dropped              by       the

 injured and              deceased.                 As    they        were       doing       so    I saw a y o u n g                   Liverpool

 fan       approximately                16 y e a r s       walk        through          the a r e a          where           a    barrier             had

 collapsed           behind           and      to    the     left       of       the    goal       p os t     he     looked                around

 and       then quickly               snatched            up a        programme             which       had       obviously                 been

 dropped        by    one        of     th e       injured        or    dead.          He     quickly             pu t       it       in h i s        back

 pocket       and     ran        back        up     to    th e    left       hand       side       of    th e      West           stand          to

 join       other     young           Liverpool            fans.            I went          after       him a n d            asked          him       if

 he    wanted        to    steal         anything            else       from       the       dea d .         He    took           the

 programme           from        hi s    pocket           and     put       it    back       d o w n at       my     request                l ef t        the

 stand       area.

 As    instructed            together               with     other          officers          I attended                 at       a    de-brief

 in    the N or t h        stand         a     short       time        later       before          returning                 to       Woodseats

 Police       station            via a P SV              from     Claywheels                lane.

 The       bodies     h a d all          been        removed           and       I walked          with       another                 officer             to

 the       Sports     Hall        where            I was     approached                by    the    elderly              parents                of    a

 Doctor       wh o    h ad       been assisting                   with       the       injured.              They        asked             if    I-

 could       lo c a t e    him.          I enquired               at    the       Sports          Hall/Police                    room/First                Aid

 room and was              told         he     was       believed           to    have       gone       to    the        Royal

 Hallamshire              Hospital             -    I told        them       how       to    get    there.

 In m y      opinion         there           appeared            to    be    a    l ac k     of    first          aid        equipment/

 airways,         oxygen          etc.             The    atmosphere              on    the       pitch       could              only       be

 described           as    totally             uncontrollable                    chaos       due    to       the     incredable

 numbers        of    dead and               injured,            the    situation             was       not       helped              by    th e

   questioned           the m a n        with       the        radio        as     I was          concerned             that       fans

    entering          later       when       it    would         be    busy        would          have       access          to    either

   side.         I was       told       that       they        ha d    wrongly            positioned               two       markers             outside

   turnstiles           9 to       12 a n d        fans        entering            fo r      the       North       stand          would          be

   entering           the    ground          on    th e       West     stand         end.             I was       also       told    that             it

   was     too    late       to    take       them        d o w n as        they        had       been       screwed          in    position.

   A    small     portable             type       aluminium            barrier            had         been    positioned             to          the

    left    of    turnstiles             9    to     12 a n d         manned         by      further          stewards             who       have

   been     requested             by    the       man     with        the       ra d i o .

   By     this    time       I was       aware           that     the       Serial           Sergeant,             Sgt.       Edwards,                was

    not    in t h e     vicinity.                 I returned               to m y       position             a n d at t h a t        time             the

    turnstiles          opened          and       fans        began        to     e nt e r .

   At     around       2pm(1400>             I was        aware        that        two       f an s     had       been       brought             in

    through       the       gate       leading           to    the N o r t h         stand            immediately             to m y         right.

    They were          in    possession             of        several           hundred           pounds          in    cash and             a

    number       of    tickets          for       the     match        that        were        suspected               to    be    forgeries.

    They were          conveyed          to       th e    Police           room.

    A   short     t i me     after       this       as        I was        searching              a    fan    entering             the

    turnstile          at    1.        I heard           one     of    the        ticket              collectors             shout from               the

    direction          of    turnstile             4 or 5          " H e ’s go t          no          ticket". I            turned and                 saw

    a young       lad       in a       blue       track        suit        running           from       that       direction             and          on

I detained            the     youth        who      was       in    possession              of a       ticket        stub which              he

agreed         was    not     his      and     after          obtaining              his    details        he    was       ejected           via

the    North         stand       gate      w h i c h was           by t h i s        time     beginning          to       be b l o c k e d

by    l a r ge    numbers         of       fans.

The    youth         was    ejected           as    opposed           to       being       arrested        or    taken          to    the

Police         r o o m as     it w a s        becoming             much        busier       and    I was        aware        that

numberous            other       fans       were        causing        problems             in th e      area        of    the

turnstiles            by    jumping           over       them       or a t t e m p t i n g        to    enter        two     at a

Police         presence          at    the     turnstiles.                     Youth       ejected;




It wa s        getting        progressively                   more     and       more       busier       at     all       the

turnstile.              I had         to    intervene              several           times     between          turnstile             1 and

turnstile            - no     ticket.              He    had       tried        to    get     in w i t h      three        others          who

had    tickets          and      had       entered.            He w a s         extremely          drunk        and       his    three

friends          were      also       intoxicated.                  Incidents              involved        fans       attempting                 to

pull      tickets          and    stubs        from        the      turnstile              attendants.

At    around         2.30pm       (1 4 3 0 )       I detained              a    further        person         who     had       jumped

over      the     barrier         without           a ticket;

fan a r ound          through          th e    West        stand       (then          I remained           at    this        poi nt )       are

along with about                  three        other          fans     who        had      been    escorted           to     t hi s       point

 As    I had a p p r o a c h e d            the       area     behind          turnstiles                 A to G at              th e     rear        of

 the W e s t      stand          I observed             about         10      persons             climbing              along       the       top     of

 These     fans        were       progressively making                             their          way     towards             the     roofs          of

 officers         working             at    these       turnstiles,                 a    large          number           of     fans      who        were

 in a n a g g r e s s i v e           and    noisy mood were                       congregating                    around        turnstiles                 A

 The    fans      on       the    roof       were       waving           what       appeared              to       be    complete             tickets

 safety.

 Several       stated            that       it    was     going          to    be       another           Hyesel           Stadium            outside

being       pushed          physically                back       away       from       the     gates          and    other       fans       were

approaching                pleading             that     the      gates          should        be       opened.           Mature,          sober

men    were       in       tears       pleading           that         children              and    women          were    being

crushed       to       death          outside.            Some         f a ns     who        were       more       sympathetic

stated       that          they       had       heard     other         fans          state        outside          that    if       they

pushed       before           kick         off    an d    caused            a crush           the       Police       would       have

to    let    them          in,    this          was    mentioned             by       on e    fan       and    another          with

him    agreed,             all    the       fa n s     were       by    this          time     entering             through

turnstiles             A    to G       in       a distressed                state.

I saw       one    m an ,        male,          white,       approximately                    30 y e a r s ,        5'8",       slim       build,

dark    hair,          black          moustache,             thin       facial           features,             he    entered          through

turnstile          E and          was       in    a collapsed                state           and    appeared          to    be       suffering

from    chest          crush          injuries.              As       I attempted              to       assist       him    I    saw       an    old

man    enter       through             these          same       turnstiles              and       lean       on    the    wall       gasping

for    air.

I offered          to       take       the       injured          man       to    a first           aid       post    but       he    refused

stating       that          he    would          be    alright           and      wanted           to    watch       the    match.

A number          of       fans       who       were     milling            around           behind       the       West    stand          again

started       shouting                at    me    on     seeing          the      apparently              injured          screaming             for

the    gates       to       open.

I believe          that          it    wa s      sometime             around          2.50     p.m.       (1450)          that       I was

standing          opposite             turnstile             A    in    line          with     the       main       gate    C

 As    s o o n as      the        gates       opened a            flood          of    fans        came       into     the    ground,

 approximately                6    to    8 wide,           they        rushed          towards           me    causing me            to       run

 to m y    l ef t      and        back    towards              the     main       gate        above.

 Although        it     seemed           like       a    long        time        the     gates          were       only    opened         about

  1 minute       then         closed.           I assumed                 that        al l    the       f an s w h o      entered         I

 mouth     of    the     tunnel           prior          to      the      gates        being        opened.            I do      however

  recall      after      the        gates       had        closed           looking           towards          the     tunnel        entrance

 and    one     blue     wooden           door          wa s     pulled          partly           across       and     the    other

 opened,        there         were       no    f an s     milling            about           or    crowded          into     the     mouth          of

 the    tunnel.           I do          not    re c a l l       whether           at     that       time       I could        se e     the

 grassed        area     of        the    pitch which                  is    normally              visible         from      where        I wa s

 standi n g .

 Although most                of    the       fans       entered            in a       rush,        some w a l k e d         in,     several

 were     obviously               distressed and                  appeared             to     be    suffering             from     breathing

 difficulties.                    Again       I was        subjected              to a        torrent          of a b u s e      and      p l e as

 to    have     th e    gates           opened          again        by     the       fans        who    had       just    entered.

 They     stated        that        a l t h o u g h we           had      let     a    large        number          in th e      problem

 distressed            and         fromwhat          I could              se e    I feared              that       someone       would

  Mention           was    made        by    on e       of    these          fans,           of a       public       houseiwhere                fans

  had    been        drinking            shortly             brfore          the        game       called The B ee                  Hive.         This

  public        house          was     not      known         to me          prior           to    being       mentioned             by t h i s

  fan.         To    date        I do       not     know       its          location although                       1 presume             it m u s t

  be    reasonably               near       th e    stadium             at    Hillsborough.

  I was        busy       dealing           with        these          fans        and       trying       to    console             and appease

  them,        when again              about        3    or 4 m i n u t e s              later,          the    same          gate       opened

  again,        and       although           further           fans          entered              it w a s     not       in as       many       numbe

  At    this        point        I recall           a    uniformed                 PC    calling          to me          from       the    gate        an

  asking        me    to       help      push       the       gate          closed,           which       I did.              I have

  considered              this       matter         and       am       unsure           whether          I assisted             this       PC     to

  close        the    g a te      on     th e      first       or       second           occasion.

  During        this       time        I was        aware          of       two     stewards             to    my    left       wearing           the

  flourescent              waistcoats,                  one    of       them mentioned                    to me          that       he    did     not

  know    where           al l    the       fans        would          go as        the W e s t          stand must             be       full.

  Also    whilst           the       crowd         entered             on    the        first       occasion             I believe           that       I

  saw    th e       juvenile                        ^/hom      I had           ejected             from       the    North          stand       gate

  at a r o u n d 2 p m           (1400),           he    was       in       t he    centre          of    the       crowd       with       other

  youths        who       were       running            h a r d.        I formed              the       impression             that       this

  group        did    not        have       tickets.               A    large           number          obviously             did and        on

  entering           several           attempted              to       give        me    their          tickets          to    remove        the

  stub.         Due       to     the     circumstances                      several           injured          persons          staggering

  around        and       few     officers              I did          not     attempt             to    take       tickets          from       them

  Had    I done           so     I would           most       certainly                 have       been       pushed          out    of    the     wa

  by    th e    bulk       of     th e      crowd and              would           have       impaired          their          entry       which

  would        have       defeated           the        object          of     th e      exercise             that       is    relieving           th

  most    of    the       more        aggressive                 fans        had       g o ne    and       I looked           around           to    see

  if    I could       se e      any        of m y         colleagues                or      other      officers.               There           were

  few    officers             around.               After        about        5 minutes               I saw a p p r o x i m a t e l y               10 tc

  stand.        Amongst              them       I saw           DC    Turner,            DC     Friend,       DC        Titterton              and

  other       officers           from          my    serial           (Serial            11).         They were           running              in the

  direction          of       th e    Police             control            r o o m at        the     side     of       the    West          stand.

 At     this    time          I was        unaware              of w h a t        the       incident         was        and    on       joining

  these       officers           running             towards            t he P o l i c e         control           room       I was          informed

  that    it w a s        a    pitch           invasion.

  I was       not    aware           of    the       time        and        I did        no t    realise           that       the       game        wa s

  in f a c t    underway.                  On       arrival           at     the       side      of    the    West        stand           an

  internal          dividing              gate       at    the        rear        of     the     Police        room was             o p en ed and

  first       aisle       leading              onto       th e       pi t ch ,      I was        aware       that        no    players              were

  on    the    pitch.            I could             hear        f a ns      state          that      the    teams        had       just        l ef t

  the    pitch.

 On     looking       across              towards          the        front         of      the W e s t      stand        to       my     left       I

  could       see    Police           officers             in f r o n t           of     the     security           fencing             in     the

  area    behind          the        goal       post,           numerous            fans        were       scaling        the       perimeter

  fence       and    dropping              over          onto        the     pi t c h .         It    became        obvious             that        it

 was     not    a    pitch           invasion,              people           were        staggering           from        the       perimeter

  fence       being       assisted              by P o l i c e          officers              and     other        fans.           They        were

  falling       onto          the     grassed             playing            area        in the        vicinity           of       th e      goals.

  Women,       old    m en ,         young          children            were        sitting           crying,           some       having

  difficulty          breathing.

  Togther       with my              colleagues,                 I went           directly            to    th e    area       at       the     rear

 teenage             male       fans.            They        were          pressed       firmly a ga i ns t               the        perimeter

 fence          in a s t a n d i n g             position.                  I estimated              initially            about        20

 obviously                dead       persons.-               At       this       time    officers           were         climbing           the

 perimeter                fence          and     assisting                 in    pulling        bodies         and       injured           out.    I

 immediately                   went       to     the        open       gate       to m y      left a n d           joined          a Police

 Sergeant             ( I . D . ????).                 He    was       attempting             to     pull      a    large          unconscious

 male          person          out       of     th e      gate.            This    person was              trapped            by     his    legs.

 He    was          wearing          a white/light                     T shirt,          heavy        build,            blue       jeans     and

 short          fair          hair,       despite            attempts             he    was     jammed         tight.              Alongside           him

was        a    conscious                young         woman          with       long    brown        h a ir       slim       build,

 approximately                      20    to 3 0          years.            She    was       screaming             in    pain        and    trapped

 by h e r           waist       like          the      unconscious                man    by her           side.          She       could     not       be

 pulled             free       at    this        t i me .         I then          became        aware        that        at    least        another

8     or       10    bodies          were        enmeshed              and       piled       up b e h i n d        them       directly        behind

 the       gate       most          were        blue        and       appeared          dead.         The      crowd          were     still

 surging             forward             and     despite              shouting          at    them        to m o v e      back,        they

 obviously                could          no t    hear        from          the    noise       being        made         mostly        from    the

 rear          by a n g r y a n d             aggressive               fans.           I could        see D C           1177       Davis,     he w as

 inside             this       area       behind            the       bodies.           He    ha d    lost         his    helmet.            His

 tunic          was       opened.

 I could             see       what       appeared               to    be a P o l i c e         officer            directly           b e h i n d DC

 Davis.              He       had    been        lifted           physically             and       dropped          head       first        over       the

 crowd          and       disappeared                  amongst             them    some        10 y a r d s        from       th e    front       of

 the       perimeter                fence        directly              behind          the    goal        area.

 Other          uniformed                officers            ran       in t h a t       direction.                 Officers           entering

 on the             fencing          directing               obviously             uninjured              fans      to m o v e        back.        For

     quickly and             officers             formed          a     line      inside and         outside          the      gate

    entrance           and       began       to    pass       bodies             through.

    She        was    not    the       one     trapped            at       the    gate.         I with      others           (unknown)

     carried          her    to a        stretcher            nearby.              I believe          that       sh e    was       still       alive.

    had a        thick       moustache             on       upper          lip only.

     I continued attempts                         to    resuscitate                for     some     15 to S O           minutes.              He




     throughout             this       time       I was       aware          only     of    movements            within        a     close

     proximity.              I recall             some       more          abusive       fans      swearing           and     blaming          the

    Police           for    the    situation                a n d at        that     time       I was      aware        of    being          struck

abusive         remarks           were       being made.

Through         exhaustion              I was         unable         to    continue             the          resuscitation and                     I was

relieved          by    someone             else      who      took       over.

During       this       time       I was        observing             a young             Policewoman                   (shoulder              length

black      hair        busy       at    bottom).               She    had       been       resuscitating                       a young          man,

male,      white,        2 0 ’s,        green         T shirt         (tennis             style),             blue       jeans,           6*    tall,

slim      build.         At       one       point        he    seemed           to    have recovered                     and started

breathing.              I recalll              thinking             that        she       was doing            a great job

bringing         him around.                  She        had       placed       him       on    his          side       in     the    recovery

pos i t i o n .

As    a   result        of    my a t te m p t e d             resuscitation                I had             been       left        dizzy       and

after      a few m om ent s                 I turned           to    see    that          the       above          described              fan    had

stopped         breathing              again.            I then went             over          to       her    and       with        her

assistance             I again          turned           him       onto    his       back,          cleared             his     airway          and

together         we     administered                  cardiac         and artificial                         resuscitation.                     After

a    few m i n u t e s       we    were       joined           by a D o c t o r           and       a    nurse          who     took       over

with      the    aid     of a n a m b u l a n c e              resuscitation                   mask          and    oxygen           tank.

By    this      time     the       first        fan        that      I had       attended                to    on       th e    pi t c h ,      the

fan w i t h       the    moustache,                 he     had      been    removed             by       someone             and     presumably

taken      to     the S p o r t s           Hall      where         ambulances             had          by    then       arrived.

I was      also        aware       whilst           resuscitating                th e      first             fan that           a    reporter

(TV)      with     a    cameraman             were         walking         onto       the       pitch          from          the     direction

of    the S o u t h      stand.              The      behaviour            of    th e      reporter                in    particular

(male,       white,          black          hai r ,      ? b l ue     suit,          dark       eyebrows,                25-30        years)           was

instantly          offensive.                  He     was      casually          walking                past       myself           and    other

officers          and    fans          who     were        struggling            to       resuscitate                   casualties.                He

was       adjusting          his       tie     as     if      to    prepare          to    be       filmed          and        appeared          to

be     looking         for    any       or a        certain          senior          police             officer.

As a       result       roars          of    anger         could      be h e a r d         from          fans       who        were       likewise

angered         and     disgusted              by h i s        behaviour.                 I was          aware          that        several

Pplice        officers            removed           them        from       the     pitch.

After        this      I looked around                     to    see       if    I could assist                     anyone         else          but

by this         time       everything               was     under          control.

I m ad e m y w a y           towards              where     th e      bodies          had     been       recovered,                    at    this

time a n u m b e r           of L i v e r p o o l          fans       were       standing           around mainly                      at    the

rear        of a l l      th e    bodies           had     been       removed          and       Police           officers             were

beginning            to    collect            clothing           and       personal           items          dropped          by       the

injured and               deceased.                As    they were              doing       so     I saw a y o u n g               Liverpool

fan a p p r o x i m a t e l y           16 y e a r s       walk       through          the       area        where       a    barrier             had

collapsed            behind           and     to    th e    left       of       the    goal        post        he    looked            around

and then quick ly                     snatched           up a        programme             which        had       obviously             been

dropped         by     one       of     the       injured        or    dead.           He     quickly             put    it       in    his       back

poc k e t     and      ran       back        up    to    the     left       hand       side        of    the        West      stand          to

join other             young          Liverpool            fans.           I went          after        him and a s k e d               him       if

he w a n t e d       to    steal         anything           else       from        the      dea d.           He     took      the

programme            from        hi s    pocket          and     put       it    back       d o w n at         my    request            left          th e

stand area.

As     instructed            together              with     other          officers           I attended                at    a    de-brief

in the N o r t h           stand         a short           time       later        before          returning             to W o o d s e a t s

Police        station            via a P S V            from C l a y w h e e l s           lane.

T he       bodies      had all           been       removed           and       I walked           with another                   officer             to

the S p o r t s        Hall       where           I was     approached                by    th e    elderly             parents             of    a

Doctor        who      had       been        assisting           with       th e      injured.               They asked                if    I-

could        locate        him.          I enquired              at    the       Sports          Hall/Police                 room/First                A

              In    respect          of    th e      perimeter            fencing,         I had          great        difficulty          in

              time       directing             any    fans.

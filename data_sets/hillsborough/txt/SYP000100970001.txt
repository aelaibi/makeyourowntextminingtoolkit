Police Constable 607

Hackenthorpe Police Station




I commenced duty at 8.30 a.m. at Hackenthorpe Police Station.                       I was instructed

at this point that I was to be working in serial 16 under Sergeant 1288 Payne.

From     Hackenthorpe    we     were     transported    to    Hillsborough      Football     Ground         by

transport provided.

On my arrival at the football stadium at                 about 9 a.m. there was no evidence                 of

any supporters and once          inside generally        waited for the briefing to be              held at

9-55 a.m. in the North Stand.

As I was sat in the North Stand awaiting                 the briefing I was instructed              that in

general charge of serial         16 was to be Inspector Purdy.

During    the briefing the       instructions        for serial   16 was to work outside             of the

Leppings Lane turnstiles         numbered A-G, at the West Stand.

After meal,    all of     serial 16 which       included Police Constable 2980 Wright,                  115

Huckstepp,    3066 Huckstepp,          1715 Best,    259 Coney,    963 Evans,    620 Yates, Cerrone

and Duffy took up their          specific     duties outside of the turnstiles. The time                now

was    approximately    11.15    a.m.     although    the    turnstiles   weren't   due to beopened

until 11.45 a.m.        I was working in company with Police Constable 115 Huckstepp at

turnstile 'A '.

At this time there were only a small number of fans in the immediate vicinity.

Even when the     turnstiles were open there were only a small number of Liverpool

fans entering. The mood^ at this time was happy with many fans joking with us, at

this time it was possible to search every person entering through our turnstile.

However, as time went on it was very noticeable to me that although there were an

increasing number of fans arriving, many were choosing to sit outside the ground
A J TAYLOR                                             -2 -                                           R 337




or   stand    away    from    the    ground    at   Leppings    Lane, even   at    this     point    it   only

appeared to be a 'normal' match.

It was noticeable though that when a prisoner needed escorting to the gymnasium

area, it meant two men leaving the turnstile area.                    To escort fans to our control

area, the gymnasium exit gate 'B' had to be opened to allow us through.

Although,     due to the work being carried out, I was unaware of time throughout, I

believe at about 2.15             p.m. I escorted a Liverpool fan to the gymnasium he had had

his ticket stolen and             only possessed the ticket stub.

We went      through exit         gate 'B'    to get   to the gymnasium, at this            time the crowd

outside was still growing,               although people were still jovial and            it was still in

order to search virtually every person entering the ground.

It had been a surprise               to see the number of Liverpool fans who had tried to                  get

into the Leppings Lane              West Stand on Nottingham Forest tickets, these had turned

up   without       tickets    but    bought     from   people     around   the    ground,    it     was   also

noticeable        that many      fans,   especially as numbers grew,         smelled of alcohol.              I

didn't see any drunken              fans but many smelled heavily of alcohol.

After being instructed              to allow the fan I had escorted to the gymnasium into the

stand area, I returned to the same exit gate 'B'.

However,     despite      it only being some 15 minutes I had been away,                    the steward at

the exit      gate refused to allow me back through showing me the number of people

outside.     At    that   time    I thought     it was    quite   astounding      the   numbers     that had

arrived in such a short space of time.                   Understanding the reason for not being

allowed outside the ground via exit gate                 'B', I then went to exit gate              'C' where

I managed to get outside.

Once outside again I managed to get to the railings by turnstiles A-G but felt

quite helpless        as    there was no possible way of returning to a turnstile,                                      there

appeared       to be so many        fans       to so few policemen.                   It was       now that a superior

officer,       although     I'm    not    sure        who,    instructed        me    to go     to    the wrought        iron

perimeter gates facing Leppings Lane to ensure that the gate closest to the river

was kept shut.

I, along with all but two of my serial, did not possess any personal radios.

I noticed that        there were         two members of the Police Mounted Section trying to

stop    the    crushing     that    was     occurring.          However,        the    horses      were   making       little

impact,       in fact the        crowd was       getting very angry at the way they were jumping

about.

The crowd at this point was getting very heated as time was getting on towards

three o'clock and movement                through the turnstiles appeared to be very slow. At

this    point     I   don't       believe       there        were    any   policemen          actually        working     the

turnstiles.           Indeed,       with the           amount       of people        outside       it would     have    been

virtually impossible to turn anyone away who had got through a turnstile.

The perimeter         gate I was atwas shut after a struggle, the idea being that if all

the    perimeter           gates    were shut,         the    crush by     the        turnstiles would          be   eased,

however,      fans    just outside these gates were by nowgetting very irate, shouting

and some       hurling     abuse    towards       us. Unfortunately,              it could be          seen that        there

were a number of young children in this crowd outside the gates and I feared for

their safety.         Immediately to my right was a wrought                             iron fence        followed by a

further       two gates     which    had       been    shut by the Mounted                  Officers.     The   crowd was

gradually       pushing     harder       and    on     numerous        occasions        I    was     having     difficulty




                           (jâ€”
A J TAYLOR                                             -   k   -
                                                                                                    R337




holding this gate shut.                I was by myself on this gate.            It was noticeable that

large numbers of people although possessing tickets, did NOT know whers that part

of the ground was          and many were unable to get out of the crowd to get to that

part of the ground after being instructed on where they should be.

At one point I allowed my                   perimeter gate to be opened to allow a fattier and his

young son and a pregnant woman to go through, the crowd at this point held back

and allowed them through before pushing again when the gate was shut.

The time must now have been getting close to three o'clock and I felt                        e   surge.    I

was unable       to hold      the    gate    shut, but made sure      that I was pushed behind the

fencing to my right.           At this point I was fearful for my own safety but there was

a greater fear for supporters' safety as they crushed through the gate. Somehow I

managed to shut the gate again, but increasingly more and more fans were climbing

over fencing to my left which runs parallel to the river, in order tc get round

the    perimeter    gates.          I also     witnessed   numerous   people    climbing   or the wall

between turnstiles 1 - 1 6             and turnstiles A - G, gaining entry by going over this

wall.

Soon after the first surge there was a great surge.                     I was thrown behind fencing

to my    right     as   the    gate    was    forced open and I saw      the     horses   at the    centre

perimeter gates get pushed out of the way as their gates too were force; open.

People were falling to the floor as the rush of people pushed them crer, now I

was extremely aware           that there were going to be some serious injuries or deaths

if these people didn't get up off the ground.

On a couple of occasions I              moved across my gateway area to try and hole the crowd

back    to give    these      people        chance   to get up.    However     the   ones on the ground
A J TAYLOR                                          - 5 -                                         R 337




didn't seem to realise the vast numbers pushing indeed.                       I witnessed one man who

had   fallen over,         lingering      to pick up his loose    change which had scattered on

falling, from his pocket.              It was at this point I realised another policeman, not

from my serial,        was present.         We urged people to calm down and to stop pushing

but it was useless,           the crowd continued to surge towards the turnstile area.                    I

was amazed how quickly such a large number of people had cleared from the area

outside the fcest Stand turnstiles.              Only a few people remained, looking for shoes

and other items of property they had lost in the surge.

As I looked towards the ground I saw that exit gate 'C' had been opened.                           I felt

some relief as I was              in no doubt that if this hadn't opened many people would

have died outside.

As    I walked      round    with   other officers    outside    of turnstiles A-G,         the   general

comments were of how quickly the area had cleared.                     It was now I heard the first

tannoy   message       I    had   heard    all   afternoonand   that    was    for   the   fans   at   the

Leppings Lane end to stop pushing. Believing                it was a message for these outside,

I thought that        it was a bit late for that, but it was obviously meant for those

inside as after a few moments, it was heard on personal radios possessed by some

officers that all officers were required inside the ground.

I made   my w a y    into the ground, around the rear of the West Stand                onto the South

Stand and then on to the pitch.

I was met    with      the    sight    of a large number of policemen stood up against                 the

fencing of the West Stand terrace obviously yelling and urging supporters to go

backwards. On the pitch there were numerous people obviously injured.

Due to the numbers of policemen at the fencing I stayed on the pitch with injured

people many struggling         to breathe.      I comforted as many as I could but it was

becoming    apparent    that   as more were being brought            onto the pitch the injuries

were getting worse.          The medical facilities at the time appeared inadequate, but

no organisation could envisage what was happening.

I remember comforting one supporter and on looking up, seeing a dead body pulled

onto the pitch, after that it was one after another.

Liverpool    supporters      who were    injured began to rip advertisement boards out to

use as makeshift       stretchers   and I then assisted to transfer the dead bodies                    to

the other end of the pitch.         Some fans still preferred to shout abuse towards us.

The Nottingham Forest fans were still chanting at the Liverpool fans causing some

annoyance,    maiing    it   necessary    for   a   police      barrier   to   be   placed   across   the

pitch.     However, when I joined this cordon, the movement of injured and dead was

well underway.

At 5-30 p.m.     I returned to the North Stand to wait further instructions, before

doing so,    I collected names and addresses of some people stood on the Leppings

Lane terrace and handed them to a collecting Sergeant. At this time the game had

been called off and most supporters had gone from the ground.

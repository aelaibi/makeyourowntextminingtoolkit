PS/Secretary of State (b<S4=-)

FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL

Following the meeting last night with the Secretary of State, and the earlier
advice, I again spoke with Parliamentary Counsel.

I have now heard from Counsel, he having spoken with the Commons House
authorities       'nature of the consultation between the two Houses was not
such that the Clerk of the House himself had been consulted. He has now been
consulted.

The view taken by the House authorities in the Commons and what they would
advise the Speaker, although he does not have to take that advice, is that-

       (1) the seating proposal on which Counsel consulted is not strictly
       within the scope of the Bill; nevertheless,

       (2) by means of an instruction,    the addition to the Bill   could be
       authorised as a cognate matter;

       (3) the motion for the instruction could be taken the same day as the
       Second Reading.

The instruction tabled would be that Standing Committee could add to the Bill
the amendment relating to seating.      The motion would be taken on the floor
House and could,of course, be defeated.

Perhaps I should also say that if it were decided in this situation to proceed
to add the seating proposal in the Lords instead of the Commons a motion would
be necessary to recommit the relevant provisions of the Bill (this would be
clause 9 or perhaps clauses 9 snd 10).   Such a motion could also, of course,
be defeated.   In either case, in the Commons or the Lords, voting would be
involved.

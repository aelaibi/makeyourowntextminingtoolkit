        HILLSBOROUGH FAMILY SUPPORT GROUP

       Mr Hicks has been in touch to agree a date for his meeting with
       Lord Ferrers.  It will be on Thursday 3 May at 3.15 pm with pre­
       briefing at 2.45 pm.  I would be grateful if written briefing
       would reach me by close of play the evening before.

       The meeting may well have to take place in the House of Lords but
       I will let you know nearer the time.

You wrote to the Home Secretary on 26 April 1989 enclosing one
from               about the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster. Miss
Bannister, in her letter of 2 May 1989, mentioned that your
letter and your constituent's had been forwarded to me as the
Secretary to the Inquiry.
I have shown the correspondence to Lord Justice Taylor who has
noted it.

                             bodies     into    gymnasium.        Covered      bodies with

                              paper tablecloths.

                             Room and      informed me to make my way to Leppings

                             Lane    end when      I had finished with              prisoner).

1537                         R e j oined   rest of,D.S.G.         at    perimeter         fence.     I

                             saw that      part    of the      fence    had been pulled            down

                             but    I did not see any bodies                being    carried out

                             at    that time.          On   looking around         1 could not see

                             any further        bodies      to be carried to the gymnasium.

                             Hundreds      of fans were walking ar o u n d the goal                      mouth

                             are a , some      i n a state      of shock,      othe r s shout i ng

                             a buse at     officers.



At one    point     I intervened       in an argument          between an      Inspector       and

several    Liverpool     supporters,        one of whom         I recognised as Derek

HATTON.      One    of the supporters          was accus i n g    the Police         of    causing       the

deaths.      The    Inspector      ordered that         the supporter        be escorted away

from the scene.         Mr HATTO N was         remonstrating With            the    Inspector       to

keep his     cool.     I spoke to Mr HATTON,                saying that we should all               try

and help those        fans   that were      in need-of        assistance,          at w hich Mr HATTON

w!a 1 k e d away.

There    then f o l lowed a period when officers                 and supporters were               just

walking ar o u n d the       playing area.         I became aware           that a cordon of

Police Officers        had been formed across                the half way      line.        Nobody
                                                                                             PAGE
                                                                                             R3 8 2

really knew what           they should be doing.               All   the bodies   had been

removed from the           scene and those           slightly    injured were     receiving

treatment       from St.      John's       A m bulance and Police Officers.

E v e n t u a l l y 4/3 of us mana g e d to         re-group and made      our way outside         the

Leppings      Lane S tand where Liverpool                 supporters    were making   their way

out of the       ground.        I remember         one   supporter    shouting at us,   "WHY

DI D N ' T YOU GIVE US THE HOP?"                  Which with hindsight,      was a question           I

was also asking.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 4.13   p.m.    we mana g e d to    re-group as a unit and

returned to our          van beside         the    gym and   began to    patrol   outside    the

ground until        8.00    p.m.    when we        returned to D H G .

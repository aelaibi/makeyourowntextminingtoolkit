               ignored us but one shouted back to us to move back gesticulating with

               his arms to move b a c k .       He obviously d i d n ’t understand that we couldnt

          do anything.        I      1t as if all my energy had gone.

          became aware of being p u s h g ^ W p to the stand above. Once up there I

          just stood and collected             myself together.           I watched from that

          position as the Police            came in.

          I was not aware of why we all fell forward and after the event my

          memory is of parts of what was going on but not in detail.

          I dont know       how but later I was wondering around Sheffield by other

          friends who       took me back home to Seacombe.

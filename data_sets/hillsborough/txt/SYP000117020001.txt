                From       this     time     of    10.45 am there w'et/evj^'owds of Liverpool, supporters

                pas s i n g u p a n d d own t h e r oa d o n Le ppin g s La n e .                      Th e f a n s a ppe ar ed to

                be getting           their        bearings        and once       done a lot        returned      back along

                the       road asking          dire c t i o n s    for different              public   houses m a i n l y      the

                Sportsman           or the The Beehive.                   Most     of them were         in good boisterous

                m o od     laughing a n d joking w ith us as to who might win the match.

                It was        noti c e d     that whilst           most    of them were asking              dire c t i o n s    for

                pubs       they still         were      carrying        either       single      cans or 'multiple          packs     of

                cans       (as if brought             from superm a r k e t          packs)      of alcohol.

                All       of the      time     there a p p e a r e d to be a large                number    of f a n s s t a n d ing
about and m o v i ng          ba c k w a r d s and forwards w i t h i n the flow of the

general       crowd a s ki ng        for    spare tickets           or tickets          to sell.         Offers

were    being made           for     £5 for a ticket             from any o n e w i l l i n g       to sell.

Groups       of y o u th s    began to gather at various                     times and m o n e y          could be

seen e x c h a ng in g 'hands and someone                  jumping about as th o u g h they had

w o n on that       occasion.            If a sked      to move          or break      up the groups w ould

just    disperse         to a few y ards           further       down the         street.       Very      few fans

s e e m e d to   pass by with o u t             being   in p o s s e s s i o n of cans of alcohol.

The    flow of      fans along L a p p in gs Lane                never      really seemed           to ease up

at any stage          in p a rticula r and a l t h o u g h           most        had   p o s s e s s i o n of

a lcohol      at that        stage     they       were w i l l i n g to chat,          pass    time of day            in

general.

M any a p p e a r e d to queue at the                chip shop just              down the      road a little

and w o u l d walk        back      past    us.      I was a s k e d on countless                occasions           for

the two       pubs a lr e a d y m e n t i o ne d and            if we knew where            the Liverpool

fans we re meet i n g .

It was m e n t i o n e d      in passing          by PC H e b i d g e      that    if 5 4 , 0 0 0 tickets            had

been sold then they all                    must    be    passing this way              as the      crowd never

see m e d to end.            I recall       a     flow of fans being e s c orted down the                           road

by Police O f fi ce rs and               thinking       that     the Wads 1ey Bridge               train

m e n t i o n e d must    have a rr i v e d and that             the start         of the m a t c h s h o u l d n ’t

be    long     off a lt h o u g h there          still a p p e a r e d    to be a very          large      number

of fans        hanging       about arid asking for tickets,,

S h o r t l y a f t er wa rd s     and whilst        there was           still    a constant        flow        I

remember a male              fan    r u n n i n g/ jo gg in g   down the         centre of the          road

singing       to himself about              "I'm     coming,      I ’m coming",           I remember            looking

at my w a t ch and seeing                the     time at 2 . 5 6 pm and shouting                  to him that

he only        had four minutes              to kick off and             better be quick,              he replied

he had       plenty of time a n d a ticket,                     he was      in good mood.

I heard a large              cheer     from the ground an d the singing                        as though            the
teams     had     come out       onto    the    pitch.        I stood at some           point    thereabouts

on one of the           b a r riers     on the    road j u n c t i o n    I was at and          remember

t hinking       that    there     seeme d an awful            lot    of fans still         to get      into     the

g r o u n d an d that      the    line of Police Horses                d i r ectly    in front       of the

gates a p p e a r e d a g g r a v a t e d and that heads              of the horses were             bobbing

up and down           I could see fans           climbing          up the fencing        to the      left of

the gates and trying               to get       in.     I a g a i n stood on the           barrier      and

remember        hearing a 1oud s peaker m e s s a g e about                  go to the N o r t h and you

will     get    in,    I do not       remember        the    exact words       but    recall     that the

m ass    crowd then seemed              to thin out a little.

At 3.10        pm I was       joined at E sk d a l e R o a d         by PC 214 C o u l s o n and told

that     there was       trou b l e w i t h i n the         gro u n d and we were        needed at the

ground.         Went    s t r aight aw-ay to Le p pings Lane                entrance and          looked for

PS R e y nolds        unable     to see him and then almost                  i m m e d i a t e l y whilst

stood near         to a g roup of other Police O f f i c e r s was                    told by a

Uniformed         Inspector       to go and       then taken          into ground at L a p p i n g s Lane

and     told to form a cordon to guard                       the    dead and     injured fans          from the

remainder         of fans      coming     out.        C o r d o n formed shoulder          to shoulder

w it h other      o f f icers     to guard bodies             and keep passage           free    for    the

f 1ow of a m b u l a n c e s .

S t ay ed at this        point     until all          the    injured     persons     had been        removed

and     the dead       persons     had been       cordoned          off with barriers and green

sheets     by fire       service.

The n sent w ith         10 other        officers       and told to try and              clear     off the

f a n s f r o m t h & b r i d g e a n d I...e p p i n g s I...a n e e n t ra n c e in o r d e r t h a t t h s

large     number       of fans     still       in the       ground    could be clear,.

Whilst     doing       this    it was     noticed       that       fans were very abusive              and

a gg re ss iv e   towards        Police and most             swore    using words        likes

"Fucking Pol i c e        had Mi n e r s       now had us."?          " I t ’s all   our    faults."

"Get the        fucking       press     out of here."

                                                                                                              ft6 3

Fans w a n te d to hang about                   near     the e n t rance        looking     for      friends,

relatives             and were          very    reluctant       to move        even a few feet          further„

Whilst      in the gr o u n d            entrance       the    cordoned fans were              reluctant      to

move    to a l l o w       in the a m b u l a n c e s      and kept w a n t i n g to         look     behind the

cordon and were                very abus i v e        towards        both services and              in fact were at

times     obstructive.

A fter all        the fans we re cleared                   from the gr o u n d and nearby entrance,

was    told to          return to ground and take up seats as                             in briefing,        which

was    done.          N ot i c e d    then     it was    7.1 0 pm.          B e t w e e n H. 56 pm and 7.10          pm

was    tot a l l y     unaware          of time a l t h o u g h all         time was     kept       busy.    Several

fans w a n t ed         to make         complaints agai n s t Police and were                       informed to

contact      their         local        force    seemed very odd              that   in all     the    panic and

c o n fu s i o n fans        could even think              of such a thing.

Farts even t ri e d o b s tr uc ti ng a m b u l a n c e s                from getting        in at the

L a p p in g s Lane        entra n c e and an arrival                   of each a m b u l a n c e    fans    had to

be m oved and a c t u a l l y a sk e d               pers o n a l l y    to a llow the a m b u l a n c e s     in.

It a p pe ar ed at           times as though they didn't want                          help.

Fans were         seen to be a ct u a l l y a t t a c k i n g Police Officers who were

carrying         bodies        both dead and            injured from           inside     the ground.

O b s er va t io ns      from myself.               E a c h and e very Police Offi c e r              1 saw acted,

a n d ciid eve ryth,i ng 11")ey possi b 1y cou 1 d to he 1 p tFte situat i o n .

Large     numbers          of Police O f f i c e r s were               tota l l y unaware      of what was

happening and              radios        should have          been      issued to at       least      every two

offi c e r s ,

It was     not at all                possible       to make any org a n i s e d         plans wh i l s t     the

incident was             ongoing and e v e ryone               did what        they thought          possible      to

help,     officers           a ct e d    on own initiative.

It was     obvious           from an early stage well                     before     the m atch       that   the

majority         of     fans w o u ld        have    pur c h a s e d and      consumed a considerable

a itio u n t o f a 1 c o hoi .
                                                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                                                R d>3

         Also    from the am o u n t       of fans as k i n g      directions      to pubs     it a p p e a r e d

         that    they had no        in t e n t i o n of being at       the   ground at a reasonable

         time     in order     to make an orderly               entrance.

         There was hundr e d s         of fans with o u t         tickets    hanging about          the Leppings

         Lane area.

         Vast    amounts      of fans      had made     their      own way to S h e f f i e l d a n d arranged

         to meet      up w i t h other       friends     in various pubs and had not                come        as

          part    of any o r g a ni se d     party or sup p o r t e r groups.

         Finally,        1 felt    that whilst       stood outs i d e after          the   incident        on

         L e p p in gs Lane wh i l s t     the fans were          going   out     they were    very abusive

         and     threatening       towards all       officers.         On more      than one o c c a s i o n         I

         felt     that    I was    going     to get a      'smack      in the   face from a fart’ and

         having      been told that          we were     to expect        a b u s e , had to take    it.         Had

         an y officer made          the    slig htest     remark      re a fans      verbal    abuse       then a

         separate        incident     could have been            spar k e d off    in seconds.        I felt

         very     t h r e a te ne d and h u m i l ia t e d at    having   to take such abuse after

          15 years       i n t he Police.

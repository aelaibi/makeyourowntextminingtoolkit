 'V                                                 of                                                              Brentford         spoke       to

                   me.         Durit^^our        conversation,                           told me that a mini                  bus    had        been

                    o r g a n i se d to travel           to the ground.              I o b t a i n e d a seat          on that        bus and,

                    in total,          nine    of us,      plus the driver               travelled         in X h d bus           on the        date

                    of the fixture.               The     persons      I can name were

                                                         Leigh   on Sea,        Essex.

I only know the others                   by their      first     names,      another

           a girl        named             and another          named                      Im sorry         I dont

know their        full      names    or addresses.

We all met        up at a public, house                called the H orse and G r o o m                in

B r e n t w o o d at about       "7.30am on the S a t u r d a y morning.                 We    eventually          set

off     in the    bus at a bout 8 . 15am.               Whilst        travelling,        we stop p e d at          the

first     service        s ta t i o n out of L o n d o n on the M1 motorway.                      I had a bite

to eat a n d a drink             of milk shake          but     I cannot      say for         certain what

the     others    had.       We only       stayed there          for about       10-15 minu t e s           before

setting        off.      The traffic        on the m o t o r w a y was        not    p a r t i c u l a r l y heavy.

It was     free       flowing and we e v e n t u a l l y a r r i v e d at S h e f f i e l d a r o u n d

11.30am.         I do not know e xa c t l y where we                   parked    but     I w o u l d say      it wa

a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 miles    from the        ’S p i o n K o p ’ end of the ground.

I made my way on foot                towards        the ground and. to JWie L e p p i n g s                Lane

entrance.         On the way we            passed a public            houj/.        We   deci d e d to go          in

a nd    play a few games            of    pool    to pass       the   Same    leading         up to the m a t c h

I drank        some Perrier         water    during      this     time and we e v e n t u a l l y           left

that     pub at about          1.45pm.       I wal k e d      to the gro u n d       quite      freely,       there

were     quite a few people w al k i n g              to the gr o u n d at          this      time,   although

there were        no     large     crowds    forming       or    causing      problems.           There were

not man y Police            offic e r s    present at this            t^tne and only d i recting

t raff i c and        pedestrians         some way from the             ground.

As     I neared the         t u rnstile are a at the yLeppi ngs Lane                     e n t r a n c e there

were     no orderly queues,               just a     largsr mass        of   people      c o n g r e g a t i n g and

o b vi ou sl y having        to sque e z e       t he i r / w a y t h r o u g h each other        to walk

t hr o u g h the turnstiles.               This wyfs at a bout           2 . 2 0 p m at w h i c h     time    I saw

3 police        horses      near    to the       c/owd who a p p e a r e d      to be a t t e m p t i n g     to

move     the    crowd away         from t^€       ground and ease            them towards           the     road.

T hey were       trying      to do this          but due to other            fans    entering         that area

from L e p p i n g s Lane        side,     the    crowd gat h e r i n g      near    the      t u r nstile    area
                                                                                                                         PAGE
                                                                                                                         SI 055

became       larger and the P o l i ce               had no chance                  of    reducing       the    crowd as

the mome n t s       went    by.

I felt myself           bearing pushed            in towards               the gr o u n d and e v e n t u a l l y

e n t e r e d t hr o u y n the se c o n d t u rnstile                  o n the         right at that           entrance.

Once     insiderf that           being at about                 2 . 5 0 p m , there was           not such a            large

crowd there as             I thought           there woul/d be after                      judging      the amount

outside.           I was able           to walk arafirid freely and bought a programme.

S h o r t l y afte r w a r d s     I became a ware                  that the        teams were         being a n n o u n c e d

and    so    1 made my way t hr o u g h tme                        tunnel       leading       to the terracing.                 I

knew w h i c h way to go as                   I have       been to the ground                    three     times        in the

past.        There was       not m any          people             in the tunnel           are a whe n       I walked

through,          it was    quite        clear a l t h o u g h o b v i o u s l y           other      fans were          present,

but    not    crowded.                                         /
                                                           /
As    I cams to the end of the                       tumel           facing       the     pitch,      I then saw that,

the s t a nding areas were                    packe A .         I say packed              but    it was     bearable.               It

came    to my notice             that      peop/e were               packed together              in the       central

area    behind the g o a l , a 11-hyp u g h to t he                        left a n d      right     of this a r e a

t here were         r elatively          verj^ few s p e c t a t o r s .               I was     s u r p r i s e d at    this as

u s u a l l y at football              matches,      specta c t o r s            are     usually directed               to areas

and are       evened out.               I saw no stewards                   or Po l i c e at        the end of the
                                                           /
tunnel       d i recting anyone,               as,   a/though              it    is easy to say now,               if there

had have          been better           d i r ec ti on s       for spectators,                such a     large      crowd

would       not   have gone            straigh/t a h e a d when                 e m e rging     from the tunnel.

I made my way to the                    r i g h t jof the           central        d i v iding    barrier at            the end

of the       tunnel    and m o v e d as           far      right as             I p o s sibly     could,       this      being

only a matter          of 3 or 4 yards                  from the            tunnel        exit.       I intended to

stay towards          the    rear        of    the   crowd to o b t a i n a better                     view.

The    football       players           came out        onto         the    pitch a short while                 later,

about 2 minutes after                    I had taken up my                      position.         I felt myself

b e c oming       crowded    in by         people a r o u n d me.                 This     crowding        became more

severe      and as a result             of the movem e n t              of    persons ar o u n d me           I star t e d

to become            very hot and was             turned       p h y s i c a l l y from side         to side.           There

was    not a severe             push f or w a r d at this               time,      just a crushing           feeling

that was         getting        worse as          the seconds went               by.

I saw the match kick                  off and,          other 4fian the            crushing and            crowding           I

have a l r e a d y stated there was                           surging        forward.         I only became aware

of a surge           forward whe n Fj-^fer B e a r d s l e y took a shot at goal                             and hit

the    crossbar.          Due    to>fni5          surge       forward,        I felt myself           being       carried

forward wit h the weight                    of    people       from behind.              W i t h this      forw a r d

m o v e me nt    I   felt myself        being          even more        tightly         packed wit h those              in

front     of me and those              behind.           I realised that                s o mething was          very

wrong.          It was    not a normal             surge w hen the               feeling      is of going          forward

and then         returning       to my original                position.           I could not          regain my

position and knew that                  those at the              front w ould           be very tigh t l y

crushed against            each other.                 I attempted           to go      rearwards,         but,    if     1

say    .1 had m ov e d forw a r d about                 8 steps,        I could only move               back about 3

steps.

I heard         people    from the          front        shouting        things         like "open the           gat e s ’.

I could not move                but    remained in the                position an d e v e n t u a l l y saw

people a t t e m pt in g        to    pull       the    fencing       down and          climb up.          There was a

lot of     c o nfusion w i t h i n the terraces.                        I saw people              from up a bove

pulling         people    up into       the area,             away    from the          crowd      I was    stuck       in.

In the     few moments           that went             by,    it a p p e a r e d that       the Po l i c e and
                                                                /
s tewards       were     o r d ering    people          not to push but              to go back,           but    I w ould

say that at that             initial         time,       t h ey/were         unaware      of the serious

problems         in the s t a n d area,            and       I/saw the        gate      being      opened to        pen

and    fans      let out     one by one.

I e v e nt ua ll y m an ag ed to make                        way to the          rear    of the      crowd and          get

free    from the         c o nfusion        throjaqh the          t u n n e l.     It a p p e a r e d that        people

the     pen,     w hich enables me            to say that              the     crowd       ;!.n front        of me were

all     in an upright            position at            that       time.

V ery    shor t l y after           getting       to    position two^a'nd whilst                       still      watching

the m a t c h     I saw a Liverpool                player          s h o & C at    the Forest            goal      and     strike

the     cross     bar..       I didn't       know who          Syda hit        the      cross       bar at       the time,

although         I now know that             it was tester Beardsley.                         I mmediately after

the     ball     hit    the    cross      b^r,     tpfe re     was a big           surge     forwards            in p e n

three.         This was a big              surgtf,      the    biggest         I had been            in since          entering

pen three.             The    surge       carried me down              the     pen and       I ended up some

eight     or     ten steps.           Further          down the        pan.,       I have ma r k e d this

position         on the a t t a c h e d      scaled          plan using           the   figure         three.

As soon as            I got    to the       position three                there      wre    still        peo p i ' s t a n d i ng

The     game was        still       being    played at             that    time.

To the      best       of my     recollection,               the    time     of the        surge/following

Beardsley         striking          the   cross        bar,    w ould      be -five,        frpysi bly s i             rn1 n u t e s

past     three.

It was      no    later       than that.          As     I looked          past      the    people        in front            of me

f r a iti p o s i t i o n t h res,     I c o u.1 d see        p e o p I e s q uashed        up a g a :l.n s t t h e

front     of me.            These    people ware             stac k e d on top of each other.                            Fro m

previous         visits       to H i l l s b o r o u g h and        having        stood     in pen thj/se on two

previous         o c casions        I knew there was a crush barrier                                in jf h e    area where

these     people were            piled      up.        Due    to    this,      upon seeing             the      pile     of

people      I i m m e d i a t l e y thought            that a crush barrier                  had broken and                   that

it was why            the    people were          piled up.

In terms         of    time,     I w ould     say       that       between B e a r d s l e y         striking          tne

cross     bar and my           noticing       the       people        piled up,          no more^jHian a couple

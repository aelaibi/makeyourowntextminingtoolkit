 NO THERE WAS NO DISORDER OR ANY BAD CONDUCT SY ANYONE OR ANY OTHER                          INCIDENT.

 BRIEFLY E X P L A I N .

 YES.    WE STILL HAD PEOPLE COMING    IN FROM BEHIND AND IT WAS A CONTINUOUS

 INCREASING PRESURE PUSHING FORWARD TOWARDS THE PERIMETER FENCING, AT ONE

 STAGE THERE WAS A LAD IN H I S TEENS I THINK TO NY L E F T .     M Y .GIRLFRIEND

 PANICKED IN THE CRUSH AND ALSO COMPLAINED OF LOSS OF B R E / ( T H,   BREATHING

 HEAVILY.      THIS LAD AND I TRIED TO CALM HER DOWN WHICH/wE SORT         OF DID.     I

 EMBRACED BOTH THE LAD AND      MY GIRL WITH BOTH MY ARM s / b RIiMGING THEM IN CLOSE      TO

 ME TO PROTECT T H E M .   I GRIPPED SOME RAILINGS TO THE DIVIDE TO PEN 3 AND 4

 LOOKING TOWARDS PEN 4 WITH BOTH OF THEM INSIDE/nY R E A CH.

 JUST BEFORE THIS HAPPENED      WHEN WE WERE IN POSITION ONE ON THE        GRID ON PAGE 3

 I ® H A D A BARRIER DIRECTLY   IN FRONT OF US.    THE PRESSURE CRUSH WAS SO GREAT


Q 15

 WE HAD TO DUCK UNDER THAT BARRIER AND/ATTEMPTED TO DO SO SEVERAL T I M E S

 BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE WOULD HAVE FOUND OURSELVES PINNED AGAINST I T .               THIS

 Q42

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY FIGHTS OR DISTURBANCE OR UNUSUAL INCIDENT AT THE TIME OF

 TAKING UP YOUR MATCH VIEWING POINT?

 NO FIGHTS OR DISTURBANCE.      THE UNUSUAL THING WAS THAT PEOPLE AT THE FRONT AT

 THE FENCING WERE TRYING TO CLIMB THE FENCING TRYING TO GET OUT OF PEN 3.                  I

 A LSO   HEARD PEOPLE SHOUTING AND SCREAMING FOR THE GATE TO BE O P E N E D .

 IT     THEN CONTINUED AFTER T H A T , CONTINUOUS PRESSURE ALL THE T I M E .

 Q 45

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD SURGE,          IF S O , DO YOU KNOW WHAT CAUSED I T ?   (BRIEFLY)

 SEE A PERSON LYING OR A BODY DOWN TO THE GROUND TO MY RIGHT AND TOWARDS THE

 TWE   INJURIES TO ANY P E R S O N ?

 THE ONLY THING I CAN SAY BESIDES THE ACTUAL CRUSH AND THE LARGE N U M B E R S ,

 WHEN I SAW PEOPLE TRYING TO CLIMB THE FENCING TO GET OUT AND PEOPLE SHOUTING

 FOR THE GATE TO BE OPENED I SAW AN OFFICER PUSHING PEOPLE BACK I N TO THE PEN

 FROM THE PITCH SIDE OF          THE P E R I M E T E R   FENCE.   I D O N ’ T THINK THE O F F I C E R

 REALISED THE DANGER AND TOOK IT TO BE PEOPLE TRYING TO INVADE THE PITCH,,

 ANOTHER FACTOR WAS NO STEWARDS OR POLICE EVIDENT TO GUIDE AND DIRECT ONCE

 FANS HAD PASSED THROUGH THE T U R N S T I L E S AT THE TERRACE ENT R A N C E ,                I WOULD SAY

 THAT ALSO APPLIED TO THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE.

 OF MY OWN ACCORD.         I D I D NOT HEAR ANY LOUD SPEAKER DIRECTION OS ANNOUNCEMENT

 OR GIVEN ANY DIRECTION BY OFFICERS OR STEWARD.                     WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT SOME

 TIME AFTER 3.00 PM I DONT KNOW AT ALL HOW LONG THE PRESSURE DROPPED FROM

 e R i N D AND A SPACE BEHIND ME A SPACE NEAR TO THE DIVIDE OF PENS 3 AND 4

 APPEARED.      I GUIDED MY GIRL TO THAT AREA AND AS TIME PASSED MORE SPACE WAS

 CREATED TO ALLOW US TO GET TO THE TUNNEL AND THROUGH TO THE BACK OF THE

 TURNSTILES.      BY T H I S   TIME THE LAD WHO WAS WITH U S I N THE PEN HAD L E F T AND

 MADE H I S OWN WAY, WHERE I D O N ’ T KNOW.               WE THEN TOOK A VERY LONG P E R I O D            OF

 REST BACK    IN THE YARD NEAR TO THE BACK OF THE TURNSTILES.                        MY GIRLFRIEND

 WAS IN SHOCK AND VERY VERY DISTRESSED AND SO I COMFORTED HER.

WAS VERY E M O T I V E .

Q 33

DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

I WAS NOT AWARE AT ANY TIME OF THE                GAME STARTING OR BEING STOPPED.               I WAS

PRE-OCCUPIED WITH MY GIRL FRIENDS SAFETY AND MY OWN AND THE L A D S .                      I    HAVE TO

SAY THAT THE FANS WERE GREAT WITH HELPING PEOPLE MOVING THEM E T C . EVERYONE

WAS DOING SOMETHING.           I DID SEE AN       AMBULANCE ENTER BY A GATE NEAR           THE YARD

C ^ T H E PRIVATE CLUB ROAD.          IT   A PP E A R E D THAT THE CREW D I D   NOT HAVE   ANY S E N S E

OF URGENCY ABOUT THEM.             ONE LIVERPOOL     FAN DID APPROACH U S        AND GAVE U S    A CUP

OF WATER.

054

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

YES    IT   IS   MY OBSERVATION THAT AT ABOUT £.15 PM WHILST                OUTSIDE THE GROUND IN

LEPPINGS LANE ABOUT 100 YRDS FROM THE GROUND POLICE ON HORSES ABOUT TWO OF

THEM WERE F O R C I N G F A N S TO GO TO THE TURNSTILES TO THE LEPPINGS LANE E N T R A N C E .

'^pS CREATED A MASS OF PEOPLE TO GO IN,                 IN   ONE GO,     CREATING THE TIGHT SPOT

AT THE T U R N S T I L E S WHERE THE POLICE HAD NO CONTROL OF QUEUES WHATSOEVER .                       THERE

WERE NO QUEUES ITS AS IF THEY WANTED TO CLEAR THE STREETS OF FANS.                             PEOPLE

BECAUSE IT WAS A NICE DAY WERE TAKING THEIR TIME TO GO IN BUT WERE DIRECTED TO

ENTER THE GROUND.

I   FEEL ANOTHER FACTOR VITAL TO THE TRAGEDY IS WHY HAVE THE DIVIDE BARRIERS I N

THE WEST END TERRACE CREATING SMALL P E N S .                I KNOW THAT FOR A NORMAL MATCH

THEY WOULD BE SUFFICIENT BUT FOR SUCH AN IMPORTANT AND WELL ATTENDED SEMI

FINAL MATCH I F THE BARRIERS WERE NOT P R E S E N T              IT   WOULD HAVE ALLOWED F A N S    TO

SPREAD AROUND THE WHOLE OF THE WEST END TERRACE TO GIVE RELIEF TO ANY PRESSURE

 NO ACTIONS HAD BEEN TAKEN QUICK E N O U G H . NO COMMUNICATIONS I.E. POLICE CAMERAS

 ETC SPOTTING WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND NOT ACT ON IT QUICKER AND FACTORS IN

f t u S T I O N 49 ON THE WAY OUT I NOTICED STEWARDS STANDING ROUND DOING NOTHING AND

 LOOKING QUITE PLEASED WITH T H E M S E LV ES , SATISFIED THAT THEY HAD GOT FANS INTO                       j


 THE G R O U N D . ONE WAS SMOKING,     TOTALLY UNAWARE OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED.

 054

 IS    THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL I S VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 ON THE WAY OUT OF THE GROUND AT 3 . 2 0 P M         (1520)   I SAW A FAN IN THE AREA OF THE

 TERRACE TURNSTILES SAYING/SHOUTING,             “GIVE ME YOUR NAME AND A D D R E S S . I WANT YOU

 TO WITNESS THIS GATE WAS O P E N . "       THIS W A S N ’T DIRECTED TO ME, WAS AT GATE

RAREST       TO TERRACE TURNSTILES TO THE LEFT OF THE RIVER D O N.               I   SAW A FIRE

 ENGINE A R R I V E NEAR TO TERRACE TURNSTILES AND AN OFFICER JUMPED OUT OF THE CAB

 AND ASKED W H O ’S IN CHARGE TO PERSONS IN GENERAL.              NO ONE REPLIED.

 I AM SURE THE POLICE WAS TO STOP FANS              FROM   INTERMINGLING,     LIVERPOOL AND NOTTS

 FOREST BEFORE DURING AND AFTER THE GAME, AND YET WE VISITED THE PLAYERS

 ENTRANCE AND STAYED THERE AN H O U R . THE           PLAYERS ENTRANCE IN THE S STAND IS A

 NOTTS FOREST SUPPORTERS AREA. THIS MAKES A MOCKERY OF THE TICKET ALLOCATION,

 LIVERPOOL FANS WERE NOT GIVEN THE CORRECT PLACEMENT                   IN THE GROUND FOR THE

 NUMBERS EXPECTED        TO ATTEND AND THE TICKET A L L O C A T I O N .

 INSUFFICIENT ROOM FOR THE ENTRANCE AND EXIT OF F A N S                INTO THE STAND.

 NO, NONE WHATSOEVER.

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 A TOTAL S H A M B L E S .   THE FIRE BRIGADE HAD TO RUN BACK AND GET WIRECUTTERS. THEY

d®ktt_D HAVE BEEN PREPARED ON ARRIVAL- THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT FIRST AID

EQUIPMENT. THE POLICE COULD HAVE DONE A LOT MORE, MANY OF THEM WERE STANDING

AROUND BY THE FENCE»

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1. I FEEL THE MATCH WAS NOT DELAYED BECAUSE OF TELEVISION BROADCAST

 COMMITMENTS.       THIS MATTER NEEDS LOOKING I N T O .

2. TOTALLY IN AD E QU A TE TURNSTILE ADMISSION FACILITIES.

^ C O M P L E T E LACK OF DIRECTIONS BETWEEN THE TURNSTILES AND THE STAND. THESE

 SHOULD HAVE BEEN POLICE OR GROUND STEWARDS PRESENT AT THIS POINT.

 4. THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A POLICE LOUDSPEAKER OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES AND

 APPEALS SHOULD HAVE BEEN            MADE ASKING PEOPLE TO PULL BACK,AS THE PEOPLE    AT THE

 FRONT WERE BEING CRUSHED            AGAINST THE WALL.

 5. LAST SEASON WHEN LIVERPOOL PLAYED STOKE IN THE CUP I SAW ABOUT A THOUSAND

 LIVERPOOL FANS WITHOUT TICKETS, FORCE THEIR WAY THROUGH LOCKED GATES INTO THE

 GROUND. THE PROBLEM WILL            CONTINUE AS LONG AS THE GENUINE FAN CANNOT GET    A

 TICKET. LIVERPOOL FANS ARE FANATICAL            AND WILL GET I N ANY WAY POSSIBLE,

 JUDICIAL              I N Q U I R Y?

 THE CONTROL AT THE TU RNSTILE WAS P A T H E T I C ,                            THE PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE BEEN         IN

 QUEUES

 LAST YEAR THERE WAS A CORDON 5 0                            YARDS FROM THE GROUND TO STOP N ON -TI C K E T

 HOLDERS              IN,   IT     D I D N ’ T HAPPEN T H I S YEAR.

 WHEN THE D I S A S T E R               OCCURRED ABOUT A DOZEN O FF I C E R S WORKED REALLY HARD,                  OTHERS

 J U S T STOOD & WATCHED & THAT MUST GO DOWN TO S U P E R V I S I O N .

 I   THINK THE LACK OF ACTION BY STEWARDS WAS THE WORST T HI N G.

 I THINK THE T I C K ET ALLOCATION WAS A TROC I OU S .                               LI VERPOOL SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT

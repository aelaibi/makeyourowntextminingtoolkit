        Dear Mr Hutchinson,

              LITIGATION ARISING FROM THE HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL TRAGEDY;
                                         COMPLAINT OF CONTEMPT OF COURT

        Thank you for your letter of 2 March 1995 together with its
        enclosure.   The Attorney General has seen and is most grateful
        to you for your full and helpful response to the points raised
        following the complaint from Messrs Russell Jones and Walker.
        The Attorney General is satisfied that this is not an appropriate
        case in which he should institute proceedings for contempt of
        court.     Messrs Russell Jones and Walker have been informed
        accordingly.   It does not seem necessary in these circumstances
        to respond individually to the specific points you have made.
        Thank you for your assistance.
        Yours sincerely,




        S. J. WOOLER

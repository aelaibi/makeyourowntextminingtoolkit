       I enclose herewith a copy of a letter sent by Mr George
       Howarth MP to the Lord Chancellor about the DPP decision
       relating to Hillsborough.  You will note (despite the date on
       the LCD letter) that it has now been transferred to the
       Attorney General.

       As you are aware, the Attorney General is anxious that Members
       of Parliament who seek a hearing should not be turned away.
       He is however conscious that this Member raises a particular
       case rather than a general issue.  He has asked me to enquire
       whether the Director would be willing to see Mr Howarth and
       receive his representations and comments about the
       Hillsborough decision.

       No reply has yet been sent to Mr Howarth from LSLO and I
       should be grateful if you would have a word with me as soon as
       you have an opportunity to take the mind of the Director.

    Dear Sir

    HILLSBOROUGH

    Please could you place the attached letter before Mr Birts and ask him to
    telephone me, to discuss advice for the West Midlands Police on the
    conduct of this interview.
    I am faxing this letter as Superintendent Murray is due for interview on

        Dear Sirs,

        Re: Hillsborough - Superintendent B. Murray

        We refer to our telephone conversation                                                    on the 12th June when we told you
        that wo had received Leading Counsel's                                                     advices.   Our Client has obviously
        not seen this Opinion because he is away                                                  on holiday, and he will not be aware
        of its contents until we meet with him on                                                 the 22nd June.

        Leading Counsel has advised "that if the interviewing Officers intend at
        any stage to use video film of th e 1988 semi-final Superintendent Murray
        should not agree to be interviewed". Leading Counsel gives this advice as
        he believes it is a potentially dangerous and misleading way of interviewing.
        It was for this reason that our Mr. Manning telephoned Dctcctive Chief
        Superintendent Foster to seek assurance on this particular point.

        The position therefore is that if our Client accepts Leading Counsel's advices
        we shall want that assurance from you. Tf on the other hand, notwithstanding
        Counsel advices, Client decides differently then we will let you know.



        Yours faitl

         Dear Sirs,

         R e; Hillsborough - Superintendent B. Murray

        We refer to our telephone conversation                                                          on the 12th 3une when we told you
        that wo had received Leading Counsel's                                                           advices.   Our Client has obviously
        not seen this Opinion because he is away                                                        on holiday, and he will not be aw are
        of its contents until wc meet with him on                                                       the 22nd June.

        Leading Counsel has advised "th at if the interviewing Officers intend at
        any stage to use video film of the 1988 semi-final Superintendent Murray
        should not agree to be Interviewed", Leading Counsel gives this advice as
        he believes it is a potentially dangerous and misleading way of interviewing.
        It was for this reason th a t our Mr. Manning telephoned D etective Chief
        Superintendent Foster to seek assurance on this particular point.

        The position th erefore is th a t if our Client accepts Leading Counsel's advices
        wo shall want th a t assurance from you. Tf on the other hand, notwithstanding
        Counsel advices, Client decides differently then we will let you know.



         Yours faithfully,                                                                                                   ✓t| c A a (m A : q J L u J n                              Vo

         Dear Sir

         Hillsborough Disaster                                                                *'

        Mr Gareth Williams QC and Mr Peter Birts QC are retained by
        the Crown Prosecution Service to advise in this case.

         I enclose a copy of a letter which I have today received from
         the West Midlands Police investigating officers.  In addition
         to the letter I also enclose copies of the items which were
         enclosed.

         It is possible that Mr Birts and Mr Williams have received
         copies of this documentation direct from the police and the
         purpose of this letter is simply a belt and braces exercise.

         Yours faithfully

             Dear Mr Kennedy

             I enclose statements from Chief Superintendent Mole and Chief
             Superintendent Denton, South Yorkshire Police, which cover the areas we
             discussed at the meeting on Friday 20 April 1990.

             Detective Superintendent Taylor is pursuing the B0WNES statement and once
             that is received it will be forwarded.

             The statements enclosed are numbered for insertion in the relevant part of
             the file, Chief Superintendent Mole in Part II and Chief Superintendent
             Denton in Part V. Amended alphabetical witness lists are included with
             the statements to insert in each Part.

             Yours sincerely

          In 1981 (000081) I was a Police Superintendent in charge of Uniform

          Operations for South Yorkshire Police.    This entailed knowledge of all

          Operational aspects for the force with particular emphasis on major

          football and public order events.

          As a result I was well aware of the 1981 (000081) crushing problem at

          Hillsborough at the FA Cup Semi final.    My deputy attended the de­

          brisf which followed the event because I was at the Police Staff

          College.   As a result I was well aware of the action taken by South

          Yor<shire Police and other agencies resulting in the introduction of

          the radial fences.

          The de-brief minutes were placed onto a Headquarters Police file

          spe-ifically relating to football.

          Fron June 1982 (000682) I was posted to F Division and involved in the

          Policing of matches at Hillsborough.     It was the policy of that

          Division to retain a Divisional football working file which I have

          today shown to Det Chief Supt FOSTER.    This file canxnenced in December

          197 9 (001279) and in Volume II which suggests a previous file is in

          existence.

This file contains a copy of the de-brief minutes    frc m   the 1981

(003081) incident and was thus available for any Divisional, Deputy or

Sub Divisional Conmander to view.    The file is actually retained by

the Divisional football liaison officer.

Because of my knowledge of the 1981 (000081) incident by the time of

the 1987 (000087) and 1988 (000088) semi finals when I was Chief

Supsrintendent of the Division, the 1981 (000081) incident did not

feature in my planning.     The reason was that I was aware the problem

had been addressed by the addition of the radial fences creating the

thei three separate pens.     It was also therefore not a subject I would

havs passed on to any new match Commander caning to my Division.

Following the semi finals in 1987 (000087) and 1988 (000088) de-briefs

were held.

The de-brief system is as follows, firstly once a serial is stood down

the serial sergeant is required to complete a de-brief document.        This

document known as a sheet contains information as to any incidents

that have occurred during the operation such as arrests, persons

injored, use of truncheon by Police Officers or any course of conduct

outside the normal scope of the Operation.

The de-brief sheet is then immediately passed by the Sergeant to the

logistics team who review each de-brief sheet before releasing the

serial.

My jwn supervisory officer de-brief then took place seme three to four

days after each semi final.     It is right to say this de-brief extended

to include representatives of every Division or Department involved.

I can state that in both 1987 (000087) and in 1988 (000088) the de-

brisfs did not disclose any suggestion that supporters had been

injared due to overcrowding or crushing.     In addition, I cannot recall

any other agency reporting to me such a problem.

        As regards the tunnel being closed in 1988 (000088) by Police Officers

        tha:: is the sort of incident I would have expected to have been on a

        de-orief sheet.   I was not made aware of the problan in 1988 (000088)

        and as a result my planning for 1989 (000089) was not influenced.

        Other aspects of my planning did change because of the result of the

        1983 (000088) de-brief including the removal of Air cover and the

        removal of one serial from Hillsborough precinct.

        It vas this that resulted in my view that 1988 (000088) was a success

        and formed a sound base for the 1989 (000089) match.

           I an presently head of Management Services for South Yorkshire

        Pol Lee.

        The Central Registry of all Policy files coines within the

        resoonsibilities of my department.

           I have shown to Det Chief Supt FOSTER a Headquarters' Central

        Registry Policy file bearing the number P22/02/08 delaing with Major

           football matches.   This file contains documentation from 1974 (000074)

        onwards and coincides with the formation of South Yorkshire Police.

        Sucn policy files are available at Headquarters for all Senior

        Officers and any other interested parties and in the focal point of

           all policy decisions on the given subject.   This policy document is

           retained at Headquarters and not sent to Divisions.   The content of

           this Central Registry file often contains information sent frcm

        outside Divisions of the force.      However, Headquarter Policy decisions

        made are placed into this file and copies are sent to the Division

           whi-h will have its own Divisional file and working papers.

           The Headquarters file P22/02/08 contains the minutes of the 1981

           (000081) de-brief following the incident at Hillsborough at the 1981

          The Police officers who attended that 1981 (000081) de-brief would

          havs been each given a copy of the minutes for information and one

       Dear Sir

       HILLSBOROUGH

       Mr Williams and Mr Birts are advising the Crown Prosecution Service in
       respect of this case.

       I enclose a copy of a letter with enclosure today received from Chief
       Superintendent Foster of the West Midlands Police investigation team.

      Please could you place this before Mr Birts for his attention and advice.
      We did discuss this possibility in conference with Mr Birts recently.
      Perhaps Mr Birts could telephone me to confirm the position re
      Dr. Eastwood.

      Yours faithfully

 Dear Mr Kennedy

 I refer to our meeting with Mr Peter Birts QC, and the letter (copy
 attached) from Dr Eastwoods Solicitors.

 On Monday 1st May 1990 I met with the Solicitors representing Dr Eastwood
 and explained   to them the reason for requesting the interview and pointing
 out the areas   I wished to pursue.

 The response however remains the same and their advice to Dr Eastwood is
 not to answer any further questions in a cautioned interview. They would
 agree to him responding by way of written questions and answers directed
 through them but that will not achieve the objective and be of little
 value.

 They have asked I point out to you their reasoning based upon Dr
 Eastwood’s instructions. Briefly it is this; he spent in excess of two
 days giving evidence before Lord Justice Taylor and only became a "party"
 in that Inquiry some days after it commenced. He was under great stress
 at the time because his only daughter had died in the February.

 He also faces now a court appearance in respect of the Civil Action in
 October 1990 and there is the prospect of giving evidence at a future full
 Inquest. His solicitors say Dr Eastwood feels he has done enough by
 producing all of the relevant documentation for the Inquiry in addition to
 his time giving evidence.

 The evidence submitted already is sufficient for the Director of Public
 Prosecutions to make a decision on any alleged criminal offences and
 nothing further can be gained by interview is the conclusion they have
 reached.


                                                                   Continued...




   PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT
                                    2.


I can add nothing to the above that is not already stated in the report to
you on the evidence relating to Dr Eastwood. I would value your advice
and that of Mr Peter Birts QC, albeit I presume it will be the same
conclusion as discussed at our last meeting.

For your information I have arranged to see the Solicitors representing
the other parties at Sheffield on the 8th and 9th May 1990 to disclose the
video and photographic material we intend to feature. At this time I
anticipate being in a position to begin the necessary interviews in
consultation with the Chief Constable Mr Sharp.

Yours sincerely




M J Foster
Detective Chief Superintendent

         Dear Sir,


         Hillsborough Disaster - Criminal Investigation



         Thank you for your letter of 2nd March sent to us on behalf of
         Dr. Eastwood.

         We imagine that your letter reflected a standard form sent to
         all  interested  parties.         It has   nevertheless caused
         Dr. Eastwood considerable concern and disquiet.

     We have advised Dr. Eastwood that we cannot contemplate any
     criminal charges which could possibly be brought against him,
     not least in view of Lord Justice Taylor's         comments at
     paragraph 289 of his Interim Report where he said:


                              "For his part, Dr. Eastwood is skilled and
                              experienced   in  this  field,  as  already
                              indicated, and he sought I have no doubt to
                              act efficiently and professionally in his
                              advice and practical work. "


     Our view, and Lord Justice Taylor's comments, have brought some
     comfort to Dr.    Eastwood but he remains distressed at the
     prospect,  however remote,   of his   being interviewed under
     caution.

     You will know that Dr. Eastwood voluntarily supplied a full
     written statement with supporting documents from his files for




          Lloyd's Office: Room 692, Floor 6, Lloyd’s, 1 Lime Street, London EC3M 7DQ. Telephone: 01623 7100 (Ext 4188) Fax: 01929 I960
                                                   Authorised by the Law Society to conduct investment business.
 J. Mervyn Jones, Esq. ,
 Assistant Chief Constable
 West Midlands Police                         -   2-   9 April 1990



the purpose of the Inquiry.    He did so even though he was made
a party extremely late in the day, indeed many weeks after the
actual Inquiry hearing had commenced.      He gave oral evidence
to the Inquiry for more than 2% days, far longer than any other
witness.    During that period he was questioned by Leading and
Junior Counsel, as the case may be,   for all parties as well as
by Lord Justice Taylor himself.

We cannot conceive that in his Statement and oral evidence, of
which you will have a transcript, Dr. Eastwood did not deal
exhaustively with all matters of relevance.      We cannot see
that a distressing interview under caution could or would add
anything to what Dr. Eastwood has already said in evidence.

Nevertheless, Dr. Eastwood wishes as ever to be co-operative.
In the unlikely event that there is any particular aspect which
you feel may not have been covered adequately in his written
Statement or oral    evidence then the most convenient and
appropriate course might be for       you to write to us with
relevant questions.   Dr. Eastwood will then be happy to answer
them in writing via ourselves.


Yours faithfully,




REYNOLDS                CHAMBERLAIN

      Dear Sir

      Hillsborough Disaster

      Mr Gareth Williams QC and Mr Peter Birts QC are retained to
      advise the Crown Prosecution Service in this matter.

      I met with Mr Birts in conference on Friday, 20 April 1990.
      Mr Birts asked if it was possible to obtain copies of the
      opinion given by leading Counsel for the prosecution in the
      Zeebrugge Ferry Disaster case. Leading Counsel in that case
W     is |Mr David Jeffreys QC/whose chambers are at Queen Elizabeth
f     Building, Temple?                              — ..       ...

      I have spoken with the Lawyers in this office dealing with
      that matter and it is felt that it might be better if a
      request for copies of Counsel's opinion was dealt with on a
      Counsel to Counsel basis. Accordingly we have no objection to
      Mr Birts approaching Mr Jeffreys to discuss the matter.

      Secondly Mr Birts asked if we were aware of the dates of the
      Zeebrugge trial at the Old Bailey.  The full trial is due to
      take place later this year. However preliminary argument has
      been fixed to be heard"by the Trial Judge initially on 22 May
      1990 for four days and then subsequently for a further four
      days from 5 June 1990.  Interestingly this argument is to be
      on the corporate manslaughter point7

clarification or should Mr Birts wish to discuss any matters
with me I should be only too pleased to speak with him.

      Dear Sir

      Hillsborough

      I have recently received a letter from Mr-Jones, the Assistant
      Chief Constable conducting this investigation. I.enclpge.a
     “copy of"this letter and should be grateful if you could place
      it before Mr Williams and Mr Birts for their attention.   It is
      possible that they have already received a copy of this letter
      direct from Mr Jones.

      If it appears that there are any difficulties in so far as
      Counsel being able to attend the meeting on 12 April I should
      be grateful if you would contact me.  I have timed this
      meeting for 4.30 pm although I understand that if Mr Williams
      commitments in court change that the meeting can be brought
      forward at reasonably short notice to 10 am on that day.

      Yours faithfully

            HILLSBOROUGH INVESTIGATION - DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS REPORT

            I have forwarded, under separate cover, the full file of evidence to you
            in respect of the investigation.  I have also sent copies of this full
            file to Mr G Williams QC, Mr P Birts and Captain E N Taylor at the
            Police Complaints Authority.

            You will see in the Report, Part VII, that we have raised certain
            recommendations which are based on our Interim Conclusions.  It must be
            stressed that these are provisional conclusions, given that we have not
            yet interviewed any of the 'principles'.  We have also listed the people
            we would like to interview, starting with Police Constables Smith and
            Illingworth.  In order that we can start these interviews in good time,
            hopefully on the week commencing Monday 23 April t We would appreciate
            an early advice from you so that we can make arrangements with the
            solicitors for these interviews to go ahead.  It would be very much
            appreciated if we could have that early advice before we meet on
            Thursday 12 April 1990 in London.  I understand that the time of the
            meeting has yet to be fixed subject to the availability of Mr G Williams
            QC.  I await your advice on the time.

            By now you will have gathered that we have had a new Investigating
            Officer appointed.  You will also have noted that the new Chief Constable
            of the West Midlands Police, Mr Ron Hadfield, cannot assume the
            appointment because he was a material witness at the match.  It would
            seem appropriate when we have our meeting in London on 12 April 1990, for
            the new Investigating Officer, who I believe will be Mr Les Sharp of the
            Cumbria Constabulary, to join us.

      Dear Sir

      Hillsborough Disaster

      Mr Gareth Williams QC and Mr Peter Birts QC are retained to
      advise the Crown Prosecution Service in this matter.

      I met with Mr Birts in conference on Friday, 20 April 1990.
      Mr Birts asked if it was possible to obtain copies of the
      opinion given by leading Counsel for the prosecution in the
      Zeebrugge Ferry Disaster case. Leading Counsel in that case
      is Mr David Jeffreys QC whose chambers are at Queen Elizabeth
      Building, Temple.

      I have spoken with the Lawyers in this office dealing with
      that matter and it is felt that it might be better if a
      request for copies of Counsel's opinion was dealt with on a
      Counsel to Counsel basis. Accordingly we have no objection to
      Mr Birts approaching Mr Jeffreys to discuss the matter.

      Secondly Mr Birts asked if we were aware of the dates of the
      Zeebrugge trial at the Old Bailey.   The full trial is due to
      take place later this year. However preliminary argument has
      been fixed to be heard by the Trial Judge initially on 22 May
      1990 for four days and then subsequently for a further four
      days from 5 June 1990.   Interestingly this argument is to be
      on the corporate manslaughter point.

      Dear Sir

      HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

      Mr Gareth Williams QC and Mr Peter Birts are retained to
      advise the Crown Prosecution Service in this case.

      A request by the Hillsborough Steering Group has recently been
      received in a letter dated 5th February 1990, for the
      disclosure of information as to the actual positions of the
      deceased at the ground.     This is to assist them in dealing
      with negotiations on damages in the civil claim. A copy of
      the letter rrOffi'Tfler^teering Committee is attached.

      I also attach a copy of a letter from the coroner Dr Popper.
      He has received a similar request.  He feels that the
      information should be supplied via adjourned inquest hearings
      which could be held on a formal basis but restricted to giving
      only that information requested by the Steering Group.

      I have spoken to ACC Jones who is also content to supply the
      information in the way Dr Popper suggests. He agrees that the
      supply of this information, on a restricted basis would not
      prejudice the criminal investigation. Mr Jones also feels
      that there would be operational advantages to him if the
      requests could be dealt with in this way.

    We have considered the request carefully, bearing in mind in
    particular, Public Iri’terest Immunity.          It is our view that the
    iritormanon "cbUia G'   5 T V led  "pr u vl de d it can be disclosed
    through the formal channel of an inquest and restricted to
    that inrorma't'iOii reqtraatad which will'liot ifivoive the
  ^di^cjrpsure of any contTbversial lnrormatiorT. However, before
   xhe lnfuiitid-fc-ion— is released we ought to b e ‘satisfied first,
    that the^sucply of this information will- not prejudice the
    criminalClnlastlgation and^&fcond, that there will be no
    prejudice t|j any potential/prosecution case.

I should be grateful to receive your views on this point as
quickly as possible.               ------

I also enclose a copy of a letter which I have received from
the solicitors acting for the South Yorkshire Police. A reply
is being sent indicating that in our view the civil trial
         -it taVp piaga-nnhi 1 the conclusion of'any criminal
         Lon.

I enclose this documentation in duplicate to be placed before
both Mr Williams and Mr Birts for their attention.  If there
are any difficulties please could you telephone
Michael Kennedy to discuss the matter.

Dear Mr. Newell,

       HTT.TflBQHOPGg - 15th of April 1989.

I refer to Miss. Steel’s letter to you of the 5th of February 1990.
I have discussed'the contents of this letter with Hr. Mervyn Jones
Assistant Chief Constable, West Midlands Police who is in full
agreement.
I also bad a meeting with Counsel (prior to the receipt of Miss.
Steel's letter) in which I dlsouased some of the procedural
aspects relating to this matter.
On the whole, I think that Miss. Steel's suggestions may have some
merit in them and in particular as far as I am concerned, I
think that it might be both helpful and advantageous if X were
to resume the Inquests in early Spring for the purposes of taking
the medical evidence, together with non-oontraversial evidenoe
such as to the location' of the deceased, either alive or dead
or toth~within theTground.
If I were to do this, it would be on the basis that the evidence
being taken at that stage, would be restricted to these matters.
Obviously a degree of control of the proceedings would be required,
but X axpeot this oould be achieved*
We think that it would be useful if you agree, for Mr. Jones and
myself to meet with you to discuss this aspect of the matter as soon
as possible so that if we were minded to deal with it along iiiese
lines, the appropriate arrangements can be made as soon aa possible.
Mr. Jones and I would be available on the following dates 1-
           20th (a.m. only), 21st, 22nd, 23rd February 1990
           or other, after discussion.
Please /let me hear from you as soon as possible.

Dear Sirs,

Hillsborough

Further to previous correspondence, there is to be a High Court
hearing on 27th February, 1990 at which consideration will be given
to the question of the present civil proceedings being carried on
by the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire against Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club and Messrs. Eastwood & Partners.

There are various issues but, for the purposes of this letter, the
material question is whether the action ought to be tried (as now
intended) during October, 1990 or whether any trial should be
deferred until after the conclusion (whichever is the later) of:


           1.     Your own inquiry,

           2.     Any subsequent criminal proceedings.

           3.     Any subsequent disciplinary proceedings.

           4.     The inquests into the deaths of the victims,


As requested in your earlier letter, the case of DPR Futures Limited
was brought to the attention of the. Judge on 20th December, 1989.
We have noted in the press that there has since been a case in which



                                                                                                                   /... contd.

 you have thought fit to intervene directly, namely, th
 brought by Mr. Warren against a Mr. Marsh.  We are not
 what considerations led to your intervention in that matter
 suspect that public interest in the civil trial may have
 relevant.  This would distinguish the case from that of D
 Limited.

 Our own feeling is that public interest in the Hillsborough
 trial is likely to be at least as great as that involving Messrs,
 Warren and Marsh.

 We should be most grateful if you could assist us with the following
 matters:                                                                                                                                                                - :        ' y:,' :v

      Dear Sir

      HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
      YORKSHIRE TELEVISION PROGRAMME

     Mr Williams and Mr Birts are advising the Director of Public
     Prosecutions in this matter.     Kindly place this letter and
     enclosures before both Counsel for their information.

      I recently attended at Yorkshire Television in London to see a
      rough-cut version of the above television programme. I made some
      notes during the course of the showing of this programme which
      have now been typed and copies are enclosed for your attention.

      The format of the programme refers continually to the findings
      of Lord Justice Taylor's interim report.     On the question of
      content alone I am of the view that there is no question of
      contempt of court, either under common law or under the 1981 Act.

      The police are happy with the contents of the proposed programme.

      Should either Mr Williams or Mr Birts wish to discuss the
      programme with me, I shall be only to pleased to speak with them.

      Yours faithfully

With the Chief Constable Mr Dear, the ACC Mr Jones, and Chief
Superintendent Foster.  Also present were the Head of Current
Affairs and Documentaries at Yorkshire, Mr McKeen, and the
producer of the programme.

We were shown a rough-cut video of the proposed Yorkshire
Television programme which had not as yet, been given a title.
The narrator's script was not on the video but one of the members
of the company read through the proposed script as the video was
being shown.

The video was basically a story of the day, 15 April 1989, when
the Hillsborough disaster occurred.   Generally speaking, it was
a fairly low key, although at times emotional, account of what
occurred on the day.   It followed closely Lord Justice Taylor's
interim report, and made comments from the conclusions which had
been reached, quoting the report on each occasion.

Yorkshire Television confirmed that it was the company's aim to
show the programme close to publication of the report which is
likely to be in mid February.


BRIEF SYNOPSIS OF THE PROGRAMME

The programme began with the description of the West Midlands
Police Inquiry, covering operational matters and the interviewing
of witnesses.    Use of the computer, and how the Inquiry had
itself looked at the occurrences on that day.

There were descriptions of 24,000 fans coming from Liverpool to
Sheffield, film of the fans arriving at Hillsborough and South
Yorkshire's police match briefing.

Throughout the film, Sergeant Morgan, of the South Yorkshire
police, who had been put forward by his superiors at the request
of Yorkshire Television, commented on the work of the police
at the ground.   He confirmed that no mention had been made of
overcrowding at the briefing.

Descriptions were given of the position of the police at the
ground and it was confirmed by all, both police and witnesses
that the atmosphere at the beginning of the afternoon was most
pleasant.

The     T ay lo r   en q u iry   was   q u o ted   as   lo o k in g   a t   th e   q u e stio n   of

BMKEO1 1 9 . C 02
drunkenness.          It concluded that the vast majority of fans were
not drunk.

The West Midlands police enquiry gathered a large number of
photographs and video evidence which was studied closely.

The programme, by use of video and commentary describes the scene
at Hillsborough that afternoon from 2.30 pm onwards.          The
programme quotes the South Yorkshire police being criticised by
the Taylor enquiry as not being able to cope with the large
numbers of fans at the gates and being unable to deal with crowd
control. Sergeant Morgan describes the crushing of fans outside
the turnstiles, and saying that there was definitely a danger of
lives being lost.     The programme quotes the enquiry being
critical of policing in 1989 compared with 1988, particularly as
there had been problems at the semi final the year before (1988).


At 2.40 pm there were 5,000 fans estimated to be outside the
ground and concerned that they would not be able to get in by
3.00 pm for the kick-off.     The enquiry quoted the Health and
Safety Executive who counted fans on video and concluded that
5.000 people would take about an hour to get through the
turnstiles. The programme indicates that Duckenfield could have
postponed the kick-off but decided not to.       Sergeant Morgan
confirmed that delaying the kick-off may have calmed the crowd
and prevented the crushing. He did not know why the kick-off had
not been delayed.   He confirmed that a tannoy message may have
had the desired effect of calming the crowd of people outside the
ground.  He said there were 50 officers in that small area who
were unable to deal with       the four offive thousand fans.
Sergeant Morgan confirmed that the police had lost control.

The programme confirmed that Superintendent Marshall had wanted
to let fans in, though others agreed to get the gates open to
avoid injuries outside. Sergeant Morgan agreed with this course
of action. The programme quoted the Judge as agreeing that the
police must have reached a decision to open the gates.        The
question of where the fans were to go would be the responsibility
of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield. He was in the control room
at this time. Descriptions were given of the TV cameras giving
the control room sight of the various parts of the ground.

By 2.50 pm it was evident that the pens were full well over their
capacity. The enquiry concluded that the pens were full, and to
allow in large numbers of extra people was courting disaster.

Sergeant Morgan was questioned about being able to put officers
across the tunnel or across the gates and prevent the pens
overfilling. A description was given of a previous year when a
barrier of police and stewards had stopped the pens, which were
already full becoming overcrowded.    The programme quotes the
enquiry's statement that the failure to give order to block
the tunnel was a blunder of the first magnitude.

Two    th o u san d   fans   are   q u o ted   as   co m in g   th ro u g h   G ate   C   to   th e

BMKEO1 1 9 . C02
tunnel.   There were graphic descriptions by fans being forced
forward and along into the tunnel and then being sucked into the
crowd in the pens. Various findings of the enquiry were quoted,
including the complaints of police conduct, insensitivity and the
fact that persons on the ground were initially unsympathetic to
the plight of fans crushed and trapped in the pens. Attempts by
fans to get out of the pens were initially seen as attempts to
invade the pitch. There were comments in the programme from fans
on the monitors and the police being able to see what was going
on, but not taking any action eg "how could professional people
be so blind?".

There were graphic descriptions by fans who had been in the pens
of others suffering injury and dying.

The Health and Safety Executive were quoted as having calculated
that the pens were overcrowded by 50%.      At 3.04 - 3.05 the
barrier in pen 3 snapped and descriptions were given of people
grabbing and grasping at each other in an attempt to save
themselves from being trampled crushed in the sea of bodies.

At 3.05 the match was stopped, but Senior Officers still believed
that this was an attempted pitch invasion.       Sergeant Morgan
describes in awful terms what he found, what he could see at the
front of the pens.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was still concerned about public
order, and ordered dog handlers at this stage. After orders had
been passed for fleets , of ambulances, Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield realised the gravity of the situation.

Descriptions given of fans trying to pull other fans out of the
pens over the fencing.

Sergeant Morgan describes asking officers to go into pen 3 to
push people back down the tunnel to alleviate the crush.    He
describes going to the front of the terracing in pen 3 finding
a pile of bodies crushed up against the wall waist deep.

At 3.15 pm, in the enquiry, Lord Justice Taylor, is quoted as
describing Chief Superintendent Duckenfield as being frozen.

There are then descriptions      of the lie,     told by Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield to the FA, Mr Kelly about the gates
being kicked open by fans.    Mr Jackson, a solicitor, who as a
member of the Liverpool supporters club was critical, of the lie
to Mr Kelly and the subsequent admission of this at the evidence
given by Duckenfield to the enquiry.

Finally, Lord Justice Taylor's conclusion that one of the reasons
for the disaster was the failure by the South Yorkshire police
to control the crowds, is quoted in the programme script.

Overall, the tenor of the programme is rather low key and
certainly not campaigning or accusatory. Whilst the programme
is emotional in some parts, it is a dispassionate description

BMKEO1 1 9 . C 02
of the day, and any criticism is simply repeat criticism of Mr
Duckenfield and the Yorkshire Police         by referring to
quotations from the preliminary report of Lord Justice Taylor.
The programme could be described as a version of the Taylor
Interim Report with pictures.

This rough edition of the programme is likely to be subject to
some further cuts down to an actual running time of 50 minutes
for broadcasting.

The police were generally very pleased with the programme and
they felt that it was a fair assessment of what had happened
without being unfairly or overly critical of any of the parties
involved.   I was asked by Mr Dear for my opinion from a legal
point of view, and I indicated that I was happy with the contents
and felt that    there worq/any criticism which had been levelled
at parties, were simply direct "takes" from the report, and in
the circumstances, I was content with the production in it's
present form.

I am firmly of the view that transmission of this programme in
its present form in mid February 1990 could not constitute
contempt of court for the purposes of any proceedings flowing
from the current West Midlands Police criminal investigation.

      Dear Sir

      HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
      YORKSHIRE TELEVISION PROGRAMME

      Mr Williams and Mr Birts are advising the Director of Public
      Prosecutions in this matter.     Kindly place this letter and
      enclosures before both Counsel for their information.

      I recently attended at Yorkshire Television in London to see a
      rough-cut version of the above television programme. I made some
      notes during the course of the showing of this programme which
      have now been typed and copies are enclosed for your attention.

      The format of the programme refers continually to the findings
      of Lord Justice Taylor's interim report.     On the question of
      content alone I am of the view that there is no question of
      contempt of court, either under common law or under the 1981 Act.

      The police are happy with the contents of the proposed programme.

      Should either Mr Williams or Mr Birts wish to discuss the
      programme with me, I shall be only to pleased to speak with them.

      Yours faithfully

       Mr Williams and Mr Birts have been retained                                                                     to     advise            the
       Director of Public Prosecutions in this matter.

       I enclose two copies of a letter and it's enclosure received from
       defence solicitors representing South Yorkshire Police. A copy
       is provided for both counsel so that they can be informed of this
       development.

       I have passed a copy of this letter to Mr Mervin Jones who is
       leading the West Midlands police enquiry.

       Yours faithfully

 In the event, no such warning or .reminder was given.

 view as to whether it bears any significance to the decisions which
 will ultimately have to.be taken by the DPP when the West Midlands
 Inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster has been concluded.

 The view expressed by our clients is ...that, as the note is in
 existence, it .ought to be made"available, both to yourself and to the
 representatives of.those against whom complaints/have been raised as
 a result of the occurrence ofvtfae disaster.

       Dear Sir

      HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

      Mr Gareth Williams and Mr Peter Birts are retained by the
      Crown Prosecution Service to advise in respect of the above
      matter.

       I enclose a copy of a letter dated 30 October 1989 which I
       have received from Solicitors who represent the South
       Yorkshire Police in the current civil proceedings.

       I would respectfully refer Counsel to the copy advice which
       they had kindly prepared and I should be grateful to hear
       Counsel^s’comments on condition three which is referred to in
       the fourth paragraph of the enclosed letter. Mr Williams and
       Mr Birts will recall discussing this matter briefly during our
       return journey from a visit to the Hillsborough Stadium on
       Friday, 10 November 1989.

       I look forward to hearing from you in due course.

       Yours faithfully

This is a request for samples to be taken for metalld gical

testing. In our view this is a reasonable request pte^idtlng

the following undertakings are given
                                                        A          . i,

This is a more difficult area. The bereaved, quite

understahdably, wish a speedy resolution of the civi^dieput^,^

and apparently an undertaking has been given that f u n

cooperation will be given in order to secure a proAj^tflal. '
                                                  '■ m s' • t I
We have considered In re D.P.R. Futures Limited [1m    1 WLft
778. In our view, the possible prejudice in D.P.R.'s Ckse was
                                                      *
more likely than in the present matter.

     On balance our advice is that no application to £j:ay the

civil proceedings needs to be made. However, we shoula obtain

an undertaking, if possible form Hammond Suddards, thift the

judge dealing with interlocutory matters at any stag6*pe
                                                                     1 if
referred to D.P.R.'s case, so that he may be alerted w         £he

problew, if necessary making orders restricting pubil®tion o'

sensitive or potentially prejudicial matter. The sam&jretild

apply if the civil trial itself were to precede our

Advice.                                                   -4

Dear Sirs

HILLSBOROUGH

Your faxed letter dated 20 October 1989 addressed to the
Director of Public Prosecutions has been passed to me for
reply.

With regard to the question of possible prejudice and the
D.P.R. Futures case, it is our view that, on balance, no
application to stay civil proceedings needs to be made.
However, the Director would be grateful to receive an
undertaking that the Judge dealing with interlocutory matters
at any stage be referred to the DPR case so that he may be
alerted to the problem if necessary making orders restricting
publication of sensitive or potentially prejudicial matters.
The same would apply if the civil trial itself were to precede
the Director's final decision.

With regard to the request made to the West Midlands Police
for samples to be taken from barrier 124A for metallurgical
testing.  There is no objection to such samples being taken
providing the following undertakings are first given in
writing by each party

1.   When samples are taken and when tests are carried out
     wherever they occur a representative nominated by the
     Crown Prosecution Service is to be present.

2.   Photographs are to be taken whenever samples are obtained
     and copies provided to the C.P.S.

3.   All reports and data are to be provided promptly to the
     C.P.S.       ------- -
                              - 2 -


  Please would you be good enough to liaise on the above points
  with either myself or Mr Michael Kennedy in this office.

  Yours faithfully

 Dear sir,

 Hillsborough

 Thank you for your fax of 25th October.

 We can confirm that the case of DPR Futures Limited was mentioned
 to Mr. justice Rose at the hearing on 26th October.

At that hearing, an unsuccessful application for a stay of the
proceedings was made on behalf of the South Yorkshire Police, not
in connection with possible prejudice to any Officer who may be the
       i    the Presei}t inquiry, but simply on the basis that it is
oiifxcult for the Chief Constable to prepare a case when Officers,
riI ^ °r wron9ly» believe that they may be under investigation
and, hence, are unwilling to co-operate in providing further
statements.   We mention this merely by way of information.

We are pleased to note that samples can be made available from
 a r n e r 124A, but it seems to us that, vyhilst conditions 1 and 2
referred to are not unreasonable, condition 3 represents a potential
.infringement of our client ’s right! to privilege in documentation "
prepared tor the use of the civiJT’triSlT" "                       —

Whilst we cannot see any obvious objection to providing a copy o£
the expert’s report for disclosure in the civil trial, there may be
^raft^reports, correspondence, etc. in respect of which privilege

   Dear Mr Birts

   Now that all of the interviews are complete I forward to you the
   transcripts of those interviews.

   It has been necessary to refer to additional statements and documents which
   are not currently in the file we forwarded to you. These statements and
   documents are included with the transcripts and I have enclosed a schedule
   which explains exactly what these additions are.

   Ky officers will insert the documentation into your file on delivery if you
   so wish.

   As you know initially in Part VII, the ie^ort, we recommended interviewing
   both Mr McGee, the then Chairman of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and
   Mr Keith Addy, the Director with specific responsibility for structural
   matters at Hillsborough. I would be grateful if, after consideration of
   the interview with the Secretary, Mr Mackrell, you could reply with a
   confirmation as to whether these interviews should take place.

   Certainly it is unlikely Mr McGee and his solicitor would agree to an
   interview based upon my previous explanation to you. However, Mr Addy
   would, I understand, make himself available if necessary.

   We have encountered difficulty in obtaining a full statement from Mr BOVljkES
   of the Council. That is complete no#'1>ut has led to further enquiries and
   documentation to explain the points you wanted to cover. I am hopeful •this                 .
   documentation will be with you in the next seven days.            ~ ' j                     Um
   If I can be of further assistance please contact either myself or Detecjtive
   Chief Superintendent Foster of Nechells Green Police Station.

   Yours sincerely

     Dear Mr Kennedy

     Following your receipt of the West Midlands Report on the investigation
     into the Hillsborough Disaster 1989, the meeting which followed and
     subsequent agreement with the Police Complaints Authority, it was decided
     that certain interviews would be undertaken by the West Midlands Police
     investigators under my supervision, and that I would conduct some of the
     interviews myself.

    These interviews have commenced and in accordance with the forementioned
    agreements, it is now my intention to forward to you the transcripts of
    these interviews at the earliest possible moment, together with any
    associated video and audio recordings.

    Please find herewith the transcripts and associated materials which arise
    from the latest round of interviews.

    Because of the relationship between the interviews you will no doubt wish
    to defer any advice until they are all to hand but in the meanwhile should
    there be any further information required, or any direction you may wish
    to give, I am sure you will contact either myself or Detective Chief
    Superintendent Foster at the above address.

    Although dates of some of the interviews still await confirmation by the
    various legal representatives, it is hoped that the final interview will
    be concluded during the first week of July 1990.

    HILLSBOROUGH INVESTIGATION

    I enclose for your information a video tape which has b'-;eu made up to
    assist in the forthcoming interviews if necessary. The document number is
    I4 3n for the D.P.P. file.

    The tape shows a sp]it screen of the crowd build up in Leppings Lane at
    set intervals from 2 pm onwards using the original video material frow the
    1988 and 1989 games.

    I accept that evidentially the video is r.ot best evidence but it helps to
    show r.he difference in crowd build up on the two occasions. Ir. is my
    belie.*: this is a factor that may be introduced by some of those to be
    interviewed.

    From your present video list the respective video Document Numbers are 146
    ror 1S88 and 110 for 1989.

    In due course I will forward a revised document list and schedule to
    update your file.

    Yours sincerely

         HILLSBOROUGH INVESTIGATION

        Following recent discussions on the progress of the police investigation
        into the Hillsborough disaster I can now confirm a timetable for the
        submission of the Final Report to the Police Complaints Authority and the
        Director of Public Prosecutions.  The timetable I propose is as follows

         Friday 30 March 1990                      Submission of the report, together with
                                                   the supporting library of material
                                                   statements and relevant documents.

         Thursday 12 April 1990                    Conference proposed between Director of
                                                   Public Prosecutions, Police Complaints
                                                   Authority and ourselves to discuss the
                                                   proposed interview plan.

         Tuesday 17 April 1990                     Commence interviews in Sheffield. We
                                                   would propose to video and audio record
                                                   these interviews and would have on hand a
                                                   transcription service so that records of
                                                   the interview, together with accompanying
                                                   tapes can be supplied to the interested
                                                   parties as they are completed.

         Friday 4 May 1990                         We would hope to have completed the
                                                   interviews by this time.

         Friday 18 May 1990                        We would hope that all the transcripts
                                                   will have been supplied by this stage, if
                                                   not earlier.

The above timetable is our best assessment at this time. We hope to
achieve the target dates set, however, they cannot be guaranteed. If
there is any slippage in the process of the investigation and reporting,
then we will give the earliest indication that we can. However, we are
confident that the report will be ready by the end of March. The first
two weeks of April would be a appropriate for interested parties to
reserve time in their diaries for reading the report and supporting
material.

I would be pleased to receive your reaction to the proposed timetable and
also an indication as to whether a conference would be appropriate on
Thursday 12 April 1990. If it is acceptable I would suggest that we
could meet in London at a venue to be determined at say 1100 hours.

         HILLSBOROUGH INVESTIGATION

         Following recent discussions on the progress of the police investigation
         into the Hillsborough disaster I can now confirm a timetable for the
         submission of the Final Report to the Police Complaints Authority and the
         Director of Public Prosecutions.  The timetable I propose is as follows

         Friday 30 March 1990                       Submission of the report, together with
                                                    the supporting library of material
                                                    statements and relevant documents.

         Thursday 12 April 1990                     Conference proposed between Director of
                                                    Public Prosecutions, Police Complaints
                                                    Authority and ourselves to discuss the
                                                    proposed interview plan.

         Tuesday 17 April 1990                      Commence interviews in Sheffield. We
                                                    would propose to video and audio record
                                                    these interviews and would have on hand a
                                                    transcription service so that records of
                                                    the interview, together with accompanying
                                                    tapes can be supplied to the interested
                                                    parties as they are completed.

         Friday 4 May 1990                          We would hope to have completed the
                                                    interviews by this time.

         Friday 18 May 1990                         We would hope that all the transcripts
                                                    will have been supplied by this stage, if
                                                    not earlier.

    The above timetable is our best assessment at this time. We hope to
    achieve the target dates set, however, they cannot be guaranteed.   If
    there is any slippage in the process of the investigation and reporting,
    then we will give the earliest indication that we can. However, we are
    confident that the report will be ready by the end of March. The first
    two weeks of April would be a appropriate for interested parties to
    reserve time in their diaries for reading the report and supporting
    material.

    I would be pleased to receive your reaction to the proposed timetable and
    also an indication as to whether a conference would be appropriate on
    Thursday 12 April 1990. If it is acceptable I would suggest that we
    could meet in London at a venue to be determined at say 1100 hours.

             I refer to our meeting of yesterday at the Chambers of Mr Gareth
             Williams QC in The Temple. At the outset may I say I found the meeting
             most useful. Following our discussions, in which we agreed that I would
             supply you with some material early, I have pleasure in enclosing the
             following items

             1.     The video tape which is the two hour compilation shown at Lord
                    Justice Taylor's hearing.

             2.     Recollections or statements and, where applicable, transcripts of
                    important witnesses.  These are:-

                    Assistant Chief Constable Mr Jackson
                    Chief Superintendent Duckenfield
                    Chief Superintendent Mole
                    Chief Superintendent Nesbit
                    Superintendents Murray, Marshall, Greenwood and Chapman

                    Also included are contributions from Dr Eastwood the Consultant
                    Engineer, Mr Mackrell the Club Secretary and Mr Bownes the Sheffield
                    City Council representative.

             3.     I also promised an interim report which will follow as I am in the
                    process of updating our earlier edition.

             Once you have had opportunity to absorb this material I will make contact
             with you and Mr Williams with a view to arranging a visit to our Incident
             Room in Birmingham followed by a discreet visit to the ground at
             Hillsborough.  Perhaps at that meeting we can discuss further what
             material we have and how and when you would like to receive it. Of
             course, it will also afford us an opportunity to deal with specific
             issues of concern.
   PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT                  Lloyd #House,_ Birmingham
I also agreed to supply you with copies of the letters which refer to
our involvement in this investigation.  These are attached for your
confidential information.

I also agreed to undertake to write to the Police Complaints Authority
to clarify their role in respect of our overall investigation and
whether we are likely to encounter any problems in respect of the
release of statements for other purposes. You will recall that I was
particularly concerned about the Police Complaints Authority invoking
the public interest immunity provisions.  That letter will be written
once my Chief Constable, Mr Geoffrey Dear, who will be the Investigating
Officer, returns to the country from North America.  Incidently, he
regrets very much not being able to meet you yesterday, but felt that
the meeting should go ahead without him in order to minimise any delay.

I trust the above information and the enclosed material is helpful,   if
there is anything in the meantime please do not hesitate to contact   me.
I also enclose my card, together with an ex directory office number   and
my home telephone number on the reverse. Out of hours I can be
contacted by way of my bleep. This can be activated by you ringing    our
Force Control Room telephone number 021-236-5000 extension 2900 and
leaving a message on the bleep for me.

For your information, I have written a similar letter to Messrs Williams
and Newell.

            Sir John Layden

S 1 Z   !
      I explained that; the Home Secretary accepts that, because of the
      scale of tha investigation and Its unexpected nature, the likely
      costs could not be absorbed by South Yorkshire within the usual
      police funding arrangements without serious detriment to the
      efficiency of the force.
si    He also recognises that, as a result of the decision to make the
      results of the investigation directly available to Lord Justice
      Taylor, it has been widened to cover national aspects which go
      wider than the -concerns of South Yorkshire, or even South Yorkshire
      policing.
g- Nevertheless, it regains the case t h a t much of t h e investigation
   will be concerned with the policing of events o n the day, a matter
   viMch is inescapably t h e c on c er n of the South Y o r k s h i r e police. We
   h-     looked., therefore, for a solution which reflects the statutory
   responsibility, which is shared between police authorities and the
   Kore Secretary, for meeting the costs of police o p e r a t i o n s i

    Mervyn Jones may now have related to you the conversation I had with him
    on the evening of 8 August, and 1 thought I would consolidate our
    conversation by writing to you.

  The nature of the Inquiry has placed the South Yorkshire Police merely as
  witnesses at the disposal of Lord Justice Taylor, and quite properly we
  have received no communication from the Vest Midlands Police officers
  engaged in gathering evidence which would indicate their views on issues
0
^ as they emerged.

    My Police Authority received a letter of complaint from Mr Trevor Hicks,
                                                       against the Deputy
    Chief Constable, Peter Hayea, for the comments he made following Chief
    Superintendent Duckenfield'a evidence to the Inquiry and the allegation
    against him of untruthfulness. That is now with the Police Authority who
    will decide on whatever course of action they feel appropriate in respect
    of Mr Hayes. On receipt of the correspondence 1 regarded it also as a
    complaint against Mr Duckenfield. I caused the complaint to be recorded
    and Mr K P D Cooper, Assistant Chief Constable of Northamptonshire, has
    been appointed to investigate the specific allegation of untruthfulness
    levelled against Mr Duckenfield.

     On receipt of Lord Justice Taylor's report Z considered that the question
     of criminal liability needed to be addressed and I have asked the Director
     of Public Prosecutions to give me his advice in this regard, and that is
     awaited. If he considers that prlaa facie there is evidence which
     justifies police enquiries then I presume that these will be carried out
     by members of your Force. This leaves the question of possible discipline
     offences which may lie against one or more members of the South Yorkshire
     Police, and it would also seem appropriate if you were to pursue these.

  In the normal course o f events an officer conducting an enquiry would
  bring to the attention of the Chief Constable of the area his views in
  regard to all of these issues but Z recognise your peculiar situation and
  understand why I have received no information from you that would assist
  me in deciding on a proper course of action. For instance your officers
  may have taken statements which would in normal circumstances be regarded
  as containing a complaint against police and would merit the appointment
  of an Investigating officer.

  The paramount consideration in this regard is, of course, the service of
  Regulation 7 notices on the officers involved at the earliest opportunity.

  it may well be Lhat now the public hearing aspect oi the Inquiry is over
  you feel you are now in a position to communicate with me on these
  important matters. All the evidence which exists is in your possession
  and clearly if further enquiries are required it would be both practical
  and appropriate for your officers to pursue them.

   I should be obliged if you would let me have your views on this issue.

               South Yorkshire Police

               Snig Hill

               S3 8LY                                                11 August 1989




               I am writing following your letter of 9 August 1989, and I have already
               telephoned your Deputy, Peter Hayes, to bring him upto date.  I
               understand that you are back in the office on Monday but it maybe that
               he will have briefed you before you have had a chance to read the
               letter. The position is as follows.

               I have not contacted you about the progress of the investigation over
               the last couple of weeks because future developments turned very much
               on the decision whether a criminal investigation should now ensue or
               whether the enquiry to service HM Coroner should make first call on my
               team.

               Today, I attended the Director of Public Prosecutions' office in Dacre
               Street, London with Mervyn Jones and met Mr Christopher Newell to
               discuss the current position.  This was in the absence of Mr Allan
               Green, Director of Public Prosecutions, who is currently on holiday but
               will return to his office on Monday 14 August 1989. He was quite clear
               that he believed that a criminal investigation should now ensue and I
               must say that I agree with that decision. He was in possession of a
               letter from Dr Popper, HM Coroner for Sheffield and I understand that
               Dr Popper’s view coincided with ours.  Accordingly, I agreed (as you
               had already indicated) that we should conduct a criminal investigation
               at your request and this will now take place.  It follows automatically
               that our contract to service HM Coroner will still continue but only
               concerning enquiries that are imperative to this purpose, it being
               clearly understood that the Inquest will not take place until all
               matters concerning the criminal investigation have been resolved.


                                                                                 cont




                                                                                                ~ 1 ^ 0

                                                        -   2   -


                      It did seem clear to us that the question of the complaint by Mr Hicks
                      against Chief Superintendent Duckenfield would now be better handled by
                      this Force, and again, it is clear that your view is accepted by other
                      parties - certainly by myself.  This will apply equally to any other
                      alleged disciplinary offences which are disclosed during the course of
                      our enquiries, and from now on we will be in touch immediately with
                      your office if that proves to be the case.  I take your point, well
                      made, in your letter of 9 August 1989, concerning the need for speed in
                      the service of Regulation 7 notices.

                      I understand from Mr Newell that the Director of Public Prosecutions
                      will write to you on Monday 14 August, setting out from his point of
                      view what I have already incorporated in this letter so far as it
                      applies to his sphere of influence.   It would be very helpful to me if
                      you could write and formally invite me to take on board the
                      disciplinary enquiries, since costs will again be well to the fore of
                      future discussions. It would appear that the usual arrangement should
                      prevail, viz that South Yorkshire would bear the usual proportion of
                      expenditure incurred when an outside Force is invited to undertake an
                      investigation.  This pre-supposes that your negotiations with the Home
                      Office do not embrace disciplinary matters when considering the
                      remainder of the "Hillsborough Inquiry".   If they do, of course, then
                      we could go no further on this point.

                      I have already discussed with Peter Hayes that it would seem appropriate
                      that a statement be made from Headquarters to the     effect thatwe are now
                      investigating possible criminal culpability against any parties (not
                      only South Yorkshire Police) and possible disciplinary considerations in
                      addition.  You might agree.

                K S Anderson Esq
                Assistant Chief Constable [Staff Services)
                South Yorkshire Police
                Snigg Hill
                Sheffield
                S3 8LY




                Dear Mr Anderson

                Following our telephone conversation of yesterday evening, I thought it
                would be useful if I summarised my understanding of our position at the
                present time.

                We have now concluded statement taking and information gathering for
                Lord Justice Taylor and, as you know, he has publicised his Interim
                Report.  The majority of those statements taken will help us
                significantly in the second part of our investigation which is to
                undertake, on behalf of the South Yorkshire Police, the Coroner's
                Inquiries into the disaster at Hillsborough.  There will probably be
                additional statement taking for the purpose of providing the precise
                continuity as far as the 95 individuals are concerned, as well as
                clearing up any ambiguities which have been identified in the statements
                already taken or the recollections received from Police Officers.


                 However, at this stage we are not undertaking a criminal inquiry as such
                 into Hillsborough other than should we, during the course of our
                 Coroner's inquiries, come across circumstances which would suggest that
                 there is prima-facie, a criminal allegation against any person or
                 persons. Should we uncover such evidence during our Coroner's inquiries,
                 by reason of our office of Constable, we would duly report such matters
                 to the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, and your local Crown
                 Prosecution Service.  As you know this policy has been in operation as
                 long as we have been involved in Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry and you
                 will remember that we have already reported two alleged crimes to you.




        PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT                 Lloyd House, Birmingham
j   o   t   }
                                             -   2   -




                As far as police complaint/discipline matters are concerned, neither
                Mr Geoffrey Dear or myself see ourselves as Investigating Officers,
                South Yorkshire Police not yet having invited us to take on this
                particular role.  As with crime, however, should we discover
                circumstances which could amount to disciplinary allegations against
                Police Officers, over and above anything already suggested in Lord
                Justice Taylor's Interim Report, then we will duly notify you of what we
                have found for you to take the appropriate action. At this time we do
                not see ourselves responsible to serve Regulation 7 Notices.  I
                think you agree.

                With regard to the future, I understand that Mr Wright now awaits a
                response from the Director of Public Prosecutions to his earlier letter
                asking, as I understand it, whether criminal proceedings/investigation
                should follow.  Our understanding from a meeting at the Director of
                Public Prosecution's Office last Friday is that the Director of Public
                Prosecutions will be writing to South Yorkshire Police suggesting that a
                criminal investigation should follow into all the circumstances arising
                out of the Hillsborough disaster.  I understand that it is likely that
                you will invite Mr Geoffrey Dear and the West Midlands Police to
                undertake that investigation.  However, you await the response of the
                Director of Public Prosecutions.

                As far as a disciplinary/complaint investigation is concerned, I think
                we both agree that these will become part and parcel of the investigation
                if you invite us to undertake the crime inquiry.

                Should you ask us to take on these additional aspects within our
                existing investigation we will willingly do so. However, we would
                require formal invitation from South Yorkshire Police to undertake
                these enquiries, together with a written assurance that th^"financial
                expenditure incurred by us will be met by the South Yorkshire Police,
                with or without assistance from the Home Office.

                Finally, we both agree that should you invite us to undertake the
                criminal/disciplinary investigations it will be extremely beneficial for
                us to meet with the representatives of the Director of Public
                Prosecutions Office and the Police Complaints Authority so that terms of
                reference, lines of communication and accountability can be formally
                determined.

                I hope that this is a useful summary of the position we both occupy at
                the present time.  If you would like to discuss further please do not
                hesitate to contact me.

                Yours sincerely

                       that in relation to the events at Hillsborough on
  15 April last there sho'
                       should now be a full criminal enquiry - not limited to the
  possible culpability of police officers alone. I understand you are in
                        this lettsr. I would be frateful if you will undertake
  receipt of a copy of th:

   HILLSBOROUGH: COSTS OF INVESTIGATION BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE

   Thank you for your letter of 31 July asking to what extent the
   West Midlands Police are undertaking work other than for Lord
   Justice Taylor's enquiry and whether expenditure on such activities
   would be covered by the terms of Lord Ferrers' letter of 27 June.

    The investigation by the West Midlands police was requested by the
    Chief Constable of South Yorkshire to look into the planning and
    operational decisions of the South Yorkshire Police.        It was
    subsequently agreed to make the results of the investigation
    available to Lord Justice Taylor.

    We accept that some aspects of the investigation have, at the
    request of the Taylor Enquiry, dealt with areas not directly of
    interest to South Yorkshire police, such as design of sports
    grounds.   The West. Midlands Police Authority have not separately
    itemised these aspects.    Nevertheless it is clear to us that much
    of the investigation must have concerned events on the day and the
    policing of them; matters which are inescapably the concern of the
    South Yorkshire police.

    I understand that the investigations by the West Midlands Police on
    behalf of Lord Justice Taylor are now virtually complete, other
    than follow up enquiries or particular aspects which may require
    some further work.

    The national interest in the Taylor Enquiry 'was taken into account
    when Lord Ferrers wrote to Sir John Layden on 27 June making the
    offer, on behalf of the Government, of a special payment which
L
would effectively meet nearly 80% of the anticipated costs of the
investigation from central funds.

Turning to the specific questions in      your letter the purposes
served by the West Midlands police inquiries clearly include the
preparation-.jof evidence to the Coroner's inquest and their
inquiries m a w also be relevant In future to complaints or
discipline proceedings or conceivably to tf?aseg, if any, taken to
the criminal or civil courts.     It is obviously not possible to
apportion costs precisely to each of t£a*e purposes,        I can,
however, confirm that the special payment^wiip cover all aspects of
the investigation which has been undertaken by West Midlands
Police, both those aspects related to the Taylor enquiry and those
related to other matters of concern to South Yorkshire, such as
evidence to the Coroner's inquest (in some cases the same material
may serve more than one purpose).

    Any work which is being or may be undertaken by other forces in
    relation to disciplinary investigations would not qualify for the
    special payment.  However, if any of the work already undertaken by
    the West Midlands as part of its recent investigation proves
    relevant to any disciplinary or complaints investigation we are
    prepared to let it count for the purposes of the special payment.

           INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

           I refer to your letter of 16 August 1989 in which you formally request
           us to undertake a full criminal enquiry - wider than just the Police -
           into the events at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989-     Ihave noted the
           Director of Public Prosecutions' interest and advice.    I also note that
           you would like us to undertake responsibility for any police
           disciplinary aspects which may emerge.

           Given that we have already undertaken a considerable investigation on
           behalf of Lord Justice Taylor and presently for HM Coroner, it is
           logical that we should take on the added responsibilities for any
           criminal aspects and any police disciplinary matters which may emerge.
           YJe will willingly take on these added responsibilities to our current
           investigation.   My Police Authority have asked me   toseek a written
           assurance that expenditure incurred by us will bemet in     full by South
           Yorkshire Police with or without Home Office assistance.

            In respect of the financing of the investigation I have had sight of
            Lord Ferrers' original letter to your Police Authority and I am aware of
            a subsequent letter which clarifies the definition of the 'investigation'
            to be in the widest sense.  It would appear, therefore, that if your
            Police Authority, which I understand will meet on Friday of this week,
            agrees the original Lord Ferrers offer, as clarified, then all financial
            costs will be met by the Home Office over and above an agreed
            contribution by the South Yorkshire Police Authority. Subject to your
            Police Authority agreement there appears to be no impediment to our


                                                                        cont

         pursuing the investigations without delay.  After your Police Authority
         has had its meeting it would be helpful to me if you could acquaint us
         with their decision so that I can keep my Police Authority fully
         informed.

         The investigations will continue on a day to day basis to be headed by
         Mr Mervyn Jones with his existing team which will be increased for a
         short period to address the added responsibilities.  In your letter you
         asked if we would like to take on the three matters of public complaint
         made by Mr Trevor Hicks as well as a fourth complaint of alleged
         corruption.  Before taking on these responsibilities I think it would be
         helpful if the meeting with Mr Hicks takes place on 23 August.
         Thereafter I can see advantages in there being a meeting between
         ourselves, yourselves, a representative of the Director of Public
         Prosecutions Office and Mr E N Taylor of the Police Complaints
         Authority.  At that meeting we could agree what responsibilities we are
         undertaking, the terms of reference, lines of communication and
         accountability.

         I trust this satisfactorily addresses the issues raised in your letter.

     Thank you for your letter of 4 August.    I have now received a
     copy of Lord Justice Taylor's Report and Geoffrey Dear and
     Mervyn Jones have attended at this office to give broad details
     of the scope and extent of their enquiries to d a t e .

     Having regard to the findings of the inquiry it is, in my view,
     appropriate that the matter should now be the subject of a full
     criminal investigation.   I understand that you have written to
     Geoffrey Dear raising the possibility of him continuing with
     enquiries and I also understand that he is happy formally to
     continue to investigate in accordance with the provisions of
     Part ix of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.      This
     investigation will not, of course, be limited to the possible
     culpability of police officers alone.

     I am sending a copy of this letter to Geoffrey Dear.

Dear Dr Popper

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

Thank you for your letter of 1 August 1989 inviting me to undertake the
enquiries on your behalf into the 95 people who died at Hillsborough on
15 April 1989. Your letter was most useful in clearing the lines of
responsibility with South Yorkshire Police.

As you know the Director of Public Prosecutions has suggested to Mr Peter
Wright, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, that it would be
appropriate for a full criminal investigation to follow. Mr Wright has
written to me and invited me to undertake that investigation.  I will be
accepting that responsibility.

Of course this will have an effect on the timing of your full inquests
which I know were scheduled to commence on 15 January 1990. Our criminal
investigation clearly will take some months before we are in a position
to submit a file of evidence to the Director of Public Prosecutions.
Furthermore, it is unlikely that the Director of Public Prosecutions will
respond very quickly on this very important issue. Consequently, I
cannot realistically see the Director of Public Prosecutions giving his
decision until the summer of 1990 at the very earliest.

As you appreciate this will impact upon your inquests. As you know Rule
26 of the Coroner's Rules 1984 indicates that I should make application
to you for you to adjourn your inquests for 28 days or for a longer
period as you may think fit. At this point in the investigation I
cannot say whether any person or persons may be charged with an offence,
but we cannot discount the possibility.  I think it appropriate,
therefore, for me to formally request you to continue your adjournment
of the inquests until such a time that we have received a response from
the Director of Public Prosecutions.  At that time, depending upon his
decision, we can perhaps discuss further the way forward.
(•on


                                          -   2   -




       In the meantime we will continue our enquiries into the deaths so that
       we will be in a position, when we receive the Director of Public
       Prosecutions decision, and if it is to the effect that no further
       action will be taken, to proceed with your inquests as soon as
       practicable.

       As you know Mervyn Jones is leading the investigation and over the
       coming months he will keep you informed, on a confidential basis, of
       developments.

       Can I also add at this stage how much we have appreciated your direction,
       advice and support. The Hillsborough Inquiry, given that there are
       effectively four investigations within one, would have been further
       complicated if you had not taken such a helpful and supportive role. I
       am sure that Lord Justice Taylor also sees it that way.

       Yours sincerely




       Chief Constable

             Dear Mr Wright

             I refer to your letter of 23 August 1989 to Mr Geoffrey Dear concerning
             our appointment as investigating officers in respect of criminal and
             disciplinary matters which may emerge from our inquiries. Mr Dear is
             presently away out of the Force until k September and, therefore, I am
             replying on his behalf.  I have noted your comments about the meeting
             with Mr Hicks on 23 August and, as you probably know, I will be meeting
             with your Mr Anderson, Mr Cleugh of the Director of Public Prosecutions
             Office and Mr Noel Taylor of the Police Complaints Authority, tomorrow
             in London. At that meeting, both Stuart and I have agreed that we will
             pursue a clear understanding from the Police Complaints Authority and
             the Director of Public Prosecutions on precisely what are the terms
             of reference, the lines of communication and accountability.  At that
             time we are hoping that the complaints already raised by Mr Hicks and
             others, can be considered as to whether they should fall to the
             responsibility of my inquiry team or remain the responsibility of those
         (   presently involved.

             I have also noted the contents of your third and fourth paragraphs with
             regard to the financing of our investigation. Since receiving your
             letter I have received a letter, a copy of which is attached, from
             Mr Stephen Walker, Solicitor to your Police Authority.  This letter, in
             fact takes us no further until the Home Office respond. We, therefore,
             wait for that response before we formally undertake the investigatory
             responsibilities.  Having said that, our intended investigation on your
             behalf will not be prejudiced as I intend to pursue our inquiries as
             part of, which obviously they are, the coronal issues. However, until
             we formally receive appointment as Investigating Officers for police
             disciplinary purposes and have received formal ratification of that

                     appointment by the Police Complaints Authority, I do not see the "clock
                     running" in respect of the service of notices under Regulation 7. My
                     understanding is that the responsibility falls upon the Investigating
                     Officer only when he has become the Investigating Officer.  If the
                     clarification we both seek from the Home Office is not forthcoming in
                     the next few days, I will liaise with Mr Hayes or Mr Anderson with a
                     view to addressing this issue in order to ensure that any subsequent
                     disciplinary investigation or proceedings are not compromised by the
                     failure to serve such notices in good time.

                     I hope this letter clarifies our understanding of the position as of now.
                     No doubt by the end of Friday 25 August much will have come clearer.

                     Yours sincerely

I refer to your letter of 17 August 1989 and note your willingness to accept
my invitation to undertake the full criminal enquiry into the events at
Hillsborough on 15 April 1989 following the advice from the Director of Public
Prosecutions.  Also that you will enquire into the related discipline or
complaint matters including those specifically referred to in my letter of
16 August and others which may emerge.

 Regarding the complaint matters I will advise further as requested after the
 planned meeting with Mr Trevor Hicks this date (23 August) and agree
 thereafter the meetings as necessary between the various parties you describe
 to clarify your terms of reference, responsibilities, lines of communication
 between ourselves and accountability.

 The South Yorkshire Police Authority have  already met and considered the offer
 made by the Home Office as set out in the  letter from Lord Ferrers and a
 subsequent letter from Mr M J Addison of the Home Office, both of which you
 refer to.

 My understanding is they are accepting the Home Office offer but I have asked
 Mr Stephen Walker (Deputy Clerk of the South Yorkshire Police Authority) in
 the absence of the Clerk who is on holiday, to correspond with you direct on
 this issue and you should regard his letter as authoritative on this point.

            Dear Mr Dear
            RE : INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
            The Chief Co nsta ble of South Yorkshire has sent me a copy of yo ur letter to him
            of 17 Augu st regarding y o u r taking on res ponsibility for the criminal inquiry
            and any police disc ip l i n a r y matters which may emerge.

             You have asked for a written assurance that e xpenditure incurred will be met in
             full by South Y ork shire Police with or without Home O ffice assistance.
             The South Y o r k sh ire Police Auth orit y met last Friday to consider further the
             offer made by the Home Office and agreed as a m a t ter of practical expediency to
             reimburse the total e xpenditure of y o u r Force subject to confirmation from the
             Home Offi ce that the total costs would be subject to the level of assistance or
             contrib utio n limit payable by South Yorkshire d etailed in Lord Ferrers letter of
             27 June.

             In these circumstances, until I receive the necessary con firm atio n from the Home
             Office, I cannot give the assurance that you r A utho rity requires.

             For y o u r information, the Clerk to the West Midlands Police Aut hority has a copy
             of my letter to the Home Offi ce de tailing the terms of my A u t h o r i t y ’s proposal.

                Having had a telephone conversation with Mr Waghorn of the Home Office yesterday
                which gave rise to some cause for concern on my part, I have had no alternative
                but to wr ite further to the Home Office clarifying matters. Enclosed is a copy
                of this l et ter for your information. I understand the C hief Cons table of South
                Yorkshire has received a letter from your Chief C onstable on the same topic and
                I will be writ ing in reply but I thought in the interim y o u may peel it prudent
                to let him have sight of my most recent cor resp onde nc e with the Home Office.

                  Having spoken to Mr Waghorn of y o u r department yesterday, it is appropriate that
                  I further clari fy the offer made in my letter of 21 Augu st to ensure there is no
                  doubt as to the terms of any agreement between us r egarding the payment of
                  ex penditure incurred by West Midlands Police.
                   The Auth orit y agrees subject to their financial c o n trib uti on being absolutely
                   limited to the amount set out in Lord Ferrers letter dated 27 June 1989 whereby
                   the total payment should not exceed the product of the         penny rate estimated at
                   £975,000, as a m a tte r of practical e xpediency to reimburse West Midlands Police
                   A u t h orit y their total costs.

                   This is agreed on the clear understanding that the total costs of West Midlands
                   Police will cover their wo rk in connection with:-
                    1         Lord Justice T a y l o r ’s Inquiry
                    2         The preparation of evidence for the inquests in South Yorkshire
                    3         The criminal investigation advised by the Director of Public Prosecutions
                    4         Cases taken to the criminal or civil courts and;
                    5         Any related m a tter of discipline or complaint.
                    This agreement is conditional upon y o u r confirmation that all the above
                    expenditure, together with any interest charged by the West Midlands Police
                    Au tho r i t y and any interest incurred by the South Yorkshire Police Authority
                    arising from any delay between the rendering of accounts by that Authority and
                    receipt of payment from the Home Office will be subject to the level of
                    assistance and contribution limit payable by the South Yorkshire Police
                    Auth ori ty de tailed in Lord Ferrers letter of 27 June.

                    The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire has let me have sight of a letter of 17
                    August from Mr Geoffrey Dear in which he confirms that it would be logical for
                    his Force to take on the added responsibility for any criminal aspect and any
                    di scip l i n a r y matters which may emerge. That Force will willi ngly take on these
                    added re spon sibilities to its current investigation but Mr Dear points out that
                    his Police Aut hori ty have asked him to seek a written assurance that expenditure
                     Mr M J Addis on                                                ~\                                 / ...

                                      -   2   -




incurred by his Force will be met in full by the South Yor kshi re Police with or
without Home Office assistance. Obv ious ly I cannot give this assurance at the
present time and certainly the South Yorkshire Police cannot, but I am sure none
of us would wish the criminal inquiry to be held up whilst the Home Office and
the South Yorkshire Police Auth orit y negotiate r e s p onsi bili t y for the
expenditure referred to earlier in this letter. I mention this because it does
highlight the need for an urgent resolution of the e xp end itur e issue.

Yours sincerely

                     Dear Mr Wright

                     CRIMINAL AND DISCIPLINARY INVESTIGATIONS

                      As you know Mr Anderson and myself met with the representatives of the
                      Director of Public Prosecutions office and the Police Complaints
                      Authority on Friday 25 August 1989. We have talked through the necessary
                      issues which we will invoke as investigating officers once our
                      appointment has been implemented.  You will recall that it awaits a
                      response from your Police Authority regarding the financial issues. In
                      the meantime the possible disciplinary issues arising out of the
                      complaints, which I understand Mr Hicks may have made, will be addressed
                      by Mr Cooper until we formally take over the appointment.

                      However, until our appointment we continue, on your behalf, the Coroner’s
                      inquiries.   This means we are making contact with a number of your
                      officers to help us, as witnesses for death continuity purposes. I
                      understand that a number of members of your Force are concerned that
                      these contacts are for criminal/disciplinary enquiry purposes. This is
                      not currently the state of affairs and is not likely to be so in the
                      near future.   I have already been approached by the Police Federation
                      Solicitors and the Superintendents Association to clarify our precise
                      role at present.   I have told them that we are seeking to interview
                      police officers solely as potential witnesses at this stage. As you
                      appreciate, should anything emerge during the course of the witness
                      interviews which would suggest some culpability, then the normal
                      protections afforded by PACE and Regulation 7 will apply. However, I
                      would stress that we are not making contact with officers where we think
                      that these aspects could apply.

                                     2


I trust that this may be of assistance in reassuring members of your
Force as to the nature of our enquiries at the present time.  As and
when that should change I will afford you the courtesy of advising you
accordingly.

Yours sincerely




Assistant Chief Constable
(Hillsborough Inquiry)

             I refer to our meeting of yesterday at your Chambers in The Temple. At
             the outset may I say I found the meeting most useful. Following our
             discussions, in which we agreed that I would supply you with some
             material early, I have pleasure in enclosing the following items

              1.     The video tape which is the two hour compilation shown at Lord
                     Justice Taylor's hearing.

             2.      Recollections or statements and, where applicable, transcripts of
                     important witnesses.  These are:-

                     Assistant Chief Constable Mr Jackson
                     Chief Superintendent Duckenfield
                     Chief Superintendent Mole
                     Chief Superintendent Nesbit
                     Superintendents Murray, Marshall, Greenwood and Chapman

                     Also included are contributions from Dr Eastwood the Consultant
                     Engineer, Mr Mackrell the Club Secretary and Mr Bownes the Sheffield
                     City Council representative.

             3.      I also promised an interim report which will follow as I am in the
                     process of updating our earlier edition.

             Once you have had opportunity to absorb this material I will make contact
             with you and Mr Newell with a view to arranging a visit to our Incident
             Room in Birmingham followed by a discreet visit to the ground at
             Hillsborough.  Perhaps at that meeting we can discuss further what
             material we have and how and when you would like to receive it. Of
             course, it will also afford us an opportunity to deal with specific
             issues of concern.


   PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT                       Lloyd House, Birmingham
I also agreed to supply you with copies of the letters which refer to
our involvement in this investigation.  These are attached for your
confidential information.

I also agreed to undertake to write to the Police Complaints Authority
to clarify their role in respect of our overall investigation and
whether we are likely to encounter any problems in respect of the
release of statements for other purposes. You will recall that I was
particularly concerned about the Police Complaints Authority invoking
the public interest immunity provisions.  That letter will be written
once my Chief Constable, Mr Geoffrey Dear, who will be the Investigating
Officer, returns to the country from North America.  Incidently, he
regrets very much not being able to meet you yesterday, but felt that
the meeting should go ahead without him in order to minimise any delay.

I trust the above information and the enclosed material is helpful,   if
there is anything in the meantime please do not hesitate to contact   me.
I also enclose my card, together with an ex directory office number   and
my home telephone number on the reverse. Out of hours I can be
contacted by way of my bleep.  This can be activated by you ringing   our
Force Control Room telephone number 021-236-5000 extension 2900 and
leaving a message on the bleep for me.

For your information, I have written a similar letter to Messrs Cleugh
and Newell.

      Mervyn Jones may now have related to you the conversation I had with him
      on the evening of 8 August, and 1 thought I would consolidate our
      conversation by writing to you.

      The nature of the Inquiry has placed the South Yorkshire Police merely aa
      witnesses at the disposal of Lord Justice Taylor, and quite properly we
      have received no communication from the Vest Midlands Police officers
      engaged in gathering evidence which would indicate their views on issues
      as they emerged.

      My Police Authority received a letter of complaint from Mr Trevor Hicks,
                                                               against the deputy
      uniei lionstsoie, reter H a y e s , tor tne comments he made following Chief
      Superintendent Duckenfield's evidence to t h e Inquiry and the allegation
      against him of untruthfulness. That is now with the Police Authority who
      will decide on whatever course of action they feel appropriate in respect
      of Hr Hayea. On receipt of the correspondence 1 regarded it also as a
      complaint against Mr Duckeafield. I caused the complaint to be recorded
      and Mr K P D Cooper, Assistant Chief Constable of Northamptonshire, has
      been appointed to investigate the specific allegation of untruthfulness
      levelled against Mr Duckanfield.

      On receipt of Lord Justice Taylor's report I considered that the question
      of criminal liability needed to be addressed and I have asked the Director
      of Public Prosecutions to give me his advice in this regard, and that is
      awaited. If he considers that priaa facie there is evidence which
      justifies police enquiries then I presume that these will be carried out
      by members of your Force. This leaves the question of possible discipline
      offences which may H e against one or more members of the South Yorltshire
      Police, and it would also seem appropriate if you were to pursue these.
SYPOL-C.C.’S-OFFICE.¥   I   9- 8-89   10:45AM   S            0742523409-}        021 233 3256; ft 3

 Id the normal course of events an officer conducting an enquiry would
 bring to the attention of the Chief Constable of the area hla views in
 regard to all of these issues but I recognise your peculiar situation and
 understand why I have received no information from you that would assist
 me in deciding on a proper course of action. For instance your officers
 may have taken statements which would in normal circumstances be regarded
 as containing a complaint against police and would merit the appointment
 of an investigating officer.

 The paramount consideration in this regard is, of course, the service of
 Regulation 7 notices on the officers involved at the earliest opportunity.

 It nay well be Lhat now the public hearing aspect of the Inquiry is over
 you feel you are now in a position to communicate with me onthese
 important matters. All the evidence which exists is in      yourpossession
 and clearly if further enquiries are required it would be both practical
 and appropriate for your officers to pursue them.

 I should be obliged if you would let               me have your views      on this issue.

              South Yorkshire Police
              Police Headquarters
              Snig Hill
              Sheffield
              S3 8LY                                                11 August 1989




              I am writing following your letter of 9 August 1989, and I have already
              telephoned your Deputy, Peter Hayes, to bring him upto date. I
              understand that you are back in the office on Monday but it maybe that
              he will have briefed you before you have had a chance to read the
              letter. The position is as follows.

              I have not contacted you about the progress of the investigation over
              the last couple of weeks because future developments turned very much
              on the decision whether a criminal investigation should now ensue or
              whether the enquiry to service HM Coroner should make first call on my
              team.

              Today, I attended the Director of Public Prosecutions' office in Dacre
              Street, London with Mervyn Jones and met Mr Christopher Newell to
              discuss the current position. This was in the absence of Mr Allan
              Green, Director of Public Prosecutions, who is currently on holiday but
              will return to his office on Monday 14 August 1989- He was quite clear
              that he believed that a criminal investigation should now ensue and I
              must say that I agree with that decision. He was in possession of a
              letter from Dr Popper, HM Coroner for Sheffield and I understand that
              Dr Popper's view coincided with ours. Accordingly, I agreed {as you
              had already indicated) that we should conduct a criminal investigation
              at your request and this will now take place. It follows automatically
              that our contract to service HM Coroner will still continue but only
              concerning enquiries that are imperative to this purpose, it being
              clearly understood that the Inquest will not take place until all
              matters concerning the criminal investigation have been resolved.


                                                                                cont
n-At- G   I H   v   <r-r i




                                                      -   2   -




                    It did seem clear to us that the question of the complaint by Mr Hicks
                    against Chief Superintendent Duckenfield would now be better handled by
                    this Force, and again, it is clear that your view is accepted by other
                    parties - certainly by myself. This will apply equally to any other
                    alleged disciplinary offences which are disclosed during the course of
                    our enquiries, and from now on we will be in touch immediately with
                    your office if that proves to be the case. I take your point, well
                    made, in your letter of 9 August 1989, concerning the need for speed in
                    the service of Regulation 7 notices.

                    I understand from Mr Newell that the Director of Public Prosecutions
                    will write to you on Monday 14 August, setting out from his point of
                    view what I have already incorporated in this letter so far as it
                    applies to his sphere of influence. It would be very helpful to me if
                    you could write and formally invite me to take on board the
                    disciplinary enquiries, since costs will again be well to the fore of
                    future discussions. It would appear that the usual arrangement should
                    prevail, viz that South Yorkshire would bear the usual proportion of
                    expenditure incurred when an outside Force is invited to undertake an
                    investigation. This pre-supposes that your negotiations with the Home
                    Office do not embrace disciplinary matters when considering the
                    remainder of the "Hillsborough Inquiry". If they do, of course, then
                    we could go no further on this point.

                    I have already discussed with Peter Hayes that it would seem appropriate
                    that a statement be made from Headquarters to the effect that we are now
                    investigating possible criminal culpability against any parties (not
                    only South Yorkshire Police) and possible disciplinary considerations in
                    addition. You might agree.

                      Dear Mr Anderson

                      Following our telephone conversation of yesterday evening, I thought it
                      would be useful if I summarised my understanding of our position at the
                      present time.

                      We have now concluded statement taking and information gathering for
                      Lord Justice Taylor and, as you know, he has publicised his Interim
                      Report. The majority of those statements taken will help us
                      significantly in the second part of our investigation which is to
                      undertake, on behalf of the South Yorkshire Police, the Coroner's
                      Inquiries into the disaster at Hillsborough. There will probably be
                      additional statement taking for the purpose of providing the precise
                      continuity as far as the 95 individuals are concerned, as well as
                      clearing up any ambiguities which have been identified in the statements
                      already taken or the recollections received from Police Officers.


                      However, at this stage we are not undertaking a criminal inquiry as such
                      into Hillsborough other than should we, during the course of our
                      Coroner's inquiries, come across circumstances which would suggest that
                      there is prima-facie, a criminal allegation against any person or
                      persons. Should we uncover such evidence during our Coroner's inquiries,
                      by reason of our office of Constable, we would duly report such matters
                      to the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, and your local Crown
                      Prosecution Service. As you know this policy has been in operation as
                      long as we have been involved in Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry and you
                      will remember that we have already reported two alleged crimes to you.




             PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE A T ................. Lloyd   House , Birmingham

As far as police complaint/discipline matters are concerned, neither
Mr Geoffrey Dear or myself see ourselves as Investigating Officers,
South Yorkshire Police not yet having invited us to take on this
particular role. As with crime, however, should we discover
circumstances which could amount to disciplinary allegations against
Police Officers, over and above anything already suggested in Lord
Justice Taylor's Interim Report, then we will duly notify you of what we
have found for you to take the appropriate action. At this time we do
not see ourselves responsible to serve Regulation 7 Notices. I
think you agree.

With regard to the future, I understand that Mr Wright now awaits a
response from the Director of Public Prosecutions to his earlier letter
asking, as I understand it, whether criminal proceedings/investigation
should follow. Our understanding from a meeting at the Director of
Public Prosecution's Office last Friday is that the Director of Public
Prosecutions will be writing to South Yorkshire Police suggesting that a
criminal investigation should follow into all the circumstances arising
out of the Hillsborough disaster. I understand that it is likely that
you will invite Mr Geoffrey Dear and the West Midlands Police to
undertake that investigation. However, you await the response of the
Director of Public Prosecutions.

As far as a disciplinary/complaint investigation is concerned, I think
we both agree that these will become part and parcel of the investigation
if you invite us to undertake the crime inquiry.

Should you ask us to take on these additional aspects within our
existing investigation we will willingly do so. However, we would
require formal invitation from South Yorkshire Police to undertake
these enquiries, together with a written assurance that th^'finaneial
expenditure incurred by us will be met by the South Yorkshire Police,
with or without assistance from the Home Office.

Finally, we both agree that should you invite us to undertake the
criminal/disciplinary investigations it will be extremely beneficial for
us to meet with the representatives of the Director of Public
Prosecutions Office and the Police Complaints Authority so that terms of
reference, lines of communication and accountability can be formally
determined.

I hope that this is a useful summary of the position we both occupy at
the present time. If you would like to discuss further please do not
hesitate to contact me.

Yours sincerely

         I have today received a letter from tie Director of Public Prosecutions
        expressing hid view that in relation to Che events at Hillsborough on
        15 April laat there should now be a full criminal enquiry - act limited to the
        possible culpability of police officers alone. I understand you are in
        receipt of a copy of this letter. I would be frataful if you will undertake
        this enquiry together with any police discipline aspects which may emerge.

         There are currently three matters of public complaint under investigation and
         which have been raised by Mr Trevor Hicks.

         The South Yorkshire Police Authority is to consider his complaint against ay
         Deputy, Hr Peter Hayes, on Friday next.

         His complaint against Mr Duckenfield is with Mr K Cooper, Assistant Chief
         Constable of Northamptonshire Police, and is supervised by Mr E N Taylor of
         the Police Complaints Authority. A meeting Is arranged between them and
         Mr Hicks on 23' August and until this has taken place it is considered
         appropriate chat the complaint remain* with Mr Copper. If after 23 August
         Mr Hicks is persisting with the matter of complaint then X suggest it should
         be referred to you and this will be arranged through the Police Complaints
         Authority.

         His remaining complaint is of incivility which is being investigated by a
         superintendent from this Force.

         There is a fourth complaiirc of corruption, namely police officers allowing
         fans into the ground on payment, which is being investigated by an officer
         from Greater Manchester Police. You may wish to consider which if any of
         these you would wish to take over.

          In relation to costs, I am advised by our Treasurer that in the light of on­
          going negotiations between the Authority and the Home Office it is highly
          probable that an agreement will soon be reached. The effect of this is likely
          to be that the costs of the enquiries you heve undertaken so far and in the
G J Dear Esq QPM DL LIB             -   2   -                   16 August IS



future in relation to any discipline or criminal matters or in reapect of tt
inquest vill be met in full from central government following the agreed
contribution from the South Yorkshire Police Authority. If such an agt earner
is reached It will effectively deal with the queries you raised in your lett
of 11 August.

It la my intention to make an announcement of the Director's advice and of
action on the afternoon of 16 August.

   HILLSBOROUGH: COSTS OF INVESTIGATION BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE

   Thank you for your letter of 31 July asking to what extent the
   West Midlands Police are undertaking work other than for Lord
   Justice Taylor's enquiry and whether expenditure on such activities
   would be covered by the terms of Lord Ferrers' letter of 27 June.

    The investigation by the West Midlands police was requested by the
    Chief Constable of South Yorkshire to look into the planning and
    operational decisions of the South Yorkshire Police.        It was
    subsequently agreed to make the results of the investigation
    available to Lord Justice Taylor.

    We accept that some aspects of the investigation have, at the
    request of the Taylor Enquiry, dealt with areas not directly of
    interest to South Yorkshire police, such as design of sports
    grounds.   The West- Midlands Police Authority have not separately
    itemised these aspects.    Nevertheless it is clear to us that much
    of the investigation must have concerned events on the day and the
    policing of them; matters which are inescapably the concern of the
    South Yorkshire police.

    I understand that the investigations by the West Midlands Police on
    behalf of Lord Justice Taylor are now virtually complete, other
    than follow up enquiries or particular aspects which may require
    some further work.

    The national interest in the Taylor Enquiry 'was taken into account
    when Lord Ferrers wrote to Sir John Layden on 27 June making the
    offer, on behalf of the Government, of a special payment which
would effectively meet nearly 80% of the anticipated costs of the
investigation from central funds.

Turning to the specific questions in        your letter the purposes
served by the West Midlands police inquiries clearly include the
preparation — of  evidence  to the Coroner's inquest and their
inquiries m a w  also  be  relevant Tn   future       to complaints or
discipline fTnaceedinqs or conceivably to     as e g , if any, taken to
the criminal or civil courts.     It is obviously not possible to
apportion costs precisely to each of tjiase purposes.            I can,
however, confirm that the special payment<yw i L y cover all aspects of
the investigation which has been undertaken by West Midlands
Police, both those aspects related to the Taylor enquiry and those
related to other matters of concern to South Yorkshire, such as
evidence to the Coroner's inquest (in some cases the same material
may serve more than one purpose).

Any work which is being or may be undertaken by other forces in
relation to disciplinary investigations would not qualify for the
special payment.   However, if any of the work already undertaken by
the West Midlands as part of its recent investigation proves
relevant to a n y disciplinary or complaints investigation we are
prepared to let it count for the purposes of the special payment.

                                                        V

            INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

            I refer to your letter of 16 August 1989 in which you formally request
            us to undertake a full criminal enquiry - wider than just the Police -
            into the events at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989-    Ihave noted the
            Director of Public Prosecutions' interest and advice. I also note that
            you would like us to undertake responsibility for any police
            disciplinary aspects which may emerge.

            Given that we have already undertaken a considerable investigation on
            behalf of Lord Justice Taylor and presently for HM Coroner, it is
            logical that we should take on the added responsibilities for any
            criminal aspects and any police disciplinary matters which may emerge.
            We will willingly take on these added responsibilities to our current
            investigation. My Police Authority have asked me    toseek a written
            assurance that expenditure incurred by us will bemet in full by South
            Yorkshire Police with or without Home Office assistance.

             In respect of the financing of the investigation I have had sight of
             Lord Ferrers' original letter to your Police Authority and I am aware of
             a subsequent letter which clarifies the definition of the 'investigation'
             to be in the widest sense. It would appear, therefore, that if your
             Police Authority, which I understand will meet on Friday of this week,
             agrees the original Lord Ferrers offer, as clarified, then all financial
             costs will be met by the Home Office over and above an agreed
             contribution by the South Yorkshire Police Authority. Subject to your
             Police Authority agreement there appears to be no impediment to our


                                                                        cont
pursuing the investigations without delay. After your Police Authority
has had its meeting it would be helpful to me if you could acquaint us
with their decision so that I can keep my Police Authority fully
informed.

The investigations will continue on a day to day basis to be headed by
Mr Mervyn Jones with his existing team which will be increased for a
short period to address the added responsibilities. In your letter you
asked if we would like to take on the three matters of public complaint
made by Mr Trevor Hicks as well as a fourth complaint of alleged
corruption. Before taking on these responsibilities I think it would be
helpful if the meeting with Mr Hicks takes place on 23 August.
Thereafter I can see advantages in there being a meeting between
ourselves, yourselves, a representative of the Director of Public
Prosecutions Office and Mr E N Taylor of the Police Complaints
Authority. At that meeting we could agree what responsibilities we are
undertaking, the terms of reference, lines of communication and
accountability.

I trust this satisfactorily addresses the issues raised in your letter.

     Thank you for your letter of 4 August.    I have now received a
     copy of Lord Justice Taylor's Report and Geoffrey Dear and
     Mervyn Jones have attended at this office to give broad details
     of the scope and extent of their enquiries to date.

     Having regard to the findings of the inquiry it is, in my view,
     appropriate that the matter should now be the subject of a full
     criminal investigation.   I understand that you have written to
     Geoffrey Dear raising the possibility of him continuing with
     enquiries and I also understand that he is happy formally to
     continue to investigate in accordance with the provisions of
     Part ix of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.      This
     investigation will not, of course, be limited to the possible
     culpability of police officers alone.

     I am sending a copy of this letter to Geoffrey Dear.

Dear Dr Popper

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

Thank you for your letter of 1 August 1989 inviting me to undertake the
enquiries on your behalf into the 95 people who died at Hillsborough on
15 April 1989. Your letter was most useful in clearing the lines of
responsibility with South Yorkshire Police.

As you know the Director of Public Prosecutions has suggested to Mr Peter
Wright, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, that it would be
appropriate for a full criminal investigation to follow. Mr Wright has
written to me and invited me to undertake that investigation. I will be
accepting that responsibility.

Of course this will have an effect on the timing of your full inquests
which I know were scheduled to commence on 15 January 1990. Our criminal
investigation clearly will take some months before we are in a position
to submit a file of evidence to the Director of Public Prosecutions.
Furthermore, it is unlikely that the Director of Public Prosecutions will
respond very quickly on this very important issue. Consequently, I
cannot realistically see the Director of Public Prosecutions giving his
decision until the summer of 1990 at the very earliest.

As you appreciate this will impact upon your inquests. As you know Rule
26 of the Coroner's Rules 1984 indicates that I should make application
to you for you to adjourn your inquests for 28 days or for a longer
period as you may think fit. At this point in the investigation I
cannot say whether any person or persons may be charged with an offence,
but we cannot discount the possibility. I think it appropriate,
therefore, for me to formally request you to continue your adjournment
of the inquests until such a time that we have received a response from
the Director of Public Prosecutions. At that time, depending upon his
decision, we can perhaps discuss further the way forward.
I'Q'&Z



                                            - 2 -


         In the meantime we will continue our enquiries into the deaths so that
         we will be in a position, when we receive the Director of Public
         Prosecutions decision, and if it is to the effect that no further
         action will be taken, to proceed with your inquests as soon as
         practicable.

         As you know Mervyn Jones is leading the investigation and over the
         coming months he will keep you informed, on a confidential basis, of
         developments.

         Can I also add at this stage how much we have appreciated your direction,
         advice and support. The Hillsborough Inquiry, given that there are
         effectively four investigations within one, would have been further
         complicated if you had not taken such a helpful and supportive role. I
         am sure that Lord Justice Taylor also sees it that way.

                         Dear Mr Addison
                         H I L L S B O R O U G H : COST OF INVESTIGATION BY WES T M I D L ANDS POLICE
                         Th ank you for your letter of 9 August. The Police Auth orit y considered the
                         matter again at its meeting held on Friday, 18 August, and wish me to reiterate
                         the view that the costs incurred by the Chief Constable of West Midlands Police
                         at the service of the Inquiry by Lord Justice Taylor are properly chargeable to
                         the Home Office. This view is emphasised by the remarks of Lord Justice Taylor
                         in paragraph 5 of his interim report.
                         However, your clarification of the work undertaken by West Midlands Police, and
                         which is subject to the special payment, has proved helpful - by way of
                         clarific atio n it is assumed this work includes the recently announced criminal
                         i nvesti gati o n .

                          In these circumstances, the Auth orit y is now prepared to agree that as a matter
                          of practical expediency, it will reimburse West Midlands Police A utho rity the
                          total costs of the Inquiry by their Chief Constable, subject to confirmation
                          from the Home Office that the grant arrangements set out in Lord Ferrers letter
                          of 27 June will apply to all such expenditure including any interest charged by
                          that Auth orit y and any interest incurred by South Yo rksh ire Police Authority
                          arising from any delay between the rendering of accounts by it and receipt of
                          payment from the Home Office.

                          Clearly the amounts involved will be large, therefore it seems to me to be
                          _appropriate that we agree a m e c h ani sm for ensuring prompt reimbursement of
                          monies to the Aut hority   When replying perhaps you will let me have your views
                          on this also.
                           Yours sincerely

             Dear Mr Wright

             I refer to your letter of 23 August 1989 to Mr Geoffrey Dear concerning
             our appointment as investigating officers in respect of criminal and
             disciplinary matters which may emerge from our inquiries. Mr Dear is
             presently away out of the Force until 4 September and, therefore, I am
             replying on his behalf. I have noted your comments about the meeting
             with Mr Hicks on 23 August and, as you probably know, I will be meeting
             with your Mr Anderson, Mr Cleugh of the Director of Public Prosecutions
             Office and Mr Noel Taylor of the Police Complaints Authority, tomorrow
             in London. At that meeting, both Stuart and I have agreed that we will
             pursue a clear understanding from the Police Complaints Authority and
             the Director of Public Prosecutions on precisely what are the terms
             of reference, the lines of communication and accountability. At that
             time we are hoping that the complaints already raised by Mr Hicks and
             others, can be considered as to whether they should fall to the
             responsibility of my inquiry team or remain the responsibility of those
        *    presently involved.

             I have also noted the contents of your third and fourth paragraphs with
             regard to the financing of our investigation. Since receiving your
             letter I have received a letter, a copy of which is attached, from
             Mr Stephen Walker, Solicitor to your Police Authority. This letter, in
             fact takes us no further until the Home Office respond. We, therefore,
             wait for that response before we formally undertake the investigatory
             responsibilities. Having said that, our intended investigation on your
             behalf will not be prejudiced as I intend to pursue our inquiries as
             part of, which obviously they are, the coronal issues. However, until
             we formally receive appointment as Investigating Officers for police
             disciplinary purposes and have received formal ratification of that

                    appointment by the Police Complaints Authority, I do not see the "clock
                    running" in respect of the service of notices under Regulation 7- My
                    understanding is that the responsibility falls upon the Investigating
                    Officer only when he has become the Investigating Officer. If the
                    clarification we both seek from the Home Office is not forthcoming in
                    the next few days, I will liaise with Mr Hayes or Mr Anderson with a
                    view to addressing this issue in order to ensure that any subsequent
                    disciplinary investigation or proceedings are not compromised by the
                    failure to serve such notices in good time.

                    I hope this letter clarifies our understanding of the position as of now.
                    No doubt by the end of Friday 25 August much will have come clearer.

                    Yours sincerely

 I refer to your letter of 17 August 1989 and note your willingness to accept
 my invitation to undertake the full criminal enquiry into the events at
 Hillsborough on 15 April 1989 following the advice from the Director of Public
 Prosecutions. Also that you will enquire into the related discipline or
 complaint matters including those specifically referred to in my letter of
 16 August and others which may emerge.

 Regarding the complaint matters I will advise further as requested after the
 planned meeting with Mr Trevor Hicks this date (23 August) and agree
 thereafter the meetings as necessary between the various parties you describe
 to clarify your terms of reference, responsibilities, lines of communication
 between ourselves and accountability.

 The South Yorkshire Police Authority have  already met and considered the offer
 made by the Home Office as set out in the  letter from Lord Ferrers and a
 subsequent letter from Mr M J Addison of the Home Office, both of which you
 refer to.

 My understanding is they are accepting the Home Office offer but I have asked
 Mr Stephen Walker (Deputy Clerk of the South Yorkshire Police Authority) in
 the absence of the Clerk who is on holiday, to correspond with you direct on
 this issue and you should regard his letter as authoritative on this point.

           Dear Mr Dear
           RE : INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
           The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire has sent me a copy of your letter to him
           of 17 Augus t regarding your taking on resp onsi bili t y for the criminal inquiry
           and any police d isci p l i n a r y matters which may emerge.
           You have asked for a written assurance that expenditure incurred will be met in
           full by South Yor kshire Police with or w i t h out Home Office assistance.
           The South Yorkshire Police Aut hori ty m et last Friday to consider further the
           offer made by the Home Office and agreed as a matter of practical expediency to
           reimburse the total expenditure of yo ur Force subject to confirmation from the
           Home Office that the total costs would be subject to the level of assistance or
           contribution limit payable by South Yorkshire detailed in Lord Ferrers letter of
           27 June.

            In these circumstances, until I receive the n ecessary confirmation from the Home
            Office, I cannot give the assurance that y o u r Auth orit y requires.

            For yo ur information, the Clerk to the West Midlands Police A utho rity has a copy
            of my letter to the Home Office detailing the terms of m y A u t h o r i t y ’s proposal.

               Having had a tele phone conversation wi th Mr Viaghorn of the Home Office yesterday
               which gave rise to some cause for concern on my part, I have had no alternative
               but to write further to the Home Office c larifying matters, Enclosed is a copy

               I will be w r i tin g in reply but I thought in the interim you may peel it prudent
               to let him have sight of my most recent cor respondenc e with the Home Office.

                Dear Mr Addison

                RE HILLSBOROUGH - COSTS OF INVESTIGATION BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE
                Having spoken to Mr Waghorn of y o u r depart ment yesterday, it is appropriate that
                I further clarif y the offer made in my letter of 21 August to ensure there is no
                doubt as to the terms of any agreement between us regarding the payment of
                expenditure incurred by West Midlands Police.
                The Aut hori ty agrees subject to their financial con tribution being absolutely
                limited to the amount set out in Lord Ferrers letter dated 27 June 1989 whereby
                the total payment should not exceed the product of the      penny rate estimated at
                £975,000, as a m a tt er of practical expediency to reimburse West Midlands Police
                A u t h o rity their total costs.

                This is agreed on the clear understanding that the total costs of West Midlands
                Police will cover their work in connection w i t h : -
                 1        Lord Justice T a y l o r ’s Inquiry

                 2        The pre paration of evidence for the inquests in South Yorkshire
                 3        The criminal investigation advised by the Director of Public Prosecutions
                 4        Cases taken to the criminal or civil courts and;
                 5        Any related matter of discipline or complaint.
                 This agreement is conditional upon y o u r confirmation that all the above
                 expenditure, t ogether with any interest charged by the West Midlands Police
                 A u t h orit y and any interest incurred by the South Yorkshire Police Authority
                 arising from any delay between the rendering of accounts by that Authority and
                 receipt of payment from the Home Office will be subject to the level of
                 assistance and contribution limit payable by the South Yorkshire Police
                 Au thor ity de tail ed in Lord Ferrers letter of 27 June.

                  The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire has let me have sight of a letter of 17
                  August from Mr Geoffrey Dear in which he confirms that it would be logical for
                  his Force to take on the added re sponsibilit y for any criminal aspect and any
                  d i s ci plin ary matters which may emerge. That Force will w ill i n g l y take on these
                  added responsi bil it i es to its current investigation but Mr Dear points out that
                  his Police Au thor ity have asked him to seek a written assurance that expenditure
                  Mr M J Addison                                              H                                                / ...

incurred by his Force will be met in full by the South Yo rkshire Police with or
withou t Home Office assistance. Obv iously I cannot give this assurance at the
present time and ce rtainly the South Yorkshire Police cannot, but I am sure none
of us would wish the criminal inquiry to be held up w hil st the Home Office and
the South Yorkshire Police A u t h ori ty negotiate re s p o n s i b i l i t y for the
expen dit ure referred to earlier in this letter. I mentio n this because it does
highlight the need for an urgent resolution of the e xp endi ture issue.

Yours sincerely

                    D e a r Mr W r i g h t

                    CRIMINAL AND DISCIPLINARY INVESTIGATIONS

                    As you know Mr Anderson and myself met with the representatives of the
                    Director of Public Prosecutions office and the Police Complaints
                    Authority on Friday 25 August 1989- We have talked through the necessary
                    issues which we will invoke as investigating officers once our
                    appointment has been implemented. You will recall that it awaits a
                    response from your Police Authority regarding the financial issues. In
                    the meantime the possible disciplinary issues arising out of the
                    complaints, which I understand Mr Hicks may have made, will be addressed
                    by Mr Cooper until we formally take over the appointment.

                     However, until our appointment we continue, on your behalf, the Coroner's
                     inquiries. This means we are making contact with a number of your
                     officers to help us, as witnesses for death continuity purposes. I
                     understand that a number of members' of your Force are concerned that
                     these contacts are for criminal/disciplinary enquiry purposes. This is
                     not currently the state of affairs and is not likely to be so in the
                     near future. I have already been approached by the Police Federation
                     Solicitors and the Superintendents Association to clarify our precise
                     role at present. I have told them that we are seeking to interview
                     police officers solely as potential witnesses at this stage. As you
                     appreciate, should anything emerge during the course of the witness
                     interviews which would suggest some culpability, then the normal
                     protections afforded by PACE and Regulation 7 will apply. However, I
                     would stress that we are not making contact with officers where we think
                     that these aspects could apply.
                                     2


I trust that this may be of assistance in reassuring members of your
Force as to the nature of our enquiries at the present time. As and
when that should change I will afford you the courtesy of advising you
accordingly.

Yours sincerely




Assistant Chief Constable
(Hillsborough Inquiry)

    uHjtfv c&mp&ments
Monday, 15 January 1990

1500 hrs

       Meeting with representatives of the Director of Public
       Prosecutions at Farrers Building, Strand, London. Present
       were Mr Peter Birts, Mr Colin Cleugh, Mr Mike Kennedy,
       Detective Chief Superintendent Foster and myself. The
       following items were discussed:-

1.     File format. After considerable discussion it was agreed
       that we would continue to prepare the file in the sections
       proposed but these would not be read by the Counsel
       appointed by the Director of Public Prosecutions until we
       have submitted our final report. They would then use the
       sections as a library to which the final report will be
       cross-referenced. This was always our intention and the
       meeting confirmed it as the right course.

       Mr Birts and representatives of the Director of Public
       Prosecutions heavily underlined the need for an early
       finalisation of the investigation. Whilst they did not want
       to effect the thoroughness of the investigation they really
       did wish to emphasise the need for an early announcement of
       a decision. Obviously going through their mind was the
       recent decisions on the abuse of the process as a result of
       time delays.

       They were particularly concerned that we should run the
       preparation of the final report in with the preparation of
       the sections, as well as the proposals for interview so that
       by March/April they could respond about interviews. Mr
       Birts said he would respond on the question of interviews
       within 10 days on receipt of the "initial" final report.
       This very much puts the onus upon us to be able to very
       quickly carry out the interviews.

       Mr Birts had prepared a summary of how he saw the format of
       the final report. A copy of this proposal, together with     ^
       other items, follows immediately this policy book note^X7^ ' ^

2.     We discussed the implications of the Wapping decision and
       another case involving Police Constable Woodcock which Mr
       Kennedy suggested had far more serious implications.

3.     We discussed the interviews. Again Mr Birts1 notes had
       addressed the issue (see later). We also indicated that a
       video tape recording facility would be available. Both the
       Director of Public Prosecutions' representatives and Mr
       Birts feel most strongly that the video facility must be
       used, where the interviewee agrees, for the benefits were
       enormous to all parties. Mr Birts felt very strongly about
       this and indeed suggested that the issue might have to go as
       far as Mr Green for his reinforcement of the policy to use.
       Mr Birts and the Director of Public Prosecutions




                                                                    «3>33
        representatives strongly emphasised the need for a common
        policy to be adopted to all those interviewed, not
        discriminating between any individual.

        It was their view that the decision to submit to a videod
        interview was a matter for the individual to decide once the
        interview commenced.

k.      We discussed the documentary being prepared by Yorkshire
        Television, which was to be shown in London on Wednesday, 17
        January at 11.30 pm. Mr Birts emphasised that anything that
        was prejudiced must be stopped, particularly as it may
        relate to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield. Mr Kennedy
        agreed that he would attend the showing and arrangements are
        in hand to notify him.

5.      We had a general discussion on the role of the Police
        Complaints Authority and the Coroner and their needs
        emerging from this investigation. However, Mr Birts
        stressed, and we all agreed, that we must "keep our eye on
        the ball". We must not be distracted to lesser offences,
        disciplinary matters separate to the main issues or their
        considerations which extend the time for the finalisation of
        the criminal investigation. The prime offences were "the
        ball". This will require a re-consideration of the emphasis
        we now place on the assembling of the file. Lord Justice
        Taylor's early report had made it easier for us in
        determining where the investigation should concentrate,

6.     We also discussed criminal culpability and in particular
       gross negligence and recklessness. Mr Birt's view is that
       we should concentrate on the dictionary definition and keep
       it as simple as that. There were two cases we may want to
       consider later, Caldwell and Lawrence. We also had a
       discussion on the grid approach on identifying individual
       responsibilities.


The meeting concluded at 1700 hrs.

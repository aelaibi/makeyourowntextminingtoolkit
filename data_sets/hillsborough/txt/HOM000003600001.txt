                           OTHER POSSIBLE MEASURES AGAINST HOOLIGANS

    Exclusion Orders
       320. At present, pursuant to Part IV of the Public Order Act 1986, a court, on convicting a person of an
    offence connected with football has power, in addition to imposing a sentence, making a probation order or
    discharging him, to make an exclusion order prohibiting him from entering premises to attend any football
    match. The exclusion order must be for not less than three months. If a breach is proved, the offender is liable
    to imprisonment for one month, to a fine or to both.

      321. This provision has not made much impact. It has not been greatly used by the courts. When orders
    have been made they have tended to be for too short a period. On one occasion, absurdly, Justices imposed a
    three month exclusion order on an offender appearing before them in May! A great weakness of a bare
    exclusion order is the difficulty of discovering whether it is being obeyed or flouted.

       322.     By section 27(5) of the Football Spectators Act 1989, the provisions of the Public Order Act 1986
    relating to exclusion orders shall cease to have effect when the Secretary of State, by Statutory Instrument,
    brings the 1989 Act into effect. So exclusion orders will go, to be replaced by expulsion from the national
    membership scheme under Part I of the 1989 Act and restriction orders under Part II, as I shall explain in the
    next Chapter.

      nforcing Exclusion by Attendance Centre Order

    r  323.    Were exclusion orders to be retained and used more realistically there are two additional measures
    which could be taken to enforce them. First, there could be provision for attaching to an exclusion order a
    requirement to attend at an appointed centre on the occasions of designated football matches. Failure to
    attend would immediately be detected and would render the absentee liable to further penalties including
    imprisonment.

      324.     Such a measure would have a number of merits. A mere ban on entering grounds may be flouted
    without detection and in any event does not ban presence near the ground. An attendance centre order would
    provide a means not merely to ban a hooligan from entry to a ground but to keep him physically from going
    there. He would thus be prevented from causing trouble outside or near the ground as well as inside it. This
    •would be achieved without adding to the prison population, unless he defaulted, and without any elaborate
    scheme impinging on spectators generally. The provision would be the logical counterpart in the domestic
    scene to the provisions of Part II of the 1989 Act relating to foreign matches.

    Is it Practicable?
       325.     I appreciate that detaining convicted hooligans during designated matches in the domestic football
    programme is a bigger undertaking and would impose a more restrictive penalty than requiring them merely
    to report on the occasions of English matches abroad. It is necessary, therefore, to consider the present
    structure of attendance centres, what extension of it might be necessary, the resource implications and the
    fairness of such a measure.

    Attendance Centres
      326.     At present section 17 of the Criminal Justice Act 1982 empowers courts to make attendance centre
    orders for young people under 21 who:

        (a) have been convicted of an imprisonable offence;

        (b) have defaulted on payment of their fines etc; or

        (c) have failed to comply with the requirements of a probation or supervision order.

      Attendance centre orders may not be used for those who have previously been given a custodial sentence
    except in special (undefined) circumstances. The minimum length of an order is 12 hours, except for those
    under 14. The maximum is 24 hours under 17, and 36 hours for those aged 17 to 20.


                                                          55
f




       327.     At present there are 137centres: 111 junior centres for those aged under 17, and 26 senior centres for
     those aged 17 to 20 (males only). The senior centres are, for the most part, in the larger conurbations. The
     Home Office has recently reviewed the use of the junior centres and some with low attendance figures are
     being closed.

       328. Most centres are in school premises. They are normally open for 2 (junior) or 3 (senior) hours every
     other Saturday, usually, but not invariably, in the afternoon. Each centre is staffed by an officer in charge,
     normally an off-duty or retired police officer, assisted by other instructors. Regimes include physical
     education and at least one other activity.

     f - ^ . Subject to these factors, attendance centre orders can be made at present against those convicted of
     football related offences. They cannot however be imposed on anyone over 21, or anyone who has had a
     custodial sentence.

       330. Effectively to exclude the offender from football grounds, it would be necessary to have the centre
     open at least on every Saturday afternoon during the season. To try to include week-day evening matches
     would create difficulties in making centres available and might be thought too oppressive on the offender If
     power to make orders were extended to cover those over 21 and those who have served a custodial sentence,
     the centre would have to provide for a more challenging type of offender. It would probably be thought
     inappropriate to mix 17 to 20 year old attenders with more hardened hooligans.

     Resource Implications
       331. Such an extension would probably involve an increase in the number and calibre of staff. Presently,
    as indicated earlier, staff include retired and off-duty police officers. More such personnel would be required.
    However, such increases might be modest in comparison with the police resources likely to be required to
    implement the national membership scheme (see paragraphs 420 to 423 infra).

    Fairness
       332. I would not suggest that the imposition of an attendance order should be a mandatory
    accompaniment to an exclusion order. It would be a discretionary power available to the courts to be used in
    accordance with the same criteria as apply in Part II of the 1989 Act, ie no such order could be made unless
    the court was satisfied that making it in relation to the accused would help to prevent violence or disorder at
    or in connection with designated football matches (c/section 15(2) of the 1989 Act). This would enable the
    courts to keep the numbers of orders within manageable limits and to apply them only in serious cases where
    the offender might otherwise be in danger of a custodial sentence.

      333. In such situations, if the offender were judged by the court to be a committed football hooligan, and
    were required to attend for say two hours each Saturday in the football season, to a maximum of 36 hours (ie
    nearly half a season) or even 72 hours, he could not surely have any just grievance. The order would be less
    harsh than even the shortest prison sentence and, from the public’s point of view, much more effective.

     ..I.34’ ? recognise the Practical difficulties in implementing extended attendance centre orders but, if those
    difficulties can be overcome, the scheme would have considerable merits. I accordingly recommend that
    consideration be given to implementing it.

    Tagging
      335.    A second possible measure to enforce exclusion from the ground and its environs is electronic
    monitoring or tagging. This device is used successfully in the United States. Pilot schemes are presently being
    run here by the Home Office. Accused persons on remand are kept under supervision using anklets with
    small radio transmitters linked to a central computer. Despite reports of some difficulty with the pilot
    schemes, Mr John Patten in an answer to a Parliamentary Question on 10 January 1989 stated:-

       It is already clear that the technology can be put to practical use and that the procedures for fitting the
      equipment and monitoring defendants are practicable. It would now be desirable to test the use of
      electronic monitoring on a trial basis in an area in which substantial numbers are likely to be eligible for its
      application as a condition of bail.”

    Moreover, you are reported as having said to the Bow Group on 11 December 1989:-

                                                           56
  “There is a need for courts to have powers to make curfew orders, confining offenders to their homes at
 certain times. This should not be a 24 hour house arrest. They need to be able to go to work if they have a
 job, attend training courses or probation centres, or receive treatment for alcohol or drug misuse. But some
 types of crime - pub brawls, for example, or car thefts - could be reduced by curfew orders. I very much
 hope that our experiments with electronic monitoring will enable it to be extended from defendants on
 remand to sentenced offenders, so as to make a curfew order properly enforceable”.

  336. If the experiments do enable the tagging to be extended to sentenced offenders, it would be a most
useful and effective way of ordering convicted hooligans, excluded from grounds, to remain at home during
designated matches. Their obedience to the orders could be monitored without excessive resource
requirements.

  337. I therefore recommend that consideration be given to using this technology in the sentencing of
offenders convicted of football-related offences.

          I enclose an extract of the recently published report by the
          Rt Hon Lord Justice Taylor on the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster.
          As you will see from the extract, Chapter 11 of the report
          recommends a wider use of attendance centres for football
          hooligans.

          The GovernfDOh^has said it will look carefully and quickly into the

          are studying the proposals but we would also appreciate the views
          of officers-in-charge of senior attendance centres.

          We would be grateful to receive comments on the recommendations

Is it Practicable?
   325. I appreciate that detaining convicted hooligans during designated matches in the domestic football
programme is a bigger undertaking and would impose a more restrictive penalty than requiring them merely
to report on the occasions of English matches abroad. It is necessary, therefore, to consider the present
structure of attendance centres, what extension of it might be necessary, the resource implications and the
fairness of such a measure.

Attendance Centres
  326. At present section 17 of the Criminal Justice Act 1982 empowers courts to make attendance centre
orders for young people under 21 who:

    (a) have been convicted of an imprisonable offence;

    (b) have defaulted on payment of their fines etc; or

    (c) have flailed to comply with the requirements of a probation or supervision order.

  Attendance centre orders may not be used for those who have previously been given a custodial sentence
except in special (undefined) circumstances. The minimum length of an order is 12 hours, except for those
under. 14. The maximum is 24 hours under 17, and 36 hours for those aged 17 to 20.

   328.    Most centres are in school premises. They are normally open for 2 (junior) or 3 (senior) hours every
 other Saturday, usually, but not invariably, in the afternoon. Each centre is staffed by an officer in charge,
 normally an off-duty or retired police officer, assisted by other instructors. Regimes include physical
 education and at least one other activity.

 f 3?u9 „ Su!>jeCi t0J hese faetors>attendance centre orders can be made at present against those convicted of
 football related offences. They cannot however be imposed on anyone over 21, or anyone who has had a
 custodial sentence.

   330. Effectively to exclude the offender from football grounds, it would be necessary to have the centre
 open at least on every Saturday afternoon during the season. To try to include week-day evening matches
 would create difficulties in making centres available and might be thought too oppressive on the offender If
 power to make orders were extended to cover those over 21 and those who have served a custodial sentence
 the centre would have to provide for a more challenging type of offender. It would probably be thought
 inappropriate to mix 17 to 20 year old attenders with more hardened hooligans.

 Resource Implications
    331. Such an extension would probably involve an increase in the number and calibre of staff. Presently
 as indicated earlier, staff include retired and off-duty police officers. More such personnel would be required.
 However, such increases might be modest in comparison with the police resources likely to be required to
 implement the national membership scheme (see paragraphs 420 to 423 infra).

 Fairness
   332. I would not suggest that the imposition of an attendance order should be a mandatory
accompaniment to an exclusion order. It would be a discretionary power available to the courts to be used in
accordance with the same criteria as apply in Part II of the 1989 Act, ie no such order could be made unless
the court was satisfied that making it in relation to the accused would help to prevent violence or disorder at
or in connection with designated football matches (c/section 15(2) of the 1989 Act). This would enable the
courts to keep the numbers of orders within manageable limits and to apply them only in serious cases where
the ottender might otherwise be in danger of a custodial sentence.

  333. In such situations, if the offender were judged by the court to be a committed football hooligan, and
were required to attend for say two hours each Saturday in the football season, to a maximum of 36 hours (ie
nearly half a season) or even 72 hours, he could not surely have any just grievance. The order would be less
harsh than even the shortest prison sentence and, from the public’s point of view, much more effective.

difficulties can be overcome, the scheme would have considerable merits. I accordingly recommend that

Tagging
   335.    A second possible measure to enforce exclusion from the ground and its environs is electronic
monitoring or tagging. This device is used successfully in the United States. Pilot schemes are presently being
run here by the Home Office. Accused persons on remand are kept under supervision using anklets with
sinall radio transmitters linked to a central computer. Despite reports of some difficulty with the pilot
schemes, Mr John Patten in an answer to a Parliamentary Question on 10 January 1989 stated:-

 “It is already clear that the technology can be put to practical use and that the procedures for fitting the
 equipment and monitoring defendants are practicable. It would now be desirable to test the use of
 electronic monitoring on a trial basis in an area in which substantial numbers are likely to be eligible for its
 application as a condition of bail.”

Moreover, you are reported as having said to the Bow Group on 11 December 1989:-

 certain times. This should not be a 24 hour house arrest. They need to be able to go to work if they have a
 job, attend training courses or probation centres, or receive treatment for alcohol or drug misuse. But some
 types of crime - pub brawls, for example, or car thefts - could be reduced by curfew orders. I very much
 hope that our experiments with electronic monitoring will enable it to be extended from defendants on
 remand to sentenced offenders, so as to make a curfew order properly enforceable”.

  336. If the experiments do enable the tagging to be extended to sentenced offenders, it would be a most
useful and effective way of ordering convicted hooligans, excluded from grounds, to remain at home during
designated matches. Their obedience to the orders could be monitored without excessive resource
requirements.

  337. I therefore recommend that consideration be given to using this technology in the sentencing of
offenders convicted of football-related offences.

                           OTHER POSSIBLE MEASURES AGAINST HOOLIGANS

    Exclusion Orders
       320. At present, pursuant to Part IV of the Public Order Act 1986, a court, on convicting a person of an
    offence connected with football has power, in addition to imposing a sentence, making a probation order or
    discharging him, to make an exclusion order prohibiting him from entering premises to attend any football
    match. The exclusion order must be for not less than three months. If a breach is proved, the offender is liable
    to imprisonment for one month, to a fine or to both.

      321. This provision has not made much impact. It has not been greatly used by the courts. When orders
    have been made they have tended to be for too short a period. On one occasion, absurdly, Justices imposed a
    three month exclusion order on an offender appearing before them in May! A great weakness of a bare
    exclusion order is the difficulty of discovering whether it is being obeyed or flouted.

      322. By section 27(5) of the Football Spectators Act 1989, the provisions of the Public Order Act 1986
    relating to exclusion orders shall cease to have effect when the Secretary of State, by Statutory Instrument,
    brings the 1989 Act into effect. So exclusion orders will go, to be replaced by expulsion from the national
    membership scheme under Part I of the 1989 Act and restriction orders under Part II, as I shall explain in the
    next Chapter.

    Enforcing Exclusion by Attendance Centre Order
       323. Were exclusion orders to be retained and used more realistically there are two additional measures
    which could be taken to enforce them. First, there could be provision for attaching to an exclusion order a
    requirement to attend at an appointed centre on the occasions of designated football matches. Failure to
    attend would immediately be detected and would render the absentee liable to further penalties including
    imprisonment.

      324. Such a measure would have a number of merits. A mere ban on entering grounds may be flouted
    without detection and in any event does not ban presence near the ground. An attendance centre order would
    provide a means not merely to ban a hooligan from entry to a ground but to keep him physically from going
    there. He would thus be prevented from causing trouble outside or near the ground as well as inside it. This
    would be achieved without adding to the prison population, unless he defaulted, and without any elaborate
    scheme impinging on spectators generally. The provision would be the logical counterpart in the domestic
    scene to the provisions of Part II of the 1989 Act relating to foreign matches.

    Is it Practicable?
       325. I appreciate that detaining convicted hooligans during designated matches in the domestic football
    programme is a bigger undertaking and would impose a more restrictive penalty than requiring them merely
    to report on the occasions of English matches abroad. It is necessary, therefore, to consider the present

      Dear David,

      Many thanks for your letter dated 4th June 1990 regarding the donation of Â£25,000 made by
      The Football Association.

      My feeling is that as Liverpool were the football club most directly affected by the tragic events
      at Hillsborough, then we should respect their decision not to seek any publicity on making this
      payment.

      What I would suggest, therefore, is that if on some future occasion you felt that it might be
      appropriate for a member of The Football Association Council or one of its staff to attend an
      event or one of the centres set up by the Local Authorities, then you should get in touch.

                    say how much The Football Association appreciates all that you and your
      F inally, m ay I
      colleagues have done to help so many people over the past year or so.

      Yours sincerely,



                                                                                  SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT

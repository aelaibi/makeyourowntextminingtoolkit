tarnished image of the English game.


     “This       package,    alongside        the     efforts     of    the    police      and   British

operations       'Own Goal'       and   'Full    Time'       have      shown   that the hooligans

PROGRESS ON MEASURES TO COMBAT FOOTBALL HOOLIGANISM

Introduction


1.      The interim report to UEFA in January stressed the importance
that the UK attaches to close co-operation between the Government,
football   authorities    and    the     police   and    their
throughout Europe.     The UK chairs the Council of Europe’s Standing            1
                                                                                                                HOOLIGANISM ___
Committee on the European Convention on Spectator Violence and was
the first to sign and ratify the Convention.        The UK plays an
role in the work of the European Community TREVI forum on football
matters, established to improve communication between police forces
about   preparations    and   security    arrangements    for    international
football fixtures.     Many of the arrangements agreed by the Standing
Committee and the TREVI group were put into practice in the detailed
planning for the West Germany v England friendly international in
September 1987.
^fropean Championships



2.        The interim report mentioned that, building on the experience
gained    at this      international       match,    a Working Group was               to be
established       to    oversee      the     arrangements         for     the     European
Championships in the Federal Republic of Germany.                   The Group met for
the first time on 19 January and has met regularly since then.                           The
Group is chaired by a Department of the Environment official and
comprises    representatives       of the        Football   Association,          the Home
Office,    the    Ministry    of   Defence,       the    Foreign    and     Commonwealth
Office,     the   Police     and   the     British      Transport       Police.        Other
interested parties, such as the ferry operators, have been called to
meetings as appropriate.           Within the Working Group the Government,
the FA and the police have worked closely together to ensure that
every possible precautionary step is taken to minimise the risk of a
criminal     hooligan      element,        masquerading      as     English       football
supporters causing trouble at the Finals.


Action by the FA



3.        The FA have worked       closely with the German                authorities onthe
detailed     arrangements      for     England's        supporters       attending       the
Championships.         Tickets     for     the    Championships         have    only    been
available in this country          through the FA and all England supporters
buying these tickets will be accommodated in segregated areas.                            An
important concern has been to ensure,                   as far as possible,             that
tickets were not sold to known troublemakers.                 A rigorous system of
processing and vetting ticket sales was adopted for both individuals
making direct applications to the FA and travel agents providing
package trips to the Championships.                  No one was supplied with a
f^cket unless they had completed a comprehensive application form
giving full details of the applicant including their                            travel and
accommodation arrangements.            All applicants were checked against the
FA's list of offenders.


4.       In consultation with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and
the    Department      of    the    Environment, the         FA    produced      a    leaflet
reminding supporters of the need for good behaviour and providing
guidance for those travelling in Germany. The leaflet was issued to
everyone buying a ticket.


Action by the Police


5.       The BTP have, notably through the TREVI network,                        cooperated
closely with their counterparts in the Federal Republic of Germany
and    other    European countries           likely   to     be    affected,         ie    those
countries      through      which    English    supporters         will    travel     to     the
Championships. Information on the numbers of supporters and identity
of    known    and    potential      trouble    makers      planning       to   go    to     the
Championships        without       tickets     was    passed       to     the   appropriate
authorities.         Action was also taken to identify recommended routes
for coach travel.


6.       The    Metropolitan        Police,     at    the    request       of   the       German
authorities, are to provide a team of five officers to attend the
Championships as police "spotters".                   They will assist the German
police    by    providing      information       on    the        behaviour     of    England
supporters, identifying potential troublemakers and in communicating
with English supporters.            They will also coordinate intelligence on
the movement and behaviour of English supporters.
•
7.       I have strenuously insisted that there              should be     maximum
police    cooperation,      co-ordination     monitoring        and   exchange    of
intelligence.


Action by the UK Government


8.       The Government expressed the hope that no English supporters
would travel to the Championships, thus avoiding the potential risk
of extreme provocation by         "supporters"        of other competing teams
which    might   occur.      However,   recognising      that    supporters   would
ignore this advice, the Government sought to address two particular
concerns. The first was to see that no ticket sales were allowed on
match days, or indeed for a period preceding the games.                 The recent
decision of the German authorities to allow no ticket sales on the
day of the match and two days before for each of England's group
matches was a welcome step in this direction.


9.       The second concerned ticket allocations to British Service
personnel stationed in Germany.          Although British Service personnel
in Germany have no record of football hooliganism the Government was
concerned about the degree of provocation that they would be likely
to experience in non-segregated areas of the stadium.                 It would have
been far better if all Service personnel had bought their tickets
from the FA and thus been accommodated in the English segregated
area. However, tickets in West Germany had been available for some
time through the voucher system, and many Service personnel chose to
use this method of obtaining their tickets.                  It was not possible
therefore to accommodate all of them in                the   English area.        But
Service    personnel      determined    to   attend    the    Championships      were
^feiorted to buy their tickets through the FA and some 3,400 tickets
have been purchased in this way.              British Service personnel in
Germany are in no doubt about the need for good behaviour or their
liability to appropriate disciplinary action under Military or Civil
Law, should they transgress.


10.    The    Government     hope    of     course   that    these    exhaustive
precautionary measures will be successful and that the Championships
will be trouble free. However, despite all the efforts which have
been made the Government cannot of course offer any guarantee that
trouble will not occur; nor should it be overlooked that our tough
stance towards crowd control can only be offered in the form of
advice to the organisers of the tournament.


11.    UEFA have asked what might be done to restrict travel by
'supporters' known to be likely to cause trouble.              The removal of
passports is not an option for policy and practical reasons.                      A
British citizen has a right in law to enter or leave the UK 'without
let or hindrance'.      Freedom of travel within the European community
is a matter on which the EC is taking a cooperative interest in the
run up to 1992.    Any steps that were taken to restrict travel within
the community could only be achieved by agreement of the constituent
countries rather than by the unilateral action of one country.                  The
British passport establishes identity and nationality, it is not a
licence to travel.        The British Visitors Passport and the British
Excursion Document are freely available from Post Offices throughout
Britain.      Someone     deprived   of     one   passport   could    acquire    a
replacement   at   once     and   without     difficulty.      This    parallels
arrangements in European countries who have national identity cards
by which owners can travel in Europe without passports.

DOMESTIC SEASON


12.    The interim report set out the measures which had been put in
place in recent years in order to deal with football hooliganism.
These include strengthening of police powers by banning alcohol at
football grounds and the introduction of exclusion orders.           It also
set out the package of anti-hooligan measures agreed in February
1987 between the Government and the football authorities, for full
implementation by the beginning of the 1987/88 domestic season.


Progress


13.    The efforts of the police aided by the additional powers they
have been given and the greater use of CCTV have made a significant
impact in the control of hooligan behaviour, though they have not
eradicated it.     So far as the clubs and the football authorities are
concerned, good progress had been made in some areas but not all
clubs have responded as far or as quickly as we would have wished.
Indeed a few are more than a year overdue in implementing this basic
package of anti-hooligan measures.


14.    All Football League clubs now have local plans for dealing
with home and away supporters agreed with the police; all ticket
arrangements     have   worked   well,   and   the   Government's   Manpower
Services Commission's Community Programme has sponsored and financed
"Football in the Community" schemes at 28 League clubs and schemes
are planned at a further 12 clubs.
Wr.     CCTV is widely recognised as the single most important and
effective measure in combatting football hooliganism.                     Although 73
clubs in the Football League had fixed CCTV installations at the end
of    the    season,   and   a   further   4 had      access    to portable police
operated      systems,   there    are   still   15    clubs    which,     for   various
reasons, have not yet had CCTV installed.                But the Football League
have said that 12 of these will do so by the beginning of next
season and that the other 3 will have access to a portable system,
again by the beginning of next season.


16.     As I mentioned in the interim report, progress on membership
schemes has been slow.           16 clubs have met the 50% ground capacity
provision of the February 1987 agreement.                 18 clubs have achieved
between 40-50%,        21 between 30-40%,       20 between 20-30%,          9 between
10-20%, and 8 with less than 10%.               The reasons why clubs have not
been able to reach the agreed level are explained in the interim
report.


17.     The Football League agreed in February 1987 to consider the
possibility of a reciprocal membership scheme covering all 92 clubs.
A consultants report on the feasibility was received in July 1987.
It recommended that:-
              the   longer   term    aim   of   the    League    should    be    for   a

            reciprocal membership scheme which has all away supporters as

            members;

            - partial reciprocal membership schemes should be in place by
            the beginning of the 1988-89 season.
The League also told the Government in November 1987 that they would
^fctasiderthe    introduction        ofa    self    regulatory    system          for
anti-hooligan measures.           Regrettably there is no progress to report
on these issues at this stage.


Preliminary Police assessment of the season


18.    The police are currently conducting a full appraisal of the
season just ended, and this will not be completed until next month.
The Association of Chief Police Officer's sub-committee on football
hooliganism      has however, given us a preliminary view.


19.    A    list     of   matches    where       serious   incidents   of    violence
occurred        is   at   annex     A.     In   general ACPO   identify     two   main
categories of match.          First those in which there has been a good
deal of      animosity between some sections of the crowd,                 but where
police segregation and containment techniques have prevented actual
violence.       The second category comprises matches where there has
been little evidence of bad behaviour or concerted aggression (often
because away support has been light), but where the potential for
trouble could not be discounted.                It is estimated that the second
category represents a significant majority of matches.




20.    Although violence by groups               of hooligans away from grounds
and on transit systems continues to occur, overall police strategies
have succeeded in containing the problem,                  but at a high cost in
terms of manpower.         The police are considering ways of increasing
effectiveness through,        forexample,        the   more active use of         CCTV
^j^htems.     The    police     are      firmly of     the view     that    the    alcohol
controls are proving beneficial and have done much to improve the
demeanour of away supporters.


21.    The    statistics       on     attendances,      arrests    and     ejections     at
Football League grounds are not yet available for the whole of the
1987/88 season.       The latest available figures cover the period up to
the end of January 1988, and these are at annex B.                       The police have
rightly always maintained that in themselves these statistics are an
unreliable guide to the general level of crowd behaviour.                          Despite
the well-publicised ugly incidents at end of season matches,                             the
overall marginal improvement in behaviour within grounds in recent
seasons has been maintained.              But there are still disturbingly large
numbers of hooligans who seem willing to indulge in aggressive and
provocative behaviour.


The cost of policing League grounds



22.    The    cost     of     policing      League     grounds    in     Great     Britain
increased during 1986-87, the latest year for which full statistics
are available,       by 16.6%,        rising from a total of £3.13 m to the
highest ever level of £3.65 m.               Preliminary figures for the first
half   of    the    1987-88    season      show   an   increase     of     29%    over   the
corresponding period for 1986-87.
Incidents of Hooliganism



23.    Police strategies have ensured that progress has been made in
containing     the    problem       of   hooliganism.      As     with    many    European
nations,    we have noted that the decline in incidents inside the
stadia has been accompanied by a continuing likelihood of trouble
4fccurring outside stadia.     Incidents inside grounds this season have
highlighted that there remain serious challenges to law and order.
It    is    disappointing   that    the     season   should   have   begun,     at
Scarborough,     with   a major     incident    of   hooliganism   and   end,   at
Chelsea, on the same note.         At international level you will be aware
of the deplorable incidents of violence at and after the England v
Scotland match at Wembley on        21   May.


24.        A note covering some of the major incidents of crowd disorder
this season is at annex A.


25.        It remains the Government's firm intention to continue to
work with the football authorities for further progress on measures
to combat hooliganism.       The position is not static and determined
efforts by clubs,       police and courts are needed over a period of
years.      I will be reviewing with the football authorities before
next season, what more needs to be done and how quickly.
    borough v Wolverhampton Wanders - 15.8.87                     Annex A


The main cause of the trouble was the inadequacy of the segregation
arrangements.     The barriers proved not to be strong enough and were
breached in several places by Wolves supporters.           The relatively
large crowd (7,314) for this ground meant that space between Home
and Away supporters was very narrow and it proved impossible to keep
the two sets of supporters apart.        There was substantial damage to
the ground's stands and newly installed toilets.           56 people were
arrested for offences of public order, criminal damage, theft and
drunkeness.      11     people were ejected   from the ground.    The   FA
announced, shortly afterwards, that all Wolves away matches would be
all-ticket for an indefinite period.


QPR v Chelsea - 12.9.87


The main incident of disorder occurred after the match had finished.
Chelsea supporters in the "away" end were being held back by the
police to allow the "home" supporters to disperse.        Most of the QPR
supporters had left.       Some 250 Chelsea supporters ran onto the pitch
towards the QPR "home" end.        Police and mounted officers were used
to disperse the Chelsea supporters.           19 people were arrested for
various public order offences.      21 people were ejected.


Arsenal v Millwall - 9.1.88


Prior to the match, two public houses were damaged.       At the kick-off
approximately 100 Millwall supporters who had managed to infiltrate
the Arsenal     "end"    - the North Bank,    began fighting with Arsenal
supporters. The Police moved in quickly and the Millwall supporters
^fere removed. When Arsenal scored, Millwall supporters showered the
police with coins.     48 people were arrested and          73 people were
ej ected.


Aston Villa v Liverpool - 31.1.88


Returning from the match, 100 Liverpool supporters badly damaged 4
coaches of a train.    Windows and lights were smashed, seats slashed
and ripped out and fire extinguishers stolen.              The police were
called and the supporters rounded up and put back on the train.          The
train, escorted by police officers, proceeded to Stafford Station
where it was taken out of service.       Supporters were put on the next
train and escorted back to Liverpool.          All of the supporters were
interviewed by CID officers at the Merseyside and BTP forces.            The
value of the damage was estimated to be around £5,000.


York City v Sunderland - 26.3.88


There were two incidents of crowd disorder at this match.         The first
occurred about 20 minutes after the kick off.          About 150 Sunderland
supporters attempted to gain access to the area immediately behind
the goal and began attempting to demolish a segregation fence.           The
police moved    them to   another part    of    the   ground.   The   second
incident occurred after the end of the match.         Sunderland supporters
started pulling out seats.    The police moved in to prevent this and
to remove the supporters.    The police contained these people at one
end of the pitch to enable the rest of the crowd to leave the
ground.     However, about 300 on the pitch became disorderly.          The
4^>ssbar at one end o£ the ground was broken.                     32 people were
arrested, all from the Sunderland area, for a variety of offences
e.g. public order, criminal damage and assault.


Chelsea v Charlton Athletic - 7.5.88


Problems    occurred when        about   100    Chelsea   supporters    managed   to
infiltrate the segregated area for Charlton supporters.                 The police
managed    to prevent      a further 300 Chelsea supporters             from doing
likewise.        Just after the kick-off the Chelsea supporters in the
Charlton end were attached by Charlton supporters and a fight ensued
involving about 400 people.              The police then moved the Chelsea
supporters from this part of the ground.                  Immediately after the
match there were two fights outside the ground following attacks by
Chelsea supporters on Charlton supporters.                These were soon broken
up by the police.              35 people were arrested and there were 47
ejections.


England v Scotland - 21.5.88


This match resulted in a number of incidents of disorder in Central
London, as well as at Wembley Stadium.               Over 200 arrests were made
altogether, 112 of them in and around the Stadium.                A general level
of   aggressive     and   drunken     behaviour    prevailed,    both   inside    the
stadium and in London generally.               A serious incident occurred on a
London Underground train travelling from Wembley Park station.                     A
crowd of 1,000 supporters were involved, trespassing onto the lines
and wrecking the train, causing it to be withdrawn from service. The
incidents inside the Stadium occurred in non-segregated areas. The
police    were    able    to   deal   quickly with     these    incidents.       Firm
^fencing prevented any major incidents of disorder.                            It appeared
that most of the offenders had previously been drinking heavily.
However, local public houses were closed and traders restricted the
sale of alcohol immediately around the ground.


Chelsea v Middlesborough 28.5.88


The atmosphere was from the outset highly charged and difficulties
on the terraces were aggravated by the ticket selling policy of the
club which did not ensure total segregation.                 The club had sold 600
tickets to both Chelsea and Middlesborough supporters for a sterile
area within the northern end of the members enclosure.                               Missile
throwing   and damage to the stands ensued.                     A similar situation
occurred   in the West Stand, and in order to                   prevent any serious
outbreaks of      disorder,     the police relocated              a    large    number    of
Middlesborough     supporters.        At     the     end   of     the    match       Chelsea
supporters [upset at their teams relegation] penetrated the security
fence at   the    Chelsea      "home end"    and encroached onto the pitch,
charging towards the Middlesborough supporters.                   Mounted police were
called and cleared the pitch. The disorder continued outside the
ground   into    the   early    evening,     causing       some       damage    to    public
property   in    and   around    public     houses    in    the       area.      104    were
arrested, 20 of which were made in the ground.                    The police received
32 injuries,     including fractured jaws, noses and ribs.                        Numerous
injuries were received by spectators hit by flying seats, stones and
coins.

                                          AND       FOOTBALL         LEAGUE




 The    Government              and       the       football         authorities
 discussed          the        need       to take          action         to    curb
 violence          and       hooliganism              associated               with       football.
 We    particularly                deplored           the      behaviour             of    so-called
 supporters             of     the E n g l a n d          team     in W e s t        Germany       during       the
European        championships.                        Hooliganism was                     not a p r o b l e m
confined           lo    football            but      football         provided             a foc u s    for     it
b o t h at    home           and     a b r oa d .


The     Prime      Minister              therefore            said     to      the
football        representatives                       that       she w o u l d        like

Government          measures



Considerable             police           resources            have       already
been devote d            to        f o o t ba l l ,    backed        by
restrictions             on      alcohol            u n der    the    Sporting
Events       (Control           of      Alcohol)           Ac t    1985        and    new
powers       for    the        police         and      courts        under       the
Public Order             A ct       1986.           The    police will
intensify          their        efforts             to d e a l     with
criminal       behaviour.                  The        Government           is
considering             h ow    better          to e n f o r c e

     The    Government            is a l s o       considering applications                              from
     l o ca l    authorities            for' b y e - l a w s          to    restrict             or    prevent      the
     consumption           of a l c o h o l        in p u b l i c          places.


     Action       by th e       football           authorities


     We    noted that           there        had been            considerable                 progress        on the
     measures        agreed        between          the     Government                and        the    football
     authorities           in F e b r u a r y       1987.             Nevertheless                the p o l i c e
     v i e w w as    that p ar ti al           club m e m b e r s h i p               schemes          had   not
     made       a significant            contribution                  to c o n t r o l l i n g
     hooliganism.


     The    Government            pressed          the     football
     authorities           to e s t a b l i s h       a    national
     membership           scheme        to    control            access        to all
     Football        League        matches.               Th e     football
     authorities           do     not    believe           that        such       a
     scheme       could     be     introduced              on a v o l u n t a r y
     basis.         The    Government              will          therefore
     bring       forward        proposals           for          legislation               to
     give       statutory         backing          to a          national
     membership           scheme.            A working             party       under          t he
     chairmanship           of     th e M i n i s t e r          for       Sport,          c o n s i s t i n g of
     respresentatives               of       the    football               authorities,                the
     Government           and     the    p o li c e ,      will        be     set      up urge nt ly          to
     l o o k at     the d e t a i l s .


     The    Prime Minister               welcomed                the d e c i s i o n         of
     the    FA    to w i t h d r a w      from      the          friendly
     international              match        arranged            in    I t al y       in

     arranged        for     next       year.         It w as          agreed          that       the q u e s t i o n
     of    England's        participation                  in the W o r l d                Cup    should      be
     kept       under     review.

                                 THE FOOTBALL NATIONAL MEMBERSHIP SCHEME
                                        WORKING PARTY REPORT PUBLISHED


                        A working party report, setting out the main principles of a
                  national    membership    scheme   to       control   admission    to   football
                  matches in England and Wales, was published today.


                        The working party was chaired by Colin Moynihan, Minister
                  for   Sport,    and    included    representatives        of      the   Football
                  Association and the Football League.


                        The recommendations agreed by the working party for the main
                  elements of the scheme are as follows:


                  GENERAL
                  Admission of spectators        to a designated football match will
                  only be permitted if:
                              the spectator produces a valid membership card                   for
                              checking at the point of entry to the ground; and
                                                     -   1-

r




                the ground on which the match              is to     be played    is
                licensed.


    The   schemewill be a national one administered                  by a Football
    Membership Authority; information about all members will be held
    on a central computer.


    A member will be entitled to only one card which will indicate
    the club which he, or she, supports and qualify him, or her, to
    attend any designated match.


    The   schemewill apply in England and Wales but                  consideration
    should     be given   to   its   extension       to   Scotland    and   Northern
    Ireland.


    MEMBERSHIP OF THE SCHEME


    An application should involve:
                a standard application form
                proof of identity
                proof of address
                a photograph.


    Membership cards should include:

                                         -   2   -
#




              date of expiry
              the name of the club nominated
              the member's national football allegiance
         they should be readable electronically and valid for two or
         three seasons only.


    Exemptions from membership:
              no general exemptions for paying British spectators;
              limited temporary membership for accompanied foreign
              nationals;
              clubs to make special arrangements for guests,
              hospitality boxes and groups such as parties of
              school children, accompanied children in family
              enclosures and disabled people in designated
              areas with special access;
              non-spectators should not be subject to the
              scheme.


    Criteria for withdrawing or withholding membership from
    hooligans should include:
              mandatory criteria imposed by legislation linked to
              conviction for football-related offences, involving
              bans of two or five years;
              discretionary criteria operated by the Football
              Membership Authority who will decide whether to
              impose bans and for how long.
*
    Two new criminal offences should be created:

                for false application for membership;

                for gaining or attempting to gain entry to ground

                without a valid membership card.



    DESIGNATED FOOTBALL MATCHES



    The scheme should apply to all matches between League clubs'
    first teams.



    The   scheme   should   not    apply        to   matches   between    non-League
    teams.



    Matches   between   League    clubs        and   non-League   clubs   should   be

    designated but the scheme should allow initially for admission of

    non-members.


    Special procedures for matches involving foreign teams.



    Admission   for   members     only    to     matches   between   English/Welsh
    and Scottish/Northern Irish teams.



    RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SCHEME:

    The Football Membership Authority and the Clubs



    The FMA will be designated by the Secretary of State;                   it will

    draw up a scheme in accordance with criteria imposed by

                                         -4-
*   »




    legislation;   the   scheme will   be   subject   to   approval   by   the
    Secretary of State.


    FMA's responsibilities to include:
              supervise application process
              approve/reject applications
              maintain central register of all members
              draw up rules on withdrawal of membership
              make decisions and possibly hear appeals on withdrawal
              licensing grounds (if this responsibility is delegated
              by the Secretary of State).


    Clubs' responsibilities to include:


              dealing with applications, maintaining records, supply
              of information to central register
              installation and maintenance of approved machinery for
              checking membership cards
              adequate arrangements to control admission of
              spectators and to deal with holders of rejected cards
              provision of sufficient trained staff to operate all
              aspects of scheme
              other requirements to ensure effective operation of the
              scheme.
                                         -5-
•d    V




     The   scheme        should    be     monitored       by    a     small      part-time
     inspectorate employed by and responsible to the FMA or another
     agency (or the Secretary of State).


     Sanctions      on     clubs        which     fail     to       carry      out   their
     responsibilities should include:


                 withdrawal of the licence to admit spectators to the
                 ground        for persistent or         serious     failure    or   in an
                 emergency following a serious disturbance;


                 fines for minor breaches;


                 criminal liability for admitting spectators to a
                 designated match at a non-licensed ground.


     The   FMA and       the    clubs will      need   to register with          the Data
     Protection Registrar.


     NOTIFICATION OF OFFENCES


     In operating discretionary criteria to disqualify from membership
     those whose behaviour is unacceptable, clubs will need to receive
     information from the police about those who are being ejected
     from the ground, and about those who are being arrested for an
     alleged criminal offence committed on the club's premises.
                                          -6-
For the mandatory criteria imposed by the legislation to work
properly, the FMA must receive information about convictions for
football related offences.         The working party recommends:


            the question of whether an offence is football related
            should be determined by the courts;


            the Government     should initiate discussions with the
            courts, the Crown Prosecution Service and the police to
            determine    the   most       efficient     means   of    notifying
            convictions to the FMA.


The Government should determine with the police and the football
authorities suitable arrangements for ensuring that troublemakers
are   not   admitted    to   the   scheme    at   the   outset.       An   early
Government announcement should make it clear that past behaviour
will be taken into account in deciding who shall be disqualified
from membership.


TECHNOLOGY AND TIMING


The   Government   representatives        and   the   police    are   satisfied
that the technology is available to implement the scheme.                   The
main elements should be:
                                    -7-

                 a computerised central register
                 a computer at each club
                 card readers at turnstiles, to be portable if possible.


    Membership     cards   are   to    be    readable   electronically.       The
    options, on which the working party has not drawn conclusions,
    are:


                 barcode cards
                 magnetic stripe cards
                 smartcards.


    The    new   technology    may    also   provide    opportunities   for   the
    clubs to improve their own administrative procedures                  and for

    marketing.


    NOTES FOR EDITORS
    The working party was set up following a meeting between the
    Prime Minister and the President of the Football League and the
    Chairman of the Football Association on 6 July, 1988.
    The       objectives     of     the     working     party     were:
                to review the main principles of a national membership
                scheme.

         FOOTBALL NATIONAL MEMBERSHIP SCHEME REPOjRT. PUBLISHED


            Sports     Minister    Colin         Moynihan   today    announced   the

Government's      intention       to   introduce        a   compulsory    national
membership scheme for football supporters in England and Wales -

by the Spring of 1990.


     Announcing publication of the report of the working party

into the national        membership     scheme,       Mr Moynihan stressed his
belief    that   the   scheme can and will            - break    the   link between

hooliganism and football.


      In a written Answer to a Parliamentary Question from John

 Carlisle MP (Luton North), Mr Moynihan said:


      "The report       of   the working           party which      I chaired    on a
 national membership scheme for football supporters is published

 today.    The working party was set up following the meeting on

♦
    July between the Prime Minister and the President of the Football
    League and the Chairman of the Football Association,                       to review
    the main principles of a national membership scheme for football.


           "The    working        party    included     representatives          of     the
    Government,     the police and the football authorities.                     All the
    members of the. working party have co-operated in preparing this
    report and it has been agreed between them.                   I pay full tribute
    to the co-operative approach which the football representatives
    on    the   working    party    have    adopted    throughout       many    hours    of
    discussions.


           "The report addresses the specific issue of when the scheme
    should be implemented.          It refers to the work that has to be done
    on the technology of the scheme and its installation at 92 League
    clubs.      Our target will be to achieve implementation throughout
    the Football        League by Spring 1990 - subject to Parliament's
    approval of our legislative proposals and the installation of
    appropriate technology.


           "There were 6,147 arrests at Football League matches last
    season and violent incidents have continued this season,                           both
    inside and outside grounds.             This cannot be allowed to continue.
    The national membership scheme offers the prospect of breaking
    the   link,    of    ending    the     role   of   football    as    a     focus    for
    hooliganism and violence.

BACKGROUND TO THE WORKING PARTY
1. The working party was set up following the meeting between the
Prime Minister and the President of the Football League and the
Chairman of the Football Association on 6 July 1988.      At that
meeting, the Prime Minister told the football authorities that
the Government believed that a national membership scheme to
control admission to football matches was necessary to counter
the continuing incidence of hooliganism associated with football.
The Prime Minister pressed the football authorities to establish
a scheme on a voluntary basis. The football authorities did not
believe that such a scheme could be introduced on a voluntary
basis.
2. The Government recognises that there has been considerable
progress on the anti-hooligan measures agreed between the
Government and the football authorities. The Government cannot,
however, accept that the level of disorder within grounds is
tolerable. The Government and the police remain concerned that at
many grounds, football matches continue to provide a focus for
aggressive behaviour and gestures. These in turn may produce a
hostile environment and create the risk of disorder. The
consequences are high levels of policing and increasingly
elaborate physical structures for crowd control and segregation.
3. The Government believes that a national membership scheme,
together with CCTV and other measures, can succeed in removing
the hooligan element from football matches and in breaking the
attachment of hooliganism to football. The Government sees the
national membership scheme as an essential element in a package
of measures which the Government is developing, alongside those
already taken by the football authorities,       to deal with
hooliganism associated with football.
4. Considerable police resources are devoted to football, backed
by restrictions on alcohol under the Sporting Events (Control of
Alcohol) Act 1985 and powers for the police and the Courts under
the Public Order Act 1986. The police will continue their efforts
to deal with criminal behaviour. The Government is considering
ways of preventing convicted football hooligans from attending
matches abroad. It has already issued advice to police and the
courts on the enforcement of the law on the misuse of alcohol and
on the need to ensure swift justice following incidents of
hooliganism.
5. The President of The Football League and the Chairman of The
Football Association, told the Prime Minister that they disputed
strongly the necessity for the scheme. They argued that over the
past season there had been very few incidents of crowd disorder
within football grounds; the main incidents of disorder occurred
away from grounds and were outside the control of the football
authorities. They said that individual clubs did, however, take
firm   action   against   supporters   who   were   arrested  for
football-related   offences.   The   football   authorities  were
unconvinced that the introduction of a national membership scheme


                                  1
would solve the problem of disorder which occurs away ftom
grounds and which is coupled with the increasing incidence of
serious disorder by young people in areas that are totally
unconnected with football.
6. The football authorities suggested at the meeting that the
introduction of a national identity card would provide a better
means of deterring hooliganism in the country as a whole than a
membership scheme confined to football. The view of the
Government representatives on the working party was however, that
the question of a national identity card was outside the working
party's terms of reference.
7. The football authorities said that they had co-operated fully
with the Government on the measures to curb hooliganism contained
in the agreement following meetings with Government Ministers in
1985 and 1986. The football authorities have taken wide-ranging
initiatives over the past two seasons to deal with the disorder
within football grounds. The main initiatives were the use of
closed circuit television (CCTV) at grounds, the introduction of
family areas and of voluntary membership schemes in home support
areas and the formation of local plans for dealing with crowd
control at matches in liaison with the local police. They
consider that these have been successful.          The continued
segregation of supporters both inside and outside the ground,
liaison with the police on kick-off times and other measures have
helped to reduce considerably the potential for disorder. The
football authorities consider that, on those few occasions where
crowd disorder has occurred, the Football Association has, after
the necessary inquiries, dealt severely with clubs who have been
adjudged not to have taken all reasonable precautions.
8. The football authorities are seriously concerned that a scheme
involving the checking of membership cards would create new
problems in handling the admission of spectators. They are also
concerned about the possible long term effects on the football
industry of the introduction of the scheme. Football, as a
leisure industry, relies heavily on the revenue generated by the
paying spectator and they fear that many casual supporters and
elderly supporters and family groups will be deterred by the
scheme from attending matches.

The working party
9. The Prime Minister said that the Government would bring
forward proposals for legislation to give statutory backing to
the national membership scheme. Having made their position clear,
the President of the Football League and the Chairman of the
Football Association recognised the Government's commitment to
the introduction of a national membership scheme and undertook to
co-operate with the Government in considering the details of the
scheme. It was agreed that a working party chaired by the
Minister for Sport would examine the details of the scheme.
10. The objectives of the working party were:

    i) to review the main principles of the scheme; and
   ii) to identify appropriate technology to implement the scheme
        for the start of the 1989-90 football season.

It met for the first time on Tuesday 26 July and on five further
occasions. Its meetings were attended by representatives of the
following bodies:

   Football Association
   Football League
   Association of Chief Police Officers
   Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency
   Home Office
   No 10 Policy Unit
   Department of the Environment.

11. The football authorities representatives have taken an active
part in the discussions of the working party and they have agreed
the contents of the report subject to the points of disagreement
noted. Given that the Government is committed to the early
introduction of legislation for a national membership scheme, the
working party has been working to a very tight timetable. This
has imposed considerable pressures on all members of the working
party and, taken together with the strict confidentiality of the
working   party's   discussions,  has   prevented   the   football
authorities from consulting the clubs and others, as they would
have wished. They reserve the right to comment further in the
light of their consultations. Subject to this, the report
represents the recommendations of the working party, to the
football authorities and the Government, on what the main
elements of an effective scheme might be;     the Government, the
police and the football authorities are not committed to accept
these recommendations.
12. The Prime Minister made clear at the meeting on 6 July that
funding for the scheme would be a matter for the football
authorities. The working party has, in consequence, not discussed
funding in detail, but the football authorities are concerned
about the financial implications of the imposition of the scheme.

CHAPTER Is SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS
1. This chapter provides a summary of the working party's
recommendations for the main elements of the national membership
scheme, as discussed in the report.

1.   GENERAL
     a) Admission of spectators to a designated football match
        will only be permitted if:
            - the spectator produces a valid membership card for
          checking at the point of entry to the ground; and
            - the ground on which the match is to be played is
          covered by a licence.
     b) The scheme will be a national one administered by a
         Football Membership Authority; information about all
        members will be held on a central computer.
     c) A member will be entitled to only one card which will
         indicate the club which he, or she, supports and qualify
        him, or her, to attend any designated match.
     d) The  scheme will    apply in England and Wales but
        consideration should be given to its extension to Scotland
        and Northern Ireland.
2.   MEMBERSHIP OF THE SCHEME                   (Chapter 2)
     a) An application should involve:
           a standard application form
           proof of identity
           proof of address
           a photograph.                        (paras 3-6)
        The football authorities disagree with the need       for a
        photograph.
     b) Membership cards should include:
           the member's name
            a photograph
            a membership number
           date of expiry
            the name of the club nominated
           the member's national football allegiance
        they should be readable electronically and valid for two
        or three seasons only.                  (paras 7-13)
        The football authorities consider   that membership should
        be valid for ten years.




                                 4
)
         c)   Exemptions from membership:
                  no general exemptions for paying British spectators;
                  limited temporary membership for accompanied foreign
                  nationals;
                  clubs to make special arrangements for guests,
                  hospitality boxes and groups such as parties of school
                  children, accompanied children in family enclosures
                  and disabled people in designated areas with special
                  access;
                  non-spectators should not be subject to the scheme.
                                                      (paras 14-21)
         d)   Criteria for withdrawing or withholding membership from
              hooligans should include:
                 mandatory criteria imposed by legislation linked to
                 conviction for football-related offences, involving
                 bans of two or five years;
                 discretionary criteria     operated by    the  Football
                 Membership Authority who will decide whether to impose
                 bans and for how long.               (paras 22-28)
              The football authorities consider that mandatory criteria
              should apply to convictions for all offences of violence
              against the person.
         e) Two new criminal offences should be created:
                for false application for membership;
                for gaining or attempting to gain entry to ground
                without a valid membership card.      (paras 29-30)
         f ) The football authorities consider there is a need for the
              two further criminal offences indicated in the body of the
              report. There should be a requirement for a member of the
              scheme to produce his/her membership card for inspection.
                                                      (paras 31-32)     *

    3.    DESIGNATED FOOTBALL MATCHES                 (Chapter 3)
         a)   The scheme should apply to all matches between League
              clubs' first teams.                     (para 2)
         b)   The scheme should not apply to matches between non-League
              teams.                                  (para 3)
         c)   Matches between League clubs and non-League clubs should
              be designated but the scheme should allow initially for
              admission of non-members;               (paras 4-6)
         d)   Special   procedures    for  matches   involving    foreign
              teams.                                  (para 7)
         e)   Admission   for    members   only   to    matches   between
              English/Welsh and Scottish/Northern Irish teams.
                                                       (paras 8-11)




                                        5
4.    RESPONSIBILITY FOR      THE   SCHEME;   the    Football Membership
Authority and the clubs                                (Chapter 4)
  a)    The FMA will be designated by the  Secretary of State; it
        will draw up a scheme in accordance with criteria imposed
        by legislation; the scheme will be subject to approval by
        Secretary of State.                    (paras 1-2)
  b)    FMA's responsibilities to include:
           supervise application process
           approve/reject applications
           maintain central register of all members
           draw up rules on withdrawal of membership
           make decisions and possibly hear appeals on withdrawal
           licensing grounds (if this responsibility is delegated
           by the Secretary of State).
                                (paras 3-6) and (paras 12-13)
   c)   Clubs' responsibilities to include:
             dealing with applications, maintaining records, supply
             of iriformation to central register
             installation and maintenance of approved machinery for
             checking membership cards
             adequate    arrangements   to   control   admission   of
             spectators and to deal with holders of rejected cards
             provision of sufficient trained staff to operate all
             aspects of scheme
             other requirements to ensure effective operation of the
             scheme.                               (paras 7-11)
   d)   The scheme should be monitored by a small part-time
        inspectorate employed by and responsible to the FMA or
        another agency (or the Secretary of State).
                                                (para 14)
   e) sanctions on clubs which fail             to    carry out their
      responsibilities should include:                (paras 17-27)
        i)       withdrawal of the licence to admit spectators to
                 the ground for persistent or serious failure or in
                 an emergency following a serious disturbance;
        ii)      fines for minor breaches;
        iii)     criminal liability for admitting spectatorsto a
                 designated match at a non licensed ground.
   f) The FMA and the clubs will need to register with the Data
      Protection Registrar.                  (paras 28-31)
5. NOTIFICATION OF OFFENCES                           (Chapter 5)
In operating discretionary criteria to disqualify from membership
those whose behaviour is unacceptable, clubs will need to receive
information from the police about those who are being ejected



                                    6
'))
      from the ground, and about those who are being arrested for an
      alleged criminal offence committed on the club's premises (para
      li-
      For the mandatory criteria imposed by the legislation to work
      properly, the FMA must receive information about convictions for
      football related offences. The working party recommends:

         1. the question of whether an offence is football related
         should be determined by the courts;
         2. the Government should initiate discussions with the courts,
         the Crown Prosecution Service and the police to determine the
         most efficient means of notifying convictions to the FMA
         (paras 5-12).

      The Government should determine with the police and the football
      authorities suitable arrangements for ensuring that troublemakers
      are not admitted to the scheme at the outset. An early Government
      announcement should make it clear that past behaviour will be
      taken into account in deciding who shall be disqualified from
      membership (paras 13-16).

      6. TECHNOLOGY AND TIMING                       (Chapter 6)
         a) The Government representatives and the police are satisfied
            that the technology is available to implement the scheme.
            The main elements should be:
               i)   a computerised central register
              ii)   a computer at each club
             iii)   card readers at turnstiles, to be portable       if
                    possible.
                                                    (paras 1-11)
         b) Membership cards are to be readable electronically. The
            options, on which the working party has not drawn
            conclusions, are:
               i)   barcode cards
              ii)   magnetic stripe cards
             iii)   Smartcards.
                                                     (paras 12-17)
         c) The new technology may also provide opportunities for the
            clubs to improve their own administrative procedures and
            for marketing.                          (paras 18-19)
             The football authorities are not committed to these views
             and the working party agreed that, until the consultants
             report and the views of the commercial advisers had been
             received, these must remain matters of judgement.




                                      7
CHAPTER 2: MEMBERSHIP OF THE SCHEME
1. The central feature of the national membership scheme will be
that spectators will not be admitted to designated football
matches unless they can produce a valid membership card, properly
issued to them. Cards will be checked at the point of entry to
the ground. No member will be able to hold more than one card,
but a valid membership card will entitle the holder to attend any
designated match.
2. The working party discussed whether people should become
members of the national scheme directly or via membership of a
Football League club. Direct membership of the national scheme
would provide economies of scale and mitigate the burden of the
scheme on clubs; vetting of applications and decisions about
withdrawal of membership could be handled centrally. On the other
hand, the more closely individual clubs are involved in running
the scheme, the more responsibility they may be expected to take
for its success. On balance the working party accepted the strong
recommendation of the representatives of the football authorities
that members should join the national scheme directly, but
indicate which club they support (or the club with which they
wish to be associated). Individual clubs may wish to develop a
direct role in exploiting the commercial opportunities of the
scheme.

Applications for membership
3. Applications for membership should be made on a standard
application form drawn up by the body responsible for running the
scheme (hereafter called the Football Membership Authority, FMA).
Application forms would be issued, and received on completion, by
Football League clubs and other agencies who would pass them on
for vetting to the FMA (see chapter 4). The form would seek the
following information:

   name
   address
   date of birth
   date of application
   sex
   club which applicant nominates
   national football allegiance.

4. The working party recognised that a balance had to be struck
between requiring essential information and asking so many
questions   that  people were reluctant      to complete    their
application forms. The view of the Government representatives and
the police was that the applicant should also be asked to confirm
that he was not presently a member of the scheme, and to provide
details of any previous withdrawal of membership and of any
previous conviction or prosecution pending for an offence
committed at or on the way to or from a football match. This
would help to deter undesirable applicants and to facilitate the
vetting process. The football authorities disagreed and felt that
those additional questions would be a disincentive for people to
join the scheme.
5. The applicant would be required to show proof of identity and
proof of address. Young people unable to produce proof of
identity or address could have their applications signed by an
adult who could produce such proof. The view of the Government
representatives and the police,       with which the football
authorities disagree, is that applicants should also provide two
photographs, one for the card, one for the FMA's records. Clubs
might wish to make arrangements for taking the photographs of
applicants; it would, in any case, be necessary for them, or the
other agencies to which application was made, to check that the
photographs of personal applicants were of the person concerned.
6. The working party took the view that, provided that a
sufficient number of outlets were available for the application
process, postal applications would be unnecessary and should not
be allowed except in the case of applicants from Scotland and
Northern Ireland (if not part of the scheme) and foreign
countries (for whom photographs would need to be countersigned by
a responsible person). Membership cards should be sent to the
applicant at the address given as an additional test of the
address. The football authorities consider that the availability
of temporary membership cards to cover delays in processing
applications is essential.

Membership cards
7. The technology for membership cards is discussed in chapter 6;
some options would make it possible for the cards to carry more
information than others. The minimum information required to be
carried on the card for the scheme to be effective would be the
name of the member, photograph (see paragraph 9), the date to
which the card is valid, the name (or logo), of the club the
member nominates and national football allegiance; the card must
also be     readable electronically and be numbered. The police
considered that it would be a useful additional safeguard if the
card were capable of bearing the member's signature.
8. The working party recognised that no system of membership
cards was impervious to forgery and fraud. We were advised that,
without causing unacceptable delays at entry turnstiles, it was
not currently possible to verify electronically fingerprints or
other unique personal characteristics. The conclusion of the
working party was that a combination of both a photograph and
electronic readability offered the best means of restricting
admission to holders of valid cards.    If the card did not meet
both of these requirements, the opportunities for abuse would be
unacceptably wide.
9. The football representatives did not accept the necessity for
the card   to carry a photograph of the applicant. They were very
doubtful    of   its  value   otherthan     to   provide  initial


                                9
identification on detention by the police. The photograph would*
add to the complexity of applying for a card. It was however the
view of the Government representatives and the police, that a
photograph was essential to the integrity of the whole scheme
both to deter fraud and impersonation and to aid identification
if the holder were involved in disorder. The football authorities
were firmly of the view in any event that photographs should not
be required for children under 16. The view of the Government
representatives and the police was that photographs should be
required at least for children of 14 and over.
10. The working party discussed what the most appropriate life
span of the membership card might be. If cards were valid for one
season only, the number of lost, stolen and damaged cards in
circulation could be kept to a minimum. But a requirement to
renew cards every year might prove a major deterrent to potential
members (and reduce attendances); it would also add to the
burdens of the FMA and the clubs. At the same time a system of
life membership would entail problems about changes of address
and physical appearance and would, unless the cards were replaced
regularly, build up an unacceptable level of invalid cards in
circulation. An accumulating database of invalid cards would be
likely to rule out the possibility of using portable card readers
(see Chapter 6).
11. The football authorities felt that membership should be valid
for the same length of time as a British Passport, ie ten years.
The cards could be reissued without reapplication at intervals
say of two or three years thus renewing the database. The view of
the Government representatives was that       membership without
reapplication should be valid for a period of two or three years.
12. When the member arrives at the ground, he will hand his card
to the turnstile operator who will run it through the electronic
reader which will check its validity. There would be unacceptable
delays if the turnstile operators were asked to check photographs
as well. The football representatives were particularly concerned
about the delays that might result when cards are rejected by the
electronic readers. It is essential that there is a means of
identifying invalid and damaged cards separately at the
turnstile. In the case of an invalid- card, it would be for the
police to investigate whether a criminal offence had been
committed. The football authorities reserved their right to
comment further on this point after seeking advice from their
consultants. The working party recognised that the arrangements
for dealing with rejected cards would need very careful
attention.
13. Members should be asked to inform the FMA of changes of
address and of other relevant information, and if their card is
lost or stolen.     Information about lost or stolen cards is
important to the security of the scheme but there is no obvious
way to compel members whose cards are lost or stolen to inform
the FMA. In the view of the Government representatives and the
police the risk that people may fail to report lost or stolen
cards makes it particularly important that cards should include



                               10
»:
     photographs. It was accepted that clubs should be able to issue
     temporary membership cards, valid for one match only, to members
     whose cards were lost, stolen, or damaged.
     Exemptions from membership
     14. The working party believes that consideration of possible
     exemptions from membership should start from the premise that
     exemptions should be allowed only if there is a very good reason
     for them and if arrangements can be made to ensure that they do
     not create an unacceptable loophole in the scheme. For some
     groups, exemption is not the obvious answer which it might
     appear. A general exemption might be proposed, for example, for
     children under a certain age, disabled people, and Old Age
     Pensioners, on the grounds that they were unlikely to cause
     trouble. But these are potentially large groups and exemptions
     would themselves impose an additional layer of checking, for
     example to ensure that those concerned were the age they said
     they were. The Government representatives and the police consider
     it is preferable to require membership of all spectators (subject
     to the following paragraphs) and to leave it to the FMA and clubs
     to issue some (or indeed all) membership cards free, or at a
     reduced rate, if they wish.

     Accompanied children in designated family areas
     15. The working party considered, in the interest of encouraging
     families to attend matches, that children under 16, accompanied
     by an adult member of the scheme, could be exempt from the scheme
     provided that:-

        (i)    they view the match from a designated family enclosure;
               and
        (ii)   there is direct access to that family enclosure, not
               allowing transfer to other areas of the ground.

     Disabled people in designated areas
     16. The working party considered that a similar exemption could
     apply to those disabled people for whom clubs provide a
     designated area and special access.

     Foreign Visitors
     17. Exemption may also be justified for foreign visitors
     attending a single domestic match, at the discretion of the club.
     Clubs could maintain a small stock of temporary membership cards,
     valid for one match only, which could be issued to foreign
     visitors, against proof of their identity (passport or national
     identity card). The clubs should be responsible for their
     behaviour.   The clubs should also maintain records of those to
     whom the temporary cards are issued, to ensure that this


                                    11
arrangement is not abused by foreign nationals who attend matches
regularly (and who could apply in the normal way for a standard
membership card).
18. The working party recommends that similar privileges should
not be extended to Scottish or Northern Irish visitors. Foreign
visitors may reasonably be asked to show their passport or
national identity card as proof of identity (since they will have
needed them to enter the country). This is not the case for UK
nationals and it is more reasonable to ask an occasional visitor
from Scotland or Northern Ireland to obtain a membership card of
his or her own than to ask a foreign national, who may be
unfamiliar with our language and institutions, to do so. Wide
availability of temporary cards to UK nationals would lay the
scheme open to abuse.    The arrangements for matches involving
foreign teams are discussed in chapter 3.

Other guests
19. The working party considered that there was a good case for
allowing the exemption of certain spectators who do not pay at
the turnstiles such as guests of the clubs' directors, sponsors
and their guests and those using hospitality boxes. On the one
hand, they are present at grounds to watch matches and it may be
argued that they should be expected to become members of the
scheme in the same way as other spectators. On the other hand,
the risk of hooliganism among these groups is negligible and
hospitality boxes and sponsorship are an important source of
revenue to many clubs. Furthermore, special additional procedures
would be required to check membership cards of people who do not
usually go through the turnstiles. On balance, the working
party's view is that admission of guests should not depend on
membership of the scheme.
20. For other categories of club or sponsor's guests not
physically segregated from the rest of the spectators it should
be possible for the clubs to make appropriate arrangements in
advance for temporary match day membership, as for foreign
visitors. In this and all cases where satisfactory arrangements
can be agreed the club, and the sponsor in the case of sponsor's
guests, should take responsibility for the behaviour of those who
benefit from them. Temporary membership cards should be produced
in such a way as to ensure that they could be used only once.
21. Another group for which exemption could be claimed is that of
organised school parties or parties of children from another
club. The working party would not wish the scheme to preclude
such groups from attending football matches. The working party is
confident that the clubs will be able to devise arrangements to
accommodate them. The possibilities would include temporary
membership and a special entrance and enclosure within the
ground. The requirements of the national membership scheme will
not apply to those attending football grounds in a professional
capacity: the police; ambulance men; caterers; journalists etc.




                               12
Criteria for withdrawing or withholding membership
22. The main objective of the national membership scheme is to
deny entry to those who may be expected to cause trouble, in
order further to improve standards of behaviour at football
matches.  The scheme must therefore provide criteria for
withdrawing or withholding membership both from those who have
been convicted of relevant criminal offences and from those whose
behaviour is, in other ways, unacceptable.     The working party
considers that:

   (1) the withdrawal or withholding of membership from those
   convicted of relevant criminal offences should be subject to
   mandatory rules, imposed by legislation;
   (2) the FMA should have discretion to exclude people (whether
   convicted of criminal offences or not) from the scheme for
   behaviour which it finds unacceptable, (this discretion should
   be recognised in the legislation which establishes the scheme
   and should be exercised in accordance with rules drawn up by
   the FMA and approved by the Secretary of State);
   (3) nothing in (1) or (2) should remove from the individual
   football club its present right to refuse entry to its
   premises.

Mandatory criteria
23. The purpose of establishing mandatory     criteria for banning
those convicted of criminal offences, is to   ensure that potential
offenders are aware of the consequences        for their continued
membership of the scheme. The working party   recommends a two-tier
tariff for convicted offenders:

         i)    if the offender receives a custodial sentence -
               withdrawal of membership for five years;
        ii)    if any other sentence, including a community
               service order or a fine, is imposed - withdrawal
               of membership for two years.

These criteria would be established in legislation and the
withdrawal of membership would take effect on the FMA receiving
notification of a conviction from the police or the courts. The
standard two tier tariff suggested above would be broadly
consistent with the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. It
would be open to the FMA to impose additional bans on these
offenders at their own discretion (see paragraph 26 below).
24. The working party considers that these mandatory rules should
operate only in respect of a category of offences similar to that
listed as football-related in the Public Order Act 1986 for the
purposes of exclusion orders (see Annex), (provided that the
court declares that the offence itself is a football-related one
- see chapter 5), and of the new offences recommended below. It
may be argued, and the football authorities were strongly of this
view, that conviction for any crime of violence should lead to
withdrawal of membership. It would however be difficult to draw a
clear and reasonable line; violence in the family, for example,
may be no guide to a person's behaviour at a football match. A
conviction for violence at other sporting events would be
obviously relevant and again the football authorities considered
that this should be taken into account.
25. It was with reluctance that the Government representatives
and the police took the view that the practical difficulties of
defining such offences and of arranging for notification
precluded extending the mandatory criteria to them. The wider the
range of offences considered relevant, the more difficult it
would be to arrange the disclosure of information to the FMA (see
chapter 5 below), and to justify such disclosure. The football
authorities maintained their strong view that for the scheme to
operate effectively the mandatory criteria must extend to
convictions for any violent crimes.

Non-mandatory criteria
26. It is essential that the FMA should have discretion to impose
bans of its own, both in the form of additional bans in respect
of criminal offences on top of those required by the legislation
and in respect of other forms of unacceptable behaviour. The FMA
might withdraw membership, other than as a result of conviction
for a criminal offence, in the event of behaviour leading to
arrest or ejection from the ground (whether or not the person
concerned was subsequently charged); and other forms of offensive
behaviour which can produce an unacceptably hostile environment
inside grounds.
27. The working party envisages that the non-mandatory criteria
for withdrawal of membership to be operated by the FMA should be
the subject of rules, concerning both the abuses for which bans
will be imposed and their length, approved by the Secretary of
State. The working party recommends that the minimum period for
which membership should be withdrawn, at the FMA's discretion,
should be twelve months. Within this category of "discretionary"
rules, some cases (eg ejection from a ground) may give rise to
pre-determined automatic bans, effective from the date the FMA is
notified of the incident. In other cases the clubs would make a
report to the FMA, who would then decide the appropriate ban, in
the light of the circumstances. The FMA may wish to consider
whether people should have the right to appeal against withdrawal
of membership (see chapter 4 below). Just as there should be
mandatory and discretionary rules for withdrawing membership so
there will have to be parallel rules for withholding membership
from applicants.
28. The football authorities felt strongly that the police should
forward to them information on arrests for a football related
offence wherever it took place. However, the view of the


                               14
Government representatives and the police was that the FMA's
discretion to withdraw membership in cases of arrest would have
to be restricted to incidents inside or just outside football
grounds. It might be difficult for the FMA to impose a
discretionary ban on a member of the scheme who was arrested away
from the ground, in travelling to or from a match for example,
because the FMA would have no direct evidence on which to base
its decision. The FMA might find it difficult to justify imposing
the ban in advance of conviction, when an alleged offence had not
occurred on a football club's premises.
New criminal offences
29.   The  working party  recommends that  the  legislation
implementing the scheme should establish two new criminal
offences in respect of membership of the scheme, along the
following lines:

   a)   it should be an offence knowingly or recklessly to provide
        false information in applying for a membership card;
   b)   it should be an offence for anyone to attempt to obtain
        entry or to gain entry to a ground (or to be present in a
        ground) for a designated football match without being in
        possession of his or her valid membership card, except in
        accordance with the scheme.

30. The case for the second of these offences is perhaps less
obvious than the first.   It would be possible to rely on clubs
simply turning people away if they did not have a valid card or
if they tried to use someone else's card. But the working party
believes that it is essential to minimize the danger that large
numbers of people may attempt to gain entry without valid cards.
The establishment of a new criminal offence should deter people
from trying to cheat the system. The police may require specific
powers, for example powers to arrest in these cases, for
effective enforcement.
31. The football authorities believed      that   two   further   new
criminal offences were also needed

        it should be an offence for anyone to fail to produce his
        or her card on demand to a police officer or authorised
        officer if inside the ground or to a police officer if
        outside the ground, or upon arrest for a football-related
        offence;
        it should be an offence for anyone to fail to surrender
        his or her card when ordered to do so, by a police
        officer, in or around the ground.
32. The working party concluded that there should be a legal
requirement for a member to produce a membership card for
inspection when asked to do so by a club official or a police
officer. This should be restricted to persons on, or seeking
entry to, club premises for the purpose of attending a designated
match. The Government representatives and the police were not
convinced that this needed the support of a criminal sanction.
Failure to produce a card on request, for example, could give
rise to suspicion that the offence in paragraph 29 (b) above had
been committed. The terms of the scheme could additionally
declare that the card remained the property of the FMA (or the
clubs), and that failure to produce it on request would render
the person, if a member, liable to withdrawal of membership. The
Government representatives and the police were similarly
unconvinced that it would be right to recommend a criminal
offence for failure to surrender a card. The football authorities
maintained their strong view that these two offences were needed.

ice        CHAPTER 3; DESIGNATED FOOTBALL MATCHES
ing
ted        1* The Secretary of State will designate those football matches
not        to which admission will be subject to the requirements of the
an.        national membership scheme.    The working party recommends that
ive        designation should initially be confined to matches involving
had        League teams. The Secretary of State will have the power to add
Lly        further categories of matches (and other sporting events) to his
the        initial list should it prove necessary to do so.
3er
The        2. Designation should apply to any match between Football League
rly        clubs' first teams, wherever it is played, in England and Wales,
ial        to include:
ies
2d.
                     i)   Football League matches;
                    ii)   Cup competitions confined toLeague clubs;
                   iii)   FA Cup or Welsh FA Cup matches      between League
                           clubs;
                    iv)   the FA Charity Shield match;
                    v)    "friendly matches".

           For these matches, admission should be restricted to holders of
           membership cards (subject to chapter 2 above). The working party
           took the view that there was no present case for designating
           matches between reserve teams or youth teams representing League
           clubs.
                                                                                   t
           3. The working party proposes that the Secretary of State should
           not designate, initially, matches in the GM Vauxhall Conference,
           nor other matches between non-League, amateur or junior teams.
           There are two categories of match where the question of
           designation is less easy to resolve:

              a)    matches between a League club and a non-League club, in
                   the FA Cup or the Welsh FA Cup, or a friendly match; and
              b)    matches between an English or Welsh League        club,   or
                   national team, and a team from another country.

           4. a)    Matches between League and non-League teams. For such
                   matches played at League grounds, there are two options:

                     i)   restrict admission to holders of membership cards.
                          This would almost certainly mean that supporters
                          of the non-League team would be admitted only if
                          they had joined the national membership scheme as


                                           17
                                                                    *
               supporters of a League club (as many of them may).       tak
               It might be possible to establish a special              r:aY
               category of membership,     within the national          Pas
               membership scheme, for supporters of non-League
               clubs but the working party did not feel that the        0•
               number of matches involved would justify doing           See
               so.                                                      adr
                                                                        scl
        ii)    Allow non-members access to the ground for such          su]
               matches.   Supporters of the League team would be        cli
               encouraged to use turnstiles at which their cards        ma
               would be checked according to national membership        no
               scheme procedures but supporters of the non-League        En
               team would not have to produce membership cards at        re
               the turnstiles allocated to them (though they             be
               would have to buy tickets, in advance, from their
               own clubs).                                               9.
                                                                         is
                                                                         tt
5. The working party felt that option (i) represented a                  c]
disproportionate burden on non-League clubs and their supporters,        ac
given the small number of matches for which the procedure would          tc
be relevant and the lack of trouble in the past at such matches.         tl
Option (i) might also pose problems of its own - for example, if         d<
supporters of the non-league team had joined the scheme as                i
supporters of the League club who were the opponents on the day.          m
The working party recommends, therefore, that option (ii) should
be followed, at least initially. The matches concerned would              1
nonetheless be designated, so that members will be required to            s
produce membership cards on request and risk losing them if they          s
misbehave (the scheme would allow for an appropriate variation).          S
If there were to be trouble at such matches, they could rapidly           e
be brought fully within thescheme.                                        v
                                                                          c
6. For matches between non-League and League teams played at
non-League grounds, only the second option would in practice be            2
available, if the electronic readers used to check membership              1
cards at League grounds were not portable (see chapter 6), since           1
visual checks of all cards would cause too many delays. We would
in any event recommend the second option.
7. b ) Matches between English/Welsh teams and teams from another
country. For matches involving non-UK opponents, whether at club
or international level, all home supporters would be admitted
only on production of their membership cards.   There would have
to be special arrangements for foreign supporters. It is not
reasonable to require nationals supporting their team for one
match in this country to become members of the national
membership scheme; nor can they be excluded altogether.    On the
other hand, some control is essential.        The working party
proposes, therefore, that supporters of foreign teams should be
admitted only through specified turnstiles, on production of a
passport or national identity card. The club will need to take
reasonable precautions to ensure ticket and passport or identity
card are in order. The working party recognised that, having




                               18
r).   taken such precautions, a club could not be held responsible if
.al   say a supporter were to gain entry by producing a forged
lal   passport,
fue
;he   8. For matches between English/Welsh teams and teams from
.ng   Scotland or Northern Ireland, the working party proposes that
      admission should be confined to holders of national membership
      scheme membership cards.      Many Scottish and Northern Irish
ich   supporters will be members because they support Football League
 be   clubs anyway. For those who are not, and who wish to attend
‘ds   matches involving their teams in England or Wales, there will be
tip   no alternative but to join the scheme, as a supporter of an
fue   English or Welsh club. The working party considers that such a
 at   requirement is essential in order to avoid disruption at matches
iey   between English or Welsh teams and other British teams,
 ir
      9.             The working party does not feel, however, that this ap
      is an entirely satisfactory one. In particular, we are concerned
      that some Scottish or Northern Irish football supporters might
 a    claim, in joining the scheme, to be supporters of an English club
s,    against whom their own local team plays. It would be impossible
Id    to segregate supporters effectively in such circumstances; and
s.    the threat of withdrawal of membership would not be sufficient to
if    deter potential Scottish or Northern Irish troublemakers because
as    it would have no implications for their future attendance at
y*    matches in their own country,
id
Id    10. In the light of this difficulty, and also because there is
to    some danger that hooligans banned from the national membership
ey    scheme in England and Wales will begin to attend matches in
)•    Scotland or Northern Ireland (there is already considerable
ly    evidence of fans from England attending major Scottish games) the
      working party recommends that further consideration should be
      given to extending the scheme to those countries.
at
be    11. Chapter 2 proposes that applicants should be asked to state
ip    their national football allegiance in applying for membership and
ce    that membership cards should indicate that allegiance. Cards can
Id    therefore help achieve segregation at international matches
      staged in England and Wales between the four home countries.

CHAPTER 4; RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SCHEME; THE FOOTBALL MEMBERSHIP
AUTHORITY AND THE CLUBS                                             <
1. The Secretary of State will designate a Football Membership
Authority to draw up the national membership scheme,          in
accordance with criteria laid down by Parliament.   The FMA will
be responsible for submitting the scheme to the Secretary of
State for approval and for ensuring that it is in place on time.
The scheme will be a national one governed by national rules but
the FMA will delegate much of the day-to-day responsibility for
operating the scheme to the clubs. This chapter discusses the
respective responsibilities of the FMA and the clubs and the
arrangements for monitoring their performance.
2. The Football Association and the Football League have decided
that they will wish to share responsibility and establish a joint
body which they would recommend to the Secretary of State for
designation as the Football Membership Authority. The working
party noted that the football authorities had, at this early
stage, appointed consultants to advise on all matters related to
the scheme.

Responsibilities of the FMA
3. The FMA will produce the standard form for applications for
membership (as described in chapter 2). It will determine the
arrangements by which applications are to be made - whether the
clubs are to be the only places to which applications may be
made, or whether post offices or even banks might be invited to
distribute and receive forms. Wherever applications are made,
they will be passed to the FMA for decision. It will vet
applications for membership against its records to ensure that
no-one has membership of more than one club and that the
applicant is not under a ban. It will need to inform the police
about false applications. It may receive information about
misbehaviour by members from sources other than the League clubs
-for example from the police and the courts (see chapter 5), from
non-League clubs, from Wembley, and from international sources.
It will decide whether applicants are to be accepted and whether
membership is to be withdrawn in cases which do not involve a
criminal conviction (see chapter 2).

Central register of members
4. The FMA will maintain a central register of all members of the
scheme, of those "blacklisted" from membership and of cards which
have become invalid for other reasons.        The clubs will be
required to supply updated     recommendations for withdrawal of
membership, and (since some people might prefer to tell the club
rather than the FMA) information on cancelled membership and lost
and stolen cards to the central register. The FMA will inform
clubs of new members who have nominated them and also supply
up-to-date details of invalid, lost or stolen cards. Thus, each


                               20
      club should have, for every match, details of members who are its
      supporters and an up-to-date list of all cards that have been
      invalidated before their expiry. The FMA will need to take a view
      on the frequency of the exchange of information between itself
      and the clubs.
 -P
 .n
 -1   Withdrawal of membership and appeals
 J.   5. The FMA will make decisions about withdrawal of membership on
 it   the criteria discussed in chapter 2. It will need to draw up
       rules, in consultation with the clubs, on the circumstances in
ie    which a ban is to be automatic (eg in the case of ejection from
ie    the ground) and for how long, and on the other cases in which it
       will consider recommendations for banning from clubs. These rules
       will also need to deal with the possibility of extending the
id    mandatory bans applied in the case of convictions, where the FMA
it    and the clubs consider that an offence is serious enough to
       warrant an extended ban. These rules on withdrawal of membership
ig    will be an integral part of the scheme when it is submitted for
-Y    approval to the Secretary of State.
:o
      6. In all cases where membership is withdrawn by the FMA for
      periods other than mandatory periods the FMA may wish to consider
      whether it should operate a procedure for appeals.

)r    Responsibilities of the clubs
le
ie    7. Football clubs would have day-to-day responsibilities for many
)e    aspects of the scheme. They would, in most cases, hold the
:°    licence to admit spectators to their grounds but licences will
if    relate to grounds rather than clubs, since a ground has a
it    physical existence which a club does not. The licence for the
*t    ground would,    however,   depend on the club meeting its
ie    responsibilities under the legislation and under the scheme.
:e
it    8, Clubs' responsibilities      under   the   scheme   may   include   the

9. The working party considered the case for requiring clubs to                        UI
take other anti-hooliganism measures, in addition to those listed                      tl
above, as a condition of the ground licence.    The availability of                    nl
CCTV, effective arrangements for segregating   rival supporters and                    c<
adequate stewarding have all been essential    to the success of a                      a
package of anti-hooligan measures. On the other hand, it will                           °
also be essential to avoid an overlapbetween the requirements of
a certificate issued under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975                          1
and a licence related to the national membership scheme; if the                           s
two were to overlap, clubs could find themselves facing                                   ^

10. The case for including a requirement on the availability of                              n
CCTV in the licence conditions may be a particularly strong one,                             ^
since it does not fall within the Safety at Sports Grounds Act                               v
and is an essential tool in crowd control and the identification                             £
of troublemakers. Subject to that point, the working party took                              1
the view that, at least initially, the responsibilities of the
clubs in respect of the scheme should be confined to those


                                 22
         (©
their         spelled out in paragraph 8 above. The Secretary of State should
ivalid        have the power to add       further conditions to a licence,   on
  from        detailed arrangements for segregation, for example, if it becomes
              clear that it would be helpful to do so.
              11. The working party noted that a number of clubs had expressed
              concern about the implications that the scheme would have for
ad to         their arrangements for handling crowds, for example, in dealing
              with people who support neither home nor away clubs or in opening
              the gates before the end of a match to allow people to leave (and
 s on         as a consequence allowing others to enter). Given the variety of
              arrangements adopted at different football grounds, issues of
              this kind would need to be resolved by individual clubs in
              consultation with the local police and the FMA. There is,
              however, no reason why the existence of membership cards should
ry to         pre-determine a club's     approach to supporters or change   its
ssion         existing segregation arrangements; cards could, moreover, help
d to          clubs in implementing their present segregation arrangements. The
              membership scheme will not prevent clubs from allowing people to
              leave matches before the end but, in doing so, they will have to
  the         take reasonable precautions, consistent with the need for safety,
              to preclude the admission of people without membership cards.
 with
              Monitoring the scheme

  (as         12. The working party believes that the scheme should operate, as
   of         far as possible, on the basis of co-operation between the clubs
              and the FMA. There will, however, have to be arrangements for
              monitoring the clubs' performance and for a system of sanctions
              to be applied in the event of failure to meet their
              responsibilities. As to who should perform this role, it may be
meet          argued that if the FMA is to be responsible for the scheme as a
              whole, it should act as licensing authority, and have full
              responsibility for monitoring the clubs' performance and for
              taking action against those who do not carry out their duties
s to          under the scheme. On the other hand, there may be advantage for
sted          the Secretary of State to be the licensing authority, to act as
y of          an independent arbiter of the clubs' performance and to take
 and          corrective action in certain circumstances.         The  football
of a          authorities were strongly of the view that the latter was the
will          appropriate course.
s of
1975          13. One way in which the FMA and the Secretary of State might
 the          share responsibility would be for the Secretary of State to
cing          delegate the licensing function to the FMA, within a framework
ould          which he would approve. He would retain a reserve power to direct
ship          the authority to take action if he considered it essential, in
              the event of a serious disorder or if he had reason to believe
              that a ground should lose its licence. The Secretary of State
Y of          might also require the FMA to make annual reports to him about
one,          its actions as licensing authority but, for the most part, he
 Act          would not seek to intervene. The working party did not reach
tion          agreement on this issue and the phrase "licensing authority" is
took          used throughout this chapter.

14. The licensing authority would set up a small part-time
inspectorate to monitor the introduction and operation of the
scheme and to advise on whether a ground should receive a licence
in the first place and when appropriate on whether it should
subsequently be withdrawn. The inspectorate would need powers to
inspect and warn clubs about any failings in their operation of
the scheme. The working party would expect the inspectorate to be
drawn largely from ex-police officers or others with relevant
experience.
15. The FMA will itself be under a statutory duty to operate the
scheme satisfactorily. In case it fails to do so, the Secretary
of State will need a power to terminate the scheme, so that he
may designate another body to take on the job. The working party
proposes that the Secretary of State should give at least six
months notice of termination and that this notice should expire
only on 1 May in any year (to give time for a new authority to
prepare for the following season).
16. Given the power of the Secretary of State to terminate the
scheme, the working party does not consider it necessary to
create any specific new sanctions to which the FMA should be
liable in respect of its duties in relation to the scheme; but it
will in any case be liable to action for breach of statutory duty
or to mandamus, if it fails toimpose sanctions on clubs        as
required by the scheme, or to carry out itsother duties
effectively.

Sanctions on clubs
17. The licensing authority will need to be satisfied that a club
is both capable and ready to carry out its responsibilities under
the scheme before a licence is issued for the ground. In the case
of a non-League club ground that is to be licensed, such as
Wembley, the licensing authority will need to be satisfied that
all the ground arrangements are satisfactory. The licensing
authority should have discretion to attach conditions to the
grant of a licence and, once issued, the power to suspend, vary,
or revoke a licence if it appears that a club's failure to carry
out its responsibilities under the scheme is of sufficient
significance to put the effectiveness of the scheme at risk,
either at the club itself or nationally.
18. The suspension of a licence may be necessary in the event of
persistent or serious default. Thus, a persistent failure to deal
with offenders promptly or to maintain the scheme’s machinery
would be grounds for suspension; so, too, would a serious case of
under staffing at a match. The licensing authority would need to
warn a club before suspending a ground licence and give it time
to put right the fault or to make representations as to why the
licence should not be suspended. The licensing authority would
also need a power to suspend the licence without notice in an
emergency, subject to a right for the club to apply for the
suspension to be lifted as soon as possible thereafter.

-time   19. The licensing authority might use its power to vary licences
E the   either for individual grounds or for all, for example to add
cence   requirements about segregation. It might also be necessary to
hould   vary a licence in the case of a ground used by two clubs.   If a
rs to   licence is initially granted in respect of both clubs and one of
on of   them fails to manage its membership arrangements properly, the
to be   licensing authority might vary the licence so as to suspend the
evant   use of the ground by the offending club, but to allow the other
        to continue.
e the   20. The power to revoke a licence completely, rather than suspend
etary   it until a club's failings are put right, may be needed if a
at he   ground is closed or a club goes into liquidation. A club which
party   is relegated from the League may wish to have its licence
: six   revoked. Following revocation, a licence would only be restored
xpire   to a ground if the licensing authority was satisfied that the
ty to   requirements of the scheme were to be met.
        21. The effect of suspending a club's licence would be to deny it
i the   the right to admit spectators to its matches and it would,
y to    therefore, be a financial penalty. Suspension of a licence would
d be    not, however, prevent clubs from playing home matches, (and
at it   fulfilling their obligations to the League etc), though they
 duty   would have to do so behind closed doors. The football authorities
s as    felt that major sanctions of this sort must be for the Secretary
aties   of State.

        Financial penalties
        22. The working party envisages that the FMA should draw up a
 club   structure of financial penalties which it would impose upon clubs
inder   for minor breaches of the scheme.       Thus, a club which was
 case   regularly a day or two late in supplying information to the FMA
h as    or was negligent in the content of the information it supplied
 that   would not commit an offence serious enough to warrant the
ising   suspension of its ground licence but would be liable to a fine
  the   imposed by the responsible body.     The structure of penalties
rary,   would be approved by the Secretary of State as part of the
:arry   scheme.

 nery   admitting spectators to a designated match on a non-licensed
 e of   ground. There would have to be appropriate penalties for such an
-d to   offence. Under parallel provisions of the Safety at Sports

Misbehaviour by a club's supporters

24. The working party does not believe that the question of
withdrawing a ground licence should automatically arise as a
direct result of the behaviour of a club's supporters, at either
home or away matches. The club's responsibilities are for
maintaining membership records, dealing with offenders, making
adequate match arrangements and employing adequate staff. If
those responsibilities are all fulfilled satisfactorily, and
supporters misbehave, it is not appropriate to penalise the club
but rather to identify and punish the supporters concerned. The
Government representatives and the police believe that the effect
of the national membership scheme will be to make identification
easier and punishment more effective.
25. The working party has also considered whether it might be
appropriate for the FMA (or the Secretary of State) to have the
power to suspend the membership of all or some of the members of
the scheme who were one club's supporters, for example if there
were serious disorder amongst those supporters. A sanction of
this kind would, however, be indiscriminate in its effects, and
would inevitably penalise far more innocent than guilty people.
The working party does not therefore consider that such a
sanction is appropriate.

Exemptions for clubs
26. The working party does not propose a specific power for the
FMA or the Secretary of State to exempt any club from the
requirements of the scheme. If the scheme is to achieve and
maintain credibility, it must apply equally to all.   All clubs
will have    to satisfy the licensing authority that they are
capable of operating the scheme satisfactorily before they are
granted a licence.     If they are not ready by the date     of
implementation, they will not be able to admit spectators after
that date.
27. The scheme should, however, allow for break-downs of
machinery and other short-term emergencies beyond     the club's
control. In such cases, it should be open to the local police in
consultation with the club to decide that, in the interests of
public safety, a match should go ahead without       the normal
arrangements for checking membership cards at the point of entry
to the ground. It would remain an offence for a spectator to
attempt to    obtain admission to the match without a valid
membership card. The clubs would report all such emergencies to
the licensing authority and any club which appeared particularly
liable to failures of machinery (and could not demonstrate that
it had provided for a reasonable level of maintenance) or other
short-term emergencies would run the risk of having its ground
licence suspended.

               Data Protection Act 1984
               28. The FMA and the clubs will need to register with the Data
               Protection Registrar (DPR), and comply with the eight Data
 a             Protection Principles set out in the 1984 Act. When registering,
sr             the FMA and clubs will be required to provide full details of the

 ®             30. The scheme, as envisaged, does reflect the Data Protection

id             clubs of chancfes in personal details, and to renew their card
               regularly, will help avoid the register containing inaccurate
               information or holding information for longer than is necessary.
               The information required for scheme membership (Chapter 2), and
               that to be transmitted in the case of a relevant criminal
               conviction (Chapter 5) has also been reduced to the minimum
               considered necessary for the effective operation of the scheme.
he             31. The principles of data protection may be unfamiliar to the
he             FMA and to many of the clubs. The football authorities'
nd             consultants will therefore need to seek the advice soon of the
bs             Data Protection Registrar on how compliance with the protection
re             principles can best be achieved. The Registrar has a duty, where
               appropriate, to encourage the development of codes of practice
°
er             for data users and the working party recommends that a duty be
               placed on the FMA to draw up such a code.

2. The working party agreed that it was essential to the                        t
effective administration of the scheme that the FMA should                      f
receive information promptly about those from whom membership                   s
should, or may, be withdrawn.    This chapter considers how this                i
might be achieved, in relation to information which will be known               e
to the courts and the police.                                                   i
                                                                                H

Discretionary withdrawal of membership
3. In Chapter 2, the working party recommends that the FMA should
consider withdrawing membership from those who have been ejected
from the ground, usually by the police, for breach of a club's
ground regulations; and from those who have been arrested on a
club's premises for an alleged criminal offence. In such
circumstances the police should draw the attention of a club
official, who will be designated for the purpose, to the
circumstances of the ejection or the arrest, so that the club may
note the membership and other details of the member at the time,
and thereafter report those details to the FMA. A brief standard
report may be devised for the purpose.
4. The football authorities considered that this should be a
statutory procedure, but the Government representatives and the
police considered this unnecessary and inappropriate. The above
outline will need to be considered in more detail by the police
nationally and the football authorities.      It may be useful,
however, to make it clear within the terms of the scheme that
ejection from or arrest on club premises will render a member
liable to disqualification from the scheme.

Mandatory withdrawal of membership
5. The FMA must receive        information about convictions     for
football-related offences.      The working party considered     two
issues:

       (i) Who     should   determine   whether   an   offence    is
                 "football-related"?



                                 28
       (ii)    Who should notify the fact of conviction to the
               FMA?
6. The football authorities considered it should be incumbent
upon the police to notify all convictions for football-related
offences to the FMA.   (Indeed they would strongly prefer to be
notified of convictions for all offences of violence against the
person, but the Government representatives and the police
considered this to be too wide - see Chapter 2, paragraphs 24 &
25).
7. There are two difficulties with the proposal to give the
police this duty. First, police records are regarded as
confidential, and have been disclosed only on grounds of national
security, for the protection of the vulnerable, and to assist in
the administration of justice. Disclosing them to assist the
football authorities with a membership scheme would be a
significant step, and one which could have wide implications. It
is, however, important to point out that, once the scheme is
established, all that would be disclosed is the fact of a recent
football-related conviction which might well have been reported
in the local press anyway.
8. The second difficulty is that it would be left to the police
to determine what is a football-related offence as defined in the
legislation. Interpretation of this statutory definition is most
unlikely to give rise to problems in respect of offences
committed in or near the grounds. The working party considers it
is most important, however, that the definition should include
offences committed on the way to or from matches, such as those
arising from incidents at railway stations, motorway service
areas, or at towns and villages en route.    These incidents may
occur some considerable distance from a ground, and at a
considerable time before or after a match.
9. The decision as to whether an offence is football-related may
therefore give rise to difficult questions of mixed fact and law
which the interests of justice may suggest should properly be
decided by a court. The Government representatives and the police
recommend that the mandatory withdrawal of membership should
apply to those who have been convicted of offences which have
been declared by a court to be football-related within a
statutory definition.
10. The working party envisages that the prosecution would be
responsible, in all appropriate cases, for seeking such a
declaration at the time of conviction.
11. If this recommendation is accepted, it affects the question
of who should be responsible for notifying details of the
conviction to the FMA. To involve the police would seem to add
an unnecessary link in the chain, the more so as the police no
longer attend court as a matter of routine since the institution
of the Crown Prosecution Service.   The most efficient solution
appears to be for the courts to notify the FMA of the facts of
•conviction. Although this would represent a new burden for the
courts, they would be freed from the tasks arising from the
                                                                    >

existing football exclusion order provisions.   The scheme would
render these redundant. Thus, the courts would no longer have to
consider in relation to a football-related offence whether an
exclusion order should be made under section 30 of the Public
Order Act 1986; for what period (section 32); and whether to
allow an application to terminate such an order (section 33). For
the police and the Crown Prosecution Service, the implications
would not seem to be significantly different from those arising
from the existing exclusion order provisions.
12. The working party recommends that the question of whether an
offence is football-related should be determined by the courts.
We further recommend that the Government should initiate
discussions with the courts, the Crown Prosecution Service and
the police in order to find the most efficient means of ensuring
that the convictions are notified to the FMA.

Withholding membership
13. The previous paragraphs relate to disqualification from
membership when the scheme is established. It is most important,
however, to ensure that troublemakers are excluded from the
scheme from the outset. In processing the many applications for
initial membership of the scheme, therefore, the FMA will need to
ensure that they have as much of the necessary information as
possible about previous misconduct.
14. The FMA would have fairly ready access to some of the
information.    The courts, for example, send copies of all
exclusion orders to the Football Association.       The football
authorities confirmed that they and the clubs have also collected
a considerable amount of information, for example from other
clubs or through the media, upon which they already acted against
hooligans.
15. The working party considered what steps may be taken to
supplement this information.   Police records do not distinguish
football-related offences, and it would not be possible to
identify all of them.      There are also issues of principle
involved (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above).     It may be possible,
however, to invite the Association of Chief Police Officers to
ask forces to keep records of convictions, for example for
offences occurring on club premises, and to notify these to the
FMA before the initial applications are processed.            The
information would cover the name, date of birth, address, offence
and sentence.   Similarly, the police could be asked to draw the
attention of clubs to persons whom they were ejecting from, or
arresting at, a ground, so that these details too would be
available to the FMA from the clubs at the outset of the scheme.
16. The working party recommends that the Government should
determine with the police and the football authorities suitable
arrangements for ensuring that troublemakers are not admitted to
the scheme. An early announcement by the Government should make




                               30
       o
 lid       it clear that previous convictions for football-related offences
  to       may be taken into account in deciding who shall be disqualified
  an       from membership.

CHAPTER 6: TECHNOLOGY AND TIMING
1. The Government representatives on the working party are
satisfied that available information technology is fully capable
of providing for the implementation of the national membership
scheme. The working party was advised that the principles of
applying technology to read membership cards electronically are
well understood and relatively simple. The football authorities
were however not completely satisfied that the technology was
available for a workable scheme. They are not committed to
accepting paragraphs 3-17 below, and will wish to be guided by
their recently appointed consultants.
2. Both the Department of the Environment and the Football League
have received large numbers of unsolicited letters offering
technological and commercial solutions for the scheme. The
working party did not see it as its task to make a choice from
these offers but, in order to consider the different ways in
which the scheme might be approached, we invited four companies
with different market specialities to make a formal presentation
on the scheme: a card manufacturer; a security access control
company; a computer systems company; and a Smartcard systems
supplier. This chapter draws out a number of common features of
the technology available and discusses a number of technical
options   as    drawn   up   by   the   Central    Computer   and
Telecommunications Agency.

Central register
3. Details of all members of the national membership scheme will
be held on a central register. The register will be the
responsibility of the Football Membership Authority though it may
employ someone else to run it. The register will be used for two
main functions:

   1. to maintain a full listing of all members of the scheme;
       to receive applications for membership and to apply
      computerised security checks on them, to protect against
       accepting known hooligans;     multiple applications to
      different clubs; repeated use of one address; and other
      possible abuses (there are sophisticated search techniques
       available but their cost is unlikely to be justified by
      the benefits they might bring);
   2. to build up and maintain a "national referral file" on all
      known hooligans,     lost and stolen cards,       cancelled
      membership and other invalid cards, a regularly up-dated
      copy of which would be fed into each club's own computer.
      (•
           Computer requirements

are        4. Every club will need a computer of its own to hold the list of
ble        members who are its supporters and to receive the national
hip        referral file but it would only need to be a micro computer. To
 of        save repeat programming costs this microcomputer should be a

was
 to        5.   There   would   be   no   need   for   expensive   permanent
 by        telecommunications links between each club and the FMA or an
           agency running the central register, on its behalf (called, in
           this chapter, "the central bureau"). The exchange of information
gue        between the central bureau and each club could be managed through
ing        small computer disks sent by registered or secure post. These
The        disks would only need to be sent once or twice a week (subject to
rom        the FMA's views). In the unlikely event that the latest version
 in        of the referral file failed to arrive in time for a given match
ies        then the previous version already held in the club's computer
ion        could be used. Alternatively each club could, at marginal extra
rol        expense, have standby dial-up facilities to the central bureau or
ems        could, at more expense, subscribe to a telecommunication service.
 of        This would make it possible to exchange information much more
cal        rapidly, to cater for matches held throughout the week.
and
           6. The processing requirement of the central bureau is expected
           to be modest but will require an appropriate computer to support
           the potential size of database. The cost of such a computer would
           be difficult to justify for only occasional use and the obvious
           solution is to employ a commercial bureau or the card
ill        manufacturer. The bureau must have adequate security to safeguard
the        the referral file from tampering or disclosure.

           Machinery at turnstiles
           7. A member seeking admission to a match would hand his card,
me;        with money or ticket, to the turnstile operator (this avoids the
ply        risk of vandalism if spectators were permitted to insert the
nst        cards in the readers themselves). Each turnstile house would be
 to        equipped with a card reader and the card would be read to check
her        that it was valid (see chapter 2). There is a consensus among
ues        potential suppliers that very little time would be needed for the
 by        card to be read - one of the companies which gave a presentation
           to the working party speculated that this might perhaps be as
           little as k second for each card in addition to the time now
all        taken to enter the ground. Nor would there need to be any better
led        lighting in turnstiles (a point of concern raised by the clubs)
ted        than is already needed to receive money.
r.
           8. Cards will be checked against the referral file (of invalid
           cards) held in the local computer (the card reader would of
           course distinguish between invalid cards and damaged cards which
           it could not read). This means that either each card reader must
           be cabled to the local computer; or, if intelligent card readers
           with sufficient memory were used, a copy of the referral file
           could be loaded from the local computer into each card reader


                                          33
                                                                (


before each match, making turnstiles self sufficient. Options
which enable card readers to be portable are attractive because
they do not require permanent cabling to the local computer.
Cabling is expensive and time consuming. The cable would also be
vulnerable, particularly when the ground is unoccupied, to
deliberate vandalism. Burying the cable or use of specially
secure conduit would increase cost and installation time.
9. Another advantage of portable self sufficient card readers is
that they could be taken to non-league grounds. Card readers with
their own intelligence and memory - hence portable - are in every
day use but no company has claimed to have one currently in
production which is sufficiently powerful to meet football's
needs. A number of companies feel confident they could develop a
sufficiently powerful, battery driven reader quickly (not all
turnstile houses have mains electricity).
10. One disadvantage of not connecting card readers physically to
the local computer is that during match entry no record can be
built up and made available to all turnstiles on which cards have
been used that day. Cards might then be "passed back" for reuse
unless the cards themselves can be marked physically or can
receive information electronically. This is a major consideration
for the technology of the scheme, given the need to avoid a
card-holder passing his card back to someone who might have been
banned. Only Smartcards and "water mark magnetic stripe" cards
can be updated electronically by the card reader while being
checked and so avoid the problems of "passing back" without
requiring cabling.

Programming
11. The programming of the local computer to hold lists of
members who are a club's supporters and the national referral
file, is well within the scope of basic programming techniques
and should not cause any problems. Programming the on-line
interrogation of the referral file during match entry may require
some special programming to handle the accumulative load at the
larger grounds. This will require investigation but should not be
a major problem.

Membership cards
12. The working party is not recommending any particular type of
membership card. Each type has its advantages and detailed
discussions with suppliers have not yet been held. Without firm
commercial bids the costs and timescales are speculative (and the
costs of cards quoted below also depend on their production in
large quantities). However the following comparisons may be made.
13. Barcodes, consisting of black stripes, are relatively easy to
forge. Someone determined to beat the system would only need to
alter the visible black stripes on his card for it to look the
same as any valid card. Barcode readers are more expensive than
magnetic stripe readers and reputedly less reliable in exposed


                               34
*
    weather conditions. Barcode cards however do have the advantage
    of being robust and can be read even if the card is badly bent.
    Only a few suppliers have suggested barcode cards. These cards
    with name, photograph, club and other information (such as
    advertising) would cost about 50p each.
    14. Most suppliers have suggested magnetic stripe cards. The
    encoded information is written electronically on a strip of
    magnetic material. A disadvantage of these cards is that they are
    not secure; the recorded information can be lost accidentally or
    destroyed with a magnet. On the other hand, the technology is a
    familiar one, in use on credit cards, and magnetic stripe cards
    are the only cards which have an ISO standard. This might be
    important if the scheme was to be used in Europe or exported to a
    wider market at a later date. The cost with photograph etc is
    about £1 each.
    15. Smartcards contain a single chip computer which (in most
    cases) is accessed through gold pins on the surface of the card.
    The chip is mounted either top left or centre left of the card.
    There is no ISO standard. Provided the same physical position is
    used throughout the national membership scheme, however, the chip
    position is not important. Smartcards are very secure. The memory
    is erased if the card is tampered with. Smartcards use dip rather
    than swipe readers. Dip readers are operationally reliable since
    they are not dependent on the correct speed of swipe but the
    cards do need careful placing in the reader to line up the gold
    pins. Smartcards may take very slightly longer to use at the
    turnstiles. An alternative Smartcard is available which does not
    require contact pins.
    16. The major advantage of Smartcards is that they can receive
    and store information about the matches which the holder has
    attended. This prevents multiple use of the same card and
    overcomes the major problem of using portable intelligent card
    readers. Smartcards can also hold more information about the
    holder, which may have wider commercial advantages, and they
    could be extended to cover other sports and activities. The
    disadvantages are: the use of Smartcards in the UK is still in
    its infancy (but growing); no card reader yet in production is
    powerful enough for a fully secure portable system (though the
    manufacturers say that one could be produced quickly); there is
    no experience in using Smartcards in a hostile environment; and
    the time through the turnstiles will have to be checked
    carefully. The price with photograph is about £5.
    17. A type of magnetic stripe, called water mark magnetic stripe,
    is becoming more widely accepted. This card is physically the
    same as a normal magnetic stripe card except that the stripe has
    an area where the magnetically held information is permanently
    bonded and cannot be erased. The stripe can also receive other
    information while the card is in the card reader. The cost is not
    known but is expected to be about half the cost of a Smartcard
    whilst having most of the advantages.

Marketing opportunities

18. The Government representatives believe that the introduction
of   the national    membership  scheme  offers   a number of
opportunities including

   a) improving club procedures

       provision of automatic entrance      statistics   by   chosen
       criteria eg by age, home address
       reduction of fraud at the turnstiles (and, in the case of
       Smartcards allow clubs to check that season tickets are
       used only by the member to whom they were issued);
       availability of local computer for accounting,     payroll,
       word processing, management support;
   b) commercial exploitation

       availability (subject to the rules of the Data Protection
       Act 1984) of mailing lists for sale to pools companies,
       mail order houses, sports shops etc
       advertising on the membership card
       arranging discount schemes with local traders or other
       schemes to enhance the attractions of going to a football
       match
       opportunities for local lotteries and other direct mailing
       schemes.

The football authorities do not share this belief and see little
commercial advantage or improvement to clubs' administration
stemming from the scheme.
19. The basic concepts and technology for a national membership
scheme are available. Different technical options, have different
timing and financial implications. The FMA will have to choose
between options, taking account of the timetable considerations
discussed in this chapter. Opinions were divided on the marketing
potential of the scheme. The working party accepted that this
could only be established once the views of the consultants and
the football authorities' commercial advisers had been received.
It should be noted that, in relation to the Data Protection Act,
members should be given the opportunity to opt out of commercial
uses of their information. Further guidance on this issue will be
included in the proposed code of practice (Chapter 4 paragraph
31).




                                  36
Timing of the scheme's introduction
20. The implementation of the national membership scheme will be
affected by the technical options discussed in the previous
chapter. The tighter the timetable which the Government imposes,
the more immediate will be the demands on the football
authorities to commit financial and manpower resources to the
preparation of the scheme if they wish to avoid the closure of
football grounds to the public. The working party accepted that a
detailed timetable for implementation cannot be imposed in
advance of the consultants report and decisions on the detail of
the scheme. The project management arrangements which the
football authorities choose to employ will have their own
implications for timing.      Three alternative approaches are
discussed as indicated below:

   i . "Do it Yourself"
   The FMA could, with some consultancy help, buy in the hardware
   and software itself and integrate and manage the whole
   project, subcontracting out cabling and other works as
   necessary.

   ii. Contract out the technical work
   The FMA to retain financial control but to contract out all of
   the systems work to a prime contractor. This prime contractor,
   probably from a "systems house" would act on behalf of a
   consortium which covered collectively all necessary skills and
   products.

   iii. Handover to a service management company
   The FMA to make a contract with a service management company.
   The FMA would only need to specify its requirements eg the
   start date of the entire scheme; the degree of security
   required; the criteria for issuing membership cards, maximum
   delay at turnstiles etc. It would then be the contractual
   responsibility of the service management company to meet these
   requirements.

21. The working party considers that implementation by August
1989 for all 92 League clubs would be very difficult to achieve
but the Government's view was that it was just possible given the
right commitment. The working party does not consider that a
phased implementation of the scheme, say a Division at a time, is
worth pursuing, because of the danger of displacing hooligans
from clubs in the scheme to those outside during the phasing
process. Whatever target for full implementation is set, it would
be in the interests of all parties for the consultants report to
be received, and the football authorities and the clubs to begin

their preparations for the scheme, as soon as possible.   The
working party considered the possibility of introducing   the
scheme in mid season.

  Clause 77 is the interpretation clause for this Part. It provides for the
Secretary o f State to designate football matches played outside England
and Wales and to designate reporting agencies.

   Clause 12 and the Schedule provide for the courts to make a restriction
order in respect of a person convicted of a football-related offence where
this would help to prevent violence or disorder at or in connection with
designated football matches played outside England and Wales.
H L Bill 8                                                            502

   Clause 13 provides that a restriction order has effect for a period of five
years where the offender is sentenced to custody and two years where he
receives a non-custodial sentence. The order requires the person subject
to it to report to a designated reporting agency within 30 days o f the
making o f the order and thereafter as directed by the agency. Failure to
report is an offence.
   Clause 14 provides that a person may apply to the court to terminate a
restriction order made against him which has been in force for at least one
year.
   Clause 15 directs the court after making an order imposing or
terminating a restriction order to send copies of it to the person to whom
it relates and to the bodies which may be concerned with it.

   Clause 16 sets out the functions o f reporting agencies. These include
registering an offender and giving him notice o f the requirement to report
at a specified time and place. It is an offence to fail to comply with the duty
to report and to fail to comply with other conditions imposed by the
agency.
   Clause 17 provides for a person to apply to the reporting agency for
exemption from a requirement to report in respect of a particular match.
It is an offence to make a false statement in connection with an
application. There is an appeal to the magistrates’ court from the refusal
of the agency to grant such an application.

   Clause 18 provides for the Secretary o f State to issue guidance to
designated reporting agencies and to make regulations governing the
giving of notices imposing a requirement to report. Notice given in
accordance with the regulations is presumed to have come to the attention
of the person required to report.

  Clause 19 and the Schedule provide for the magistrates’ courts to
impose a restriction order in respect o f offences committed outside
England and Wales which are specified by Order in Council as
corresponding to football-related offences under the Schedule.

  Part I I I consists of general provisions contained in Clauses 20 to 22
which provide for offences by bodies corporate, the service o f documents
and the commencement and extent provisions of the Bill.


Financial effects o f the Bill

  The measures introduced by the Bill are expected to give rise to public
expenditure of about £2.5 million per year taking into account police,
Crown Prosecution Service, court and legal aid costs and the cost of
operating the designated reporting agencies. That does not take account
of income from fines. The cost of the Football Membership Authority
and the installation of equipment at grounds and the issue of membership
cards, which may be required under the scheme, is a matter for the
football authorities.

Effect o f the Bill on public service manpower
  The Bill may require a minor staffing increase in the Department of the
Environment if the Secretary o f State assumes the licensing functions
under clause 10. The Bill should not result in any increase in manpower
of other departments.

                    FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL PUBLISHED

        Proposals to introduce a national membership scheme for
 football supporters in England and Wales, and to prevent
 convicted football hooligans from attending matches abroad are
 set out in a Government Bill published today.

          The Government hopes to have the scheme in place in Spring
  1990.

          The Football Spectators Bill would:

               control the admission of spectators to designated
               football matches in England and Wales by means of a
               national membership scheme;

               provide for the licensing of football grounds to admit
               members of the scheme;

               stop convicted football hooligans from travelling to
               matches abroad and so help prevent the violence which
               has tarnished our national reputation in recent years.

        The Bill provides for the appointment of a Football
 Membership Authority (FMA) to prepare and subsequently administer
 the membership scheme.

       The proposal is that only members of the scheme (or others
authorised by the scheme) would be allowed to attend matches
designated by the Secretary of State.         Convicted football
hooligans could be disqualified for standard periods of two and
five years.

       Grounds on which designated matches are to be played would
need a licence granted by the Secretary of State (or by an
authority appointed by him).      An essential requirement for
obtaining a licence would be participation in the national
membership scheme. Without sucha licence, clubs would be unable
to admit spectators to designated matches. These matches will
include all League matches and any other matches which the
Secretary of State chooses to designate. The licensing authority
would also have the power to revoke or suspend licences where
clubs are judged to have failed to comply with the         stated
conditions.

       To prevent violence or disorder at key football matches
abroad, the Bill proposes that courts should be given the power
to impose 'restriction orders' on convicted football hooligans.
This would require those individuals to report to named agencies
on the day of designated overseas football matches.

       The Bill contains 22 clauses and one schedule.

      A guide      to the Bill is attached to this News Release.



NOTES TO EDITORS
The Government hopes that the football authorities will take on
the role of the Football Membership Authority and the Minister
for Sport, Colin Moynihan has today written to the President of
the Football League and the Chairman of the Football Association
to invite them to confirm that they wish to do so.
                                  -   2-
A working party to review the main principles of a national
membership scheme was set up following a meeting between the
Prime Minister, President of the Football League and the Chairman
of the Football Association on 6 July, 1988.
The working party, which was chaired by Colin Moynihan, Minister
for Sport and included representatives of the football authori­
ties and Association of Chief Police Officers, published its

              GUIDE TO THE FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL



THE PURPOSE OF THIS NOTE

This guide provides a layman's summary of the main provisions of
•this Bill. It is not intended to be an exhaustive or definitive
interpretaion of the clauses.

The Bill is arranged in 3 parts.

PART I (clauses 1-10) provides for a national membership scheme
for spectators at designated football matches in England and
Wales and for the licensing of grounds on which these matches may
be played.   It provides for the Secretary of State to appoint a
body todraw up the national membership scheme and for the scheme
to be approved by him.
The effect of Part I would be that:

               only members of the national membership scheme (or
               others authorised in the scheme) would be admitted
               to those matches in England and Wales designated
               by the Secretary of State.

               spectators could be admitted to designated matches
               only on grounds licensed by the Secretary of
               State

               any member of the public attending or attempting
               to attend a designated match other than as
               provided for by the scheme would be committing an
               offence




                                   1
              it would be an offence to admit spectators to a
              designated match on an unlicensed ground

              anyone convicted of a relevant offence would be
              disqualified from membership of the scheme for a
              standard period of two or five years

PART II (clauses 11-19) provides for the imposition of restric­
tions on convicted football hooligans travelling abroad, to help
prevent violence or disorder at football matches played outside
England and Wales. It provides for courts to be given the power
to impose restriction orders on individuals lasting for two or
five years. Reporting conditions will apply when key matches are
being played abroad.   Individuals will be required to report as
directed to a designated reporting agency.    This Part also sets
out the functions of reporting agencies and provides for the
Secretary of State to issue guidance to agencies.

PART III (clauses 20-22) contains general provisions providing
for offences by bodies corporate, and the commencement and extent
of the Bill.

HOW THE GOVERNMENT'S   POLICY OBJECTIVES   ARE   DELIVERED   BY   THE
CLAUSES

Spectators in England and Wales

Clause 1 is the interpretation clause for Part I.     It provides
for the Secretary of State to designate football matches to which
the national membership and licensing schemes will apply.




                                  2
Clause 2 makes it an offence for any spectator to attempt to gain
entry to, or to remain in, a ground for a designated football
match, except as a member of the scheme.        It sets out the
penalties to which an offender may be liable on conviction, and
provides for arrest without a warrant.

Clause 3 provides for the Secretary of State to appoint a body to
run the national membership scheme and for a change of appoint­
ment to be made if necessary. The Bill refers to the body to be
appointed as the "administrator", it is referred to generally as
the Football Membership Authority.

Clause 4 provides for the administrator to draw up a draft
scheme, and to submit it to the Secretary of State for his
approval. The administrator should also agree with the Secretary
of State when the scheme is to take effect. The scheme, and any
later modification, is to be laid before Parliament.

Clause 5 provides for the framework of the national membership
scheme.   It lists certain requirements which the scheme must
fulfill and other matters which it may cover.     It also ensures
that information supplied by members or potential members is
subject to the provisions of the Data Protection Act.

Clause 6 provides for the circumstances in which people may be
refused membership of the scheme and in which membership may be
withdrawn from them.    It provides for the disqualification of
convicted football hooligans for standard periods of five years
where a sentence of imprisonment is imposed, or two years in
other cases.    The clause also provides for longer periods of
disqualification to be determined under the scheme itself by the
Football Membership Authority.




                                3
Clause 7 makes it an offence for a club, or anyone else, to admit
spectators to any premises during a designated football match,
unless those premises are licensed for the purpose.

Clause 8 makes general provisions for the granting of licences to
admit spectators to designated football matches. It covers:

              charging for licences

              the scope of licences

              a right of inspection of the licensed premises

              procedures which the licensing authority         must
              follow if it wishes to vary a licence

              the conditions which the authority may attach to a
              licence.

It makes it an offence for a club to contravene the conditions of
a licence.

Clause 9 provides for the circumstances in which the licensing
authority may suspend or revoke a licence to admitspectators.

Clause 10 provides forthe Secretary of State to be the licensing
authority and for him to appoint another body as the authority
and for the procedures by which such an appointment may be made
or terminated.




                               4
FOOTBALL MATCHES OUTSIDE ENGLAND AND WALES

Clause 11 is the interpretation clause for this Part.          It
provides for the Secretary of State to designate football matches
played outside England and Wales and to designate reporting
agencies.

Clause 12 and the Schedule provide for the courts to make a
restriction order in respect of a person convicted of a football-
related offence where this would help to prevent violence or
disorder at or in connection with designated football matches
played outside England and Wales.

Clause 13 provides that a restriction order haseffect for a
period of two or five years and requires the person subject to
the order to report to a designated reporting agency within 30
days of his conviction and thereafter as directed by the agency.
Failure to report would be an offence.

Clause 14 provides that a person may apply to the court to
terminate a restriction order made against him which has been in
force for at least one year.

Clause 15 directs the court after making an order imposing or
terminating a restriction order to send copies of it to the
person to whom it relates and to the bodies     which may be
concerned with it.

Clause 16 sets out the functions of reporting agencies.    These
include registering an offender and giving him      notice of the
requirement to report at a specified time and place. It would be
an offence to fail to comply with the duty to report and to fail
to comply with other conditions imposed by the agency.



                                5
Clause 17 provides for a person to apply to the reporting agency
for exemption from a requirement to report in respect of a
particular match.    It would be an offence to make a false
statement in connection with an application.   Provision is made
for an appeal to the magistrates'court from the refusal of the
agency to grant such an application.

Clause 18 provides for the Secretary of State to issue guidance
to designated reporting agencies and to make regulations
governing the giving of notices imposing a requirement to report.
Notice given in accordance with the regulations is presumed to
have come to the attention of the person required to report.

Clause 19 and the Schedule provide for the magistrates' courts to
impose a restriction order in respect of offences committed
outside England and Wales which are specified by Order in Council
as corresponding to football-related offences under the Schedule.

documents required or authorised by the Bill.

Clause 22 provides for the citation of the Act, the commencement
of its provisions, for the repeal of certain provisions of the
Public Order Act 1986 and for the limitation of its extent to
England and Wales.

            BREAKING THE LINK BETWEEN VIOLENCE AND FOOTBALL
          Nicholas Ridley Outlines The Government*s Proposals



         The Football Spectators Bill will provide the means to
  break the link between violence and football.     For the first
  time, there will be an effective and comprehensive procedure to
  keep hooligans away from football matches, Environment Secretary
  Nicholas Ridley said today.

         Speaking in London at            the   launch   of   the   Football
  Spectators Bill, Mr Ridley said:

         "Everyone will recall the immediate background to the
  Government's decision to legislate on this subject - the
  incidents   in May last year and the appalling scenes in West
  Germany during the European Championships in June.     The nation
  demanded action and the Government agreed.       When the Prime
  Minister met the football authorities on 6 July, she invited them
  to establish a national membership scheme themselves.        They
  refused and she told them that the Government would bring forward
  legislation to establish the scheme.

         "The Bill also deals directly with the problem of English
  football hooligans abroad. It gives the courts powers to impose
  restriction orders on convicted hooligans to prevent them
  travelling to English matches abroad.

        "This Bill has nothing to do with the idea of a national
identity card. Our intention is that if people wish to go to a
football match, they will have to obtain a membership card for
■the purpose. If they behave like hooligans, they will lose their
membership.    The concept is entirely different from that of a
national identity card that someone could carry all the time.


       "We welcome the measures which the clubs and the police
have taken to deal with hooligans inside football grounds.    But
their effect has been to keep the lid on the problem, not to cure
it.    At too many matches, violence remains just below the
surface.   Rival supporters have to be kept apart by physical
barriers and by the employment of large numbers of police.


       "Outside football grounds, the behaviour of rival groups
of   supporters     makes    life    intolerable          both    for   law-abiding
football supporters and for those who live or trade nearby or
wish to travel by train on the same day as a football match.


       "For the police,       this means that every weekend thousands
and thousands of them         are employed to deal with travelling
football supporters and       the matches themselves.   The ratepayer
and the taxpayer have to      foot most of the bill.


        "Football    seems    to    be       a    focus   for   hooligans   and   for
violent behaviour in a way unheard of in most other sports - and
most other forms of activity. There have been isolated outbreaks
of trouble at a few other sporting events in recent years.   But
not on remotely the same scale or frequency as football and the
Bill which is published today deals only with football.
                                         -   2-
       "The Bill establishes a statutory framework for a national
membership scheme for football spectators.   It does not prescribe
the contents of the scheme. It provides for me to appoint: an
authority to draw up a scheme and to submit it to me for
approval.

       "We hope, and expect, that the football authorities will
establish the Football Membership Authority.   Colin Moynihan has
written today to the President of the Football League and the
Chairman of the Football Association to invite them to confirm
that they will take on the responsibility and to ask them to
produce an outline programme for the scheme.    The Government is
asking Parliament to impose the requirement for a scheme. But we
want the scheme to be devised and run by football.


       "The Bill proposes that everyone who attends a designated
football match in England and Wales should be a member of the
national membership scheme, or otherwise authorised by the
scheme, and that designated matches should be played only on
licensed football grounds. Those who are convicted of a relevant
offence will be disqualified from membership of the scheme and
the scheme itself will allow for the Football Membership
Authority to ban others who misbehave at football matches.


       "For the first time, there will be an         effective and
comprehensive procedure to keep hooligans away       from football
matches.    Of course there will be attempts to abuse the system
but if the scheme is effective, those attempts will fail.    We
believe that it offers the real prospect of ending football
hooliganism both inside and outside grounds.  If hooligans know
that they will not be allowed in to football matches, they will
have no incentive to travel to them.  The link between football
and hooliganism will be broken and football will cease to be a
focus for violence.
                              -3-
       "This is why the Bill is necessary.      We have said all
along that we want to co-operate with the football authorities in
drawing up the scheme and I shall be meeting the chairmen of the
League clubs this afternoon to talk about the Bill. I hope that
they will begin to see that it is in their interests; I have no
doubt but that it is in the interests of society as a whole.”

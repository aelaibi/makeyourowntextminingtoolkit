Dear

Thank you for your recent letter to Mr Moyniha*) which has been
passed td this department in view of our responsibilities for the
Safety of Sports Grounds Act.  I apologise for the delay in
replying to you.

Lord Justice Taylor recognised, in his Final Report, that there is
no single solution to achieve crowd safety and cure all the
problems of crowd control.  However, he was satisfied that seating
does more to achieve these objectives than any other single '
measure.  He also considered that moving to all seated
accommodation was consistent with the policies of both FIFA and
UEFA.

I understand your feelings and those of many others who wish to
stand at football matches.  However, Lord Justice Taylor said in
his Final Report:

"I am not convinced that the cherished culture of the terraces is
wholly lost when fans are seated. ... The communal spirit is still
there and finds ready expression.  To such extent as the seating
limits togetherness or prevents movement, that price is surely
worth paying for the benefits in safety and control."

This is a view with which the Government is in agreement.

Lord Justice Taylor also commented that it should be possible for
clubs to plan a price structure which suits the cheapest seats to
the pockets of those presently paying to stand.  He pointed to
Ibrox where seating is £6 and standing is £4, which he did not
consider to be a prohibitive price or differential.  Therefore, the
fears of many spectators that they may no longer be able to afford
to attend football matches may be unnecessary.

                                                      Yours sincerely




                                                      MR S BILBE

            We did not stop a ny where               en route to the m atch and were                      not subjected

            the    car on the A61 6 about 75 yards                         from the Stadium.



            We    then went       into S h e f f i e l d    centre         by ta;<i,   had a walk        round the

            cathedral,          then had     lunch at a restaurant.                    We    then returned to the




    9       ground by ta;<i arriving at the entrance at 2pm



            I went       to the VoKlet and w h i 1 st walking                      towards

                                  a nother whose           name     I do not know,



            Ou ts id e       the wrought     iron gates           there were a number                of people mill in g

  CAT                                                           GvfPS,
            Once     inside the gates           the re were           ini              lere were        o rganised queues

            a bout      40    people   deep.      I queued witl^fny son and his friends                            Ths

            people       I travelled with had stand tick



            I have been to H i l l s b o r o u g h a nunnery of tiiis^s before, including last
             C A T   1 3 3 ^ SfcMi
            years m at ch there for the semi-^i n<fl , b)/C it is m any years since I ’ve

            been     in the terracing,            but      I h* f d / n     'eal d i ff ic ul ty finding         the

            turns ti le s       I had to use.



            Wh i ls t    queuing up it became               quite         crowded and the queues            disappeared.

CAT          Then two m ou nt ed Officers                  came    into      the   crowd froiTj/my/ riqjjft and          in

I b u c f   front       of me    in an obvious          effort        to    relieve    the fcf
                                                                                                              P AGE         3
                                                                                                              S3136

           I e ve nt u al l y got     pushed up against            the      railing on the     right hand side.

            By this time the           crowd was       out of      control.



           The    only    people trying       to sort       the    crowd out were        two    mounted

           Officers.         There were      other     foot Officers          to the   right and beyond          the

           turn st il es     by the   large gate just             standing and talking.           There were          no

           s tewards at all as          far as       I am aware.



           Eventually        I m an ag ed   to struggle         through the far         right hand turnstile.



           I stood       in the t urnstile         for a number of seconds waiting for the man

           to take my ticket,           but he was talking             to another man in front of me.

           It just a p pe a re d      like a chat and nothing                urgent.     People    behind me

           were    shouting      to hurry up.          It certainly delayed my entry to the

           ground.



           I ripped my ticket           in half and handed the ap pr op ri at e                part    to the man

           who    looked at      it a nd    c ontinued to talk           to the other man.            Eventually        I

           got    through.

                They both then ran off to my right,                         but   I don't kfiow where         they went.

                My son came through and we started to look ^ K e / e to g o . The

                w here    to go.       I saw the       lettering on\^ne            tunnel A and B the wrong way

                round,     but      I saw some stairs and deci de d to go up them to start at the

                back     of the terracing w h ic h            is where       I thought      the stairs went.



                As   I climbed the stairs              there were 4 stewards with 2 Police Officers

                be hi nd t h e m .     The y asked      to see my ticket,            w hich    I showed      them.



                T he y told me        I was    in the stands          entrance and the entrance               to the

                t e rr ac in g was down the tunnel.                 This was       one of the stewards who                told

                me that.



                So   I went        back down and       into the tt\nfc^r.L^ P ^ r t           from those      on the

                stairs there were             no other    stewards          or Police Officers          giving

                I went down the tunnel               and turned        right      onto   the terracing,        this was

                at a bout 2. 4 0 p m     (1440).        The    terracing was         crowded,      I literally had to

        S       force my way through,                expecting       it to get easier as we went               down,      as

                normal,      but     it didn't.        I stood        round for a couple           of minutes    and even

                tried to get back,             but    couldn't.        I could      see to the        left and right

                that     there was      plenty of       room,       but at that      time     I was    not aware         of the

                lateral      fencing.         I said to my son,             who was with me,          that   I was

                getting      out     to the    side.     The    pressure was         intense,      so m uch so       I

                thought      I was     going    to have a heart attack.                  I shouted at others

                walking a ro un d the          perimeter       of     the    pitch that     it was crowded,      one

                looked     right at me,         but kept       on walking.

            At about       kick off time          I looked back        into the        pen I had just          left and

            the      crushing had become          unbelievable.           People were          crushed up against

            the side       fencing and no one was able                 to m o v e ,    People were           screaming

            w i th the     pain.        You   could see a slow movement               of heads     towards          the
                                                                                                         /

            I froze,       just    looking at the scene,            not    believing w h a / I was seeing

            T he n    I went     over    to see    if I could help.           I could ^ee         people trying             to

            climb out,          but they just         couldn't.



            I remember a teenage               girl    in distress,       cry in-/and                   fg, she was

            about a quarter             of the way up the terracin/,              not     r       lip a gainst            the

            railing,          but just    back.       This was w hen      I/ap pr oa ch ed the Police

            I went      back up and tried to help a lad out.                          I put my hands          thro ug h

            the bar and tried to               push his    legs up.        E v e n t u a l l y he m a na ge d to get

            out.        I then helped others            out w hen the      pressure       relaxed slightly.

      "jO$E-   ^ eac*“          was a white male, about 2 0 - 2 2 years, thin build, dark short

               hair,     the only       item of    clothing       he was wearing were              blue jeans,

               Sofjveone shouted we            needed    stretchers      so    I ran back and s cr eamed at the

                       » 4bove        in the stands       to tear the a d v e r ti si ng       hoardings       down,

                                could    reach,    but    I c o u l d n ’t.     The y   ripped them off and

                          them down and we took             them to the gate and             passed them onto the

               pitch.



               I went     back    up and       realised    I had got to the             back of     pen 3 where         I had

               been,     there was more          room,    but    it was still       packed.         I got out of         it

               again,     but by this time            I think most of the           injured had been got out,



               I met a man who was             just     standing     there saying,         " H e ’s dead,     h e ’s

               dead,"     he was       crying.     I c o u l d n ’t do anything,          I just     looked at him.



               It was     then the sheer horror             of    it all      hit me,     it a pp ea re d as     if it

               was all        over then and       in some semblance            of order.       I    stood    next      to my

               son for a while.



               I then left the ground and went home.



               My views on how the              incident           hajrttiled are why were           some Police

               O ff ic er s    standing a r o u n d doing                     and others working            so hard.

The Police           seemed to     react      slowly to       it as     if they didn't      realise what

was      happening at first,



I also want to ask are                 the    turnstiles       capable     of handling      that many

people wi th in an hour of kick off.                         The    tickets are also       bad    in that

they don't           tell you where          to go.     There       needed to be stewards and
              /
P ol i c e / i n s i d e   the ground di re cti ng/peo pie where             to g o .    There was a

disXinct          lack of basic        first <^/d |?qui pment j / i B , stretchers,              oxygen,

at c .



If fences are to be used at                    pitch    level       then there must       be equipment

to easily          remove     it or more       gates    to    let    people out.



The      turnstiles were a major               problem       in that access        was so slow causing

a backlog.            The man at my turnstile was about                        and just     c o u l d n ’t

handle       that many        people,    he was       in a state of        panic



They shouldn't              have the    lateral       barriers as        it prevents      people moving

sideways and away from the                    crush and even having            the fences        they

s hould have signs             indicating       the gates          thro ug h them.



I have       indicated on the a tt a c h e d           plan my       passage through       pen 3,



I received no injuries at the ground and w i t n e s s e d no                           criminal

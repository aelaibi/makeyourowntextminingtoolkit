Thank you for your letter of 13 August to Jack Straw, enclosing one from
                                                                               H in
support of calls for a new inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.

As you know, concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster remain
unresolved received renewed attention following the Granada television
documentary drama "Hillsborough" last December. The Home Secretary
subsequently received many representations calling for a new public inquiry.

After fully considering the material which has been put forward, he has decided,
in all the circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure
that no matter of significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. To
this end, as you will know, he announced in the House on 30 June that he had
invited Lord>Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal to
conduct the scrutiny. I enclose for your information a copy of the
Home Secretary's statem ent to the House, which includes Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith's terms of reference. You will see that he has undertaken to make public
the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives him.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has indicated that anyone who, after consideration of
his terms of reference, wishes to make representations to him should contact his
Secretariat via Room 528, 50 Queen Anne's Gate, London SW1H 9AT. It is our
earnest hope that this independent scrutiny will finally bring to an end the
uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.

  DOSTJack,
 I have received the enclosed letter from one of my
 constituents, concerning the Hillsborough Tragedy.

 I would appreciate it if you could inform me of the
 Government's current position, in light of the latest
 developments regarding this matter.



 Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr Borrow

Congratulations on your election to parliament!, I hope you enjoy a long
and successful career in national politics.

I am writing to you to draw your attention to a national issue rather than a
local one. As an exiled Liverpudlian and lifelong supporter of Liverpool
Football Club I request your support for the Hillsborough Family Support
group in their fight for justice and ask that in the light of the new evidence
which has recently emerged about the disaster, you do all in your power to
support any attempt to establish a fresh inquiry and/or inquest into the
tragic events of Saturday 15th April 1988.

The Home Secretary will no doubt have been inundated with cards issued
at the recent day of support. I hope he, like you, will be sympathetic to our
request.

Yours sincerely

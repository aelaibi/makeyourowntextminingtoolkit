Dear Mr Straw, Sir

I enclose copy of a letter sent to the Financial Times on the
5th August 1989.   As I recall, all but the last paragraph was
printed in their letters page on the following Saturday.      I
have no way of knowing as to whether or not my views were
considered or even seen by Lord Taylor at the time of the
original Enquiry.    It has always seemed to me that the police
on duty on that fateful day have received an unfair share of
criticism and it is possible that reopening of the Enquiry
into the Hillsborough disaster will result in endeavours to
place even more blame onto their shoulders.     I am writing in
the hope that the views expressed in these letters can receive
proper consideration.

At the age of ltt years I was present at Burnden Park in a
position overlooking the desperate scenes as the disaster
occurred there in March 19^6.   Thirty three people died on
that day.      It makes me shudder to think how many would have
died at Burnden had there been in place a fence similar      to
that which existed at Hillsborough and I emphasise my opinion
that it was the existence of that horrific fence,      not  the
failure of police control,      which was the main cause of the
tragedy.     A lot of people also believe that,   as at Burnden
Park,    there was an element of the crowd on which part of the
blame should rest.

I would be grateful if you could please endeavour to have the
foregoing observations placed before the Officials who are
conducting the new Enquiry.

SIR,

THE INTERIM TAYLOR REPORT INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL DISASTER
IS STRONGLY CRITICAL OF THE POLICE, INDEED LORD TAYLOR IS QUOTED
AS SAYING THE MAIN REASON FOR THE DISASTER WAS THE FAILURE OF
POLICE CONTROL.

THERE WERE OBVIOUSLY MANY REASONS WHY THE DISASTER OCCURRED BUT
THE ONE THING WHICH WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF THE DEATHS WAS
THE HORRIFIC PERIMETER FENCE, WHICH WAS OBVIOUSLY DESIGNED TO
WITHSTAND A PRESSURE WELL ABOVE THE PRESSURE WHICH THE HUMAN BODY
CAN WITHSTAND.  WITH INADEQUATE DESIGN OF THE TERRACES AND
BARRIERS BEHIND THE FENCING THERE WAS NOTHING TO STOP THE
PRESSURE FROM INCREASING ONCE THE OUTER GATE HAD BEEN OPENED. IF
ANY ONE PERSON OR GROUP OF PEOPLE ARE TO BE BLAMED IT MUST SURELY
BE THOSE WHO AUTHORISED THE BUILDING OF THE PERIMITER FENCE SUCH
THAT THE PRESSURE COULD NOT BE RELIEVED IN A CONTROLLED MANNER.

ADEQUATE PRESSURE RELIEVING DEVICES ARE FUNDAMENTAL ESSENTIALS IN
ANY PRESSURISED SYSTEM WHERE THE MAXIMUM PRESSURE IS UNKNOWN.   IT
IS NO USE BLAMING THE PLANT OPERATORS WHEN SOMETHING GOES WRONG
IF SUCH DEVICES HAVE NOT BEEN INSTALLED.


YOURS FAITHFULLY,
                                                       Ian Daines,       BA(Hons) Dip.Ed.

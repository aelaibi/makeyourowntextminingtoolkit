             I reside at the above address with my wife and children and my full

             time job is an

             I am also a member of Semth Yorkshire Fp4ice Special Constabulary for

             six years,       having joined on the

            During     these six years         I have been stationed at Ecclesf i eld Police

            Sta t io n which is situated on the F2 Sub Division.                  My rank     is that of

            Special Constable.

            About a week before the Liverpoo 1/Nottingham Forest Semi Final,                           I

            spoke to Commandant MARTIN via telephone.                 He is my supervisory

            Officer and I informed him that I would be on duty on Saturday 15th

            April     1989    (150489).   At the time I spoke to Commandant MARTIN no

            duties were assigned to me but 1 said that                I would meet at

            Hillsb or ou gh Football Ground at about             12 midday    (1200).
                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                     5779

At about    12 midday    (1200)    I left home in my own car and travelled to

the ground along the A61.           Traffic along thisyroad was fairly light

although    I re ca l1 that for     last y e a r 's Sejn F i n a l , whi ch I w o r k e d , the

same   road was very heavily congested.

I arrived at the ground at about            1215 hours.        I made my way on foot to

Nia gr a R d , where   I spoke to Section Officer                     Whilst speaking       to

S ection Officer          , I heard a radio transmission to the effect that

a regular Officer       engaged on traffic control at Penistone Rd required

another Officer to assist him in his duties.                   The Officer was told by

control    that there was no one available,               so I told Section Off i ce r

       that I would go to PenL*ftone Rd to assist the regular Officer.

I was given a personal          r^fio by SDO              who had booked it out for me.

I made my way to P e n i f ^ n e    Rd, where the traffic            lights were switched
                           1/                         \
off.    The time would have been a .hoj/C 1225 hours.

iiy job was to control      the traffic at this            p o i n t , which at this time

appeared to be normal S a tur da y traffic.               However,    there were a

considerable amount of Liverpool            supporters       I j/ould estimate the

number to be about three hundred,

I remember seeing about a dozen L i v e r p o o l supporters whuu' were very

drunk and were unable       to stand up wi tlarout assi stancj

A lot of supporters were          in my opinion d r u n k . Mapy of them were still

drinking from cans and bottles as they walked X l o n g Penistone Rd.
                                 ------------ y e --------------------
1 remained at Penistone Rd until            1450 hours,       during which time I

directed Liverpool       supporters     to the part of the ground that had been

allocated to them.

The L i v e r p o o l supporters were genersJLly unruly and difficult to

direct.     It appeared that they \ e j ^       not bothered about getting           into

the ground on time.

At one point a Mini      bus drove past me full of Liverpool                supporters.

They were behaving      in an abusive and disorderly manner as they went
                                                                                    PAGE        3
                                                                                    3779

past, with the door of the van open.

F rorri where   I was    in Penistone Rd,     I was     able to seethe turnsti les

that the Nottingham Forest supporters were going through.                      Although

there were      large numbers of supporters at the turnstiles they were

able to enter the ground without any problems.

I could see that there were a number of                 regular Officers      posted at

these turnstiles also.

At about    1450 hours,      because there w a s n ’t any traffic       problems,      I went

to have a cup of tea at the North Stand of the ground.                    I remained

there for about         ten minutes.

When    I came back out I saw regular Officers making their way to the

Football Pitch but it was not apparent for what reason so I continued

towards the gate at Penistone Rd.

Although        there were a lot of transmissions            on my personal   radio,/ I was

unable to make          them out because    I d i d n ’t have an earpiece.

As   I made my way towards          the ground entrance gate, SDQ               [was

walking    in the opposite direction.             He took my arm and instructed me

to follow him onto the pil^ch and down to the Leppingsl Ljn end.

As I walked the         length an    the pitch,    1 d o n ’t recall seeing any of the

football    players there.          I walked up to the Leppings Ln end towards

the right of the goals.

As I approached it appeared tha^t what hald occurred was a normal                      crowd

surge similar to those that            i/have experienced at the ground in the

past.     Ithought that all         that w<mld be requi red        was to let people out

onto the        pitch because the pushJs<jg in the          pens had become too much to

bear.     This has been done a t / pas t itQ h ^c h e s ■

Whilst standing at the fen/ing            I began to direct people out of A he

terracing through the gaVe and onto the pitch.                   After a whi Le some

Officers went      into the /crowd to assist someone.             I beg^an>to pull

people through the oc/en gate,            I could not say if they were concious,
                                                                                    PAGE       4

dead or alive.

I continued to do this for some time,                  I remember seeing two Officers

attempting to resuscitate a male supporter                 in a part of the terracing          .

that had become        clear.                                                          /

Shortly after,       tog earner with supporters and othe r Of f i ce rs       I b jeg a n to

pull the f etfci n g / a w a y .    I thought we were do i ng this     in order/ to

enable the w f i c e r s       on the terrace to carry the male supporter

through,    who appeared to be dead.

As we pulled the fence away supporters                 began to climb through onto the

pitch.      I helped pull a girl through,             helped by her boyfriend.        She

was   crying.      I helped to carry her away and then I returned to the

fencing and began to               help people up onto the pitch.      I remember

looking up and seeing a clearing              on the terrace.     It looked as if

things had eased.          I       then looked to my left and was     devastated.

Further along by thegoals was even                worse.    I could   see bodies on the

pitch covered over,            people receiving    resuscitation and supporters

attempting to get through fencing that was also being pulled down.

Seeing this totally overwhelmed me.                I felt as /though I could not

remain there and found it necessary to walk/away.

I went and stood with a line of Qfficer%/at the halfway line of the

p it ch .                                       \ /

I remained in the line for a while and was then directed by SDO

to go outside to the Leppings Ln end of the ground,                   which I did with

other Officers.

I remained for a short time and then went with other Special

Constables      into the North Stand where we talked and were spoken to by

a Supervisory Officer.              After this we were allowed home.        This would

have been at about         1615 hours.

I would like to add that I have been on duty at a considerable number

of Sheffield Football matches,              including previous Cup Semi-Finals.

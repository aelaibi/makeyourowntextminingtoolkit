     Dear Mr Enzor

     I thank you for your letter of 3 1st December 1998. As you know there is a hearing listed at
     Leeds District Court for Thursday 7th January, which it may be possible to avoid, in the
     interests of saving costs. We enclose a copy of the letters that have been exchanged between
     us and Hammond Suddards.

     We should be very grateful to receive tomorrow your written confirmation that the voluntary
     disclosure procedure will proceed in relation to CPS material. You will see that Mr Metcalf
     has not indicated any objections to this CPS disclosure.

     You will note that Mr Metcalf still claims to be relying on your “guidance”. I should be very
     grateful if you could guide him so far as to suggest that he should not look to us to pay his
     exorbitant costs of copying to the defence the material we seek.


     Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Metcalf,

Adlington v Murray: Adlington v Duckenfield


We have received your letter to us o f 4th January 1999. We regret that you have taken such an
unco-operative and sullen attitude to our requests for further information. We have been told that
the CPS will inform us by tomorrow o f its own attitude to voluntary disclosure of documents in
its possession, and we expect to be told by them matters relevant to the question o f disclosure by
South Yorkshire police. For that reason I am sending the CPS copies o f our recent
correspondence.

We are therefore unable to inform you whether the hearing on Thursday will proceed or not. For
the time being, we do not propose to ask the court to vacate the date, but if this position changes
in the light of CPS guidance or information we shall let you know. I have the following questions
arising from your letter to which I should be grateful if I could have an answer before 5pm today,
in the hope that an informed decision may be taken as to whether the hearing should proceed on
Thursday.

1.      Is the South Yorkshire police force prepared to allow either me and other lawyers for the
        prosecution, or the lawyers for the defence, to see the papers we have listed in the draft
        schedules to the witness summonses in order to eliminate unnecessary copying and
        expense?

2.      Is the South Yorkshire police force prepared to hand over voluntarily the originals of any
        of the papers that have been specified on the draft schedules, or any other papers, either
        to the prosecution or the court?

^ 1 ' note that you are concerned about the costs o f Thursday’s hearing. My understanding o f the
   attitude to costs taken by the South Yorkshire Police Authority in this case leads me to believe
   that they are unlikely to leave you exposed.

   I should point out that the South Yorkshire police appeared at the hearing on 21st December
   because the magistrate requested it. I had assumed that you were proposing to appear or be
   represented on 7th on the same basis. An application for a witness summons is usually made ex
   parte. You are not, of course, obliged to be present, and we are not obliged to inform you o f any
   application we make for such a summons.

   If you instruct counsel, that is because you have chosen to appear voluntarily at the hearing, and
   you cannot expect us to meet you costs, nor, if you threaten us with applications for costs, can
   you expect us to inform you o f our intentions in relation to summonses in future.


   I look forward to your reply,



   Yours sincerely,


   /i .

           Dear Ms Adlington

           Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 1989
           Private Prosecutions - Release of Documentation

           Thank you for your letter of 3 1 December 1998.

           It is disappointing that you do not indicate clearly an intention to accept the proposals which have
           been put forward but instead raise a number of issues many of which are of doubtful relevance.

           What ever may have been said in Court about a Judicial Review my understanding is that no
           proceedings have been commenced. If such proceedings are commenced and/or leave is obtaine
           the       position will again arguably revert xo what it was before the DPP s decision was
           announced. In other words there will again be the possibility of intervention and it is arguable that
           the South Yorkshire Police should then revert to the original guidance of the CPS which was to
           await the decision before considering release of documentation.

           I am bound to point out that had you simply accepted the offer instead of raising this and the other
           queries the process o f disclosure could by now be underway.

            You have asked for clarification on other matters and I am observing your paragraph lettering.

            (A)          Guidance requested for the CPS by the Chief Constable is provided pursuant to the
                         Prosecution o f Offences Act 1985 and is confidential. You will have to take on trust that it
                         has been accurately summarised in our correspondence.

(B)    1 do not know what undertakings could possibly be implied at common law. Unless it is your
       intention to misuse the material you should have no problem giving the required undertaking.

        The difference between prosecution and defcncc is that you are asking for the material
        whereas the defence is not. It is part of the CPS guidance that material be copied to the
        defence if requested by and provided to the prosecution. Clearly an undertaking cannot be
        requested in circumstances where the CPS guidance requires that materia! be supplied,

(C)    I suggest that you rase this point if and when material which you request is refused on
       grounds of lack of materiality.

(D)     The proposed charge is a reasonable one. You ignore the tact that it will include the cost of
        black and white A4 photocopying (both to yourselves and the defcnee). You also ignore the
        fact that a documents officer cannot exist in a vacuum but requires office facilities and
        secretarial support. As to the drafting of invoices these will simply indicate the amount of
        hours spent in each period. Under English law an explanation is required it VAT is not
        chargeable rather than if it is.

(E)    This has being dealt with under (B) above.

(F)    This has been dealt with under (B) above.

(G)    Quite simply this is none of your business.

I do not think the balance of your letter requires comment save to note that we are in agreement that
the question o f voluntary disclosure is a separate matter from the Application for a Witness
Summons.

Turning to the latter we have reserved Counsel to appear at Court on 7 January 1999 and we do
need to know as soon as possible whether the hearing is to procced. Obviously we will be seeking
to recover costs if Counsel appears and the matter is then adjourned.

Yours sincerely

 31 December 1998

 Dear Mr Metcalf

 I have received your letter o f 30th December 1998 sent by facsimile.

 I had spoken to Mr Croston o f the CPS last week and to a different CPS lawyer yesterday
 before receipt of your letter. I have been told that the intention o f the CPS is to disclose the
 ™ if ‘e the‘r Possession subject to any convincing objection in law that you might raise on
 behalf of South Yorkshire police, but I am pleased to say that they will not be charging £30
 per hour No doubt you have also been in touch with Mr Croston or his colleagues and been
told of their attitude already. I had assumed from the terms of your letter that you would not
  e a vancing any such objections but I am surprised to read in a letter from the CPS which I
received this morning that you are suggesting that the CPS should postpone their disclosure
pending the outcome o f judicial review proceedings. There is no sense in proposing the
voluntary disclosure of material in possession of South Yorkshire police and asking the CPS
to withhold theirs.                -

 The reservation in the third paragraph of your letter makes the prospect o f early disclosure by
 your clients more apparent than real in any event. It is not correct to say that judicial review
 proceedings are “being considered”. On 2 1st December, leading counsel for Mr Murray and
junior counsel for Mr Duckenfield both told the court in unambiguous terms, in the presence
of the prosecution and your counsel, that an application for judicial review would be made and
Mr Harrison QC told the court that he intended that it would be lodged in the first two weeks
of January. He told the court this after Miss Varty had indicated that voluntary disclosure
would be withheld if such an application were to be made, and after prosecution counsel
protested at the potential delay in the disclosure process. (Miss Varty later appeared to adopt
a more amenable attitude when the Magistrate suggested that many o f the documents might be
disclosed by agreement between the parties so that the committal proceedings would be
conducted in an orderly and efficient way.)



                                              -   1
                                                  -

I am sure that, if the defence had changed their minds, or were now undecided as to whether
to apply for judicial review, they would have told us, because they know that the CPS decided
to delay a decision as to voluntary disclosure on the 2 1st only by reason o f the declared
intention of the defence to challenge the CPS decision.

The prosecution considers it wholly unreasonable of the defendant to form, and act upon, a
concluded decision to apply for judicial review, when they believe that the decision-maker may
or will provide reasons for his decision within a short time. We must, however, accept the
reality that attack upon the rationality of the decision is to be made whatever the reasons, and
whether reasons are supplied or not. I therefore ask you to tell me whether the Chief
Constable will indeed “suspend” the process when the proceedings are “instituted” (by which I
surmise you mean lodged with the Crown Office) or at least explain why you cannot tell me
now. I am sure that your clients will agree that it would be pointless to spend time and incur
expense in setting up a procedure, and in installing a “documents officer”, if the arrangements
were to be put into abeyance within a few days. I hope that you will throw more light on this.

I also request that you clarify the following matters:

(A)   What is the “guidance” to which you refer in paragraph 1. I understand that the
      present position o f the CPS is that they have no guidance to offer because they have
      decided not to intervene. However, since last July the makers o f statements have
      requested copies o f their statements from South Yorkshire police. May we please see
      a copy o f the “guidance” to which you refer, which apparently you have been ignoring
      for the last six months. Why were the statements not disclosed if such guidance was
      given and the makers consented.

(B)   What limitation is the proposed undertaking specified in para 2.1 intended to add, if
      anything, to such undertakings as are implied in relation to disclosure by common law?
      We note that you are not suggesting that the Defence give similar undertakings.
      Please explain why not.

(C)   In para 2.3, you suggest that your client will “require” a brief explanation o f the
       relevance o f the material to one or more of the charges. Such a position implies that
       an individual decision on behalf o f your clients is contemplated in relation to each item,
       either to disclose or withhold. Do you propose to apply the test embodied in section
       97A o f the Magistrates Court Act, or some looser standard? If the test is to be
       “materiality” you will understand that a court, after applying the same test, does not
       charge the prosecution for photocopying at a rate equivalent to a salary exceeding
       £50,000 a year, and then make a further charge at the same rate for supplying copies
       of the same material to the defence. I suspect also that the application of the
       “materiality” test would be rather less generous in your hands than the Court’s. If the
       proposed criterion is different, please set it out.

(D)   The basis on which the exorbitant charge is to be levied is unclear. The HSFG could
      find a competent and trustworthy person to do the job for nothing except travel
      expenses, or at a commercial rate o f under £5 an hour. You may well be right to say
      that VAT is chargeable, but I should like to know on what basis, and how the hourly
       rate has been calculated, so that the HFSG can inform itself properly before deciding
       whether to authorise this unusual expenditure. Please also inform me o f the detail in
       which the invoices will be drafted, so that we can be assured that the time and
       activities o f the documents officer will have been reliably set out.

(E)    You tell me that all material disclosed to us will also be disclosed to both defendants.
       Fortunately we can relieve you o f that responsibility. At all three hearing before the
       Leeds District Magistrates’ Court, the prosecution has raised the difficulties it has
       experienced in obtaining documents from the South Yorkshire police and CPS. On
       each occasion it has openly invited the defence to support its request to both these
       bodies that documents be disclosed. The prosecution has pointed out that the
       defendants might reasonably expect that such disclosure might assist their case.
       However, on each occasion, perhaps mindful of cost, the defence have declined to
       support the request. Instead they have argued that it is for the prosecution to disclose
       to them all relevant material in their possession.

       Miss Varty will be able to confirm this in relation to 21st December, and Mr Manning
       will, we trust be prepared to confirm that this was also his expressed position at the
       earlier hearings. It is therefore wholly unnecessary for you to supply the defence with
       copies and to charge us for doing so.

       If this does not cause you to change your mind, please confirm that it is also proposed
       to supply the defence with any material that they may request, on what criteria, and
       whether it is intended that such material will also be copied to the prosecution at the
       expense o f the defence (ie the expense o f the South Yorkshire Police Authority). You
       do not say if you have written in similar terms to the defence solicitors, as opposed to
       merely sending them a copy o f your letter to us.

(F)    Please inform me, in any event, why you propose to charge us for the supply to the
       defence of the same material as you send to us. Such an arrangement would make a
       mockery o f the “equality between prosecution and defence” which you refer to, and
       the impartiality which you have professed in earlier letters. Surely the defence should
       pay for their own copies. -The prosecution have obligations o f disclosure o f all relevant
       material to the defence, which it will abide by, and at a fraction o f the cost of your
       expensive “documents officer” . Fortunately as I have said, the defence will look to us,
       and not to you to disclose.

(G)    Who is it proposed will be the “documents officer”? Will he have had any previous
       connections with the Hillsborough inquiries and an interest of his own to protect?    ]



There is a further objection to your proposal to charge us for copying material to the defence.
You know that the defendants are in receipt o f public money for their defence, namely, funds
from the South Yorkshire Police Authority. It is obvious from the fact that the defendants

                                               -3-
have already announced a concluded decision to apply for judicial review, that the Authority is
liberal with its money. It will obviously meet the reasonable copying of the defence, and, on
the basis o f recent experience, there is every reason to believe that the Authority will accept
even your proposed rates o f charging, particularly wheri the money will be coming back to a
body which it finances.

When the prosecution applies in due course for its costs, it is unlikely that, upon conviction,
the defendants would be ordered to pay the whole sum. In that event, or in the event of
acquittal the prosecution would have to look to recover its costs from public funds, and will
face taxation. The taxing authority is unlikely to regard the costs which you stipulate for a
person who is essentially a photocopier as in any way reasonable. The proposal we make to
finance the costs o f copying to the defence is undoubtedly more reasonable, and conducive to
the saving of public money.

I agree with you that the question o f the issue o f witness summonses is separate, and that any
agreement we may reach does not prejudice our right to apply for such summonses, or your
right to object to them. However, it is possible that we may agree about disclosure, and so
avoid the necessity o f the application on 7th January. The prospect of this will obviously be
improved if you reply to this letter today. If the hearing of the 7th is unnecessary we would
wish to inform the Leeds Court, which has always been helpful to us, as early as possible. No
doubt the Court will conclude its business today earlier than usual.

We should tell you that the decision of the South Yorkshire Police Authority to fond the
defence is one that we have challenged. We suggest that it was made unlawfully and
irrationally, as you have no doubt heard. We shall be making further formal representations to
the Authority, and will be copying the file as a matter of courtesy to the Chief Constable. If
you have been advising either the Authority or the police in that matter, please let me know,
so that I can serve the papers on you directly.

Yours sincerely

 Dear Ms Adlington

 HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER 1989
 PRIVATE PROSECUTIONS: RELEASE OF DOCUMENTATION

 As you are aware my firm represents the Chief Constable in this matter.

 Now that the DPP has decided not to intervene in the prosecutions the South Yorkshire Police
 would like to progress the issue o f disclosure of copies o f relevant material from the Hillsborough
 archive.

 It has been suggested that the decision o f the DPP may be the subject o f judicial review proceedings
 by the Defendants. The South Yorkshire Police do not propose to delay disclosure on the basis that
 such proceedings are being considered but will review the position if such proceedings are actually
 instituted and reserve the right to suspend disclosure pending the outcome in that event.

 I should make clear that this decision has no effect on our position in relation to the application for
 the issue of a witness summons directed to the Assistant Chief Constable. That application is due to
 be considered again on 7 January 1999 and if it is proceeded with it will be resisted.

 Reverting to the matter o f disclosure the following points are relevant:

 1.           A vast amount of material has been requested. I must ask that you indicate your priorities so
              as to enable attention to be directed first to the material which you consider most important.

 2.           We have considered carefully the guidance o f the CPS to the effect that the consent of a
              witness should be sought before a copy o f his or her statement is made available. We believe

       that in the circumstances of this particular case that may be an unreasonable requirement and
       subject to the safeguards set out in the following three paragraphs the Police are prepared to
       supply material without that requirement being fulfilled. The safeguards are:

       2.1   The material supplied and any further copies taken will be used only bona-fide for the
             purposes of the present prosecutions and not for any other purpose whatsoever.
             Aside from actual use in court it will be made available only to legal representatives
              of the prosecution and, where necessary, to expert or other witnesses.

       2.2   At the conclusion of the prosecution all such material and any copies taken will be
             returned to the South Yorkshire Police. The Chief Constable will be prepared to
             consider alternative proposals for safe custody of the material provided that such
             proposals clearly continue to satisfy condition 2.1 above.

       2.3   In the case of each item we shall require a brief explanation of the relevance of the
              material to one or more of the charges.

              Item 2.1 and 2.2 must be supported by your written undertaking as a solicitor.

3.     There will be a substantial cost in providing this material. Rather than charge on an item by
       item basis the South Yorkshire Police propose to use the services of a documents officer and
       to charge his time at £30.00 per hour plus VAT. For the avoidance o f doubt the time charge
       will apply for any work in connection with provision of documents or dealing with any other
       requests raised by the prosecution whether dealt with in this letter or otherwise. That charge
       will include the cost of all black and white A4 copying but an additional charge will be levied
       in respect of the copying of any videos, tapes, photographic prints or any other non-standard
       material including black and white photocopies of non-A4 size. An account will be rendered
       to you every fortnight following commencement of copying and this must be paid within 7
       days failing which provision of material will be suspended. Given that the Hillsborough
       Family Support Group, who we believe are your Clients, do not appear to have a legal
       personality, we will require your personal solicitor’s undertaking that these charges will be
       met as outlined above.

4.    Express guidance from the CPS is that there must be equality between prosecution and
      defence so that all material supplied will be copied at the same time to the two Defence
      solicitors. This will be chargeable to you on the basis set out above.

5.    CPS guidance is that original statements should not be released from the archive. We are
      prepared to consider making appropriate arrangements for the inspection of specific
      individual statements or other original material if good reasons are put forward.

There is no reason why this process should not now commence quite quickly once the terms above
have been accepted.

I look forward to hearing from you.

         Dear Mr Enzor

         I thank you for your letter of 3 Is1December 1998. As you know there is a hearing listed at
         Leeds District Court for Thursday 7lh January, which it may be possible to avoid, in the
         interests o f saving costs. We enclose a copy of the letters that have been exchanged between
         us and Hammond Suddards.

         We should be very grateful to receive tomorrow your written confirmation that the voluntary
         disclosure procedure will proceed in relation to CPS material. You will see that Mr Metcalf
         has not indicated any objections to this CPS disclosure. .

         You will note that Mr Metcalf still claims to be relying on your “guidance”. I should be very
         grateful if you could guide him so far as to suggest that he should not look to us to pay his
         exorbitant costs of copying to the defence the material we seek.


         Yours sincerely

     5 January 1999


     Dear M r Metcalf,

     Adlington v M urray: Adlington v Duckenfield


     We have received your letter to us o f 4* January 1999. We regret that you have taken such an
     unco-operative and sullen attitude to our requests for further information. We have been told that
     the CPS will inform us by tomorrow o f its own attitude to voluntary disclosure o f documents in
     its possession, and we expect to be told by them matters relevant to tlie question o f disclosure by
     South Yorkshire police. For that reason I am sending the CPS copies o f our recent
     correspondence.

     We are therefore unable to inform you whether the hearing on Thursday will proceed or not. For
     the time being, we do not propose to ask the court to vacate the date, but if this position changes
     in the light o f CPS guidance or information we shall let you know. I have the following questions
     arising from your letter to which 1 should be grateful if I could have an answer before Spm today,
     in the hope that an informed decision may be taken as to whether the hearing should proceed on
     Thursday.

     1.      Is the South Yorkshire police force prepared to allow either me and other lawyers for the
             prosecution, or the lawyers for the defence, to see the papers we have listed in the draft
             schedules, to the witness summonses in order to eliminate unnecessary copying and
             expense?

     2,      Is the South Yorkshire police force prepared to hand over voluntarily the originals o f any
             o f the papers that have been specified on the draft schedules, or any other papers, either
             to the prosecution or the court?




                   Phone 0151236 1919. Fax 01512361936. E Mail info@hfsg.org

     I note that you are concerned about the costs o f Thursday’s hearing. My understanding o f the
     attitude to costs taken by the South Yorkshire Police Authority in this case leads me to believe
     that they are unlikely to leave you exposed.

     I should point out that the South Yorkshire police appeared at the hearing on 21“ December
     because the magistrate requested it. I had assumed that you were proposing to appear or be
     represented on 7* on the same baas. An application for a witness summons is usually made ex
     parte. You are not, o f course, obliged to be present, and we are not obliged to inform you o f any
     application we make for such a summons.

    If you instruct counsel, that is because you have chosen to appear voluntarily at the hearing, and
    you cannot expect us to meet you costs, nor, if you threaten us with applications for costs, can
    you expect us to inform you o f our intentions in relation to summonses in future.


    I look forward to your reply,



    Yours sincerely,



    Ann Adlington.

          Dear M s Adlington

          Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 1989
          P rivate Prosecutions . Release of Documentation

           Thank.you foryour letterof3l December 1998.

           It is disappointing that you do not indicate clearly an intention ro accept the proposals which have
           been put forward but instead raise a number of issues many of which are of doubtful relevance.

           What ever may have been said in Court about a Judicial Review my understanding is that no
           proceedings have been commenced. If such proceedings are commenced and/or leave is obtained
           the legal position will again arguably revert xo what it was before the DP?’s decision was
           announced- In other words there will again be the possibility of intervention and it is arguable that
           the South Yorkshire Police should then revert to the original guidance of the CPS which was to
           await the decision before considering release of documentation.

           I am bound to point out that had you simply accepted the offer instead of raising this and the other
           queries the process of disclosure could by now be underway.

           You have                for clarification on other matters and I am observing your paragraph lcncnng:-

           (A)         Guidance requested for the CPS by the Chief Constable is provided pursuant to the
                       prosecution o f Offences Act 1985 and is confidential. You will have to take on trust that it
                       has been accurately summarised in our correspondence.

          (S)    I do not know what undertakings could possibly be implied at common law. Unless it is your
                 intention to misuse the material you should have no problem giving the required undertaking.
                 The d if fe r e n c e b e tw e e n prosecution and defencc is that you are asking for the material
                 whereas the defence is noL It is pan of the CPS guidance that material be copied to the
                 defence i f requested b y and provided to the prosecution. Clearly an undertaking cannot be
                 requested in dicurostances where the CPS guidance requires that material be supplied,

          (G)    I suggest that you raise this point if and when material which you request is refused on
                  grounds of lack o f materiality.

          (D)    The proposed charge is a reasonable one. You ignore the fact that it wiflinclude the cost^of
                 blade and white A4 photocopying (both ro yourselves and the detcncc). You also ignore
                 farf that a documents officer cannot exist in a vacuum bur requires office feci ities an
                 secretarial support. As to the drafting of invoices these will simply indicate the amount o
                 hours spent in each period. Under English law an explanation is required ii VAT is D2I
                 chargeable rather than if it is.

           (E)   This has being dealt with under (B) above.

           (F)   This has been dealt with under (B) above.

           (G)   Quite simply this is none of your business.




           to recover costs if Counsel appears and the matter is then adjourned.

         Your Ref: PCM/C HI. 05 7-9

         31 December 1998

        Dear Mr Metcalf

        I have received your letter o f 30,h December 1998 sent by facsimile.

        I had spoken to Mr Croston of the CPS last week and to a different CPS lawyer yesterday,
        before receipt o f your letter. I have been told that the intention of the CPS is to disclose the
        material in their possession subject to any convincing objection in law that you might raise on
        behalf of South Yorkshire police, but I am pleased to say that they will not be charging £30
        per hour. No doubt you have also been in touch with Mr Croston or his colleagues and been
        told of their attitude already. I had assumed from the terms of your letter that you would not
        be advancing any such objections but I am surprised to read in a letter from the CPS which I
        received this morning that you are suggesting that the CPS should postpone their disclosure
        pending the outcome o f judicial review proceedings. There is no sense in proposing the
        voluntary disclosure o f material in possession of South Yorkshire police and asking the CPS
        to withhold theirs.

        The reservation in the third paragraph of your letter makes the prospect o f early disclosure by
        your clients more apparent than real in any event. It is not correct to say that judicial review
        proceedings are "‘being considered”. On 21st December, leading counsel for Mr Murray and
        junior counsel for Mr Duckenfield both told the court in unambiguous terms, in the presence
        of the prosecution and your counsel, that an application for judicial review would be made and
        Mr Harrison QC told the court that he intended that it would be lodged in the first two weeks
        o f January. He told the court this after Miss Varty had indicated that voluntary disclosure
        would be withheld if such an application were to be made, and after prosecution counsel
        protested at the potential delay in the disclosure process. (Miss Varty later appeared to adopt
        a more amenable attitude when the Magistrate suggested that many o f the documents might be
        disclosed by agreement between the parties so that the committal proceedings would be
        conducted in an orderly and efficient way.)

                rate has been calculated, so that the H fSG cart inform itself properly before deciding
                whether to authorise this unusual expenditure. Please also inform me of the detail in
                which the invoices will be drafted, so that we can be assured that the rime and
                activities o f the documents officer will have been reliably set out.

         (E)    You tell me that all material disclosed to us will also be disclosed to both defendants.
                Fortunately we can relieve you of that responsibility. At all three hearing before the
                Leeds District Magistrates' Court, the prosecution has raised the difficulties it has
                experienced in obtaining documents from the South Yorkshire police and CPS. On
                each occasion it has openly invited the defence to support its request to both these
                bodies that documents be disclosed. The prosecution has pointed out that {he
                defendants might reasonably expect that such disclosure might assist their case.
                However, on each occasion, perhaps mindful of cost, the defence have declined to
                support the request. Instead they have argued that it is for the prosecution to disclose
                to them all relevant material in their possession.

                Miss Varty will be able to confirm this in relation to 21st December, and Mr Manning
                will, we trust be prepared to confirm that this was also his expressed position at the
                earlier hearings. It is therefore wholly unnecessary for you to supply the defence with
                copies and to charge us for doing so.

                If this does not cause you to change your mind, please confirm that it is also proposed
                to supply the defence with any material that they may request, on what criteria, and
                whether it is intended that such material will also be copied to the prosecution at the
                expense o f the defence (ie the expense o f the South Yorkshire Police Authority). You
                do not say if you have written in similar terms to the defence solicitors, as opposed to
                merely sending them a copy of your letter to us.

         (F)    Please inform me, in any event, why you propose to charge us for the supply to the
                defence of the same material as you send to us. Such an arrangement would make a
                mockery o f the “equality between prosecution and defence” which you refer to, and
                the impartiality which you have professed in earlier letters. Surely the defence should
                pay for their own copies.' The prosecution have obligations of disclosure of all relevant
                material to the defence, which it will abide by, and at a fraction of the cost of your
                expensive “documents officer”. Fortunately as I have said, the defence will look to us.
                and not to you to disclose.

         (G)    Who is it proposed will be the “documents officer”? Will he have had any previous
                connections with the Hillsborough inquiries and an interest o f his own to protect?




         There is a further objection to your proposal to charge us for copying material to the defence.
         You know that the defendants are in receipt o f public money for their defence, namely, funds
         from the South Yorkshire Police Authority. It is obvious from the fact that the defendants

                                                        -3-

        have already announced a concluded decision to apply for judicial review, that the Authority is
        liberal with its money. It will obviously meet the reasonable copying o f the defence, and, on
        the basis o f recent experience, there is every reason to believe that the Authority will accept
        even your proposed rates o f charging, particularly when the money will be coming back to a
        body which it finances.                 •

        When the prosecution applies in due course for its costs, it is unlikely that, upon conviction,
        the defendants would be ordered to pay the whole sum. In that event, or in the event of
        acquittal the prosecution would have to look to recover its costs from public funds, and will
        face taxation. The taxing authority is unlikely to regard the costs which you stipulate for a
        person who is essentially a photocopier as in any way reasonable. The proposal we make to
        finance the costs o f copying to the defence is undoubtedly more reasonable, and conducive to
        the saving o f public money.

        1 agree with you that the question o f the issue o f witness summonses is separate, and that any
        agreement we may reach does not prejudice our right to apply for such summonses, or your
        right to object to them. However, it is possible that we may agree about disclosure, and so
        avoid the necessity o f the application on 7lh January, The prospect of this will obviously be
        improved if you reply to this letter today. If the hearing of the 7* is unnecessary we would
        wish to inform the Leeds Court, which has always been helpful to us, as early as possible. No
        doubt the Court will conclude its business today earlier than usual

        We should tell you that the decision o f the South Yorkshire Police Authority to fund the
        defence is one that we have challenged. We suggest that it was made unlawfully and
        irrationally, as you have no doubt heard. We shall be making further formal representations to
        the Authority, and will be copying the file as a matter of courtesy to the Chief Constable. If
        you have been advising either the Authority or the police in that matter, please let me know,
        so that I can serve the papers on you directly.

        Yours sincerely




        Ann Adlington

        Dear Ms Adlington

        HILLSBORO UGH STADIUM DISASTER 1989
        PRIVATE PROSECUTIONS: RELEASE O F DOCUMENTATION

        As you are aware my firm represents the Chief Constable in this matter.

       Now that the DPP has decided not to intervene in the prosecutions the South Yorkshire Police
       would like to progress the issue o f disclosure of copies of relevant material from the Hillsborough
       archive.

       It has been suggested that the decision o f the DPP may be the subject o f judicial review proceedings
       by the Defendants. The South Yorkshire Police do not propose to delay disclosure on the basis that
       such proceedings are being considered but will review the position if such proceedings are actually
       instituted and reserve the right to suspend disclosure pending the outcome in that event.

       I should make clear that this decision has no effect on our position in relation to the application for
       the issue o f a witness summons directed to the Assistant Chief Constable, That application is due to
       be considered again on 7 January 1999 and if it is proceeded with it will be resisted

       Reverting to the matter of disclosure the following points are relevant:

        1.           A vast amount o f material has been requested. I must ask that you indicate your priorities so
                     as to enable attention to be directed first to the material which you consider most important.

       2,           We have considered carefully the guidance o f the CPS to the effect that the consent o f a
                    witness should be sought before a copy of his or her statement is made available. We believe

                  that m the circumstances of this particular case that may be an unreasonable requirement and
                  subject to the safeguards set out in the following three paragraphs the Police are prepared to
                  supply material without that requirement being fulfilled. The safeguards are:

                  2.1    The material supplied and any further copies taken will be used only bona-fide for the
                         purposes o f the present prosecutions and not for any other purpose whatsoever.
                         Aside from actual use in court it will be made available only to legal representatives
                         o f the prosecution and, where necessary, to expert or other witnesses.

                  2.2   At the conclusion of the prosecution all such material and any copies taken will be
                        returned to the South Yorkshire Police. The Chief Constable will be prepared to
                        consider alternative proposals for safe custody o f the material provided that such
                        proposals clearly continue to satisfy condition 2.1 above.

                  2.3   In the case of each item we shall require a brief explanation of the relevance of the
                         material to one or more o f the charges.

                        Item 2.1 and 2.2 must be supported by your written undertaking as a solicitor.

        3.    There will be a substantial cost in providing this material. Rather than charge on an item by
               item basis the South Yorkshire Police propose to use the services of a documents officer and
              to charge his time at £30.00 per hour plus VAT. For the avoidance o f doubt the time charge
              will apply for any work in connection with provision o f documents or dealing with any other
              requests raised by the prosecution whether dealt with in this letter or otherwise. That charge
              will include the cost o f all black and white A4 copying but an additional charge will be levied
              in respect o f the copying of any videos, tapes, photographic prints or any other non-standard
              material including black and white photocopies o f non-A4 size. An account will be rendered
              to you every fortnight following commencement of copying and this must be paid within 7
              days failing which provision of material will be suspended. Given that the Hillsborough
              Family Support Group, who we believe are your Clients, do not appear to have a legal
              personality, we will require your personal solicitor’s undertaking that these charges will be
              met as outlined above.

        4.    Express guidance from the CPS is that there must be equality between prosecution and
              defence so that all material supplied will be copied at the same time to the two Defence
              solicitors. This will be chargeable to you on the basis set out above.

        5.    CPS guidance is that original statements should not be released from the archive. We are
              prepared to consider making appropriate arrangements For the inspection o f specific
              individual statements or other original material if good reasons are put forward.

       There is no reason why this process should not now commence quite quickly once the terms above
       have been accepted.

       I look forward to hearing from you.

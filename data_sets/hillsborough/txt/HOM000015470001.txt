      At Prims Minister's Questions today, Frank Field, M.P.,
raised the issue of those who are receiving social security
benefits, and who would receive payment from the Hillsborough
Fund.   He was concerned that payments from the Fund would reduce,
or even remove their entitlement to benefit.   The Prime Minister
promised to look into this in the light of the experience which
people have had with other disaster funds, while making the
point that if, as she had heard possible, the organisers decided
not to apply for charitable status, then this might have implications
Could you please let me have a note to show to the Prime Minister,
and a suitable draft letter for her to send to Mr. Field.
It would be helpful if your advice and the draft reply could
be with me by Thursday 4 May.

        I am copying this letter to Peter Storr (Home Office).

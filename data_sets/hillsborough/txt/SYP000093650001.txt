                      Further to my questionnaire which was completed earlier regarding the

                      Hillsborough disaster,                      I wish to add further details.



                      After         climbing over the perimeter fence onto the pitch after the game

                      was stopped,                 I helped to rip down some advertising hoardings to use as

                      stretchers.                  At this time I had lost contact with my mates and was on

                      my own.



                                                                                               i appeared   to be




                      jacket which was covering his face artful he was wearing jeans I think.

                      I did not see the m a n ’s face at all.
                                                                                            PAGE
                                                                                            S3791



     'f0 ^    We picked up the man/bn the left hand side of the penalty a r ea as

               ook from the pitch/into Leppings Lane terrace.                We carried him from

              there to the far/end of the pitch where we placed him,               on the

^ ^ ^ ^ J ^ ^ C f h o a r d i n g , just off the pitch,   in the path which led to the rear of

              the North Stand.



              At the time the man was picked up he was almost on the hoardings.

              When I saw him he had been lifted on by three lads and it was they

              that asked me to give them a hand to carry the hoardings.



              I do not know the other lads who carried the hoarding and I do not

              think that they knew the man on the hoarding.



              This was the only person I had any dealings with,               but I did see a lot

              of bodies     lying on the pitch,           covered up, but I would not be able to

              identify them or describe them now.

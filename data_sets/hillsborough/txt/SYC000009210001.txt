             Dear Sirs,

             Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


             If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
             of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
             on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
             due course.

             I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
             evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
             coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
             inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

             Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners' Rules, the Inquest is
             under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
             witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
             this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

             Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
             to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
             appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
             consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

             May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
             attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

             I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
S            names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
             to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

             I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
             heard from you by                      I will assume you have no names to
             submit.

             Yours faithfully,

Dear            3ir9f

Hes           PATRICK J. THOMPSON (deceased) Bo.49.
As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not' to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,



S.L.Popper,
H.M.Coroner.

 Dear Sirs,

 You will be aware that I do not normally ralease post mortem
 reports until the resumption of the Inquest, ■■■hen they ara
 in fact put in as evidence.

 However, in view of the numerous requests which I have received,
 and the obvious distress which delay is causing to your clients,
 I have decided that subject to certain conditions set out below,
 I am prepared to release to you upon request, the post mortem
 report of your clisnt(s).

-The release of these post mortem reports are cn the basis that:-

      a.      They have to be treated as provisional, and therefore
              subject to amendment or alteration until such time as
              they are given or produced in evidence at the Inquest.

      b.      They are to be used only for the purpose of bereavement
              conselling of the deceasedrs relatives or for proper
              legitimate purposes in connection d.th any legal proceedings
              in which solicitors may be engaged.

      c.      Subject to -a£-;afe§v§, they are to be kept confidential until
              they come into the public domain at the resumed Inauests.

I have your request for the post mortem report to hand in respect
of each of the persons listed on the attached sheet,'and on the
assumption that you will confirm -that the report in respect of
each of your respective clients is accepted on the terms set out
above, and in order to save further delay and upset to your client,
I enclose a copy of the relevant post mortem report. If for any
reason you cannot agree to the contents of this letter, please return
the post mortem report to me, without of course making any use of it.

The cost for the copy post mortem report(s) is    fy   per sheet (total                        £% yf

Dear Mr Popper

I write following my very helpful conversation this afternoon with Mr Thompson
from your office to confirm a number of points.

Firstly, I understand that you are favourably inclined towards the requests
that you have recieved from a number of Solicitors to release copies of
the Post-Mortem Reports on the victims of the Hillsborough Disaster in advance
of resumed Inquest Hearings and in this regard might I ask you to let me
have copies of the Reports on the deceased named in the attached list the
families of whom I respresent.

There is a strong feeling from many of the families that early receipt of copies
of the P.M. Reports would be beneficial both in terms of answering some
hxterto unanswered questions and also in perhaps reducing the anguish which
might be suffered when full details of the cause of death become known at a
public hearing perhaps some weeks or months hence.

If payment is required for copies of any of the Reports then needless to say
I will be happy to deal with this.

I understand that the relative positions of approximately 50 of those who
suffered fatal injuries has been established at or immediately prior to the
estimated time of death, this information is being generally discussed and
although I am not asking you at this stage to release the names of the 50
involved I would be very greatful if you would confirm that this information
is correct, perhaps the number has increased from 50? Would it be your intention
to release this information prior to reopening of the inquests?

Finally, I confirm that I will speak to my fellow committee members tomorrow
(Wednesday) about the issue of 'block representation' of the bereaved families at the

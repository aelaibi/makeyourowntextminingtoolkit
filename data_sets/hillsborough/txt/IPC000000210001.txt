                                                       HILLSBOROUGH

      A number of complaints were made by individual members of the public following

      the tragedy at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.                        The final consideration of

      these complaints had to wait until the inquest was concluded.


      In accordance with the procedures laid down in the Police and Criminal

      Evidence Act 1984 for dealing with complaints by members of the public against

      the police, the Police Complaints Authority have directed that disciplinary

      charges be preferred against two officers.


      Ihe Authority have considered complaints against a number of other officers

      and have decided that no disciplinary charges be preferred against them.

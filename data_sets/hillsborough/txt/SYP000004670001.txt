              When travelling to the game neithf                     or myself had a ticket for

              the match, we went        in the hopeMjf obtaining one at the ground,                           Me

               left home at 8.30 am <0830) and made our way to Sheffield via the

              A 1 , A57 and til motorway, we did not stop on route and were not

         We arrived in Sheffield at 11.00 am (1100)          that morning and I parked

         my Vauxhall Nova, Dark Blue        in colour,   registered number              r in

         Penistone R o a d , Sheffield,    approximately 1 1/2 miles from the ground,

         Upon my arrival    I did not receive any police direction or escort to

         the ground, I did not witness any disorder, fighting or drunkeness

         At 11.10 am (1110), we arrived at the Spion W6p end of the ground,

         where I saw a man who was selling Nott inghanf Forest ti ckets for £35

         each.     Having told him we we re Liverpool     fans/he   simply stated that

         we could obtain some from his brother, who              pointed out to us.         This

         man sold us two tickets for the Le pp i n g ^ j/ane end for £30 each.

         We had some 1unch and tried to find a public house, most were/shut

         and the few that were open were that packed, we d i d n ’t bothj

so.a     We eventually arrived at the Leppings Lane turnstiles at 1/pm

         (1300).     We were able to hand in our tickets and walk st\Jdght            in.

         I did not receive either        police or steward directions at the

         turnsiles, we had no diff culty in f inding our ent ry        point and      I did

         not see an open gate and nor did I see one opened.

         I did not witness persons gaining an unathorised entry.

         Having entered the grounji,       I did not see any signs directing fans

         to their viewing    point/f.      I have been to Hillsborough before and/had

         no need to look for / n e .      I knew where I wanted to go, so,        I wa/ked

         down the Control Tu/nel        leading to Pens 3 & 4,   I had free pas\°^4ge

         along this t u n n e ^ ^ here I did not not i ce any po 1 i ce or steward control;

         I did not witness any disorder or other incidents at this time,               I saw

         no one consuming alcohol within the ground,

           2.55 pm (1355).

           There was a surge from behind and one or two people fell to the

           ground,   these were able to get back up, as at this time there was

           still a little room to move.         At this time I began to get separated

           from        who was forced down Pen 4 towards the right hand corner by

           the perimeter fence.       This surge was more than I usually experience



OVi        1 was standing      in front of a barrier,        leanyng my back against it, I

           began to feel very uncomfortable because yal though the.surge was from

           behind the people in front of me were pafshing back Jind I was bent

           over the barrier

           As 1 was in this position,       bmndreds of fans weri surging past me

           coming from my right, across me and to my froprt

           This   initial surge subsi/ed for a short time before building up again

           and another surge wor.sa than the first ensued



           barrier behind me began to slide down under it in order to escape the

           crush.

           People around me were screaming for help and others were shouting for

           people to move back,      there is no doubt that by now hundreds of people

           were   panicking.

           Due to the pressure I was experiencing from the people coming under

           the barrier,   I was forced away from it towards the segregating fence

           between Pens 4 and the narrow gangway             (5).

           I was moving   in virtually a straight line, as I                    it half way,

           there was a commotion behind me, an unconcious                       then passed

above the heads of the fans to the front perimeter fence, where a

group of people pulled him over and onto ttap pitch.

As this man was passed over me,      I noticed that he was a white male in

his early twent ies with 1ong black shabby hai r that was down his

back.    He was wearing blue denims and a black short sleeve            *T ’

shirt.     I not i ced that he was very red and he was dribbling from the

corner of his mouth.

The match had only just begun and as this many6as          passed over the game
                            c a t   cSttvtjs- a t ~
was still    cont inui n g , I saw a few people spi yli ng onto the pitch

through a small gate in the fence behind tpa goal.

The pressure was sustai ned but I was now ystat              ^    ^ j QjIlQ j L x O

The game had been stopped for about 5 n ^ n u t e s , when I saw a m a n ^ o l

down in front of me, he fell face do^s onto the ter race amongst the

legs of the people in front where r lost sight of him.

I saw a barrier in f ront of me and cl imbed onto it, the man that had

collapsed must have gone under it when he fell.           Tha/barrier was

right by the fence between Pens 4 and 5,       I walked^sn the barrier to

the fence following another      lad who was helped rfver the fence,           he

then turned and hel ped me over into the gan\wj*y (5).

I walked down the gangway and onto the pitch,         the poli c / w e r e

initially asking us to stay off the playing area and>ftand on the

gravel    track,   I was so exhausted that I just     collapsed onto the pitch

where    I slowly recovered.

A policeman asked me if I was okay and I told him I wasn't too b a d ,

he told me to calm down and that everything would be okay.

I got up and wandered over to the track adjacent to the North S t a n d ,

I saw a youth 16/17 years      propped up against an advertising board,               he

was crying and said he c o ul dn ’t move his legs.       I summoned a

poli ceman who came over to us and then quickly checked over the youth

                                                                          S467

the injured youth.     The ambulanceman thought he had broken his back

and he was carried away.

The Nottingham fans were still    chanting,   this upset a group of

Liverpool    fans who began to run towards them,    they were turned back

by the police who shortly after    lined up across the pitch to prevent

trouble.

I would say that the main reason for this disaster was the mass of

people arriving through the tunnel to      Pens 3 & 4.

I saw nothing that I consider to be a criminal        offence.

Due to the large scale of this disaster,      I am of the opinion that

everyone concerned including Police,      Ground Officials and Fans were

so confused that no one realised for a long time, what was really

happening.    When it was finally realised that people were dying,

everyone did all they could to help.

Goi ng back to the youth I saw 1eani ng agai nst the North Stand

advertising boards.     I would describe him as a white male,        16 - 17

years,   slim build with short fair   (Light Brown)   hair,    he was wearing

light blue denim jeans and a faded yellowish tee shirt.

I was wear i ng light blue denim jeans,    a grey 'candy'   Liver pool    'away'

shirt and a Fred Flintstone white Tee      shirt,   H^Tec     sports shoes.

I am 5' 9 inches, medium build with short 1 iglnt brown hair.

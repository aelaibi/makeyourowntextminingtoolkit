There        were     many       other         fans         walking          fast    or       running        to       get to           the

stands.             It w a s     clear         from         the     demeanour           of m a n y      of     these people                   that

they    had        been     drinking               alcohol.

With     other        officers            1 told            the    persons         who     were       urinating               to       stop      it.

I heard a message                   come           o v er    the    tanoid         at     the       stadium asking                     people           to

clear        the    pitch and             return            to    the    spectator            area.          I assumed                 from     this

that    there         had       been      a    pitch         invasion.             The     location            I was          at       wa s    s t il l

very     busy and           I remained                wh e re      I w a s , neither                I or     the       officers               around

me    had     a Police           radio.

About        2-3 minutes            after           I heard            the    tanoid       message           several           police

officers,           1 believe             this        was        *F * C & V S q u a d           came        running           along           the

gangway           from     the    direction                 of    Leppings          Ln.       We     joined           them,        at     that

time     I believe              that      there          must      have       bean a serious                 public           order

I joined            the     other         officers            and       made    my way          to    the      pitch.              When        I was

in    sight         of    the p i t c h        I could            see    t h at     the    football            m a t ch was             not      in

play,        I did        not    see      any        players.            There       were       a    lar g e      number           of     people

on    th e    pitch        i t se l f .        I could            see    people         climbing           o v er      th e    fencing              at

the    Leppings            Ln    end      of       the      ground       onto       the    pitch.

I stood           on the        pitch         toward         the    N Stand          of    the       ground           still        at     this

stage        it    seemed        that         the           problem       was      public        order       one.        Ibelieve

there        was    a second           tanoid               message          of a    similar           c o n t e x t to the             first

one    1 mentioned.

I saw a man               laid    on      the       pitch         obviously          in    pain       being         attended              by    the
                                                                                                                                   /
St    Johns        ambulance           then         Ir e c e i v e d     information            that        there             had       been        a

crush        and    it w a s      believed                  someone          was    dead.            This    came h jf w o r d           of

I made        my way        closer            to    the      goal       mouth and          then       begysn to se e                   dead

                 the    people        I saw were            clearly        dead

                 From    the     supporters            on    the    pitch          there       was      rival      aggression          directed

                 towards        the       Police      officers          who      were     present.              I re c a ll    one     youth

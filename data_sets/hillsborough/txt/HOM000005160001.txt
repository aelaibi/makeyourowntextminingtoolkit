       TAYLOR REPORT - LORD FERRERS MEETING ON 10 JULY


       You reminded me that the briefing enclosed with my note of 4
       July omitted to deal with item 13 in your note of 26 June; CoÂ­
       ordination of Emergency Services.


       From enquiries made of the fire authorities and local
       authorities last September,   following the Interim Report, we
       understood that the emergency services had already implemented
       the interim recommendations or were well advanced in their
       plans to do so.


       A background note and line to take are annexed.

CO-ORDINATION OF EMERGENCY SERVICES

Background note


The Final Report made 5 recommendations (Nos 59-63, page 81)
on the co-ordination of emergency services.     These concerned:-



     (a)   regular liaison between senior nominated officers of
           police,   fire and ambulance services;


     (b)   advance circulation of full details of events to all
           3 services,   including anticipated or potential
           difficulties, and availability of such details in
           emergency service control rooms;


     (c)   lines of communication from police control room to
           local HQ's to be maintained at all times;


     (d)   contingency plans for arrival of emergency service
           vehicles to be reviewed; and


     (e)   briefing on contingency arrangements for police
           officers positioned at ground entrances.


Enquiries made of the fire authorities and local authorities
last September following the Interim Report indicated that the
emergency services had already implemented these
recommendations,     or that plans to do so were well advanced.


Line to take


Understand that action on these recommendations was quickly
taken following the Interim Report.      Ask Mr Anderton whether
he can confirm that the recommended arrangements have become
standard practice and whether he regards them as satisfactory.

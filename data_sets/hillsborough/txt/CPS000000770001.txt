   RE: HILLSBOROUGH: ADLINGTON -v- DUCKENFDELD & MURRAY

   Thank you for your letter of 25 August and enclosures which I received today. This included
   a copy of a four page letter to Mr Croston, a copy of a three page statement marked 101A,
   101B and 101C, and a red ring binder of material paginated 1-207.

   I confirm that I have sent all this material to Mr Croston at our York office from where this
   case is being handled.

   I want to make it clear that, although I have replied to some recent correspondence as acting
   Chief Crown Prosecutor during Ms Sharpling’s absence on annual leave, I will not play any
   part in the review process which is being handled by Mr Croston. This is because, as I
   believe you know, I was involved in the case and decision not to prosecute which was made
   some years ago after the West Midlands Police enquiry.

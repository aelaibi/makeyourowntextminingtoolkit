               I report       that     I am        currently engaged            in the    role of C u s t o d y Officer

               at Thorne.

               At 8.15 am Saturday,                       15 April     1989,   I commenced duty and was             later

               transp o r t e d    to the H i l l s b o r o u g h Football           Stadium,        Sheffield,     for a

               briefing       in the m ain stand a t ^ 9 „ 30 am that date.

               I was     in charge           of                        these jdu^u?s     prior   to the kick        off,

morning,      supporters         began to arrive             in the area,          all   appeared       good

h u m o u r e d and    there were     no particular              problems.

By    i pm the        pedestrian     traffic      had built         up and      it was      noticeable

that    some of the supporters were                    in possession of             cans    of alcohol.

Two    of my serial         were    placed     in L e p pings Lane and these                   officers were

preventing       supporters         continuing any further                  down L e p pings Lane

whilst     in p ossession of cans of alcohol.                        The fact        that      the supporter

in p ossession of alcohol              were     stopped by the              police,      created no

problems and the            supporters        were     quite      content     to    remain      in the area

to    consume    their alcohol         prior      to    continuing         towards       the    football

stadium.        At this      time    the weather           was    fine and dry,          it was    sunny and

at any one       time      there may have         been up to         150 supporters             at the mouth

of Leppings Lane,            sitting    on walls and              standing     in groups         drinking

their     alcohol.

The    pedestrian traffic            increased, and at just after S pm there was a

surge o f s u p p o r t e r s who were a c c o m p a n i e d by both officers                   on foot and

members      of the m o u n t e d section who              had just arri v e d by train at               the

Wads 1ey Bridge R a i l w a y Station.                 A g a i n there was         no problem wit h the

supporters and           they,     in the main,         went      down Leppings Lane            towards        the

ETtjuiium.

By about S . 55         pm it was     noticeable           that    the    pedestrian traffic was

easing    down        con s i d e r a b l y and at two or three minutes                  past   three,

a cting   on the        instru c t i o n of    I ns pe c t               e 1 1 , myself     and my serial

went    down Leppi n g s      Lane    towards        the     football      stadium where          our   next

s c heduled duty was          for    standby      duties         in one of the Force            coaches.

Leppings Lane           by this     time was     vir t u a l l y    clear of all           pedestrians and

upon arrival           at Leppings Lane         there were a p p r o x i m a t e l y 200          police

officers     on duty outside           the gate..          There were         very few suppo r t e r s          in

the area at this            time and after a few minutes                    at this        location we

were    instructed        to form a cordon across                  the m outh of the Leppi n g s
                                                                                                                      PAGE        3

                   Lane    entrance.      Information was           then     received that          the    football       match

                   had been stopped and               I immediately formed the opinion that                       there was

                   mass    fighting w i t h i n the ground amongst                the supporters.            Supporters

                   then began       leaving      the stadium via the Leppings Lane                      entrance and         it

                   was    obvious    from many of their            faces     that    they had been          in some form

                   of distress.        Many      of the supporters           began heckling          the    police    line,

                   shouting     that we should           be in the      ground to assist            the    disorder and

                   not    be stood     in the        position we occupied.            The    exit    by the supporters

                   b egan to    increase and after a few minu t e s                  I saw a male          being    carried

                   out of the L e p pings            Lane gate    by police       officers.         This    person was

              ®"   being    carried face         downwards,       his    body limp and I could see a liquid

                   c onstantly      running      from his mouth.           To    my horror      I realised that            the

                   man was     dead.     The     body was       placed on the        concrete       d r i v e w a y on the
       rtf'                                                                                         .
^                  right    hand side as one enters               the stad i u m from Leppings              Lane.     By

                   this time     there was a mass              exodus    from the stadium and s u p p o r t e r s

                         e chanting at         the    police,    "murderers,        you bastards,          i t ’s all your
^ ^I
                   fault." and similar               obscenities.       Further      bodies were          then carried

                   from the stadium and were               placed on the          right hand side           of the

                   driveway.        Injured      persons were        placed      on the     left    hand side       of the

                   d r i veway and     these     were being a t t e n d e d      to by police        officers       and

                   civilians.        Further         bodies were    brought       from the stadium and              placed

                   together along wit h              injured    persons.        The scene at this           time    could

                   only be d e s cribed as horrific.                Acting       under    the   instructions         of

                   Inspector Sykes,            my serial       along w ith other         officers,        then formed a

                   cordon in front        of the bodies           to screen the bodies              from the       view of

                   the    supporters who were            leaving the stadium.               In total       1 believe

                   there were       twelve      bodies    in this       l o c ation and at one stage              X saw a

                   lady aged a p p r o x i m a t e l y 30 years,         she was walking among              the    bodies

                   and was o b v i o u s l y    looking     for a particular           person.       She was       quite

                   composed     in view of the horrific                 circu m s t a n c e s that s u r r o u n d e d her
                                                                                                                     PAGE            A
                                                                                                                     R5?

           and after a few minutes                  she    left the area.              The s u pporters          continued

            to shout     o bscenities at the               police    lines and after about                  half an hour

           barricades were          placed         in front       of the bodies and these wre                    draped         in

           tarpauling         sheeting      therefore        screening          the bodies        from members         of

           the      public.

           The Fire Service and A m bulance Serv i c e were                            both    in a t t e n d a n c e and

           they were      exp e r i e n c i n g    great    difficulty,          p a r t icularly the A m bulance

           Serv i c e   in getting        into the stadium via the Leppings Lane                             entrance

            due to the supp o r t e r s           leaving.

           Part      of my serial       were       then d i r e c t e d e l s ewhere and          I remained        in this

           area until most          of the         bodies and the injured                had been       removed.           At

            one     stage at the      height        of the    incident,          whilst       forming      the    barricade

            in front     of the bodies,             near L e p p i n g s Larie gate,           I was a p p r o a c h e d    by

           an off duty fireman who                  offered his assistance.                    It was      obvious     from

           his appea r a n c e     that     he was        under    the    influence       of alcohol         and    I was

            under the opinion that                 he was    not    in any fit state to assist                     anyone

           and      I requested him to             leave the area.              This man       I later      noticed

            talking     to other      police        officers,       pres u m a b l y offering          his assistance

           and after about          quarter         of an hour       he    came back to me and               I escorted

            him from the ground.

            The     crowd were     ext r e m e l y hostile         towards       the    police and         on two occasion
s

            I found myself         isolated and            it became       apparent       to me the         dangers        in

            such a sit u a t i o n of being            isolated.          I remained          in the area         until

            a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 pm at w hich time all             the    supporters,         the    injured

            persons and the          bodies        had been       removed from the area.

            I later     returned to the H i l l s b o r o u g h Gro u n d and joined                    other members

            of the detail.

            I found the whole            incident         horrific and          left me with a stunned feeling.

              Report by PS 2881 Pearson - A2 Sub Division, Thorne
                                       (Serial 31)




I report that I am currently engaged in the role of Custody Officer at Thorne.


At 8.15 am Saturday, 15 April 1989, I conmenced duty and was later transported
to the Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield, for a briefing in the main
stand at 9.30 am that date.


I was in charge of Serial 31, these duties prior to the kick off, being to
supervise the pedestrians and coaches at the roundabout at the junction of
Leppings Lane and Pennistone Road.


My serial consisted of the following officers:


                  PC   919 Evans
                  PC 1934 Smith

After briefing, my serial took up their respective duties at the location
outlined above at approximately 11 am.     Throughout the morning, supporters began
to arrive in the area, all appeared good humoured and there were no particular
problems.


By 1 pm the pedestrian traffic had built up and it was noticeable that some
of the supporters were in possession of cans of alcohol.       Two of my serial were
placed in Leppings Lane and these officers were preventing supporters continuing
any further down Leppings Lane whilst in possession of cans of alcohol.       The
fact that the supporters in possession of alcohol were stopped by the police,
created no problems and the supporters were quite content to remain in the area
to consume their alcohol prior to continuing towards the football stadium.
At this time the weather was fine and dry, it was sunny and at any one time
there may have been up to 150 supporters at the mouth of Leppings Lane, sitting
on walls and standing in groups drinking their alcohol.


The pedestrian traffic increased and at just after 2 pm there was a serge of
supporters who were accompanied by both officers on foot and members of the
mounted section who had just arrived by train at the Wadsley Bridge Railway
Station.   Again there was no   problem with the supporters and they, in the main,
went down Leppings Lane towards the Stadium.


By about 2.55 pm it was noticeable that the pedestrian traffic was easing down
considerably and at two or three minutes past three, acting on the instruction
of Inspector Millett, myself and my serial went down Leppings Lane towards the
football stadium where our next schedulled duty was for stand by duties in one
of the Force Coaches.   Leppings Lane by this time was virtually clear of all
pedestrians and upon arrival at Leppings Lane there were approximately 200 police
officers on duty outside the gate.   There were very few supporters in the area
at this time and after a few minutes at this location we were instructed to
form a cordan across the mouth of the Leppings Lane entrance.    Information was
then received that the football match had been stopped and I iranediately formed
the opinion that there was mass fighting within the ground amongst the
supporters.   Supporters then began leaving the stadium via the Leppings Lane
entrance and it was obvious from many of their faces that they had been in some
form of distress.   Many of the supporters began heckling at the police line,
shouting that we should be in the ground to assist with the disorder and not
be stood in the position we occupied.   The exit by the supporters began to
increase and after a few minutes I saw a male being carried out of the Leppings
Lane gate by police officers.   This person was being carried face downwards,
his body was limp and I could see a liquid constantly running from his mouth.
To my horror I realised that this man was dead.   The body was placed on the
concrete driveway on the right hand side as one enters the stadium from Leppings
Lane.   By this time there was a mass exodus from the stadium and supporters
were chanting at the police, "murderers, you bastards, it's all your fault"
and similar obscenities.   Further bodies were then carried from the stadium
and were placed on the right hand side of the driveway.    Injured persons were
placed on the left hand side of the drive way and these were being attended
to by police officers and civilians. Further bodies were brought from the stadium
and placed together along with injured persons.   The scene at this time could
only be described as horrific.     Acting under the instructions of Inspector
Sykes, my serial along with other officers,    then formed a cordan in front of
the bodies to screen the bodies from the view of the supporters who were leaving
the stadium.     In total I believe there were twelve bodies in this location and
at one stage I saw a lady aged approximately 30 years, she was walking among
the bodies and was obviously looking for a particular person.     She was quite
composed in view of the horrific circumstances that surrounded her and after
a few minutes she left the area.    The supporters continued to shout obscenities
at the police lines and after about half an hour barricades were placed in front
of the bodies and these were draped in tarpaulling sheeting therefore screening
the bodies from members of the public.


The Fire Service and Ambulance Services were both in attendance and they were
experiencing great difficulty, particularly the Ambulance Service in getting
into the stadium via the Leppings Lane entrance due to the supporters leaving.


Part of my serial were then directed elsewhere and I remained in this area until
most of the bodies and the injured had been removed.    At one stage at the height
of the incident, whilst forming the barricade in front of the bodies, near
Leppings Lane gate, I was approached by an off duty fireman who offered his
assistance.    It was obvious from his appearance that he was under the influence
of alcohol and I was under the opinion that he was not in any fit state to assist
anyone and I requested him to leave the area. This man I later noticed talking
to other police officers, presumably offering his assistance and after about
quarter of an hour he came back to me and I escorted him from the ground.


The crowd were extremely hostile towards the police and on two occasions I found
myself isolated and it became apparent to me the dangers in such a situation
of being isolated.    I remained in the area until approximately 5 pm at which
time all the supporters, the injured persons and the bodies had been removed
from the area.


I later returned to the Hillsborough Ground and joined other members of the
detail.


I found the whole incident horrific and left me with a stunned feeling.

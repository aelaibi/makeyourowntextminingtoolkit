At    10 am       ( 1 0 0 0 ) the officers     on duty were a s s e m b l e d    in the N o rt h Stand

for jariefing by Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Duckenf ie 1 d .             Very   little

i n f o r m at io n was a v a i l a b l e   regarding what     numbers were e xp ected            to

travel      to the ground without              tickets.     Serials were        to     be briefed      by

d es ig n a t e d    Inspectors.         In the event my Serial      received          no d et ailed

br i ef i n g .     However       the    O perational   Order was a de quate and carried

s ufficient          information         to enable me     to brief my Serial           on their

duties.           I was   in p ossession of a Burdept            radio.

There was         very    little m ov ement                of fans along P en istone Rd N until

approximately            1.30 pm          ( 1 3 3 0 ).    F ro m this      time on the flow of fans                    both

towards      the ground and north towards Wads 1ey Bridge                                    increased.           A

 onside r a bl e     number          of    Pans were asking               directions       for    *

public      house,       a considerable                  number   of fans were a p p r o ac hi ng          others

saying      "Any spares."                 In general         the fans were           in good humour,           well

behaved but         in general were                 standing a ro u n d and seemed                reluctant           to

make     their way to the jg^ound.                        j^arge numbers were             carrying      cans      of

jaeer and     lager oby/tously purchased from other                                than public        houses.              I

p ersonally a d v is ed a number                    of these fans            on the     implications         of

trying      to enter       the ground w it h alcohol                      in their      possession.          The

stock     reply was        " I ’ll drink            it before        I   A&t    in the ground mate."                   I

noticed at         this time          that       ’The Ga,te'✓'publ i c house was open and

a l lo w i n g Liverpool         s upporters             to enter.



At 2 .3 0    pm    <1430)      I notic ed a ma rk ed               increase        in the number          of fans

approaching         from the Wads ley Bridge area.                             A high     proportion of these

fans     had obviously been drinking,                         they were         chanting slogans,

d is or d e r l y and were male                persons ma in ly           in the age group of             18 to 25

y ears    of age.         Some       coaches we re still                 arriving at this time.



At 2 .45     prn (1445)       there was a ma rk ed decrease                        in the flow of fans                 to

the ground,         a lt h o u g h    I saw four            coaches       o ff-loading       their     passengers

on Hali fa x Road to the north of W a ds le y Bridge.                                   The fans      from these

coaches were much the same as                             those   des cr ib ed      in the     preceding

paragraph.          Because          the flow of fans had d ecreased to a trickle                                 I

deci de d to assemble                the Serial            outside       ’The T r a v e l l e r ^ R e s t * w i t h a

of C a tc hbar L n/Leppings              Ln).



At 2 .5 0     pm      (1450)    t he Serial      was    delayed at a disturbance at             "The

Gate * involving Liverpool                    supporters and       local    residents.        This

d i s tu rb ance was          quelled by the officers at te nd in g            leaving       some       sixty

supp or te rs         still    in the    premises.        1 radioed      control a dv is in g       them of

the s it ua ti on and           requesting       that we be       relieved by other          officers          in

order     that        the Serial       could go on with          phase 2.     The    response was             that

they had no officers a v a i la bl e at that time.                         I was              opinion

that the serial w o ul d be better                     deployed nearer JSme ground so               I

advised       control         that    I was    joining    1 nspe/tos/rli 1 lett      in order       to

commence        phase 2.         Being aufait wit h the            layout    of Leppings Ln/West

s ta nd entrance and aware                of the       large   number    of fans     I had seen

a p p r o a ch i ng    the ground       late    I thought      there may be some           problems       on

L ep p in g s Ln.



At 2.5 5      pm      (1455)    I jo in ed     Inspector Hillett a nd other Serials at                        the

j un ct io n of Leppings L n / C l a ^ / ^ e e l s Ln.            It was most       noticeable          that

large      q uantities         of bottle and          canned beers      had been d i s c ar de d at           this

point along w ith empties.                     I became aware       of an    increase       in radio

traffic,        one     parti cular      officer was       very anxi ou s about           the s ituation

at a gate and            requesting       that    it should be opened and that                fans were

in danger          of being      crushed.        At    least   three    requests were made              for    the

gate     to be opened.               It was    c 1ear that the      problem was at the West

stand.



At 3 pm (1500) wit h other                    serials    under    the   command/*bf       Inspector

Mil le tt     we a p p r o a c h e d the ground by way of L e p ^ n g s             Ln.     On arrival at

the g round           it a p p e a r e d to me that Police         officers    o ut nu mbered       fans at

this    point,    what    fans were     outside      the ground were           being      prevented

from entering        the ground.        Radio     traffic at this           point a p p e a r e d to be

■Frequent and urgent.              It was a pp arent      to me there was            problems      in the

ground.        A c onsiderable       number    of fans were milling about                  in the

d i r e c ti o n of Catchbar Ln.        I was under        the    impression they had been

p ushed back by the officers              in L ep pings Ln.          A number        of fans were

i rrate,    aggressive,       and ho 1 ding tickets           up demandiirn^n),ry to the

qround.         A senior     officer then ordered a cordj^n to be f ormed a cross
                                                    “ 7 ^ -----         -------------
the entrance        on L ep pings Ln.   At this pa in* hav i ng f o rmed the cordon

we were     joined by officers          from Mo^int^j^fl Branch.           A fan a p p r o a c h e d me

very    irrate,     it was a pp ar en t    h e ’d been drinking and was waving                     his

arms about        holding a ticket saying            " I ’ve got a ticket" and was

dema nd in g    entry to the ground.            I a d v i s e d him that       fans were      not being

a l l o w e d to enter    because     of a serious        incident       in the West        stand.

This   particular        fan became more aggr es si ve and was a p p r o a c h e d                by a

M o u n t e d officer who a d v i s e d him     in strong        terms    to   leave     the area.

The y ou th a t t e m p t e d to    push the    police horse away and                in doing      so    lost

his    balance and fell        bene at h the horses          hooves.       He got up and

i mm ed ia te ly struck a stone         pillar with his           right fist         causing his

knuckles       to split.      An older man then took him a way saying                       " I ’ve seen

it all,     its    ridiculous,       h e ’ll complain,       I ’m a w itness."            It was at

this    point that       I heard a message         on the      radio     for all a v a i la bl e

o fficers      to enter    the ground.         At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3.05    pm   (1505)    I

e nt er e d the ground by way of the gate                 leading      to the       rear of the West

stand and the tunnel           feedj^ffg the t e r r a c e s .     The Serial at this              point

fragmented.         On e nt *Sr iBg the space at the             rear of the stand           I was met

by a scene        of utter    confusion.        Fans    stood     in groups some angry,                 some

distressed.         Police    officers a ss i s t e d by civilians were                  trying    to

resus ci ta te     people on the ground.             Fans were       laying        on the floor

unattended.         I went    to the    tunnel and w it h the assis ta nc e                of other

officers          pulled a male      person o u t , his finqp^ ia iI s were                  blue,     there

was    fluid       coming from his mouth and nostrils,                        thejw was      no sign of a

pulse.           11 a pp e a r e d to me he was dea^N             T h e ra/was a strong s m e 11 of

al c o h o l ,     Attempts made         to    resusruate        tbjfe    man were without           suecess.

I was     then      involved     in a s s i st in g w i t h/Che        dead and       injured.       Fans were

s tood a b o u t , some were angry,               soma/were       distressed,          a large      number

were d r u n k , some we re p hysically               i nte rf e r r i ng with officers.               I

personally          had to s tr ongly advise             fans    to    leave the area.            L iq u i d was

pouring down the back               of the stand.



I was     later given to under st an d that                 this was urine.               I could see

damage      being      caused to the           covered stair wa y of the stand                 I was       unable

to respond to this,

                                                                                                                         ]



It seeme d to me that              the    remaining       fans    in the West stand w ou ld be

leaving      the ground and there was                 every      likelihood this w ould

interefere with the Police                     o peration   involving          tpe    dead and      injured.

W ith what a vailable manp ow e r was ava ilable ajm wit h the ass istance                                      of

some Liverpool            supporters          I fortned a cord<fri to          prevent these         fans

leaving      by way of the gate                leading   tcyohe service              road at the       rear of

the    stand where         the dead a nd         injured were          being a s s e m b l e d awaiting

colle ct io n by ambulance.



T h ro ug ho ut     the   latter    part of this          incident         I w i t n e s s e d officers      who

were distressed,            s ic ke ne d by the whole            incident        being s u b j ec te d to

              Fu rt h er      to my        previous statement         I can now a dd a de s c r i pt i on to the

               body       I m e n t i o n e d on pages 5 + 6        w he n    1 first     saw the body        I was     in the

               q ua dr a ng l e a re a between gate C and the tunnel.                         Several      officers and a

               W PG were          carrying      the body out of the tunnel.                  I grabbed his          legs and

               a s s i s t e d them at a point about 5 yards                    into the quadrangle            from the

               tunnel we           laid the body down and tried to                     resuscitate      him as d es cribed

               in my other statement.

               I can recall              that   the body was that of a white male,                     18— 20 years— aid

               av er a ge     height        but heavy build not fat but m us cular                   he had short        fair

               W h il s t    dealing wit h the young and the dead that                         day I can recall          one

               body w ea ri n g a gold             ring type sleeper           earring      in its    left e a r .      I ’m

               not sure           if that       relates   to the body I ’m describing.

                 That     body had a coloured shirt                but   I c a n ’t recall what         colour.        It

                 c e r ta inly w a s n ’t white.          I used    it to wipe      the vomit from his face

                 before        giving m outh to m o u t h .        The   shirt was     undone      because      I remember

                 s eeing       the mens     body.

                 He was        clean s h a v e n .   He was wearing        blue   jeans and had blue and w h i t e

^        i<rfe   t rouse r s .     He had m ou s e y hair.

                 As a result          of what     the doctor said         I left the b o d y .in the care of

     £           a no th e r    officer who      I d o n ’t know.        I then was enga ge d         in ensuring           the

                 injured were          taken care of.

December! 989   A NEWS LETTER FOR PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER   Number 3
               A M essage from th e heart
     The countdown is on again: the shops are
     brimming with turkeys, trimmings and
     talc, and mostpeople appear to be rushing
     around in an effort to make everything
     perfect for the big day.
     It seems like business as usual....
     But for others, Christmas has taken on a
     more poignant meaning:
     this year we experienced a tragedy which
     cost 95 precious lives and left us with
     damaging and painful mental scars.
     For our friends who lost loved ones at
     Hillsborough, the memories of past Christmases will be heightened and, inadequate
     as words always are in such circumstances, we hope you can gain comfort from each
     other, your friends and families.
     Those of us who survived will also have plans, but no matter where we are or what
     we do, the memories of April 15 won’t be very far away.
     Lives were changed on that tragic day, and rebuilding them will take a lot longer than
     the brief moments it took for them to be shattered. But perhaps the end of 1989 will
     be a symbolic step forward in itself: we can now leave this dreadful year behind, and
     that may be a reason to look forward to 1990 with some hope.
     It only takes a second for one year to fade out and another to replace it, but we all wish
      that those moments can signal some kind of new beginning for everyone of us in
     distress.
     It will be the hardest Christmas many people have ever had to face, and amidst all the
      hectic activity it is important not to forget that mutual support is still vital.
     There are no miracle words to take away the hurt, but sharing your feelings can some
      times help to make them easier to cope with.
     No-one should feel isolated at any time, so if you need help, there will always be
      someone there for you.
     To everyone affected by the Hillsborough tragedy, we send our prayers and best
     wishes for a peaceful Christmas and New Year.
     T.L.

Everyone will be aware that the coming year will bring many issues surrounding Hillsborough sharply into
focus, not least the publication of the Taylor Report and the inquest into the deaths of loved ones. We see the
role of ‘Interlink’ in these circumstances as keeping those involved informed of developments over a wide
range of interests, and providing a place to air comments and express views. With this in mind we have asked
relevant groups for a regular input into ‘Interlink’ in order to deal with these issues. As you will see, we have
included several features here aimed at giving information and advice. For future issues we expect regular
contributions from:-
     ■ The Hillsborough Steering Committee who have agreed to provide information regarding legal action
    and compensation claims.
    ■ The Liverpool City Council Working Party, and the Edge Hill College, who will report on the coverage
    of the inquiry and the inquests.
    ■ The social workers who will give specialist advice on coping with the problems experienced since the
    tragedy.
Also it is important to provide a place for personal thoughts to be expressed.
    ■ ‘Answerback’ will provide a space for letters and comments of all kinds. There will be no editing of
    any contributions we receive. We only ask that bad language be avoided.
    ■ Contact point gives people the chance to get in touch, or make enquiries.
    ■ Pen pals page will enable those affected to have the chance to write to each other.
We hope Interlink’ will continue to provide support to all those affected by Hillsborough and we look forward
to hearing from you and receiving contributions from anyone who finds it useful to put pen to paper.
We wish you all a peaceful Christmas and hope that the new Year will bring comfort to us all......

                 THROUGHOUT THE CHRISTMAS PERIOD

Now more than 40 volunteers staff the helpline 24 hours a day, listening, advising, helping.
Their co-ordinator Mrs Eleanor Grundy said: "The Helpline is still a vital need - we are still getting calls
from people - especially young people - who are only now finding problems coming to the surface".
The Helpline is managed by Liverpool Council for Voluntary Service whose Chief Executive, Edward
Murphy, said,”We are immensely grateful to the Hillsborough Disaster Fund Trustees for providing the
money to keep this service going”.
The city’s voluntary organisations have worked closely with the local authorities ever since the disaster
and are happy to be taking over the Helpline as the authorities always hoped they would.
The Hillsborough centre closes at 12 noon on Friday 22 December and re-opens at 8.30am on Wednesday
27 December.

From Stoke - on - Trent
We have been present at three memorial
presentation evenings and we know of three
more to come next year, tributes to our son.
It is difficult for us but somehow because
we know he would have appreciated it, we
carry on.
Now there is talk of yet another memorial;
a garden this time in our own city, a re-
minder to all football fans of the tragic
occurrence at Hillsborough, dedicated to
the 95 that died.
in the next few weeks/days I’m sure we are
all going to feel awful. Christmas is a time when we think of others, a time
when we show our love to our families and friends; what can we do about
the huge gap in our hearts and homes this year?
We can try and support one another. It is even more important now, just
a phone call to someone who is going through the same, someone who
understands how you feel, can help.
Please lets remember and help one another and also think of the survivors
who will carry forever the sights of that fateful day.

became clear so many supporters had lost their lives at Hillsborough. My sympathy goes to
the bereaved families all over the country and all Merseyside people who stood shoulder to
shoulder in their response to the disaster.
Football people around the country and around the world have always marvelled at the way
both Liverpool and Everton supporters could gather together as friends and rivals at derby
matches. This was a special quality in happy times and has been a great strength in tragedy.
Going back to a match for the first time is not an easy step, but it is a big step. I experienced
my first match on the evening of Wednesday May 3rd 1989 - the ‘derby’. It wasn’t easy for
me that night as I was on my own.
I only managed to watch 30 minutes of the match that night; 20 minutes of the first half and
 10 minutes of the second half. There was still so much heartache, sadness and pain inside me
that night, and there still is. All those memories came flooding back to me on that very emo­
tional night.
I went back that night in respect for those who died, and with thoughts for those who had lost?
 a loved one at Hillsborough. Seeing that banner at Goodison that night said it all. It was seen
by millions.
 It expressed thanks from the Kop and said, “We never walked alone”.
 That latter sentence rings so true.
 For those we loved don’t go away,
 But walk beside us every day.

The resson I written this I do not Know. As this story productivly like a lot of others.
The 15th April was just like anyover Saturday for me or so it was that day when I got up that Saturday. I w a 0
going to hairdressers at 2.45 then I was going to get the train up to see my mum. As my brother had gone to
see Liverpool playaway and our mum always did worry when he went to see them playaway.
So when I got there she wasn’t herself. I knew that there was something wrong the minute I got there, my mum
ask me if I saw news about Hillsbours game. Just then the news came up on the T. V. again and it said that five
had die at the front with this my mum was starting to worry, but my dad and my other brother peter said he
was a big boy now, he could look after himself. And when the news come T. V. again it said there was about
50 who had died at the front. So by now we was all begining to worry. As we knew Tommy always like to
get down the front. So when the phone number came up to ring we was on phone from 4.30 until after 10 and
the 6 or so hours we was on the phone trying to answer was so trying I would not like to put anyone through
it again not now or ever, and all that time we all was hoping and some of the time even praying he would be
alright, he just had to be. Then around 10.30 who should walk in the door was ou r brother the one we was
begining to think we would never see again. He was not injury on the outside, but on the inside he was hurt
by what he saw that day and that hurt he was feeling was going to take a very long time to go away. But we
got him back that day, which is more than a lot of familys did.

     Hr. S.L. Popper,
     H.M. Coroner,
     Watery Street,
     Sheffield,
     S3 7ES.

     Dear Mr. Popper,

     Please find enclosed the Major Disaster list.

     I refer to the second page of the document, MAJAX No. 29 - Adam Spearitt.
     This clearly shows that Adam Spearitt went to the General Intensive Care
     Unit of the Northern General Hospital, dying on the day of admission and
     I have subsequently learned that                 I, Consultant Anaesthetist
     in Intensive Care dealt., with Adam Spearitt.  He did not write anything
     in the notes, due to the severe pressure on him at that time In dealing
     with the large number of patients requiring intensive care.

     I hope this clears up the anomaly in my statement.


     Yours sincerely,




     J. WARDROPE   F.R.C.S.
     Consultant in Accident and Emergency Medicine.

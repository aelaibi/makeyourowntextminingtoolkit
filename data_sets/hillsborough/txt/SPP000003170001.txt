File Note 6th July 1999 about 2.15 p.m.

I had a conversation with Chris Dorries shortly before writing this note..

Mr. Dorries said that Ann Adlington had rung him about various matters. They were
appreciative that I had raised the matter with the DPP without pressure from them.
She was concerned that the file note had not been released by Mr. Croston. Mr.
Dorries agreed that in principle it was better not to release file notes but if need be one
might have to do so. I said that Mr. Croston had disclosed if anything more than was
in the file note and I read it to Mr. D. He felt that I should wait to see if there was any
request for th is.

He also wanted to know where they could look in the archives for the statement and
I said perhaps CC5F1/7 to CC5/F1/9 but I could not say whether they would contain
the copy statement. He said that if they found it he would tell Ms A. A. that he had the
a copy of the statement.

                    On Saturday 15th April            1989 I. had been at work daring the morning,,

                    There were a number of both Nottingham Forest and Liverpool fans around

                    the area from about 10.30 am.                   From around 11 am and afterwards I did

                    see a number of both sets of fans drinking from cans walking along the

                                     "he fans w e re a 11 g o o d h um 0 u re d ta Ik in g to ea eh o t h e r

                    At about 3.230 pm the garage closed and I left by car,                            I drove along

                    Leppings Lane and off shopping along Worres Rd.                            The fans 1 passed were

                    behaving normally.            I finished the shopping at about 1 pm and then went

                    home, t,o                     |«here I stayed in until 2.30 pm.                   I then went to

               ^/the Rose and Crown pub                                                           uhere as I went in

         there were about 50 Liverpool fans either just leaving the pub or

       / 'finishing off their drinks and then walking from the pub in the

         direction of the ground.        The fans I saw were well behaved and were not

         drunk.      The Rose and. Crown is about a mile from the football ground.

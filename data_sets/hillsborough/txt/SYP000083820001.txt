            I am a Police Sergeant      in the South Yorkshire Police            presently

            stationed at Hammerton Road Police Station,               Sheffield,    <F 1 Sub-

            Division) .

            My full name      is Dennis PIERPOINT,    29 years,       date of b i r t h _________

            collar number 2665.

            On 15 April      1 989, I was a Police Constable stationed at Attercl if fe

            Police Station,     Sheffield   (D2 Sub-Division).

            I was originally included in the F.A. Cup semi-final                 operational

            order,   however due to a shortage of drivers on the               *C ’ rota duty group

            at that station my place was taken by a 'non-driver'                 PC 575 Hemborough

            of D2 Sub-Division.

            1 worked a 6am - 6pm duty on that date covering D261                 car beat duties.

            This beat covers the Wi ncobank area of Sheffield,
                                                                                  P A G E -:

           I had no actual   involvement    in the policing of the football match.

           However   I did attend an incident at 2.30pm on that date which appeared

           to concern football    fans.    This was a complaint   received from

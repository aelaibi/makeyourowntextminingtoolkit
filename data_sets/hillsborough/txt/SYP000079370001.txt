                   I am a single man living with my mother at the above address for the

                   last year.

                   On Saturday 15th April                   1989 (150489?              I went to H i lls bo ro ug h to watch

                   the F«A. Cup Semi-Final                    football game between Liverpool F.C, and

                   Nottingham Forest F.C.                       I went as a L i v e r - s u p p o r t e r .

                   I am a season ticket holder                        for Liverpool F.C. and as such X got my

                   ticket from my voucher at Anfie'ld.                                I paid £6 for the Leppings Lane ,

                   standing area.                                                                       '

                                                                             S2363

entering Sheffield we were delayed for 20 minutes due to the volume of

traffic.

We arrived at the Stanley Gate public: house at 2.15pm              (1415) where we

were dropped off?       the coach carried on to one of the organised parking

a re a s .

We walked toyChe ground arriving at the entrance to the ground, at

P .25 pm     (1/^25) it was a case of following the people down,        there was no

n e e r        directions, although there were a few police a r o u n d .

There were no queues for the turnstiles           it was a large crowd of

people,       stretching back out beyond the outer blue railing gates,           the

moment       I entered the crowd to try to get to a turnstile.          I was s p 1it

up from my friends.         The only police    I. saw where three mounted

officers who were trying to organise queues,            they were shouting to

move    back and pushing with their horses,        but people couldn't move

because of the people who were arriving behind them.

I eventually got to a turnstile,         1 was almost    literally carried there,

not    in control of my own movements,        and then when 1 tried to get

through it was difficult because more than one person at a time was

trying to go through a gap designed for one person.

I managed to get through a turnstile,           it was the fifth from the left,

having been to the ground before 1 knew where I was goring.               Prior to

going through the turnstile         I had seen one or twpXpoliee on top of the

jkursnti l e s, they again were telling       people     move back,   but it was

impossible.        Fans were climbing up t h e ^ m d s and over the turnstiles,

just to get out of the crush, which was so bad people were being

passed over head towards the back,          from the front by the turnstiles.

After I handed my whole ticket         in at V p ^ ~ turnstile,   I waited and

looked for any of my friends durLpfg which time the concertina gate to

the r 1ght of the turnstiles            open and crowds of people were coming

in.     I waited for abput 3/minutes for my friends but I d i d n ’t see any
                                                                                                 P AGb.   3
                                                                                                 S2363

               of them,      so I decided to carry on into the terraces to get a viewing

               point.       Between going through the turnstile and getting on to the

               terraces      I saw no police or stewards giving directions.             1 saw no

               signs directing       people to the terraces,           and although I ’ve been to the

               ground before I was not aware that you could get on to the terraces

               around the sides of the West Stand.

               I went with the crowd and walked down the tunnel,                 the tunnel although

               crowded,     was not that bad that if I had wanted to turn round and come

               back out again I w ou l d n ’t have been able to,            it was free of

               obstruction.


 I'*
               When I came out of the tunnel           I went to the r i o f        the fence with

               the intention of making my way to the cen>re of the pen.                  However,

               from the moment       I entered the pen ag^fn 1 was out of control of rny own

               movement,      I hav.e marked on the g j / i d   map,    1 was shown, where I started

               in the pen and where         I enk^xdp.        I got on to the terraces at about

               2 . 5 5 pm (1455) the players were on the g jJ e -c h warming up.

               I was not aware of the barrier                          in the pen, although when the
                                                      O '
               crowds were clearing         I realised I must have been quite close to it.

               I was      pushed down the pen until         I eventually ended up near to the

               front fence, about        10 feet f^im the gate onto the pitch.           As I was

         jrf pushed down the pen I Ig/fked to my left and saw tw^-S&ds who were on
                                                    "I     gf
       (&+> my coach, t h a t ’s ftarj/LEWIS and Stepnen KyBER^PS, looking at the grid

             , map I      would place them as Carl at 6G andMStephen at 6 H .           They were

               both facing the front, I          could only see their heads and faces and they

  flJjf        were obviously i n distress and pain as they were shouting.                   I

       /to    d o n ’t    think they saw me.      Before I reached t>© front        I went down on

/y/£s*. /     to my       knees thats when I     got bruising tff/my legs, as I was trampled

               on.       I was stuck down at the front o r the pen for a good 20-25

               minutes,      during which time it was difficult to breath.             I eventually

               managed to get out by pushing my way back up the pen.                  While I was at
                                                                                                  PAGE    4

                      he front of the pen I saw people        climbing out over tjrfe      front fence,

                     the game was          being    played,   but the police y e r e      stopping them and

                     put them bag£ in through the gate,         I don" l / j ^ a l 1 the match being

                     stopped b«at saw people being passed out over the fence who

                     appeared life less,    one boy in particular,         he was about    13, wearing

                     either a blue or green top,     jeans and training shoes.

                     When I got to the back of the pen I waited and looked around for any

                     of mates,   I eventually found one and left the ground to go back to the

              ^ t ^ c o a c h at about 4^ OQpm (1600).
VIV   d < \      \

         ^       'We went back to the Stanley Gate pub and waited for everyone,                  thats

                     when we eventually discovered that Carl and Stephen were m i s s i n g , but

                     it w a s n ’t until the next day that 1 found out they had both died.

'• y                 From getting to Sheffield until      leaving       I saw no violence,    fighting,

                     drunkensss or anything of a criminal nature.

                     In my opinion,   the fences segregating t e’ y#' pens contributed towards the

                     deaths and injuries,    if they h a d n ’t j*een there    people would have been

                     able to spread along the terraces

                     The   police appeared slow to re^ct to the situation and realise the

                     seriousness of the incidei\txand open the gates at the bottom of the

                     pens .

                     I feel that in view of the disaster the barriers on to pitches and the

                     •fences segregating   pens should be removed from all grounds,

                   several         yideo recordings and photographs taken at Hillsborough

                   Football Stadium on Saturday the 15th of April                                      1989 (150489).

                   Having viewed the videos on a video recording referenced MAPI                                        I was

                    Having viewed the video recording and photographs referenced PR 1 and

                    D B 16 I am quite happy that I was                             in fact f urther to the right of Pen 3

         as you look from the pitch.      I have indicated my position on a pIan

         reference number DARI.

         Whilst    I was in Pen 3 I saw a man lying on the terrace I saw that he

         was dead,   I would describe him as a white man with black hair., he was

         very tu bby . He was w earing a white t-shirt.

         1 saw this man a little time later and I saw that he had a Police

         tunic placed over his head. This man was later carried by fans back up

         the terrace towards the tunnel,      he was lying in front of gate 3

         halfway up the terrace,      I was unable to identify either Carl or

         Stephen on the video or photographs but they would have been in front

         of me and further to my right as you look from the pitch,      I cannot be

         specific where.

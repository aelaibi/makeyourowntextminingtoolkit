Dear


I have been asked to reply to your letter of 5 December to the
Prime Minister about Lord Justice Taylor's report into the
Hillsborough tragedy. These issues are principally matters for
the Home Office.


I understand your concerns that all seated accommodation will not
necessarily change the attitude of some of those who attend
football matches. There will undoubtedly be some people like
yourself who regret the passing of open terraces. Lord Justice
Taylor recognised that there is no panacea which will achieve
total safety and which will cure all the behaviour and crowd
control problems at such matches. However, he was satisfied that
seating does more to achieve these objectives than any other
single measure. He believed that significant improvements in the
amenity of spectators may help to remove the conditions which
tend to cause problems of public order and safety. The government
has accepted that view.


Some clubs face difficult decisions on how best to proceed. Some
will wish to move away from existing, sometimes out of date,
premises and obtain new purpose built accommodation, where this
is a practicable option. Others may reduce the amount of standing
accommodation at existing grounds.


Not all clubs will be able to make progress at the same rate.
Given the arguments which were expressed in Lord Justice Taylor's
report in support of the recommendations, the government feels
that there is no case at the moment for relaxing the final date
by which spectators attending football league grounds should be
admitted only to all seated accommodation (August 1994 for First
and Second Division grounds; August 1999 for Third and Fourth
    Division grounds.) However, provided that there is satisfactory
    progress towards achieving the deadline, strict adherence to the
    interim stages may not always be appropriate.




    Yours sincerely

 Bear       P r i m e Minister-,-

 Congratulations                      a n d "best, wishes..

 I    d o n ’t d o u b t         that       y o u Biav© t o o '                          your        mind       to    seriously             take
 action         on m y       letter.             I have          decided           to w r i t e       it n e v e r t h e l e s s        as       it
 does       seem      that        you may           be u n i q u e           among       o ur    top p o l i t i c i a n s         inasmuch
 as    you have             stood        on    football           terraces            to    support             your       local       team.

^feinnot        something              be     done     to n u l l i f y           the m o s t        absurd          decisions          of       the
 Taylor         report?               The     Hillsborough                  tragedy        tears          no    relation          to    the       small
 3rd     and      4th       division           clubs        with        crowds        often between                   2,000       and       4»©®0.
 Although            , as        so    ofte^.,       the P o l i c e          seem       to h a v e        got       the m a j o r      blame
 for     t he     terrible             tragedy         at    Sheffield               the    bulk          of    foofball          supporters
 "believe         it w a s        c a u s e d by       considerable                 numbers           of       Liverpool          supporters
 who     travelled               without         tickets          being           sure     that       by       creating        enough
 pressure            outside           the     ground        they would               be    able          to    force       their way
 inside,          which          they       did with         terrible              results.
 It    is    nonsense             to     force       small        clubs           to h a v e     all       seater          stadiums.              It
 is    only n o n - f ootball                  supporters               who       have     never          stood       on    terraces             to
 watch       their          local        team       who     think           that     there       is       something          terrible             in
 standing.                The     comradeship               on    th e       terraces           is m u c h          greater       than        being
 hemmed         into        seats.            I am     74 y e a r s o n l d a n d I s t i l l p r e f e r to s t a n d a n d
 watch       Leyton          Orient           or G i l l i n g h a m         (I    come     originally                from     t he M e d w a y
 Towns)         than        to    s it      c o o p e d up       in     a stand.            In       an    emerge e n c y         it    is m u c h
 easier         to    vacate           standing           supporters               that     people             in    a stand.           The
 Bradford            tragedy           is     a case        in point.               The     real          danger        at H i l l s b o r o u g h
 was     t he     barriers             prevented^            quick movement                     of    people.              There       is     also
 the     naive        belief           by     some     people           that       seats        prevent             vandalism          and
 disturbance.                    If    hooligans            and       determined            to       create          mischief          seats
will        not      stop        t h i s.      In    fact        t he       seats     are       torn up             and used       as m i s s i l e s
It     is    easier          to u p r o o t         seats        than        concrete           crush          barriers.           It       is    not
 possible            to     eradicate            all      risk where               people        are       gathered          together             and

 passions            a re    aroused.

Very many             of     t he      smaller         football              league        clubs          are       struggling          to
 survive.             By     forcing           them       to h a v e         all    seater           stadia          their     problems               a re
 vastly         increased.                  Many     will        be     unable        to    develop             their       present
 grounds          and will             be     forced        to    find new            grounds             often       a long way              from
 -ttheir t r a d i t i o n a l           home.         Despite              football        hooliganism                 (this      became
 fashionable                and       like     all     fashions              will     cease)          a football             club       gives

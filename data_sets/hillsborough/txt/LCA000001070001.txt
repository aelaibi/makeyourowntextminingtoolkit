TO :   All Members of the Hillsborough Working Party




D ear Sir / Madam

The Chair of the Hillsborough Working Party (Councillor Peter Millea) has asked
me to write to all Members to advise them that he is mindful to call a meeting of
the Working Party following the conclusion of the current court case.

Th e purpose of the meeting will be to review the progress of the work undertaken
by the Working Party.

As you will be aware the Working Party has not met since March 1999. In the
circumstances the Chair has asked if you could advise me in writing and within
the next 10 days of any additional items of business which you would wish to
have considered for inclusion on the agenda for the meeting.

If you require any further information please do not hesitate to contact me on the
above telephone number.

Yours faithfully




Dave Jones
Council Secretariat

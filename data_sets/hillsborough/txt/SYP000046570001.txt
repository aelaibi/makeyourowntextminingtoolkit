    5.       The Licensing Section deals with 33 licensing systems, for example,

             Legislation and the Green Guide

    6.       On 1st August, 1975 Royal Assent was given to the Safety of Sports Grounds

             Act 1975 (Docuaent 1, pages 1-16) which established a "Certification"

             system for sports grounds capable of holding more than 10,000 spectators.

             When a sports ground .is designated by the Secretary of State an

             application needs to be made to the Certificating Authority for a General

             Safety Certificate under the 1975 Act.


    7.       At the time the Safety Certificate was granted in respect of Sheffield

             Wednesday Football Club the South Yorkshire County Council (the

             Certificating Authority) was obliged to attach to the Safety Certificate

             such terms and conditions as they considered necessary or expedient to

              secure reasonable safety at the sports ground when it is in use for

              specified activities.    The terms and conditions at this time had to

              include



HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                    -3-


         (a)     The maximum number of spectators to be admitted to the stadium and;

         (b)     Terms and conditions as to the number, size and situation of

                 entrances to and exits from the stadium or any part of it and the

                 means of access to any such entrances or exits and requiring those

                 entrances, exits and means of access to be properly maintained and

                 kept free from obstruction and as to the number, strength and

                 situation of any crush barriers.     (Section 2(2) of the Safety of

                 Sports Grounds Act 1975).


         Section 2(2) of the 1975 Act was repealed by the Fire Safety and

         Safety of Places of Sports Act 1987.        However, Home Office Circular

         71/1987 (Docunent 2, pages 20-29) advised that those conditions should

             still be included.


   8.    Certificate conditions must also be framed with reference to the plan

             attached to the Certificate, where appropriate.


    9.       Section 10 of 1975 Act provided for an emergency procedure which could be

             used by the Council if it thought that there was a serious risk to

             spectators at a sports ground.   The procedure involved applying to a

             Magistrates' Court for an Order prohibiting or restricting the admission

             of spectators to the sports ground.


   10.   Under Section 11 of the 1975 Act a person authorised by the Local

             Authority or the Chief Officer of Police, or the Building Authority, or

             the Secretary of State, could on production of his authority enter a

             sports ground to make inspections and examine records and make enquiries

             as he thought fit.   On local government reorganisation on 1st April, 1986

             (when the South Yorkshire County Council was abolished and its functions

             passed in the main to District Councils) the reference to the Building

             Authority was changed to the Fire Authority.

    11.   In 1976 the Home Office issued the "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds

          (Football)" which is a guide to measures for improving spectator safety at

          Football Grounds, i.e., at rugby union and rugby league grounds as well as

          at soccer grounds.      A revised edition of the Green Guide was issued in

          1986 following the Bradford Disaster and the Popplewell Inquiry.        The

          scope of the Green Guide was amended to cover measures for improving

             spectator safety at existing sports grounds.   It is a voluntary code.     The

          Green Guide makes comments on such matters as the spacing of crush

          barriers, estimation of safe ground capacity, terraces, etc.      The

^         Guide makes the point that deviations from individual guidelines are

             possible without necessarily detracting from the overall safety of the

             ground.   A flexible approach should be maintained to take account of the

             particular circumstances at individual grounds (paragraphs 6 to 8 of the

             Guide).


    12.   The Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act, 1987 amended the 1975

             legislation in a number of areas.   In particular, the old Section 10 of

             the 1975 Act (Document 1, page 8)   was replaced by a more wide ranging

             provision which gave local authorities the power to issue a Prohibition

^         Notice in respect of either a whole sports ground or part of it.        A

             Prohibition Notice can only be issued where the Local Authority is of the

             opinion that there is a serious risk to spectators if they are admitted to

             the sports ground.   A Prohibition Notice may include directions as to the

             steps which will have to be taken to reduce the risk to a reasonable level

             and these may require alterations or additions to the ground or things to

             be done or omitted, which would contravene the terms or conditions of a

             Safety Certificate for the ground or for any stand at the ground.

              (Section 10(4) of the 1987 Act).   A prohibition or restriction contained

              in a Notice may take effect immediately if certain conditions are

              fulfilled, or after a specified period contained in the Notice.     An appeal

             may be lodged with the Magistrates' Court against a Prohibition Notice but


HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                   -5-


           that appeal does not suspend its operation.      The Court may either cancel

           or affirm the Notice.


    13.    In the new Section 10B of the Act it is the duty of every Certificating

           Authority to enforce the provisions of the Act and regulations made under

           it and also to carry out an inspection of each designated sports ground

           at least once every 12 months and to act in accordance with guidance given

             to them by the Secretary of State.


    14.    The 1987 Act also made provision for Safety Certificates for various

             stands at sports grounds.   Also, in order to give effect to various

^            Popplewell comments on indoor sporting activities, the definition of

             public entertainments which require licensing was extended.


    15.    The Safety of Sports    Ground Regulations 1987 (Statutory Instrument

             1987/1941) sets out the prescribed form of application for a Safety

             Certificate and also refers to appeal procedures, etc. (Document 3, page

             30-35).

                                         Home Office Circulars

    16.    Home Office Circular    71/1987 (Document 2, page 17-29) introduced the

             provisions of Part 2 of the 1987 Act and gives advice on the effects and

^            operation of them.   There is   also specific reference to the new

             Prohibition Notice procedure and a draft Prohibition Notice.


     17.     Home Office Circular 72/1987    (Document 4, page 36-43) sets out the

             Statutory Guidance on inspections which is mandatory.


                          Administration of the Certificating Function by
                                   South Yorkshire County Council

             Background to Certification

     18.     The County Council   set up an "Officer Working Party (Sheffield District)"

             which consisted of representatives of the Fire Service, the Police, the

              Building Authority (Sheffield City Council) and the South Yorkshire County

              Council Administration Department.    This Working Party was set up

HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                 -6-


            following a report to tbe South Yorkshire County Fire Service Committee on

            8th January, 1976.   There were four such Working Parties, one covering

            Sheffield, one Rotherham, one Barnsley and one Doncaster.


     19.    In the early part of 1976 discussions took place between the South

            Yorkshire County Council and the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club about

            the possibility of certification in view of the commencement of the Safety

            of Sports Grounds Act on 1st September, 1975.   On 30th March, 1977 the

            South Yorkshire Police became involved in the discussions and wrote

             to the Home Office indicating that they felt certification should be

^           considered when the matter was next reviewed, owing to the large scale

            events that were held at Hillsborough.


     20.    At a football match held on Saturday, 23rd April, 1977 there were

             incidents at Hillsborough involving some injuries and a number of arrests.

             This prompted further discussions about certification and the involvement

             of the Fire Service Committee of the County Council as well as the Police.

             At a meeting of the South Yorkshire County Council on 27th April, 1977

             questions relating to the problems at the football match were raised and a

             specific complaint was later made by a member of the public in connection

|)          with an incident that allegedly took place at the Leppings Lane end of

             the ground.


     21.    The Chief Constable subsequently agreed to take up   the designation

             question once again with the Home Office.   On 24th August, 1977 the Home

             Office wrote to the Chief Constable stating that the case for designation

             of Sheffield Wednesday was not overwhelming at that time - but they would

             reconsider the matter later.

                                            v;
      22.   The County Council continued to press the case for   designation with   the

             Home Office on the grounds that because of the importance of the games

             played there and the consequent crowd capacities, only if the Stadium had
                                             V
              been designated could the Authorities satisfy themselves as to standards

HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                   -7-


          of safety within the ground.       The Home Office once again declined to

          designate the stadium.


    23.   In April, 1978 the County Council prepared and submitted a lengthy paper

             to the Home Office on the case for designating the Hillsborough Stadium

          under the 1975 Act.


    24.   In August of 1978, the Home Office wrote to the County Council

             indicating that they would recommend to the Home Secretary that an order

          be made designating Hillsborough in due course.          The County Council then

             began the Safety Certificate drafting exercise.       The exercise was carried

             out in consultation with the Police, the Fire Service, the Building

             Surveyor and the Club.


    25.   The Safety of Sports Grounds (Designation) Order 1978 (Statutory

             Instrument 1978 No. 1091) designated the Sheffield Wednesday Football

             Stadium as requiring a Safety Certificate with effect from 1st January,

             1979 (Document 5, page 44).


    26.   The Club applied for a Safety Certificate on 8th September, 1978

             (Docuaent 6, page 45-48).


^            Progress of the Safety Certificate Application with particular
             reference to the Leppings Lane End of the Stadium

    27.      In support of the Club's application, a report was submitted to the County

             Council by Messrs. Eastwoods & Partners, Consulting Engineers, in January,

             1979 (Docunent 7, page 49-58) which dealt with the question of ground

             capacity at the stadium.    The report ".    .   .   deals in broad terms with

             the necessary strengthening and supplementation of the crush barriers on

             the terraces, and calculations are made of theoretical exit times .        .

             All the stands and terraces were dealt with in the report.        Pages 4 and 5

             (Document 7, pages 53 and 54) of the report indicates that the west

             terrace (which is at the Leppings Lane end) has a total area of some 1,480

              square metres, but there are no gangways.       It is suggested that the full

HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                  -8-


          area would justify about 8,000 spectators, but after making a 10Z

          allowance as the equivalent of gangways, a capacity of 7,200 would be

          appropriate.    The report says that the barriers should be designed to

          match this figure approximately and that those barriers which could not

          withstand test load should be appropriately strengthened and extra ones

          provided where necessary.     Proposed extra barriers were shown on drawing

          1610/2X.    The three exits from the west terrace have a total width of

          about 11.5 metres which would permit some 1,250 persons per minute to

          leave the terrace.     The terrace could, therefore, be emptied in about 6

          minutes.     The report goes on that the Guide suggests that everyone on the

             terrace should be within 12 metres of a gangway or exit.    As there are no

          gangways some spectators would be 25 metres from an exit.       The report goes

             on to say that this is felt to be of no consequence as movement

          horizontally along the terrace will be easy and quick.


    28.          The north west corner reinforced concrete terrace is also referred to in

             the report which is noted as covering a net area of approximately 535

             square metres.   The recommended number of spectators was 2,900, bringing

             the total standing at the Leppings Lane end to 10,100.     It was also noted

£            that the exits serving the north west terrace were adequate in width and

             emptying should take place within 8 minutes.   The significance of the 8

             minute time relates to the recommended maximum time for departure of

             spectators from a terraced area of a football ground.    This recommendation

             is contained in,the original "Green Guide" at Paragraph 15.5 and the new

             Guide at paragraph 56.   The last page of the report, recommends a ground

             capacity of 50,100 spectators (consisting of approximately 24,000 seated

             spectators, 16,000 standing on the spion kop and 10,100 at the Leppings

             Lane end).


    29.      Following the submission of Eastwoods' report to the County Council there

             was a meeting of the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) on 12th

              February, 1979 (Docvaent 8, page 62) at which the west terrace and north

HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                   -9-

          west corner reinforced concrete terrace were discussed.         As far as the

          west terrace was concerned it was agreed that           .   .   In view of the

             lack of depth of this terrace, the Club's offer to reduce the spectator

             limit to 7,200, and the discharge time of 6.6 minutes, the Working Party

             agreed that it would be unreasonable to insist that gangways or additional

          exits must be provided." The Working Party also noted that special

             attention would be required to the crush barriers in addition to the

             ordinary testing in view of the apparent sharp edges, corrosion,      etc.    The

          Working Party agreed that there were no real problems with the north west

^            terrace but reference is made to the corrugated sheeting which would be

             required to pass the appropriate tests, along with the crush barriers.


    30.      On 30th March, 1979 (Docunent 9, page 66) the Officer Working Party

             considered further the question of the west terrace and the north west

             terrace.   As to the west terrace it was noted that the terracing in small

             areas near to the stand was in poor condition and that the cross-fall on

             the steps on the north west corner exit would also require attention as it

             tended to throw people forward.   The height of the crush barriers' was also

             mentioned as being below the Guide recommendations.      The Working Party

             agreed that these points should be drawn to the attention of the Club.         As

             far as the north west terrace is concerned, the Building Authority now

             took the view that the corrugated sheeting would require alteration in

             order to meet the requirements of the Green Guide.


    31.      On 2nd April, 1979 (Document 10, page 71) the Officer Working Party

             visited Sheffield Wednesday and a joint meeting was held with the Club

             representatives.   The Working Party agreed that the Club's proposals

              (including a capacity limit of 7,200 spectators) was acceptable, without

              the need for additional gangways.   It was also agreed that the question of

              the cross-fall on the steps on the north west corner exit, the height of

              some of the existing crush barriers as well as their corrosion and sharp

              edges in places, should be the subject of detailed discussion between Dr.

HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                      -10-


         Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.           The Club's proposals in respect to

         the north west terrace were also accepted, with a capacity limit of 2,900

         and the improvement of existing barriers and addition of some new

         barriers.     It was also agreed that the improvement or replacement of the

         existing corrugated sheeting should be subject to discussion between the

         Building Surveyor and Dr.        Eastwood.


  32.    On 18th April, 1979, (Doeaent 11, page 75) a joint meeting of the Officer

         Working Party was held at Sheffield Wednesday.           The meeting was held to

         discuss further the proposals in relation to the Hillsborough Stadium.

         The comments made on the west terrace were that the Club accepted that in

         view of the cross-fall on the north west corner exit, the steps should be

         rebuilt and that the other matters previously raised would be reconsidered

             after it was seen which of the crush barriers failed on testing.       Whilst

             accepting the need for improvement or replacement of the existing

             corrugated sheeting on the north west corner terrace, the Club wished to

             consider whether to carry out more extensive works so as to bring an

             existing unused area into use for the accommodation of further

             spectators.


   33.       On 1st May, 1979 (Document 12, pages 78-80) the Sheffield City Council's

             Building Surveyor wrote to the County Council indicating that as far as

             the west terrace was concerned, the downward slope of the exit steps

             needed to be corrected and that the limitation in capacity should remain.

             It was noted that, on the north west terrace, the replacement of the

             corrugated sheeting at the rear was required, as was the removal of

             understrength barriers and their replacement by new ones constructed to

             Guide recommendations.
                                      t



   34.       On 16th May, 1979 (Document 13, page 82) the Chief Fire Officer wrote to

              the County Council with a work schedule in respect of Sheffield Wednesday.

              It is noted that the west and north west terrace exit routes were regarded


HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                      -li­


              as satisfactory.     It was noted that the capacity of the west terrace was

              7,200 persons and that of the north west terrace 2,900 persons.


      35.     As a result of these consultations between the Working Party and the Club

              on 8th June, 1979 (Document 14, page 85 and Docuaent 15, pages 86-92) a

               list of "Matters requiring attention at the Sheffield Wednesday Football

              Ground, Hillsborough, Sheffield" was sent to the Club for its attention.


      36.     On 15th August, 1979 (Docment 16, page 93) the Officer Working Party met

              again to consider matters relating to Sheffield United, and also to review

                 the progress of work at Sheffield Wednesday since the last meeting on 12th
m
               July.   It was noted, amongst other things, that no strengthening of the

                 corrugated sheeting on the north west terrace had been carried out.


       37.    On 19th September, 1979 (Document 17, pages 96 and 97) Eastwood & Partners

                 wrote to the County Council about the emergency lighting installation in

                 the stadium.   Eastwoods proposed in the letter that new emergency circuits

                 and fittings be installed in areas of the stadium including the north west

                 terrace, the south west terrace and the Leppings Lane exit.


       38.    Between 31st October, 1979 and 12th November of the same year, there was

                 correspondence between Eastwoods and the County Council about the

                 corrugated sheeting at the rear of the north west terrace.     It was finally

                 agreed that a continuous horizontal timber member should be fixed to the

                 front of the corrugated sheeting at a Working Party visit to the ground

                 to assess the progress of works.     (Docuaent 18, page 99).

                 Grant of the Certificate

       2^ #      ‘Hie County Fire Services Committee of the South Yorkshire County Council

                 at its meeting on 29th November, 1979 approved the issue of a General

                 Safety Certificate and the terms and conditions of that Certificate to

                 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.     This decision was ratified by the full

                  County Council meeting on 19th December, 1979.    Prior to the grant of a

                  certificate the Working Party visited the ground on 18th December, 1979

             (Docuaent 97, pages 299-301).     The grant of a Certificate was made subject

             to remedial works to the south stand steel columns and the emergency

             lighting system being carried out.        The Safety Certificate document itself

             was issued on 21st December, 1979 under the signature of Mr.         F.   A.

             Mallett, the Chief Executive of the County Council.

             South Yorkshire County Council policy of twice yearly visits to football

             league grounds in South Yorkshire.        A list of the dates of inspections

             Example of Inspection

   42.       At the Working Party inspection on 11th August, 1983 (Docuaent 20, pages

             113-116) there were two representatives from the Sheffield Wednesday

             Football Club (Dr.     Eastwood and Mr.     E.   England), two from the South

             Yorkshire Police (J.     Barker and C.     Calvert), one from the South

             Yorkshire County Fire Service (J.        Miles), two from the Sheffield City

             Council (Building Authority) (A.     Roberts and D.      Sheriff) and one from


HB5AAA/JJJ
the South Yorkshire County Council Administration Department (D.

Vaughan).   For illustrative purposes, I would refer to the last two

paragraphs on the first page of the notes of the Working Party visit.      In

the first of the two paragraphs it is clear that a problem in relation to

the brickwork at the rear corner of the stand nearest the north west

terrace had been raised at the previous meeting of the Working Party and

this was further explored at the meeting on 11th August.   In the second

paragraph, Dr.   Eastwood (the Club's Consulting Engineer) gave details of

testing of the crush barriers on the terrace and indicating that

appropriate remedial action had been taken, where necessary and that the

first cycle of the barrier testing had thus been completed.


Issues arising other than on inspections

The County Council was made aware of various problems in connection with

the use of the stadium.   An example as to how these matters were dealt

with can be seen by reference to a letter from the South Yorkshire County

Fire Service (Document 21, pages 117-118) to the Sheffield Wednesday

Football Club regarding a test which the Fire Service did of the emergency

procedures at a match on 4th October, 1983.   There was particular concern

that stewards could not hear the emergency procedure announcement on the

public address system, which resulted in stewards failing to carry out

their emergency procedure duties.   Consultations then took place between

the Club and the Fire Officer (with reference to the County Council) which

resulted in the system being checked and found satisfactory by the County

Fire Service on 29th October, 1983, (Document 22, page 119, and Document

23, page 120).


             Sheffield City Council as Certificating Authority
                     (with effect from 1st April, 1986)

Initial Administrative System

At the meeting of the General Purposes Panel on 3rd March, 1986 (which is

a Sub-Commit tee of the Municipal Enterprise and General Services Programme
Committee of the City Council) a report was considered from the Head of

Administration and Legal Department on Safety of Sports Grounds

(Docuaent 24, page 122). The Panel adopted the recommendations contained

in the report which were:-


(a)   All the powers and duties of the Council under the Safety of Sports

      Grounds Act 1975 be delegated to the General Purposes Panel.


(b)   The emergency procedure powers under Section 10 of the 1975 Act be

      delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal Department in

      consultation with the Chairman or Deputy Chairman of the Panel or of

      the Municipal Enterprise and General Services Programme Committee as

      appropriate.


(c)   The power to authorise Officers under Section 11 of the Act be

      delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal Department.


The Panel's decision was subsequently confirmed by a full meeting of the

City Council which took place on 9th April, 1986.


 The General Purposes Panel considered a more detailed report on the Act at

 its meeting on 6th May, 1986 (Docuaent 25, pages 123—127).


 Review of the Administrative System

 At its meeting on 7th September, 1987 the General Purposes Panel

 considered a report (Docuaent 26, pages 128-130) on the future

 administration of the Council's Certificating function.


 As the report accepts that the Council, as the Certificating Authority,

       act on the basis of advice from experts (such as the Fire Service),

 the question arose as to how that advice may best be formulated.     In this

 respect it was recommended that a "Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory

 Group" should be established which would consist of representatives from

  the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor's Division and the
                                                  -15-


          Department of Health and Consumer Services.       Both the Building Surveyor's

          Division and the Department of Health and Consumer Services are part of

          existing Council structure.      It was envisaged that the Advisory Group

          would function as a forum for discussion between Officers and its most

          regular use would probably be the discussion of advice to the Council

          before recommendations were finally formulated by the appropriate

          Authority.


48.           It was also anticipated that meetings of the Group would be held at the

              request of one or more Authorities and on receipt of a request the

          Administration and Legal Department would arrange a meeting and despatdi a

              list of items to be discussed.   At the conclusion of the meeting a further

              list of items would be prepared and the details of action agreed to be

              taken by each Authority would be noted.    It was then envisaged that

              detailed written advice would be provided by each discipline and acted

              upon as appropriate.


49.           The report went on to suggest various areas of responsibility for each

              Authority


              Authority                          Area of Responsibility

              The Building Surveyor,             All matters relating to the structure
              (Sheffield City Council)           of stadia, including crush barriers,
                                                 walls, etc.

              South Yorkshire County             Fire precautions, fire alarms, means
              Fire Service                       of escape, emergency lighting, stadium
                                                 capacity.

              South Yorkshire Police             Stadium policing, evacuation procedures,
                                                 access of emergency vehicles and
                                                 emergency planning.


              It should be noted that there is, of course, an independent duty in

              relation to safety at the sports ground which falls on the club as

               certificate holder and the management of the business carried on at the

              ground as occupier.

  50.    It was also anticipated that the Health and Consumer Services Department

         would have an input into the Advisory Group on:- aspects of general

         safety, the general safety management of stadia, and various special items

         such as first aid requirements.      These lists were of course not

         exhaustive and several of the functions overlapped.


  51.    The report considered the question of inspections and it was suggested

             that one large scale inspection per stadium should be carried

         out each year.      It was also envisaged that some additional inspections

         would take place during events.      It was noted that the proposal was in

             line with the Popplewell Report and with licensing practice in other

             areas.


  52.    The Panel approved the revised administrative system which therefore came

             into effect immediately and delegated all routine matters in connection

             with that system to the Head of Administration and Legal Department.     The

             system remains in effect.


   53.   The report was seen in draft by all the interested officers and its

             proposals modified in the light of comments made.   Prior to the

             preparation of the report the administrative system was discussed at

             length at both a meeting and in correspondence with proposed members of

             the Advisory Group.


             Comments on the New Administrative System

   54.       Basically, the Council's responsibility divides into three parts, i.e. (a)

             inspections of sports grounds; (b) dealing with proposed alterations to

             sports grounds and (c) dealing with serious risks to spectators.   The

             inspection system is dealt with at paragraphs 61 to 78.
                                               v;-
   55.       Sports ground management sometimes wish to alter or improve their facility

             and usually these proposals involve the Council as Certificating
                                               \

             Authority.   Recent examples of sufch developments include the extension and
                                                   V'
HB5AAA/JJJ
          roofing over of the Kop and also the installation of facilities for people

          with disabilities in the North Stand at Hillsborough.       The administrative

          system for dealing with those alterations is that copies of the proposals

          are circulated to all the members of the Advisory Group for comment.

          Where comments are received, they are collated and passed on to the Club -

          if necessary following discussions between officers either informally or

          via the Group itself.       This system works reasonably well where proposals

          are straightforward and there is no disagreement between the officers and

          the Club about individual items.       An example of a relatively

          straightforward alteration to the Hillsborough Ground is the "Gate 'O'

          Development” (Document 86, pages 269-270) which involved the creation of a

          new entrance to the Ground on Penistone Road.


    56.   Unfortunately, some developments are not quite so straightforward and an

          example of the sorts of problems that can arise are contained in the large

          volume of correspondence in relation to the proposed facilities for people

          with disabilities in the North Stand at Hillsborough.       In that

             particular instance, a considerable amount of time was expended on what

             was essentially a fairly straightforward development.    The amount of

^         officer time spent on dealing with alterations to sports grounds obviously

             has to be included in the total amount of time applied to the Safety of

             Sports Grounds system.


    57.   If the Council were of the opinion that admission of spectators to the

             Sports Ground involved a serious risk then immediate steps would be taken

             to secure rectification of the problem.    If rectification was not

             possible prior to spectator admission then if appropriate steps would be

             taken to issue a Prohibition Notice.


    58.   The administrative system has not yet been in operation for a long enough

             time to enable a true assessment of it to take place and it will, as with

             arty similar system, no doubt be capable of modification in order to



HB5AAA/JJJ
improve its efficiency.   It is and has been my practice to review

administrative systems after they have been in operation for a reasonable

time (for example in this case perhaps a period of two years would be an

appropriate time to review it)


Role of the Administration and Legal Department
in the Certification System

The basic role of the Department is to co-ordinate the administration of

the Certification System and also to keep the records of it.


An example (Docwent 27, page 131-132) of an Agenda and notes of a meeting

are attached, dated 28th April, 1988, which shows the sort of items

discussed at the Advisory Group.


The Inspection System operated by Sheffield City Council

Every year inspections of stadia are fixed by the Head of Administration

and Legal Department in consultation with the clubs and the interested

authorities.   Inspections have taken place on the following dates:-

7th August, 1986; 6th August, 1987; 19th May, 1988.


The Inspection System

The inspection system basically consists of six stages:-

Stage                       Action

1                           Arrange the inspection

2                           Carry out the inspection

3                           Receive comments from Advisory Group members
                            in writing

4                           Co-ordinate the comments if necessary via an
                            Advisory Group meeting

5                           Send the co-ordinated list to the sports
                            ground management

 6                          The Advisory Group Officers check that work is
                            done either on the next inspection or at some
                            earlier stage if appropriate.
                                                  -19-


   63.       This procedure is of course much simplified in    the table above and many

             variations of it can occur.   The system itself should in most

             circumstances work well but in practice some difficulties do occasionally

             arise.


   64.       Inspections are attended by persons representing:- the County Fire

             Service, the Police, the Council's Director of Health and Consumer • -       -

             Services and the Council's Building Surveyor.    Often, the Club is

             represented at the inspection by a consultant engineer, together with

             another representative, usually the Club Secretary or similar Officer.

             The inspection is carried out by the various officers who meet at the

             ground and then disperse to various areas in which their particular

             interest lies.


   65.       The Officers can draw points to each other's attention during the

             inspection and Club representatives are sometimes asked for

             information.


   66.       If Officers discover a serious safety defect then the Head of

             Administration and Legal Department is informed and immediate steps are

             taken to secure its rectification.   If rectification is not possible prior

             to spectators being admitted into the stadium, then steps would be taken

             to issue a Prohibition Notice, if appropriate.


   67.       Officers at the conclusion of the inspection write to the Head of

             Administration and Legal Department setting out their comments on matters

             which ought to be raised with the Club.     These are then collated and

             discussed with the officers (when necessary at an Advisory Group) and

             finally formulated into a list which is sent to the Club for action.


   68.       As an example, a copy of Officers' comments following the 1987 inspection

             are attached to this Statement (Docunent 28, pages 133-134).




HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                  -20-


  69.    The actual time spent on each ground inspection alone usually exceeds two

         man    days per year.    This does not include the subsequent administrative

         work or the consideration of proposals submitted by sports ground owners.

         Home Office Circular 72/1987 (Doeuaent 4, pages 36-43) states that

         inspections are not expected to take more than about two man days per

         ground on average.


         Details of the Inspections at Hillsborough in 1986, 1987 and 1988

         7th August, 1986

  70.    There is no written record of the inspection, on 7th August, 1986. There are

             two reasons for this.    The first is that no significant problems were

             discovered on the inspection and the only point of significance raised was

             that in relation to barrier 144 which is referred to in paragraphs 174-175

             of my statement.    The second reason is that at the same time as the

             inspection was being carried out, the lengthy and complex debate in

             relation to the Spion Kop was fully underway and by far the majority of my

             own efforts aqd those of the other participants in that debate were

             concentrated in that area.    I do, however, recall that the inspection

             followed the County Council system and it helped firm my views in that

             area.


             6th August, 1987

   71.       The Building Surveyor and the Director of Health and Consumer Services

             made a number of comments on the annual inspection.    These comments

             were considered and discussed between officers and a consolidated

             list was drawn up and sent to Sheffield Wednesday on 4th December, 1987

             (Docuaent 28, pages 133-134).    No comments were received from the Fire

             Service or the Police.    The list was circulated to the Fire Service, the

             Health and Consumer Services Department, the Building Surveyor, the Police

             and Messrs.   Eastwood & Partners.




HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                  -21-


  72.      Messrs. Eastwood & Partners wrote back to the Council (Document 82, pages

           242-245) on 15th January, 1988, indicating that the majority of the points

           raised from the list of comments had been completed but raising one or two

           questions on some of the items.      Copies of Eastwoods letter were passed on

           to the Health and Consumer Services Department and the Building Surveyor

           but owing to the impending May inspection no further action was taken at

           that stage.    I should explain that it had been decided to move the annual

           inspection from August to May, in order that any work that needed to be

           done could be identified and carried out during the close season.


     73.   As already noted, the Fire Service did not make any comments in relation

             to the inspection.   The Fire Service sent a letter to the Council on 18th

             February, 1987 (Document 91, pages 279-284) containing a large number of

             comments on Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground.    After discussions with

             the Fire Service, the City Council sent a copy of the Fire Service letter

             (along with various comments) on 22nd April, 1987 (Docuaent 92, pages

             285-286) to Sheffield Wednesday.    After being reminded, the Club via

             Eastwood & Partners responded to the County Fire Service letter on 3rd

             February, 1988 (Docuaent 93, pages 287-293).    The letter was very detailed

 ^           and was passed on to the Police, the Health and Consumer Services

             Department and the Building Surveyor on 8th February.    The letter was sent

             to the Fire Service on 8th February, 1988, with a covering letter

             (Docuaent 94, page 294).   In view of the comments in this letter, the Fire

             Service were invited to respond directly to Eastwood & Partners.    The

             letter also requested comments on the remainder of the points raised- in

             Eastwoods letter.    A Senior Fire Officer rang me in February, 1988,

             indicating that the Fire Service did not wish to reply to the letter at

             that time.

             19th May, 1988

   74.       The inspection was attended by representatives of the Police, the Fire

             Service, the Building Surveyor and Health and Consumer Services

             Department.


   75.       The Fire Service and   the Health and Consumer Services Department both

             commented on the inspection by letter dated 25th May, 1988 (Document 95,

             pages 295-296) and memorandum of 3rd June, 1988 (Document 96, pages

             297-298) respectively.


   76.       The Fire Service had   not yet replied to Eastwoods letter (Document 93,

             pages 287-293) referred to above.    I was therefore reluctant to send their

             further letter (Document 95, pages 295-296) to the Club before the

             previous issue had been resolved.    I had thought to write back to the Fire

             Service in this way but unfortunately time simply did not permit owing to

             other commitments within the Licensing Section.    I should say that at no

             time has the Fire Service indicated that any of the points mentioned in

             their letter required immediate attention or presented any serious hazard

             to the public.


^^77.        The Director of Health and Consumer Services made a number of points

             similar to ones raised previously.


   78.       Ideally, what should have happened in June or July 1988 was that the

             outstanding Fire Service issues should have been resolved and that a

             co-ordinated set of comments submitted to the Club.    This did not

             however happen owing, as I have mentioned previously, to pressure of work

             within the Licensing Section.    As I have already said, none of the points

             raised by either the Fire Service or the Health and Consumer Services

             Department had been highlighted as being of a serious nature.

         Why were the Administrative and Inspection Systems changed when
         Sheffield City Council became the Certificating Authority?_____

  79.    In April, 1986, I recall visiting the South Yorkshire County Council

         Offices in Barnsley and collecting the large number of files in relation

         to both designated sports grounds in Sheffield.         In addition to applying

         some time to reading the files, I talked to officers who had

         been involved with the system for some time.


  80.        It seemed to me that the key test of the South Yorkshire County Council

         administrative system was whether or not it achieved a reasonable degree

         of public safety within the sports grounds which were subject to the

             certificating system.   Bearing this principle in mind, I formed a number

             of tentative views about the County Council's administrative system.      The

             first and most obvious point was that the issues at sports grounds were

             complex and required the allocation of a considerable amount of time in

             order to deal with them.   Also, although it appeared on the face of it

             that the system itself worked well, it struck me that there were a number

             of points which required clarification.     For exanq>le, it was not clear who

             made what decisions.    There were plenty of "agreements" on the file and a

             lot of letters to the Clubs but there was no evidence to indicate who had

             the authority to make requirements, etc.     It was also difficult to pick up

             from the files exactly where the technical responsibilities lay and often

             "agreements" were noted as having been arrived at without an indication as

             to who contributed to them.    There was also no clear indication in a lot

             of cases as to the basis on which agreement was reached.      The constitution

             of the Working Party was also rather confused as evidently Club

             representatives were present and made comments at various meetings at

             which agreements were reached.


   81.        I also looked at the question of inspections of the sports grounds and

             wondered about their thoroughness.    The inspection records did not

              clearly show which areas of the sports grounds had been looked at and it


HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                   -24-


         seemed to me that in view of the size of sports grounds quite a number of

         points would be raised on an inspection - although these points would

         obviously vary in importance.        The question of the time taken on

         inspections was also a matter which I thought about.         I also noted that

             the Safety Certificate had now been in force for seven years and perhaps

             should be reviewed.    Obviously, this review process would take a

             considerable time.


  82.        I also looked into the question of the amount of time which should be

             spent on safety of sports grounds and took particular note of paragraph 10

             in the letter accompanying the Home Office Circular 136/78 (dated 23rd

             August, 1978) which stated that "... Local Authorities should not in the

             normal course find it necessary to charge fees representing more than 17

             man/days work          This statement is in relation to charging fees for the

             grant of Safety Certificates and is a clear indication that from the point

             of view of the Home Secretary, even the work prior to Certification which

             the Council would need to carry out should not exceed the rather limited

             17 man/days.    It should be noted that Home Office Circular 72/1987

             (Document 4, page 37) indicated that inspections are not expected to take

             more than about 2 man/days per ground on average.     It seems to me that far

             more than 2 man days per ground are required.


   83.       It is, in my opinion, vitally important that a licensing authority should,

             whilst arranging adequate systems of communication, also be completely

             independent of licensees themselves.     Such independence is crucial in

             order that the Authority can form properly balanced views which are based

             on adequate information and which are not unduly influenced by the view of

              licensees themselves.     I should emphasise once again, however, that

              licensees have a part to play in discussions but decisions finally rest

              with the Authority.     Carefully maintained independence also tends to breed

              objectivity whereas inter-dependence (i.e.     relationships which become too




HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                   -25-


         close) tend to obscure it.        In the area of public safety, independence

         must be maintained.


  84.    In March/April, 1986, having formed the tentative views I have set out

         above, I then decided to see exactly how the system worked in practice.           I

         had no wish to interfere with what appeared to be a smoothly running

             system unless significant factors emerged which required immediate

             attention.


  85.        In relation to the administrative system, the matter was first considered

             by the Council on 3rd March, 1986 (Document 24, page 122) when all powers

             and duties under the Act were delegated to the General Purposes Panel and

             various powers were then delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal

             Department (paragraph 44).    A further report was considered on 6th May,

             1986 (Docuaent 25, pages 123-127) when it was agreed that the old system

             should continue for the time being and that the certificate conditions

             should be reviewed.     Finally, at its meeting on 7th September, 1987

             (Docuaent 26, page 128-130) the current administrative system was approved

             (paragraph 46 to 53).


   86.       The inspections in 1986 followed the pattern of the previous County

             Council inspections where Officers of the Working Party accompanied a Club

             representative around the sports ground over a period of possibly two

             hours.   Two things struck me about these inspections.    The first was that

             they were not particularly efficient as Officers representing the various

             disciplines were not all interested in the same items and therefore much

             time was wasted while discussions took place between a particular

              specialist and the Club.    Secondly, the lead appeared to be taken by the

             Club in directing the inspection.     I am quite sure that if officers had

              said that they wished to visit a particular area of the sports ground or

              to take more time with their inspection this would have been allowed by

              the Club.   There is no suggestion that the Club or its representatives


HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                 -26-


           either attempted or intended to control the areas of the sports ground

           which the officers visited.


    87.    However, during the 1987 and 1988 inspections of the sports grounds, I

           attempted to encourage Officers to feel free to visit all parts of the

           sports grounds and gradually this did indeed happen.      I recall that

           initially the Clubs were perhaps somewhat concerned about this move as

           were some of the officers, but its value has been demonstrated several

             times.   For exanq>le, during the 1987 inspection of one of the sports

             grounds in Sheffield it was discovered that there was an accumulation of

^          combustible material beneath a wooden stand.     This situation was dealt

             with most promptly by the Club concerned in consultation with the relevant

             officers.


    88.    One of my suggestions was to involve officers of the     Council's Health and

             Consumer Services Department in the Safety of Sports   Grounds System.    This

             stemmed from recommendation 9 in the Popplewell Report which related to

             the Health and Safety experts.   I recognised that unlike other similar

             licensing systems (for example, public entertainments, theatres and

             cinemas), there was no input in the old County Council system from

^            appropriately qualified Health and Safety experts.     There were some

             resistance to the idea of their inclusion, but I believe that their

             contributions have been and will continue to be most valuable.


     89.     Obviously, any system can be improved in the light of experience but I

             believe that any serious safety problem would be discovered and dealt with

             under the current system.    In the light of the tragic events at

             Hillsborough and with the benefit of the Inquiry report these issues will
                                                  V ,"
             be reconsidered.


                                      The role of the Home Office

     90.      The Home Office is the Central Government Department which is responsible
                                                    V.

              for safety of sports grounds.   Its functions can be described in brief as

HB5AAA/JJJ
follows:

(a)   To advise Parliament on legislation;

(b)   To issue circulars informing interested persons about legislation
      and to offer guidance;

(c)   To issue Statutory guidance (for example, in relation to
      inspections); and

(d)   To issue the "Green Guide" which is an advisory document to assist
      the improvement of safety standards at sports grounds.



       The Certificating Authority's response to the Bradford Disaster
                         and the Popplewell Report

The South Yorkshire County Council issued a press release on 10th May,

1985 (Docuaent 29, page 135) outlining the certification system in

operation throughout the County.    The press release went on to say that

the forthcoming "Summer" inspections will take into account the lessons of

the recent tragic event at Bradford and any revised advice and

requirements which may be issued by the Home Office.    On 13th May, 1985

the South Yorkshire County Council sent a letter to the Secretary of

Sheffield Wednesday (Document 30, page 136) enclosing a copy of the press

release and stressing that it is vital necessity for safety stewards to be

fully aware of and trained in their duties on the manning and opening of

doors and gates on egress routes and in the use of fire fighting

equipment.


The South Yorkshire County Council wrote again to Sheffield Wednesday on

9th August, 1985 (Document 31, pages 137-138) indicating that the Interim

Report of the Popplewell Inquiry had been produced and advice had been

received from the Home Office.     The letter drew attention to a review of

 the evacuation procedures in consultation with the Police and the Fir^

Service and also to the duties of safety stewards.     It also indicated that

 the Police and the Fire Service were willing to assist clubs in these

matters.     Detailed comments were also made about the first aid facilities

 at the stadium and the requirements of the Certificate in respect of them.
                                                    -28-


             There was also a comment about stands which are constructed of combustible

         materials and that they should have "no smoking" signs prominently

             displayed.   The Club responded (Document 32, page 139) to the County

             Council's letter of 14th August 1985 and comments were made about steward

             training procedures.


   93.       The Sheffield City Council wrote to Sheffield Wednesday on 15th October,

             1987 (Document 33, page 140) referring to the revised Green Guide which

             had been published by H.     M.   Government following the Popplewell Report

             drawing attention to the new Guide and particularly to Chapter 2y~wfii cIT is

             entitled "Management Responsibility".      The letter asks Sheffield Wednesday

             to confirm in writing that the Club intends to retain a copy of the

             revised Green Guide on the premises and that they should take immediate

             steps to appoint a safety officer as defined in Chapter 2.      The Club

             responded to that letter on 23rd October, 1987 (Document 34, page 141) and

             Mr.   Mackrell stated "I confirm that I do have a copy of the Guide to

             Safety at Sports Grounds - 1986 edition and have had such for many months.

             With regard to the appointment of a Safety Officer, my duties encompass

             those of the Safety Officer and I would be grateful if you could amend

             your records to note that I am responsible for all matters of safety

             within the ground".


                                          The Semi-Final in 1981

   94.       On 7th April, 1981 the Officer Working Party (Document 35, pages 142-143)

             inspected the Sheffield Wednesday Stadium, bearing in mind that an F.A.

             Cup Semi-Final was to take place on 11th April, 1981.


   95.       Sheffield Wednesday Football Club wrote to the County Council on 15th

             April, 1981 (Document 36, pages 144-145) outlining an incident which took

             place at the Leppings Lane end of the ground at the Semi-Final Match on

              11th April, that year.    It is noted that there were injuries to spectators

             because of crushing.      The Club goes on to say that from its enquiries it


HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                   -29-



         appears that the crushing was caused by Tottenham supporters arriving late

         due to travelling problems and rushing to their places after the game had

         commenced, thereby causing problems to spectators at the front of the

         terracing who had been in the ground for a considerable length of time.

         The turnstile readings indicated 335 persons in excess of the

         capacity for Leppings Lane end which was the result of Tottenham fans

         having purchased tickets from Wolverhampton and on arrival at turnstile

             'N' (in Penistone Road) which was the Wolverhampton standing area, were

         directed by the Police to the other end of the ground where Tottenham fans

         were standing.        Apparently, 30 spectators were treated by St. John

         Ambulance for minor ailments and 8 spectators were treated at the Royal

         Hallamshire and Northern General Hospitals.          According to the Police,

             three people had broken limbs, one had head grazing and another had

             unspecified injuries.      The Club finally commented that the crowd behaviour

             both inside and outside the stadium was very good.


   96.       On 22nd April, 1981 the Chief Executive of the County Council wrote

             (Document 37, page 146) to the Police asking for a copy of their report on

             the Semi-Final incident.


   97        Mr. Brownlow, the then Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, wrote to the

             Secretary of the Football Association on 3rd June, 1981 (Document 38,

             pages 147-148) commenting in detail on the incident at the match on 11th

             April.   The Chief Constable starts by noting the basic facts relating to

             the stadium and indicating that there had been many similar Semi-Final

             matches at Hillsborough without previous incident.      The Police apparently

             envisaged difficulties prior to the match because both sets of supporters

             would need to use the Ml motorway.      There were a number of problems which

             slowed down the arrival of spectators, namely a major road accident, a

             coach breaking down and extensive road works.       These resulted in Tottenham

             Hotspur fans being held up on the motorway for some 90 minutes.       This all

              resulted in ".    .   .   a sudden influx of large numbers of football

HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                     -30-


         supporters to the area of the ground at around the time for the start of

                                   tt
         the match .      •    •




  98.    Mr. Brownlow went on to indicate that Tottenham Hotspur supporters managed

             to obtain tickets from Wolverhampton.      He noted that this completely

         defeated the spectator policy which places the largest groups of standing

             supporters at opposite ends of the football ground.      Apparently, neither

         participating football club told the South Yorkshire Police, Sheffield

         Wednesday, or the Football Association about this situation and the mixing

             of supporters was not properly catered for.      Some 400 Tottenham fans had

             to be removed from the kop and accommodated in the Leppings Lane end.


   99.       According to Mr. Brownlow the Tottenham Hotspur fans who had arrived early

             took up advantageous viewing points and refused to move to the centre of

             the Leppings Lane enclosure " . . .     thereby creating a jamming effect at

             the extremeties of it . . ."       The late arrivals then caused a problem

             because they rushed forward immediately upon entering after Tottenham

             Hotspur had scored an early goal.       The resulting injuries included broken

             arms, legs and crushed ribs.       It is noted that some 38 people received

             treatment.   Hie pitch perimeter gates at the front of the Leppings Lane

             enclosure were opened and spectators were allowed to go on to the

             perimeter track to relieve pressure.       Police Officers also refused access

             to the Leppings Lane enclosure to spectators waiting to get in, in view of

             the crushing problem.      In Mr. Brownlow's view, no other course of action

             could have been adopted in the interests of public safety.


  100.       Mr. Brownlow does note that the circumstances he outlines in the letter

             had been discussed at length and would be borne in mind in planning other

             similar events.                ’

                      The installation of, and alterations to, the radial fences
                                     on the Leppings Lane terrace


            Hie 1981 Proposals

    101.    Messrs. Eastwood & Partners wrote to the County Council on 2nd September,

            1981 (Docuaent 39, pages 149-150) indicating that ".     .   . w e have been

            instructed by the Club to organise the installation of two radial fences

            on the terrace at the Leppings Lane end of the ground .      .   .".   It was

            noted that the intention of these fences was to divide the terrace into

            approximately three equal areas, each served by its own entrance.        The

^           object of dividing the terrace was to exercise more control over

             supporters and for example, a visiting team with only a few followers

            would be allocated one section with the other two sections retained for

             home supporters.    A 1.15 metre wide gate was proposed at the rear of each

             fence, to give access for maintenance and also policing during the game.

             The gates could be left open, but fastened back to connect the areas

             during the game if appropriate.    In order to preserve spectators' views

             Eastwoods recommended that the top of the fence should be approximately

             1680 mm above the terrace.    It was noted that a fence of this height would

             not prevent individual spectators from climbing the fence, but it should

^           eliminate a mass "invasion" from one area to another.     Apparently, fences

             of this height worked successfully at St.    James' Park (the Newcastle

             United ground).     The plans referred to in the letter are 3563/1 and 3563/2

             and 3.


     102.   On 9th September, 1981 (Docuaent 40, page 51) Eastwoods wrote to the •

             County Council indicating that radial barrier work is likely to begin in

             early October, subject to their being no objections from the Council.

             Eastwoods indicated that major changes to the proposed scheme should be

             received by 23rd September.


     103.   The Officer Working Party at its meeting on 11th September 1981 (Docuaent

              41, page 152) considered the question of the proposed new radial barriers

HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                  -32-


         on the west terrace.       It was noted that there were drawbacks to the

         division of the terrace into approximately three equal areas, but the

         Working Party felt that increased control on the terrace should result.              A

         "for instance" was quoted in that there could well be problems with

         opposing fans mixing at the rear of the west stand and/or the final exit

         gates, but the Police considered that they could cope with these

         problems.


 104.    The adequacy and positioning of the gates at the rear of the radial

         bdtrifits was discussed as well as the use of the existing gates in the

         pitch perimeter fence.       It was noted that the plans did not indicate the

         headroom which would be available at the rear of the terrace should the

         radial barriers and gates be installed.           'Die Working Party agreed that

             there was no objection to the proposals subject to further calculations as

             required by the Building Authority being satisfactory, confirmation of

             adequate headroom at the rear of the terrace and those gates being under

             Police control.   The County Council wrote to Eastwoods confirming the

             Working Party views on 14th September (Document 42, pages 154-155).         In a

             letter of 14th December, Eastwoods indicated that the works were now

             substantially complete (Document 43, page 156).


  105.       The South Yorkshire Police wrote (Document 44, pages 157-158) to the

             County Council on 18th January, 1982 about, amongst other things, the new

             radial fencing at Leppings Lane.     It is confirmed in the letter that the

             fences are working well.    It is commented that since there have been no

             games resulting in the whole of the terracing being occupied by one group

             of fans, the Police are unable to comment in that respect, but they

             foresee no problems.    The Chief Constable goes on to say that as existing

             barrier rails have been extended up to and completely through the new

              radial fencing, fans could climb over from one pen to another.       Also, it

              was noted that there were some ".    .   .   dangerous pieces .

              protruding from the cut off ends of some barrier rails.       The County

HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                    -33-


             Council wrote (Document 45, page 159)     to Eastwood and Partners indicating

             that the radial fences appear to be working satisfactory and also

             outlining the Police views on them.     Messrs.   Eastwood and Partners wrote

             back to the County Council on 26th January, 1982 (Document 46, pages

             161-163) accepting the possibility that fans could climb over the radial

             fence, but stating that it would be unacceptable to leave a gap along side

             each radial fence completely free of crush barriers as that would present

             a major hazard.      The Police comment on the dangerous pieces of rails is

             no ted.


      06.    At an Officer Working Party meeting on 4th February, 1982 (Document 47,

             page 164) the Police views on the barriers was again discussed.       It was

             however, agreed that the existing arrangement was, on balance, preferable

             from a safety point of view to prevent crowd surge.        It was agreed to

             review the issue at the end of the current season.


             The 1985 Proposals

     107.    Messrs. Eastwood & Partners wrote to the County Council on 9th April, 1985

                 (Document 48, page 167) indicating that the Club was anxious to segregate

             visiting teams' supporters as they entered the ground and also to enable

£            the Police to control their exit at the end of the game.       A scheme showing

                 a possible modification to the Leppings Lane end was prepared and shown on

                 drawing 6705/2 which involved the construction the two new banks of

                 turnstiles and various runs of fencing and new gates.


      108.   The Officer Working Party considered these plans on 18th April

                 1985 (Document 49, pages 168-169). They were agreed, subject to a number

                 of conditions.


      109.   Particular reference was made by the Working Party to the inclusion of two

                 gates in the new central radial fence and a second gate in the radial

                 fence dividing the neutral area and home supporters.




    HB5AAC/JJJ

     no.      On 30th April, 1985 (Document 50, page 170) the Fire Service wrote to the

              County Council indicating that from a means of escape point of view, the

              scheme was satisfactory, providing the gates had minimum widths as

              indicated on the plan enclosed with the letter.    The Fire Service also

              stated that it was understood that these gates will be supervised either

              by the Police or Club officials.   The County Council on 2nd May

              transmitted its views to Messrs.   Eastwood & Partners by letter.

              (Document 51, pages 171-172).


     111.     Eastwoods responded tothe County Council's letter on 8th May

(£            1985 (Document 52, page 173) and indicated that several of the points made

              had already been incorporated into the latest scheme.        Eastwoods say in

              the letter:- ".   .   .   However I would ask that further consideration

              should be given to the    request in paragraph (c)of your letter for a

              second gate to be installed in the radial barrier and for the new radial

              barrier which you have asked for to     have two gates.   If     these gates are

              meant for use in emergency it would     mean having a stewardin attendance on

              each occasion, the expense of which would hardly be justified.        It is our

              view that in the event of emergency, spectators can be evacuated quickly

              enough by the gates on to the pitch and by the normal exit gates at the

              rear.   We will of course be prepared to discuss the matter with the Fire

              Officer's staff should you so wish .    .    ."


     112.     The County Council sent a letter to Eastwoods on 10th May, 1985 (Document

              53, page 174) indicating that the Police were prepared to concede the

              request for two gates per radial fence in the right hand area of the

              Leppings Lane End Terrace, provided     that the remainder of the points

              raised by the Officer Working Party     were incorporated.


     113.     Subsequently, Eastwood & Partners submitted a further detailed proposal

              for a revised layout of the Leppings Lane end and related works on 25th

              July 1985 (Document 54, pages 175-176). Fourteen plans were included in


 HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                   -35-


         the submission and it was considered by a meeting of the Officer Working

         Party on 29th July 1985 (Document 55, pages 177-178). The Working Party

         accepted the proposals in principle, but made a number of comments which

         were transmitted to the Consulting Engineers by a letter of 30th July

         (Document 56, pages 179-180). The comments were made by reference to the

         plans submitted:-

         "(a)       Plan No. 6705/6 - for both security access and emergency egress
                    purposes, a pitch perimeter fence gate to be provided";

         "(b)       Plan No. 6705/8A - the new handrail by turnstile 23 to be either
                    shortened or realigned so as to maintain the exit width between the
                    outer (river) wall and turnstile 23, and the exit width between
                    turnstile 16 and the new handrail not to be less than the width of
                    the roller shutter gate between turnstiles 16 and 17";

             "(f)   Plan No. 6705/12 -   . . . no objection in principle, but no barrier
                    height indicated .   . .";

             "(i)   Plan No. 6705/17 - for both security access and emergency egress
                    purposes, a pitch perimeter fence gate to be provided";

             "(j)   Stewarding of new gates - as mentioned in my letter of 2nd May,
                    1985, it is essential that all the new gates are fully supervised by
                    stewards, who must be fit, able and properly trained".


  114.       Eastwoods responded to the County Council's letter on 1st August (Document

             57, pages 181-182) and indicated that it might be easier for discussions

             to take place when the works are under construction.       Eastwoods' letter

             made the following comment on (a) above "We are not sure of the location

             onthe West terrace of the proposed extra security       gate.   There is already

             a gate in the 2m wide gap formed by the new radial fence for use by the

             police.   This same gate will still be available for the spectators in

             emergency as there are gates into the 2m gap from the terrace which will

             be under the control of the police.      This point may perhaps be clarified

             during the Working Party's visit on 7th August".        It is also noted in the

              letter that the stewarding would "...       no doubt be taken care of by Mr.

              Chester ..." (the Sheffield Wednesday Club Secretary at that time).       A

              copy of the letter was sent to Mr.    Oiester by Eastwoods.

 115.      The Officer Working Party visited Hillsborough on 7th August 1985

           (Document 58, pages 183-184) and noted the progress of works to segregate

           supporters at the Leppings Lane end of the ground and on the terrace.        The

           note states "On the Terrace itself, it was noted that there was an

           existing gate in the new 2m wide gap formed by the new radial fence for

           use by the Police.     This gate would still be available for the use of

           spectators in an emergency as the gates at the top of the Terrace under

           the control of the Police would enable spectators to be directed down the

           2m wide gap.     However, it was agreed that steps or a longer gate would be

I          required.     It was also agreed that a new gate would be required from the

           new South Central Terrace Pen."     The Working Party agreed "(b) that the

           existing gate in the pitch perimeter fence should either be extended or

           have steps to provide easier access from the new two metre wide gap formed

           by the new radial fence; (c) that a new gate in the pitch perimeter fence

             should be provided from the south central terrace pen".     There are several

             other comments about general matters in the west terrace.


    116.   At a meeting at the Police Sports and Social Club at Niagra, Sheffield,

             the Officer Working Party on 13th November 1985 (Document 59, page 187)

             considered the Club's proposals in relation to various projects at the

             stadium.    It was also noted that the Police reported on the continuing

             problems caused by the merging of spectators at the Leppings Lane end of

             the ground.    The Working Party noted that it was difficult to see how this

             could be overcome as the physical restraints to achieve this could

             conceivably be more of a danger than allowing the present situation to

             continue.


    117.     When Eastwoods were notified of these problems by the County Council in a

             letter of 14th November 1985 (Document 60, page 190)      in a response dated

             29th November, 1985 (Document 85, page 268) it was stated that they found
                                                    \

              it very difficult to envisage anything* more which could be done at
                                                        \-


HB5AAC/JJJ

                reasonable expense, as major work had been undertaken during the last

                close season.


    118.        The Officer Working Party at its inspection of Sheffield Wednesday on 22nd

                January, 1986 (Docuaent 61, page 193) next considered the segregation

                arrangements at the Leppings Lane end.        The Police confirmed that the new

                arrangements worked well on by far the majority of occasions.        Other minor

                matters were referred to in relation to advertising hoardings, spalling

                concrete and the north west terrace.


                Other references to the Leppings Lane end of the Stadium 1980 to 1988

                1980


     119.       On 11th September, 1980 a report from Dr. Eastwood as to an inspection of

                the Hillsborougih Football Stadium indicates that in the north west corner

                of the concrete terrace there are a number of cracks which have grown more

                pronounced in the past year. The recommendation is that the cracks should

                be sealed to prevent the reinforcement corroding.        (Document 62, pages

                194-195).


                1981

#    i».        On 10th February, 1981 the Officer Working Party met (Document 63, pages

                196-198) to inspect the Sheffield Wednesday Stadium.        It was noted that

                the Club had received quotations for making good the cracking of the

                concrete at the north west terrace, which would be considered shortly.

                The Working Party also heard the Club outline the consideration it was

                giving to the siting of caravans outside the Penistone Road and Leppings

                Lane ends of the ground to sell tickets.        It was hoped that if this took

                place, increased entry flow of spectators to the ground would result by

                reducing delays at the turnstiles.


      121   .   On 7th April, 1981 (Document 35, page 143) the Working Party noted that

                 the cracking of the concreting at the north west terrace had been attended


HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                  -38-


         to by injecting material from the top.          The results had been satisfactory,

         except in two small areas where water seepage had taken place and

         they were to receive further attention.


  122.   The next entry on the file relates to a visit of the Officer Working Party

             to Hillsborough on 8th June, 1981 (Document 64, page 200) at which some

         water seepage was again noted at the north west terrace.          There was also a

             note that the tie bars through the upper level concrete area to the rear

         had been protectively wrapped.


             1982

  123.       The Officer Working Party at its meeting on 24th August, 1982 (Docuaent 65

             pages 201-203) and a letter from Messrs.      Eastwood & Partners of 27th

             August, 1982 (Docuaent 66, page 204) deal with some minor problems which

             did not apparently involve visitor spectators in the concrete at the north

             west terrace.   Similar problems were alluded to on 21st February, 1983 at

             a Working Party meeting.    (Document 67, page 206) On 8th September, 1982,

             Eastwoods submitted a certificate relating to their annual inspection of

             the Hillsborough Stadium (Document 68, pages 208-209) and it was noted

             that the two radial fences had been installed on the Leppings Lane

             terrace.


             1983

  124.       The fact that the crush barriers on the Leppings Lane terrace had been

             tested was noted by the Officer Working Party on 11th August, 1983

             (Document 69f pages 210-213) which testing had completed the first cycle

             of crush barrier testing at the stadium.      There was also mention of water

             seepage again at the north west terrace.      On 29th August, 1983 (Document

             70, pages 214-215).   Dr.   Eastwood copied a letter to the County Council

             confirming the testing of crush barriers at the Leppings Lane End of the

              ground and amongst other things, certified that in his opinion "...        the

              various structures on the ground are in a satisfactory condition and are


HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                   -39-


            appropriate for the stadium to be used to the full capacity laid down in

            the Certificate of Ground Safety..."


            1984

    125.    The former A.R.P.     building adjacent to the boundary wall (near to Gate

             'C') of the Leppings Lane entrances to the stadium was in the process of

            being demolished when the Officer Working Party visited the stadium on

            29th February, 1984 (Document 71, pages 216-217). Once again, water

            seepage was noted on that day at the north west terrace.     In June, 1984

             the crush barriers at the north west corner were tested by the Club's

             Consulting Engineers (Eastwood & Partners) (Document 72, page 218 and

            Document 73, pages 219-228).


     126.    It was noted that there was some cracked brickwork at the rear of the west

             stand and that there were damaged angled support brackets to the pitchside

             security fence at the front of the Leppings Lane terrace, at an Officer

             Working Party inspection of the stadium on 9th August, 1984 (Docuaent 74,

             page 229).   It was also noted that the wire mesh barriers on the north

             west terrace had been successfully test loaded.

             1985

®     127    There was some discussion at an Officer Working Party meeting on 23rd

             January, 1985 (Docuaent 75, pages 232-233) about the segregation of home

             and visiting supporters at the rear of the west stand at certain matches

             by erecting temporary barriers.     It was noted that it was the policy of

             the Police to aim for the exclusive use by visiting supporters of the west

             stand and terrace.     The Working Party agreed that the Club would consider

             a scheme for permanent barriers at the rear of the stand subject to the

             necessary approvals.     It was also noted that the cracked brickwork

             previously mentioned should continue to be monitored and that the apparent

             rusting of steel columns at the rear of the stand should receive

             appropriate treatment.

           1986-1988

   128.    There are no other file references in respectof the Leppings Lane End        of

           the sports ground other than those dealt with     elsewhere in the statement.

           It should also be noted that inspections were     taking place on a

           regular basis throughout this period.


                              Further Comments on the Certificating System

           Further comments

   129. At the time the current Safety Certificate was issued, the terms and

           conditions contained therein were those thought by the South Yorkshire

           County Council on the advice of the various interested parties to be

           necessary or expedient to secure reasonable safety of spectators at the

             sports ground.    There is no evidence from the files that the Certificate

             Holder or any other interested party has appealed to the Secretary of

             State (up to 1st January, 1988) or to a Magistrates' Court (thereafter) in

             respect of the Certificate Conditions.


    130.     Section 2(4) of the 1975 Act (as amended) states that the Safety

             Certificate must have attached to it a plan and the terms and conditions

             shall be framed by reference to it, where appropriate.    Paragraph 5 of the

             General Safety Certificate refers to plans.    Under Schedule 1 of the

             Certificate, the definition of plans is "document or documents attached to

             and forming part of the General Safety Certificate and signed by the

             person signing the Certificate ...".     When the files were handed over to

             the Sheffield City Council in April, 1986 a copy of the General Safety

             Certificate for Hillsborough was in an envelope, together with a number of

             plans, none of which were signed by Mr.     Mallett (the original signatory

             of the Certificate).     The original Safety Certificate and plans are lodged
                                             *

             with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited (the Holder).


   131.      Under Section 3(3) of the 1975 Act applications for Certificates had to be

             copied to the Police and the Building Authority.     Sheffield Wednesday



HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                 -41-


           applied for a Safety Certificate on 8th September, 1978 (Document 6, pages

           45-48).   Copies of the application were sent to the Building Authority,

           the Police and the Fire Service on 13th September, 1978 (Document 76, page

           235, Document 77, page 236, Document 78, page 237).      There was no formal

           notice issued by the County Council requiring the Holder to supply further

           information to enable it (the Council) to determine the terms and

           conditions of the Certificate.    The matter was dealt with in lengthy

           correspondence and by consultation.


    132.   The amendment and replacement of Certificates is governed by Section 4 of

^          the 1975 Act (as amended) and the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations

             1976, which were superceded on 1st January, 1988 by the Safety of Sports

             Grounds Regulations 1987 (Document 3, pages 30-35).


    133.     The 1975 Act (as amended) provides that a local authority may, if it feels

             it appropriate to do so, amend a Safety Certificate by notice in writing

             to its holder or replace it.   A Safety Certificate may be amended or

             replaced either with or without the application of the Holder of the

             Certificate.   Section 4(4) of the 1975 Act (as amended) indicates that a

             notice under Section 4(l)(a) amending a General Safety Certificate shall

^          specify the date on which the amendment to which it relates is to come

             into operation, and the date so specified may be a date later than the

             date of issue of the notice.   The Regulations make further provision with

             regard to the amendment of the Certificates.    Regulation 5 provides that

             where a local authority issues or amends a Certificate it shall as soon as

             practicable give notice in writing of the issue or amendment . . .       to

             every interested party.   In addition, the local authority in giving

             notices must inform the persons to whom notice is given that a copy of the

             Safety Certificate and the application may be inspected and where and at

             what time such inspection may be made.     In addition, the local authority

             must publish a notice in a newspaper as soon as maybe after the

             decision including certain information.

   134.      On 3rd September, 1981 the South Yorkshire County Fire Service Committee

             resolved to amend the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club General Safety

             Certificate by replacing Conditions 10 and 26 of the Safety Certificate.

             The amended Condition 10 contains slight wording differences to the

             original.   Condition 26 varied the time limits in relation to

             electrical certificates.   There is no evidence from the file that these

             revised conditions were in fact properly brought into effect.


   135.      At a meeting on 21st August, 1986 (Document 79, pages 238-239) the City

             Council's General Purposes Panel resolved to amend the capacity of the

             Spion Kop at Sheffield Wednesday to 21,000 spectators.    The Panel agreed

             to amend the Certificate subject to a number of conditions, one of

             which related to temporary additional stewarding to be provided until

             certain works on crush barriers on the new Spion Kop were completed.      This

             condition related to two matches.   The amendment to the Certificate only

             affected the capacity at the Spion Kop end of the ground.    The Inquiry has

             prompted a review of this amendment and it transpires that no notice was

             inserted in a newspaper in connection with this amendment.    The Panel's

             deliberations attracted considerable publicity and copy of a report in the

             'Star' newspaper of Friday, 22nd August, 1986, is attached to this

             Statement (Document 80, page 240). Additionally, the General Safety

             Certificate is regarded as a public document and therefore the spirit of

             the legislation has been met.


   136.      On 1st December, 1986 the General Purposes Panel resolved (Document 81,

             page 241) to amend Schedule 1 of the Certificate so as to extend the

             definition of specified activity to include Royal visits.    Again, the

             notice provisions of the legislation were not observed.


   137.      Under Section 5 of the 1975 Act (as amended) interested parties may appeal

             against or about the terms and conditions in a Certificate and the




HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                  -43-


             Council's refusal to amend or replace it.   According to the files, there

             have been no appeals.


   138.      Under Section 8 of the 1975 Act (as amended), the Certificate Holder must

             give notice to the Council if he intends to alter or extend the sports

             ground or any of its installations (if that alteration or extension is

             likely to affect the safety of persons at the ground).     To the best of my

             knowledge, this Section has been complied with by Sheffield Wednesday

             Football Club; the developments which have taken place have been the

             subject of lengthy correspondence in each case.


   139.      The Council as Certificating Authority may issue a Prohibition Notice

             under Section 10 of the Act if it feels there is a serious risk to

             spectator safety.   No Prohibition Notices have been issued in respect of

             Sheffield Wednesday.


   140.      It is the duty of the Council under Section 10B(1) of the Act to arrange

             for the inspection of stadia at least once every 12 months.    At its

             meeting on 7th September, 1987 (Document 26, pages 128-130) the General

             Purposes Panel noted the details contained in a report by the Head of

             Administration and Legal Department about the operation of the Council's

             certification function for the safety of sports grounds.    One of the

             details mentioned in the report relates to inspections and the proposal

             that one large scale inspection per stadium should be carried out.       In

             fact the report itself does not make clear my intention that these

             inspections should be annual.   My intention at the time, and the Council's

             practice since has been to arrange annual inspections of sports grounds.

             The report goes on to indicate that these inspections would be backed up

             by a series of "during event" inspections which proposal was in line with

             both the Popplewell Report and with licensing practice in other areas.        I

          . am aware that the Fire Service visit the sports ground during events and

             of course the Police are present during most specified activities.

             The Safety Certificate

   141.      Under Condition 1(1) of the Safety Certificate, the Holder's nominee must

             be approved in writing by the Council.


   142.      Currently, the nominee is the Club Secretary.     On the 15th October, 1987,

             the City Council wrote (Document 33, page 140) to Sheffield Wednesday

             pointing out various provisions of the new Green Guide and making

             particular reference to the appointment of a Safety Officer as defined in

             Chapter 2 o f ’the Guide.   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Pic responded

             to this letter on 23rd October (Document 34, page 141) and confirmed that

             Mr.   Mackrell's duties encompassed those of the Safety Officer and

             requesting that the Council's records be amended to note that he is

             responsible for all matters    of safety within the ground.


   143.      Under Condition 8(1) of the Certificate the Holder is required to provide

             and maintain at the sports ground, to the satisfaction of the Council, a

             suitably equipped first aid room.     The first aid room was installed and

             noted by the Officer Working Party to be in use on 21st February, 1983

             (Document 67, page 207).     The question of first aid facilities was raised

             and discussed during 1987 and 1988 (Document 28, page 134 and Document 82,

             pages 243-244).

             Sheffield Wednesday - The Up to Date Position

   144.      On Wednesday, 10th May, 1989 the pre-planned annual inspection of the

             ground commenced involving Police Officers, Fire Officers and Council

             Officers from the Health and Consumer Services Department, the Building

             Surveyor's Division and the Administration and Legal Department.      Detailed

             enquiries are being made of Sheffield Wednesday pursuant to the

             inspection.

                                      FURTHER GENERAL COMMENTS


           General Safety Certificate Conditions

    145.   A copy of the Safety Certificate and the Conditions which form part of it

             is attached to this Statement (Document 19, pages 103-112).      There are

             some 31 terms and conditions contained in Schedule 2 to the Certificate.

             The Holder is required to comply with various terms and conditions

             to the satisfaction of the Council, the Fire Officer or the Chief

             Constable as provided for in the particular condition.    Generally, for

           monitoring the ground the Council relies on annual inspections, during

^            activity inspections and being notified by, for example, the Club of any

             proposed development or the Police (as they are present during most

             specified activities) of any matter which causes them concern.     In

             addition, following the Home Office Circular 72/1987 (Document 4, pages

             36-43) the Council would (where practicable) obtain copies of relevant

             certificates of testing, etc.   on annual inspection.    I set out below my

             comments on certain of the conditions.


             Condition 3

    146.     This condition relates to the number of spectators who may be vadmitted to

^            the various areas of the Stadium.   These restrictions on the numbers of

             spectators admitted to the Stadium are also referred to as capacities.


    147.     At the 1989 inspection a sample of the turnstile records was obtained.        It

             is understood that these records are available from the Club for past

             events.   There is reference on the file to individuals obtaining access to

             the ground with forged tickets (Document 38, page 148) and reference to

             numbers of people with tickets for the "opposing" end of the ground being

             removed to "their" end of the ground (Document 38, pages 147-148).      There

              is no evidence on file to suggest that the Club deliberately allow more

              people into the ground than is provided for in the certificate.

              Paragraphs 27-29, 31, 34 and 95 of my Statement refer to capacity on the


HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                  -46-


            Leppings Lane Terrace and there are other references to capacities on the

            Spion Kop.     There have been no amendments to spectator capacities in

            respect of any part of the ground since the Spion Kop development in

            1986.


    148.    Questions have been raised about the adjustment to capacities in relation

             to the alterations to the Directors' Box in the South Stand and also in

            relation to the incorporation of facilities for people with disabilities

             in the North Stand.    There is no reference on file about any changes to

             the Directors' Box on the South Stand.      At no time during the discussions

^           in relation to the new facilities for the disabled was any mention made        of

             changes in capacity for the north stand.      Had the question of capacity

             been an issue I would have expected the Advisory Group members to raise

             it.


             Condition 8

    149.    This Condition relates to first aid facilities and associated matters.


    150.    The County Council, in 1979, approached the Area Health Authority for

             advice on first aid facilities at Sheffield Wednesday.      The Area Health

             Authority responded on 31st May, 1979 (Document 87, pages 271—273) with        a

             list of requirements. References are made in the list to two or three

             treatment couches; six stretchers, two sets of stretcher wheels, 20

             blankets, six pillows and one "minute man" resuscitator.      Other comments

             are made about water requirements, lighting, etc.      On 15th August, 1979

             (Document 16, pages 93-95) the Officer Working Party requested the Club to

             provide a permanent first aid structure during the 1980 close season,

             subject to the Club agreeing to provide the recommended first aid

             equipment immediately.                       V/


     151.     On 21st December, 1979 (Document 88, page 274) the County Council wrote to

              Sheffield Wednesday indicating that the existing first aid facilities were

              accepted on an interim basis only pending\the erection of purpose built

HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                   -47-


             facilites in the 1980 close season.   On 20th April, 1982 (Document 89,

             pages 276-277) the County Council wrote to Sheffield Wednesday following

             an Officer Working Party meeting at which the Club's outline drawing for

             new Police and first aid facilities was considered.   As far as the first

             aid facilities were concerned, four comments were made in particular:-

               (a)   The walls of the first aid room should be lined with a suitable
                     non-combustible and easily cleaned material, which would not need to
                     be redecorated.

               (b)   Lockable storage facilities for blankets, stretchers, etc. were to be
                     provided.

               (c)   A telephone point was to be provided in the first aid room.

               (d)   The floor was to be of easily cleanable material (such as quarry
                     tiles, etc.)


  152.      The Officer Working Party at its meeting on 21st February, 1983

             (Docment 67, page 207) noted that the new Police and first aid facilities

             under the north stand had been welcomed by the users and were proving to

             be most useful.


  153.      Following the interim Popplewell report, the County Council wrote to

             Sheffield Wednesday on 9th August, 1985 (Document 31, page 138) and drew

             attention to the necessity of providing adequate first aid and first aid

 ^           room facilities.   Attention was also drawn to Condition 8 of the Safety

             Certificate.   In December, 1987 (Document 90, page 278 and Document 28,

             page 134) the City Council wrote to Sheffield Wednesday in response to the

             annual inspection which took place on 6th August, 1987.    It.was noted on a

             schedule attached to the notification letter to Sheffield Wednesday that

             "The main first aid room requires to be supplied with adequate first aid

             equipment for the treatment of spectators .   .   ." It was also mentioned

             that the provision of qualified first aiders was being reviewed and the

             views of the Club on this subject were sought.


     154.    In a letter dated 15th January, 1988 (Document 82, pages 243-244) Messrs.

             Eastwood & Partners responded to the Council's comments and noted the



HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                  -48-


           views expressed on first aid equipment.       They went on to say that the Club

             regularly liaise with St.   John Ambulance about manning levels and a

             sufficient number of first aiders is provided for each game in line with

             the recommendations given by the football league.


    155.     The Green Guide deals with the question of first aid in paragraph 29

             (Management Responsibility).   Paragraph (x) is "to provide first aid

             facilities and first aid staff".


             Paragraphs 50 and 143 of my Statement also refer to first aid facilities.


)          Condition 8(2) requires that during every specified activity a doctor

             shall be available to attend at the first aid room if required.


             Condition 8(3) relates to the number of first aid assistants required to

             be in attendance at specified activities and the condition states that

             there must be one first aid assistant for every 2,000 spectators.     Neither

             the County Council nor the City Council have varied that ratio.


             Condition 9

    156.   This condition relates to stewarding and makes particular reference to

^          fitness and capability to carry out their duties, training and

             instruction, identifiable dress and written instructions as to their

             general duties.


             A schedule specifying the duties and responsibilities of safety stewards

             was handed to Club representatives on 10th April, 1980 at a meeting of the

             Officer Working Party (Document 98, page 302).


             At a meeting of the Officer Working Party on 13th November, 1985 (Document

             59, page 187) it was agreed that a draft booklet which had been prepared

             by the Police outlining the duties of safety stewards was acceptable and        -

              that it should be distributed to designated grounds for the information

              and guidance of stewards employed there.    Factors peculiar to particular


HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                   -49-


             grounds could of course be added if considered appropriate.

             Unfortunately, there is no copy of the booklet (which is identifiable as

             sudi) on the file.   The Police and the Fire Service are involved in annual

             briefing exercises for stewards and in addition there are tests of the

             emergency procedures which include the stewards duties.    I also understand

             that there are pre-match briefings of stewards.    There are two emergency

             evacuation procedure drills particularly referred to on the files; the

             first being mentioned at Paragraph 43 of my Statement.    This relates to a

             test on 4th October, 1983 by the Fire Service.    The Fire Service stated

^            that ". . . the stewards they questioned would have known what to do if

             this message had been heard . . . " (Document 21, page 118).


    157.     On 14th November, 1987 (Document 99, pages 305-306) the Police instigated

             a trial of the emergency evacuation procedure during a match and found

             there to be some deficiencies in the Public Address System which were

             subsequently reported to the Club.    Again, there is no comment that the

             stewards' responses were in any way inadequate.


    158.     Paragraphs 43, 91, 92, 111, 113, 114, 171 and 191 of my Statement refer to

             stewarding.    There has been no concern recently expressed about stewarding

             at the Leppings Lane end of the sports ground, but the Building Surveyor

             did comment on the Spion Kop stewarding in a memorandum dated 2nd

             February, 1988 which was considered by the Safety of Sports Grounds

             Advisory Group on 23rd March, 1988.    It was indicated by the Police

             Representative at that meeting that the point had been taken up with

             Sheffield Wednesday.    Some records of steward training were produced at

             the 1989 inspection of the ground and further details are being obtained.


             Condition 10

    159.     Condition 10 refers to the immediate and easy opening of final exit

             doors/gates, the manning of those doors/ gates by stewards and the opening

             of them at appropriate times.    The Police determine which doors/gates are


HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                 -50-


             opened/closed on match days and no' complaints have been received from the

             Police or the Fire Service about this procedure.     Neither have there been

             complaints about the manning of doors/gates by stewards.     The final exit

             gates are subject to at least annual inspection by the Fire Service and

             occasionally by the Building Surveyor.     Other references in my Statement

             to the type of items covered by Condition 10 can be found at paragraphs

             43, 92, 103, 110 and 134.



             Condition 11(4)

  160.       This Condition refers to the maintenance of all means of ingress to and

             egress from the sports ground in good condition and free from obstruction.

             Generally these routes are checked both on annual inspection and during

             specified activities by the appropriate Advisory Group members.


             Condition 15(1)

  161.       This Condition relates to the structural parts of the sports ground which

             are required to be maintained in sound order and to the appropriate and

             relevant standards in the Guide, and in all cases to the satisfaction of

             the Council.


             Presumably when the County Council issued the Safety Certificate to

             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd in December, 1979 it was satisfied

             (subject to compliance with certain conditions) that this ground was

             reasonably safe (Document 14, page 85).


             Various structural parts of the sports ground are also checked on

             inspection. It should be borne in mind that full structural surveys of

             buildings at the sports ground is rarely practicable in view of their

             considerable size.   Separate consideration is, of course, given to

             structural alterations at each sports ground as and when they are

             proposed.




HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                  -51-


  162.       My Statement refers at some considerable length to structural matters.


  163.       As far as the Leppings Lane Terrace is concerned, it was subject to a

             visual inspection by the Building Surveyor on the 1988 inspection.      The

             tunnel (connecting the Leppings Lane Terrace and the open area at the

             back of the West Stand) and the turnstile wall were inspected at that

             time.


             Condition 16

  164.       This Condition covers the maintenance of emergency equipment and the

             maintenance, repair or renewal of any items within the Stadium as may from

             time to time be necessary.   There is also a requirement to maintain the

             operational parts of the Stadium in good and efficient working order.      The

             matters covered by this Condition are generally dealt with on annual

             inspections and by during event visits where appropriate.


             Condition 18(2)                                s

  165.       Emergency vehicle access routes are covered by this Condition.       The Fire

             Service has commented on 16th May, 1979 (Document 13, page 84) that

             adequate roads should be provided to ensure that speedy and direct access

             can be obtained by emergency vehicles to all exterior parts of the

             stadium.   They also mentioned that it was necessary to ensure that parked

             vehicles would not obstruct this access.    I understand from this

             letter that the Fire Service only require vehicular access to the exterior

             of each building in the football ground.    The emergency access routes are

             shown on plan 1610/11A.   The Officer Working Party at a meeting on 12th

             November, 1979 (Document 18, page 101) agreed that whilst no real problems

             had occurred in the past the Club would in consultation with the Fire

             Service and the Police mark out a lane from the main gates to the south

             stand in which parking would not be allowed.    It was also agreed that the

             hydrant outside the south stand would have to be kept clear.     The Police

             noted on 26th March, 1980 (Document 84, page 264) that they did not have


HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                 -52-


         any current problems in respect of the access for emergency vehicles.

         Access for ambulances is referred to at Document 87, page 273 and Document

         86, page 269.      The reference in Document 86 is set out in greater detail

         be low.


 166.    During the planning stage for the redevelopment of the kop, the Club

         offered (letter from Eastwoods 29th November, 1985 - Document 85, page

         268) to widen the gangway between the North Stand and the retaining wall

         of the kop to enable fire engines to get to the front of all stands.         The

         Fire Service responded to this at an Officer Working Party meeting (22nd

         January, 1986 - Document 61, page 193) by saying that whilst they felt

             that such a facility was not essential for their purposes it could be

             useful for use by emergency vehicles in certain situations and generally

             should be supported.   In a letter from Eastwoods dated 18th December, 1986

             (Document 86, pages 269-270) proposals were submitted for creating a new

             entrance to the Sports Hall off Penistone Road so that the public would no

             longer have to use gate 'O', (Plan numbers 7593/1 and 2).   Another purpose

             of the development was to provide separate access for Police vehicles,

             ambulances, etc.   on match days; the proposal effectively reduced dangers

             which could result from vehicles having to pass queueing spectators to
             gate
             'O'. This development did take place.


  167.       It is the responsibility of the Club to maintain these access routes, free

             of obstruction, and the emergency services have never inSicated that there

             have been problems with them.   I would expect the Police (who are present

             during the majority of specified activities) to make appropriate comments

             should the need arise.


             I understand that meetings have taken place between the Police, the Fire

             Service and the Ambulance Service on the emergency evacuation procedures

             at Sheffield Wednesday.   I assume those discussions dealt with the




HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                    -53-


               emergency access of vehicles to the sports ground.     The City Council has

           had no direct contact with the Ambulance Service on this matter.


               Condition 24

168.           This Condition relates to the engineers' annual inspection of the sports

               ground.   There is no record of any copies of Certificates being submitted

               in 1984-1987, but a copy of the 1988 Certificate (dated 2nd August 1988 -

               Document 100, page 307) was submitted on 10th May, 1989.     Previous

               Certificates were submitted for 1980 to 1983 - see Document 68, pages

               208-209 and Document 70, pages 214-215 for examples.


               Condition 28

169.           This Condition prescribes the various records which need to be kept by the

               Holder and produced to authorised officers on request.     The records kept

               under Condition 28(1),(2) and (3) were checked on 10th May, 1989 and

               subsequent enquiries about them are being made.   The checking of records

               under Condition 28(4) is not practicable;   due to the wide ranging scope

               of the condition.   However, all major work is inspected through specific

               applications or inspections.

               THE LAYOUT OF THE LEPPINGS LANE TERRACE
               WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO PENS 3 AND 4

170.           In the earlier part of my statement (see paragraphs 101-118) I refer to

               the full history of discussions and decisions between the interested

               parties (the Police, Fire Service, the Building Authority and the Club,

               and its Consulting Engineers) leading up to and following the installation

               of the radial fences on the Leppings Lane terrace.     It will be recalled

               that the installation of fences took place in two distinct stages in 1981

                and 1985.   In relation to the 1981 proposals it is clear from the

               correspondence on file, which is particularly referred to in my statement,

                that the fences were erected only after careful and thorough consideration

               by the appropriately qualified experts.




  \r f t t t
                                                   -54-


  171.       In early 1985 the Club, via their Consulting Engineers, Messrs.

             Eastwoods & Partners, submitted proposals to alter the Leppings Lane end

             of the ground and to construct two new radial fences on the Leppings Lane

             terrace.   The reasons for the additional fences on the Leppings Lane

             terrace involved the better control of supporters.    Once again, full and

             careful consideration was given to the proposals by the County Council

             involving the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Authority, the Club

             and its Consulting Engineers.    Full details of the discussions dealing

             with the positioning, width and proposed stewarding of the gates in the

             radial fences are related in the earlier part of my statement.


  172.       As far as the Green Guide is concerned, paragraphs 101 to 103 (in

             Chapter 8) refer to the division of spectator accommodation.     These

             paragraphs of the Guide are drafted in general terms.    There is no

             evidence on the file to suggest that the penning arrangements at Leppings

             Lane conflict with the general statements contained in the Guide.

             Obviously, the pens were constructed over a number of years, and were

             installed and approved in that situation by all the interested parties I

             have already listed.


             Crush Barriers on the Leppings Lane Terrace
             Layout

  173.       The layout of the barriers was approved when the Certificate was issued on

             21st December, 1979.   The barrier layout must have been reviewed when the

             radial fences were installed in 1981 and 1985.


  174.       On 7th August, 1986, the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was subject

             to an annual inspection.   During the course of this annual inspection I

             recall that the Police representative requested that crush barrier number

             144 be reduced so that the persons entering the terrace from the tunnel

             would not be obstructed by it.    Apparently, there had been some

             difficulties in this area.   The barrier itself penetrated the central




HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                  -55-


         radial fence immediately in front of the tunnel.       The barrier was indeed

         reduced with the result that barrier 144 now contains only one section,

         that is in the north central pen (see plan 1610/64E).       This issue was

         considered at the time of the inspection in the presence of

         representatives from the Fire Authority, the Police, the Building

         Authority and Messrs.       Eastwood & Partners, the Club's Consulting

         Engineers.       No problems with this revised barrier arrangement have been

         brought to my attention.


 175.        I should, however, point out that no written record of the decision to

             reduce the barrier is noted on the file.    I can, however, say that I

             remember the discussion and that none of the persons present objected to

             the reduction of the barrier.


             Strength

  176.       As far as the strength of the barriers is concerned, they were tested

             by Messrs.   Eastwood & Partners on 14th, 15th, 18th and 19th July, 1988

             and the report (Document 83, pages 246-249) is attached to this statement.

             There were one or two defects discovered on the test which are noted in

             Eastwoods' letter which were remedied during 1988.    The barriers had also

             been tested in 1979 and 1983.


             Height

  177.       Prior to certification, it was brought to the attention of the Working

             Party (Document 9, page 66) that many of the barriers were below the

             height recommended in the Guide.    This was brought to the attention of the

             Club at a meeting on 2nd April, 1979 (Document 10, page 71), and was the

             subject of detailed discussion between Dr. Eastwood and the Building

             Surveyor.    As the ground was subsequently certificated by the County

             Council without requiring all the crush barriers to be replaced, I

              conclude that the Guide was applied flexibly as advised by the Home Office

              and that the Council were satisfied that the ground was reasonably safe.

            The Access Tunnel to the Leppings Lane Terrace

    178.    This tunnel which runs beneath the west terrace is not of a constant

            gradient and at the end increases to a gradient of 1:6 on the approach to

            the terrace itself.


    179.    The files in my possession indicate that there have been no

            discussions about the tunnel itself.     No complaints have been received

            about the tunnel.     As far as I am aware there have been no problems with

            the tunnel and as it has been used for many years by many thousands of

            spectators without apparent difficulty or incident.


            The Wall at the Leppings Lane Turnstiles

    180.    The wall at the turnstiles is approximately 14' high from ground    level to

             the coping stones and should prevent persons climbing into the ground in

             the majority of circumstances.


             Prohibition Notices in respect of Sheffield Wednesday

    181.    No Prohibition Notices have been issued in respect of Sheffield

             Wednesday as there was no indication that there was a serious risk to

             spectators warranting such action.    The Inquiry will be aware that since

             the tragic events at Hillsborough the Leppings Lane end of the ground has

^            been largely closed and certainly no spectators have been admitted to the

             terrace or to the west stand.


     182.    On 25th April, 1989 a meeting was held between the Club and the various

             officers and it was agreed that the next two football matches would be

             postponed as the Leppings Lane end of the ground was closed which

             prevented the efficient segregation of spectators and emergency

             evacuation.   It was agreed that reserve matches could go ahead as they
                                                           V
             have a limited number of spectators.


     183.    On 2nd May, 1989 there was a meeting held to discuss future games and

              on 4th May, various officers visited the spirts ground to look at the
                                                          VV
                                                           Y".
HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                  -57-


             pro posed plans for segregation, admission and evacuation of spectators

             for football matches.    It was agreed that matches could go ahead using

             part of the Leppings Lane end, but not the terraces or the stand.      The

             Leppings Lane end remains closed and will not be used for the time being.

             If it appears necessary to do so, the Council will consider issuing a

             Prohibition Notice to prevent the opening of the west terrace prior to the

             interim report of the Inquiry, as extra works required at the ground may

             then be determined.


             The Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987

   84.       Following the commencement of the Act, the existing delegations, etc.

             were feit to be sufficient and the matter was fully reviewed in a report

             to the General Purposes Panel in January, 1989.     The various delegations

             were then restated as far as it was necessary to do so.     On receipt of

             Home Office Circulars 71/1987 (Document 2, pages 17-29) and 72/1987

             (Document 4, pages 36-43) were circulated to all members of the Advisory

             Group.


             The Safety Certificate

  185.       The original 1979 Certificate is still in force in respect of Sheffield

             Wednesday.   Amendments to it are dealt with by letter and do not as such

             feature in the body of the Certificate.     Amendments to the Safety

             Certificate are dealt with in paragraphs 133-136 of my Statement.


             Directional Signs in relation to access to the ground

   186.      There has been criticism about the adequacy of directional signs within

             the sports ground which would direct people to pens other than the two

             central pens on the Leppings Lane terrace.     The point has been made that

             fans entering through turnstiles A to G or Gate C could only see the

             tunnel which leads to the two central pens and no other signs.     There is

             in fact one small directional sign to the right of the west stand which

             says "standing".

  187.       It is appropriate to point out that spectator flow on match days is a

             matter on which the Council would need to take advice, from the

             Club and members of the Advisory Group.      There is no record on any of the

             files that there was any suggestion of inadequacy in signing arrangements

             for the terrace at Leppings Lane and had it been a significant factor I

             would have expected that the matter would have been raised.      The provision

             of signing is not usually a complex or expensive task.


             Means of egress onto the pitch from Leppings Lane Terrace

  188.       There is no clear record on the files as to when the pitch perimeter

             fence at Hillsborough was in fact installed, but it appears to have been

             in place when the County Council first looked at the sports ground from

             the point of view of a Certificating Authority.


  189.       According to the files, the pitch perimeter gates at Leppings Lane were

             considered in 1985 when the second radial barrier development plan was

             submitted.    It was agreed by the Officer Working Party and the Club and

             its representatives that one pitch perimeter fence gate was to be provided

             per pen.     (Document 49, pages 168-169, Document 55, pages 177-178 and

             Document 58, pages 183-185).


®190.        There is no information on the files relating to whether or not the

             pitch perimeter gates should be signed.


  191.       The means of access laterally between the pens on the Leppings Lane

             terrace are the gates at the top of each radial fence immediately adjacent

             to the west stand wall.     The gates are designed so that when they are

             open a clear 1.15 metre opening remains.      Manning of gates is dealt with

             in Document 50, page 170, Document 51, pages 171-172, Document 52,

             page 173, Document 53, page 174, Document 55, pages 177-178, Document 56,

             pages 179-180, Document 57, pages 181-182 and Document 58, pages 183-185.

      192.       There are no gangways as defined by the Guide on the Leppings Lane

                 Terrace.   Annex 'A' of the Green Guide defines gangways as being channels

                 for the passage of spectators through a terrace running across the slope

                 (lateral gangway) or running with the slope (radial gangway).   Paragraph

                 96 of the Guide indicates that the aim should be to ensure that every

                 spectator on the terrace is within 12 metres of a gangway or exit so that

                 they can move quickly on to exit routes at the end of an event or in the

                 event of an emergency.


V     i93-       All the proposed major alterations to the terraces have been considered by

                 the Working Party and therefore subject to full and careful consideration

                 by the interested parties.

       bringing in Part II of the 1987 Act with effect from 1 January
       1988.
       2.   This circular, together with Annex A, introduces the
       provisions of Part II of the 1987 Act and gives advice on the
       effects and operation of them. Advice on those provisions of
       Part I of the 1987 Act (fire safety) which are to be brought into
       force by the first commencement order is the subject of Fire
       Precautions Act Circular, 14/1987.
       Implementation of Part II (Safety of Sports Grounds)
       3.   Part II of the 1987 Act, consisting of sections 19 - 25,
       amends the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act) in
       line with the Government's proposals contained in the
       Consultative Document published in June 1986 in response to the
       safety recommendations of the Popplewell Inquiry set up following
       the fire tragedy at Valley Parade on 11 May 1985. Thu main
       changes effected by Part II are as follows;-
       Section 19:- removes the distinction between sports "ground" and
       sports MstadiumM with consequential modifications to section 2(2)
       of the 1975 Act dealing with the contents of safety certificates.

       Section 20:- empowers the Secretary of State to vary the
       designation threshold of 10,000 under section 1 of the 1975 Act.

                                                                  I




                                          a
Section 21:- precludes'conditions in safety certificates
relating to police presence unless the extent of the presence is
reserved for the Chief Officer of Police.

Section 22:-   directs appeals under section 5 of the 1975 Act to
the courts.
Sections 23 and 24:- replaces the existing emergency procedure
under section 10 by introducing prohibition notices in the case
of serious risks to spectators; and provision to appeal against
them.
Section 25:- places a duty on local authorities to enforce the
1975 Act and to arrange for annual inspections of designated
sports grounds in accordance with guidance from the Secretary of
State.                                         -
4.   Annexes A and B to Home Office circular No 7/1986 which
gives advice on the 1975 Act should be noted as necessary and
cross referenced to this circular. Particular attention is drawn
to the latest guidance on the new procedure for the issue of
prohibition notices to deal with serious risks to spectators.
Local authorities are asked to copy all such notices to the Home
Office for information until further notice. To assist local
authorities to draw up a prohibition notice a suggested format is
reproduced at Annex B to this circular.
Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1987
5.   A copy of the revised regulations is also enclosed with this
circular. The regulations reflect the changes brought about by
sections 22 and 24 of the 1987 Act and lay down time limits for
appeals. Provisions on procedures for applications for safety
certificates, their issue, amendment, transfer and replacement
are incorporated in the regulations which also authorise the
determination of fees to be charged in respect of applications
for the issue, amendment, transfer and replacement of safety
certificates.
Transitional
6.   Under the provisions of. Schedule 5 of the 1987 Act any
existing court order made under section 10 of the 1975 Act
remains in force. Similarly any appeal lodged prior to 1 January
1988 and still extant on that date will remain subject to the
appeal procedures of the Safety of Sportr. Grounds Regulations
1976 (SI 1976/1263).

Resource and manpower implications
 7.    The contents of this circular do not result in any cost or
-manpower implications other than those arising from the
 inspections to be carried out on designated sports grounds under
 section 10B(1) as introduced by section 25 of the 1987 Act.
 Circulation of Statutory Guidance under section 10B(2) of the
 1975 Act on these inspections together with any supplementary
advice is being done separately and will cover, as necessary, any
resource implications arising therefrom.

Supplementary
8.   The information and advice in this circular and in Annex A
on the 1987 Act are given in good faith but it should be
understood that ultimately only the courts can rule
authoritatively on points of law.
9.   A n y enquiries about the contents of this circular should be
directed to Mr D Macnamara 01“213 7338.
                                          Yours faithfully

ANNEX A TO HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 71/1987
FIRE SAFETY AND SAFETY OF PLACES OF SPORT ACT 1987
Advice note by the Home Office on Part II of The Fire Safety and
Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 (The 1987 Act) amending The
Ssffity of Sports Ground Act 1975 (The 1975 Act)

Introduction
1    The general background to the 1975 Act together with a
summary of local authority powers and functions under that Act,
and procedures for the issue of safety certificates is set out in
Annexes A - D of Home Office Circular 7/1986 issued 7 February
1986 (taken from earlier Home Office circulars 150/1975, 130/1976
and 187/1976). This guidance should therefore be read in
conjunction with Annexes A - D of Home Office Circular 7/1986
which will need to be cross-referenced.
2.   The Popplewell Inquiry set up after the fire tragedy at
Valley Parade concluded that the 1975 Act had worked
satisfactorily at designated grounds but recommended changes to
improve its operation. The Government's response was contained
in a consultative document published in June 198®*.
ttt 0f ^ e 1987 Act implement these proposals and introduction of
Part II as from 1 January 1988 is the first phase of this
implementation.
3.   The main Mechanism for securing safety at sports grounds
remains the safety certificate. Guidance on safety standards is
contained in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (The Green
Guide) revised in October 1986. Local authorities are reminded
of the advice contained in paragraph 5 of Annex B to Home Office
Circular 7/1986 highlighting the need to maintain flexibility in
order to take account of the different circumstances at
individual grounds.
 SUBSTANCE OF T H E AMENDMENTS EFFECTED BY PART II OF T H E 1987 ACT
 lection 19: Application of the 1975 Act to all sports grounds
 a   Section 19, together with the textual amendments of Schedule
 2*to the 1987 Act removes the distinction in the 1975 Act between
 a sports "ground" and a sports "stadium". As amended the
 provisions of the 1975 Act apply to all fPort% g*2"J*s     thSs
 in section 17(1) of that Act. The Secretary of State may thus
 designate any category of sports gr°")d        c£     that      °
 make an order extending the provisions of the Act to that
 particular class of ground.
 *     Tn mnseouence of this wider power, section 2 of the 1975
 Act (originally formulated with "stadia" in mind, particularly
 football stadia) has also had to be amended, by section 19 (2) of
 S f ? ? 8 7 Act, so that safety certificates are no longer required
 to contain certain obligatory terms and conditions. The
 secretarv of State is however empowered to stipulate by oraer tne
 lonfSrtfof a s t m y certificate for any class of sports ground.
In this way those grounds of a particular type, or grounds used
for a particular sport need not be subject to requirements which
would be inappropriate to them.
6.   As there are no present plans to extend designation to other
classes of sports ground it is not envisaged that an order under
this new power will be necessary. The discretion given to local
authorities under section 2(1) of the 1975 Act means that with
the possible exception of clauses in safety certificates relating
to police presence (see paragraph 9 below) the contents of safety
certificates will not automatically require amendment as a result
of the removal' of the obligatory terms of section 2 of the 1975
Act. Safety certificates should continue to specify maximum
spectators; include terms and conditions as to size, situation
of entrances/exits to and from the ground and parts of it
(including means of escape in the case of fire or other
emergency) plus means of access to any such entrances and exits;
terms and conditions should continue to require‘those entrances,
exits and means of access to be properly maintained and kept free
from obstruction; and terms and conditions should continue to
deal with the number, strength and situation of any crush
barriers.
                                                                     y
7.   Section 19(2) also widens the regulation powers given to
the Secretary of State by insertion of a new subsection (1A) to
section 18 of the 1975 Act thereby enabling regulations to make
different provision for different classes of sports grounds.
Section 20:   Designation of grounds - variation in qualifying
              spectator capacity
8.    Section 20 inserts subsections (1A) and (IB) in section 1 of
the 1975 Act to give the Secretary of State power to vary by
order the numerical threshold above which grounds may be
designated as requiring a safety certificate. The threshold is
at present set at 10,000 by the Act.

Section 21:   Safety certificates - police presence
9.     Section 21 adds subsection ,(2A) to section 2 of the 1975
Act. Where the    local authority includes in a safety certificate
a provision which requires the presence of the police, the
subsection requires that determination of their number is to be
left to the Chief Officer of Police. This is already the usual
if not invariable practice and this provision does no more than
give statutory force to existing arrangements. Safety
certificate conditions which do noc comply with this provision
will however be void and local authorities are advised to ensure
that any such conditions comply with the new provisions.
Section 22:   Safety certificates - appeals
10. Section 22 of the 1987 Act directs appeals under section 5
of the 1975 Act to the courts instead of to the Secretary of
State as hitherto. Such an appeal is to the Magistrates Court by
way of making a complaint (new subsection (3A) of section 5) .
There is also provision for an appeal to the Crown Court against
an order made by a Magistrates Court on determining a complaint.
Such an appeal may be made by the local authority or by any
"interested party" as defined in section 5 of the 1975 Act.
11. Subsections (4), (6), (7) and (8) of section 5 are repealed
in consequence of the removal of the Secretary of State's
functions in respect of appeals. However the Secretary of State
is given the power to prescribe by regulation the time within
which appeals under section 5 of the 1975 Act are to be brought.
These regulations will also come into effect as from 1 January
1988. There is however transitional provision contained in
paragraph 6 of Schedule 5 to the 1987 Act to preserve the
existing appeal procedures/powers in respect of appeals made to
the Secretary of State before 1 January 1988 and which are still
extant on that date.
12. Section 22(8) of the 1987 Act makes a number of
consequential amendments to section 7 of the 1975 Act
(determinations and appeals/supplementary). Subsection (8)(a)
amends section 7(1) of the 1975 Act so that it provides for an
application to be deemed to be withdrawn if the local authority
serve a notice under section 5(1) that an applicant is not
qualified for the issue of a certificate, once the time limit for
an appeal has expired. It also removes from the 1975 Act section
7(1)(b) which misleadingly implies that the local authority can
determine without an application having been made that an
existing holder of a safety certificate no longer qualifies to
hold it.    Subsection (8)(b) amends section 7(2) to make
provision to suspend the effect of the local authority decision
that an applicant is not a qualified person if an appeal is made
in the prescribed time limits. This suspension has effect until
the appeal is either withdrawn or determined by the court in
favour of the authority. Subsection 8(c) amends section 7(3) of
the 1975 Act and subsection (8)(d) repeals the provision in
section 7 of the 1975 Act by which a court could, on the
application of the local authority, give immediate effect to a
term or condition of a safety certificate which had been
 suspended as a result of an appeal.
Section 23s Special procedure in case of serious risk -
prohibition notices: and
Section 24s Prohibition Noticess appeals
13. Section 23 of the 1987 Act replaces the existing section 10
of the 1975 Act with provision for a system of prohibition
notices. Section 24 of the 1987 Act provides for appeals against
a prohibition notice.
 14. A prohibition notice may be served in respect of any sports
 ground as defined in section 17(1) of the 1975 Act or part of
 such a sports ground. The criteria for issuing a prohibition
 notice are set out in the new section 10(1) and local authorities
 should not feel inhibited from using the new powers when
 necessary. These powers are nonetheless potentially far reaching
 (see also paragraph 20 below) and local authorities are therefore
 asked to ensure that they are used with due discretion. In
 practice, the considerations leading to the i s s u i n g * a
 prohibition notice are likely to be comparable to those which now
 apply to seeking a court order, and prohibition notices should in
 general be used as a last rather than a first resort, after
 consultations with the ground operator have failed to secure
 reasonable safety improvements and amendment of a safety
 certificate (where issued) is not considered to be an effective
 way of dealing with the risk(s). It is, of coursl, noneSelesf
 important for local authorities to ensure that they have an
 effective machinery for the issue of such a notice urgently
 should the need arise. Authorities may therefore wish to
 consider delegating to a limited number of senior officers the
 authority to act on behalf of the council and i s s u e s u c h J l o t i c e
 containing directions.                                            notice

15. Prohibition notices must contain the information specified
in new section 10(2). Local authorities are also encouraged to
include in the notice directions under new section 10(4)
detailing the required remedial measures. A notice can apply
generally or to a specific occasion (new section 10(3)). A
notice may not however include directions compliance with which
would require the provision of police unless the Chief Officer of
Police has consented to their inclusion (new section 10(5)). The
extent of the provision is also reserved for his determination.
16. A prohibition notice and any amendment to it should be
served on the persons specified in new section 10(6). Where it
applies to an occasion for which a special safety certificate is
in force, notice should be served on both the holder of the
                           and ^   holder of the general safety
certificate. Failure to do so does not however affect the
validity of the notice.

17. New section 10(7) provides that a prohibition notice can
take effect immediately, if the risk to spectators is imminent or,
Whe?e                       °f th* Period specified in the notice.
      S i * 2: ?   ,    *ake immediate effect, the notice must
state that the local authority are of the opinion that the risk
to spectators is or, as the case may be, will be imminent.
I®*  ^ copy of the prohibition notice and any amendment to it                    >
        ?ent    t h e offi°er and authorities named in new section
10(8). In most cases these authorities are likely to be
represented in any safety team and are likely to have been                   *
consulted in advance.

19. Under section 10(9) a prohibition notice may be amended and
any amendment must specify the date on which it is to come into
operation (section 10(10)). Under section 10(11) a prohibition
notice may be withdrawn. Section 23(2) of the 1987 Act amends
section 12 of the 1975 Act (offences) to take account of the
changes to section 10. Section .23(3) adds to the definitions of
section 17(1) of the 1975 Act.
Appeals
                                                        V            •



20. Section 24 of the 1987 Act introduces new section 10A to the
1975 Act which provides for a system of appeals against
prohibition notices issued under new section 10 as inserted by
section 23 of the 1987 Act. The bringing of an appeal does not
suspend the operation'of the notice or of any amendment to it
(section 10A(6)) so, particularly if the notice is to apply to a
"one-off" fixture, it is important that it is served, wherever
possible, well in advance so as to enable the recipient to
exercise effectively his right of appeal. The appeal procedure
is by way of complaint to a Magistrates Court. On appeal the
court may cancel the notice or affirm the notice, either in its
original form or as amended, or with such modifications as the
court thinks fit. There is provision for a further right of
appeal to the Crown Court against the decision of the Magistrates
Court. Persons entitled to make such an appeal are listed in new
section 10A(7). "An aggrieved person" referred to in sub-section
 (7)(a) is defined in sub-section (9).
Section 25:   Enforcement : Inspections and offence of obstruction
21. Section 25(1) of the 1987 Act adds a new section 10B to the
1975 Act which provides for local authorities to enforce the
Act's provisions and, for that purpose, to arrange for the
inspection of designated grounds at least once every twelve
months in accordance with any guidance from the Secretary of
State.
22. Section 25(2) updates section 12(6)(d) of the 1975 Act by
amending the term "wilfully" to "intentionally".

                              PROHIBITION NOTICE

    NOTES
    Offences
    1.    Contravention of any prohibition notice or restriction
    imposed by a prohibition notice is an offence provided by section
    12(1)(e) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act)
    as amended by the Pire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act
    1987 (the 1987 Act) and renders the offender liable, on summary
    conviction, to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum
    (currently £2,000) or, on conviction on indictment, to an
    unlimited fine, or imprisonment for not more than two years, or
    both.
    2.   Where any person is charged with an offence under section

+   12(1)(e) of the 1975 Act it shall be a defence to prove
    (a)     that the admission of spectators in contravention of the
            notice was without his consent; and
    (b)     that he took all reasonable precautions and exercised all
            due diligence to avoid the commission of such an offence by
            himself or any other person under his control.
    3.   Section 12(7) of the 1975 Act provides that where an offence
    under that Act which has been committed by a body corporate is
    proved to have been committed with the consent or connivance of,
    or to be attributable to any neglect on the part of, a director,
    manager, secretary or other similar.officer of the body
    corporate, or any person who was purporting to act in any such
    capacity, he, as well as the body corporate, shall be guilty of
    that offence and be liable to be proceeded against and punished
    accordingly.
    4.   Where the affairs of a body corporate are managed by its
    members, section 12(7) of the 1975 Act shall apply in relation to
    the acts, and defaults of a member in connection with his
    functions of management as if he were a director of the body
    corporate.
    5.   The validity of a prohibition notice served on any person
    shall not be affected by a failure to serve another person
    required to be served with such a notice.

    Appeals
    6.   Your attention is drawn to the provision for appeal to a
    magistrates' court against this notice in section 10A of the 1975
    Act as inserted by the 1987 Act.
     Regulations made under section 10A(1) of the 1975 Act stipulate
     that a person on whom a prohibition notice is served may appeal
     to the court within 21 days after the day on which the notice is
     served on him.
Where an appeal is brought under this section against a
prohibition notice or an amendment of it, the bringing of the
appeal does not have the effect of suspending the operation of
the notice.

              Further to HOC/71/87 giving advice about the effects of changes
              brought about by implementation of Part II of the Fire Safety and
              Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 (the 1987 Act) this circular
•)            introduces statutory Guidance given by the Secretary of State on
              inspections of designated sports grounds under section 10B of the
              Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act) as inserted by
              section 25 of the 1987 Act.
              General
              The Statutory Guidance, drawn up following consultation with the
              local authority associations, has effect in respect of any
              inspection carried out under section 10B of the 1975 Act after 1
              January 1988 when, by virtue of the Commencement Number 1 Order,
              Part II of the 1987 Act comes into effect.
               Local authorities should bear in mind the mandatory nature of the
               Statutory Guidance on inspections carried out under section 10B
               of the 1975 Act whereas the supplementary* explanatory memorandum
               enclosed with the Statutory Guidance is not binding.

Resource Implications .
Whilst it is not intended to restrict the time local authorities
may feel should be devoted to this task, inspections under
section 10B (when taken with existing commitments to inspect
designated sports grounds) should not result in significant
resource implications. The scope of inspections under paragraphs
3 and 4 of the Statutory Guidance, together with associated
report work, are not intended to be as detailed or extensive as
that often required of the holder of a safety certificate, or
that which may sometimes be necessary prior to the issue of a
safety certificate. In general, inspections are not expected to
take more than about 2 man days per ground on average.
To assist local authorities prepare a report and record of
inspections a suggested basic format which can be adapted
according to preference is enclosed at Annex A.
Supplementary
Any enquiries about this circular or the Statutory Guidance
should be directed to Hr Macnamara 01-213 7338.

1975 (as inserted by section 25(1) of the Fire Safety and Safety
of Places of Sport Act 1987).


General
1.   The local authority should be satisfied that inspections
under this guidance are carried out by a person or persons
qualified for that purpose.
Scope of inspection
2.    Inspection of the ground should, where practicable, include
inspection of the following certificates of testing and records
as required under the terns and conditions of the safety
certificate to be kept by the holder and/or submitted to the
local authority.

3.   The inspection of the ground should normally include
inspection of the following items:-
(a) any part of the ground where an accident or incident
resulting in serious injury to spectators has occurred since the
last inspection;
(b) any recorded defect or deficiency which has arisen since the
last inspection and which, in the opinion of the inspecting
officer would be likely to lead to an accident which could result
in serious injury to spectators;
(c) major remedial work carried out since the date of the last
inspection to ascertain that it has been satisfactorily carried
out;
(d) all public stairways for their general condition, slip
resistance, condition of hand-rails (see also (j) below), trip

(k) 10% of the terraces or viewing slopes for general surface
condition, even-ness and slip resistance;
(1)   anchorage and fastening of 10% of any fixed seating.
(m)   any provision for the disabled.

of spectators, the authority should go on to inspect all the
crush barriers etc, terracing or seating in that part of the
ground where the sample indicated that there were deficiencies.

Testing of equipment
4.   Tests should if possible be carried out to confirm that the
following is in working order:-


                             £3
(a)   lighting, particularly on stairways and exit routes;
(b)   emergency lighting;

2.   The object of the inspections is to monitor the suitability
of the terms and conditions of the safety certificate (where
issued) in the light of any change in the condition of the ground
and secondly, to assist local authorities in enforcing compliance
with the terms and conditions of the safety certificate or other
notice served on the ground occupier.
3.   Local authorities may wish to note that the inspection is
not intended to shift responsibility for spectator safety away
from the holder of any safety certificate or ground occupier, but
rather to help see that he succeeds in achieving (and
maintaining) the safety standards intended to be set by any
certificate for the number of spectators authorised to enter the
ground for a specified activity.
General
4.   As the size, age, configuration, condition and usage of
designated sports grounds as well as the attitude of management
can give rise to different inspection needs, the discretion of
local authorities to carry out more frequent or more extensive
inspections than is laid down by section 10B of the 1975 Act is
not restricted. The requirements of the Statutory Guidance have
been set at what is seen as the desired minimum likely to achieve
the objective described above leaving authorities free to add to
the content of the inspections or increase their frequency
according to locally determined needs. In this context local
authorities may wish to bear in mind that inspections carried out
under section 10B of the 1975 Act are in addition to, not a
substitute for those required to be carried out under the terms
and conditions of the safety certificate by or on behalf of the
holder.
Inspection frequency
5.   As section 10B(3) of the 1975 Act stipulates that an
inspection should take place of a "designated" ground at least -
once every twelve months, this frequency must be observed even if
the issue of a safety certificate is delayed. Where a safety
certificate has not been issued, the inspections carried out
prior to its preparation and issue should be such as to fulfil
the requirements of the Statutory Guidance. Once a safety
certificate has been issued at least one further inspection of
the ground should be carried out either:-
within a year of its issue, or
within a year of the last inspection, whichever is the earlier.
Thereafter, inspections should take place at least annually from
the date of the last inspection.

Where an inspection of a sports ground takes place at the
discretion of the local authority for some other reason, for
example as a result of proposed alterations or an application for
amendment to the safety certificate, that inspection can be
regarded as an inspection carried out under section 10B of the
1975 Act provided the criteria of the Statutory Guidance are met.
Inspection Team
6.   The Statutory Guidance allows the local authority to
determine how best to arrange and effect inspections under
section 10B of the 1975 Act and does not stipulate that they
should be carried out by a particular professional discipline.   jj?
As it is nonetheless important that inspecting officers are
qualified for that purpose, the guidance places an onus on the
local authority to be satisfied on this account.  (The Guide to
Safety at Sports Grounds (paragraph 36) envisages that
inspections arranged by ground management will be carried out by
someone who is professionally qualified. Local authorities may
wish to consider whether inspecting officers should also be
professionally qualified.)
7.   Local authorities are also asked to bear in mind the
potential advantages of a team approach to inspections under the
Statutory Guidance and the role of the fire authority, building
authority and the police. Local authorities in London and
metropolitan counties may therefore wish to arrange at least one
inspection per year to be carried out with a representative of
the fire authority in attendance. Elsewhere, local authorities
will no doubt wish to consider inclusion of a member of the fire
service as well as a representative of the building authority.
Local authorities may also wish to consult the Chief Officer of
Police so that the opportunity can be given for a police officer
to attend at least one inspection each year.  (It is not intended
that these considerations should interfere with any internal or
locally agreed arrangements between the local authority, fire
authority, building authority, police and any other agency with
an interest in safety at the ground.)
Scope of Inspections
8.   Where possible all the items listed in paragraphs 3 and 4
of the Statutory Guidance should be inspected and tested. It is
recognised however that there may be occasions when one or more
of these elements cannot, for some reason, be inspected. For
this reason there is a degree of discretion within paragraphs 2 -
 4 of the Statutory Guidance. In this way it is hoped to avoid
the situation where the local authority has to pay repeated
visits to a ground in order to comply with the Statutory
Guidance.
9.   The Statutory Guidance does not require that an inspection
should take place at any particular time so the local authority's
discretion to carry out an inspection whilst the ground is in use
is not restricted. An "in-use" or "during performance"
inspection could therefore constitute part of the.inspection
required by section 10B of the Act even though it might not be
sufficient (having regard to the requirements of the Statutory
Guidance) to be an inspection itself.
Records                                          - _
10. Local authorities will doubtless need to keep a record of
all inspections carried out under the Statutory Guidance and may
wish to consider whether a copy of any report/record should be
sent to the holder of the safety certificate. Local authorities
are also asked to consider affording a reasonable opportunity for
any such report to be made available for inspection, if so
requested, by members of the public.

                 This report sets out our thoughts on the ground capacity
    which is attainable.
           It deals in broad terms with the necessary strengthening
    and supplementation of the crush barriers on the terraces, and
     calculations are made of the theoretical exit times.
            Calculations of exit times are also made for each of
     the stands and reference is made to the observations which were
     made at the end of the third round cup-tie on 6 January, 1979.
                 The green guide has been used as a basis foi? our cal­
     culations, although as with probably all existing grounds,                                               it
     will not be possible to satisfy all the recommendations in the
     guide.         Reasonable compromise will be needed on the part of the
     fire officer and the police.

    Standing Accommodation
    (a)     Spion Kop
                   The general layout of Spion Kop is good.          It
            has a very adequate number of gangways, with spacings
           well below the maximum laid down in the guide.           The
            slope strikes a happy balance between the requirements
            for good viewing and the requirements of safety.         '
                    "The'"only questions therefore are the adequacy
            of the crush barriers to justify a high number of
            permitted spectators, and the capacity and nature of
            the exits.
                    Where the barriers are adequate in strength
            and spacing, the guide recommends that the number
                                                           2
            of spectators should not exceed 54 per 10m         of plan
            area.      Disregarding the gangways the area of Spion
                                         2
            Kop is approximately 3120m       which would provide
            accommodation for 16,850 spectators.
                    Crush barriers can satisfy either of two
            standards.      Category A must be able to withstand a
            test load of 6kN/metrewidth (400 lb/foot approximately)
            and Category B must withstand 4.3 kN/metre (290 lb/foot).
            In 1973 tests were made on all the barriers by Toft
            and Brocklebank Ltd.      Of the 101 barriers on Spion
            Kop, 21 failed to carry the test load of 400 lb and
            a further 15 carried the load but had some actual or
            incipient defect which needed attention.           Most of
            those which failed the test, failed so badly that they
            would probably not satisfy category B standard either.
            On the other hand, it was sometimes only one part of a
            long barrier which was weak.       It should be emphasised
            that the general situation was satisfactory compared
            with most grounds.
                   Clearly it would be advisable to bring all the
                                                                              SHEET   3

               barriers up to a uniform category A standard.        It
1             should be kept in mind that it is now five years since
J             the tests and there may have been some deterioration
7             due to rusting.      Most of the barriers are made from
               2§” diameter tube which only has a thickness of 0.192
               inches when new.     Rusting is now very slow in Sheffield’s
1             atmosphere, but certain parts of the barriers are subject
               to more rusting than others and it is possible that
|             there will be an increase in the number needing attention.
                        Provided a barrier can withstand 6kN/in, the
|             maximum distance between barriers recommended i n the
               guide varies between 5m for slopes of only 5. to 2.9m
               for slopes of 30°.      These figures apply to ’peak viewing’
i              areas.      Most of Spion Kop has a slope of about 17
               for which the recommended spacing is 3.6m.      The slope of the
               upper part     changes to 25° for which the spacing is
               3.1m.
                         Whilst we believe it is arguable that parts of
               Spion Kop could be considered as not being '£>eak
               viewing areas' we are prepared to accede to the police
               view and use peak viewing~area standards for all barriers.
               This also applies to the stands at the west end of the
               ground.                     ,
                         We propose that the existing barriers should be
                supplemented by new ones as shown in red on the attached
                drawing 1610/1X.     The green shaded area behind each
                barrier shows the area which can then be assumed to be
                available for spectators.     This area, is 2958m   which
                at 54 persons/10m2 gives a capacity of 15,973.           It
                should be kept in mind that as many as 20,000 spectators
                have been admitted to the Kop in the past.

                       Spion Kop has three exits, one near each
                  end and one at the top.       The total width of
                  these three exits at their narrowest points is 12.5m.
                  The guide assumes a maximum flow rate through such
                  exits of 60 persons per minute for each 550mm of
                  width.      Thus the theoretical time to discharge
                  16,000                    spectators from Spion Kop would be Ilf mi
                  compared with a maximum of 8 minutes indicated by the
’                 guide.      We do not consider this to be a serious^,..-—        } / , <-> O ....
                  matter.      Rapid evacuation (in say 8 minutes)      is very
'i                desirable for stands where there may be a risk due to
1                 fire, or explosion, or structural failure.          In the
1                 case of terracing it is only the impatience of.spectators
■                 which might create danger.     We believe that for an
,                 interim period at least the evacuation time of'Ilf
I                 minutes should be acceptable.
                             The exits at each end of the terrace are
f)                reasonably free from hazards, except the one at the North
                   end passes under a bridge with a headroom below the
                  recommended value of Sft.^' “ This defect could be
                   removed by lowering the floor level, but we believe
                   it is far from essential to have such a large headroom,
                   and the cost of modification is not justified in an
                   existing structure.
                          The exit at the back of Spion Kop would benefit
                   from handrails dividing it into lanes.         Some remodelling
                   of the approaches to the ramp may also be thought
                   desirable.
            (b)    The West Terrace (Including Lower Level at North ^est_ Corner)
                             The west terrace has a total area of. 14S0ra       but
                   there are no gangways.       We feel that   some   allowance should

                         be made for circulation space as spectators have
                         to move    quite considerable horizontal distances
                         to achieve good packing.         The full area would
                         justify about 8000 spectators, but we suggest it would
                         probably be appropriate to allow 10% as the equivalent
                         of gangways giving a capacity of 7200 spectators.

                         approximately.      Those barriers which cannot withstand
                         6kN/m should be appropriately strengthened, "and extra
                        ones provided where necessary.
|       |                        The extra   barriers required to achieve

    |                   attached copy of drawing 1610/2X.
j                                The three   exits have a total width of about
\ I                     11.5m which would permit about 1250 people per minute
        *               to leave the ground.     Thus the terrace could be
        a               emptied in about six minutes which is very satisfactory.
             ’                   The guide   suggests that everyone on a terrace
                         should be within 12m of a gangway or exit.        There are
    1                   no gangways and some spectators will be 25m from an
                         exit.     But we feel this is of no consequence as
    J                   movement horizontally along this terrace will be easy
                         and quick.

                                   This area is also illustrated in the drawing
    j                   1610/2X.      The gross area available (there are no
                         gangways)    is about 565 m2 .     Thus if the crush barriers
    %                   were adequate and the whole area is included the number
                         of spectators could .be about 3,050.

            shown on our drawing 1610/2X,   the area which can
            be used in calculating spectator capacity is that
                                                         2
            shown in green.    This area is about 535m       corresponding
            to about 2900 spectators.     This would bring the total
            standing at the Leppings Lane end to 10,100.
                    The exits serving this part of the terraces
            are very adequate in width and there will be no
            difficulty in emptying in eight minutes.             v>^S^


    Seating Accommodation
    (a)     The North Stand
                    The form of construction of this stand is
            such that it presents a minimum fire hazard.-       The
            exits are numerous and spaced so that they satisfy
            the recommendations of the guide.
                    The exits are very marginally below the .
            recommended 1-lm width, but we do not consider this
            to be of great consequence.
                    Gangways are only 640mm wide for much of their
            length (they widen round the exit).     This is well
            below the green guide recommendation.      However,   it
            is clearly appropriate to take into account the
            general nature of the stand, the number as well as
            the width of the gangways, and above all the ease arid
            speed   with which spectators can evacuate the stand.
                    On 6 January we counted the number of spectators
            leaving in successive minutes after the final whistle.
            The figures were 71, 72, 80 and 73.     Thereafter
            the number fell off as the spectators were in no hurry.
            This established that in an emergency the green guide
            figure of 80 per minute (relating to a 1 ‘lm gangway)
            can be achieved.    With 18 exits for 10,000 spectators



                                     0
                                                                                 SHEET   7,


         EASTW OOD £t PARTNERS




                     the average is 556 per exit.      Thus the stand.would
                     empty in about seven minutes, which is within the
                     recommended limit of eight minutes.
                            Our observations in company with the fire
                     officer^ staff on 6 January showed that everyone
                     had left this stand, apart from some people who were
                     in no hurry, in about six minutes, although we also
                     counted about 40 per exit who left before the final
                     whistle.     The overall picture appears very satisfactory
                    ' and we suggest that this stand should be accepted
                     as not needing any significant modification.

I            (b)     The West Stand
^ jjlj                      This stand is very similar to the north stand
I                    in its construction.     We were not able to accurately
j •S                 assess the time taken   for it to be vacated on 6
j                    January because there were many    seats which were   unsold.
                     However,    there is every reason to believe that there
                     will be no difficulty in vacating this stand within
                     eight minutes also.     There should be no need for
                     significant modifications.

              (c)    The South Stand
                            The structure has been surveyed and appended
                     are prints of our drawings 1610/3, 4 and 5, which
                     show the plans and cross-section.       Also attached is
                     a seating plan, drawing No. 1610/6.
                             The upper part of the stand (the covered area)
                      has 5710 seats.     These are served by 12 exits (excluding
                      those serving the directors box) so that an average
                      of 476 people need to pass through each exit.        The
                      count by the fire officer’s staff on 6 January showed
                      an average of about 70 per minute passing through one
                      exit which corresponds to an emptying time of about
                      seven minutes.    Indeed there were very few people
                                                                         SHEET   8.

                 still trying to get out six minutes after the final
                 whistle.    A few had no doubt left early and a few
                 were still standing around, but the stand had       t
                 substantially emptied in about six minutes.
                         Having left the top of the stand the spectators
                 have to make their way from the first floor landing
                 via one of three staircases.    Two of these are 3.6m
                 wide and the other 2.4.    This is equivalent to 17^
                  ’lanes' of 550mm.   At 40 people per lane, 700 people
                 pass per minute.     To discharge 5710 people (less
                 those in the directors box) will therefore take almost
                 exactly 8 minutes as permitted by the guide.    '
                         At ground floor level two of the staircases lead
                 almost straight to the open air,   through a compartment
                 which is separated from the main part of the building.
                 The third staircase passes through a wide lobby which
                 will probably need three sets of self closing fire
                  doors to separate it from the remainder of the building,
                 The club intends to move the paint store from the
                  space behind this staircase.
                         The front, open-air part of the south stand is
                 well endowed with exits but these all discharge onto
                  one passage.   This passage has! a theoretical capacity
                  of only about 150 people per minute in each direction.’
                  This gives an emptying time of 11 minutes.     Because
11               the stand is open to the air and there is very
                  ready access to the pitch we do not think this rather
|§.              long emptying time is of any great consequence.


          General Requirements                                       ■
                  The police and the fire officer, and possibly the
          Building Surveyor, will no doubt wish to discuss a number of
          matters.    Prior to holding a further formal meeting they

     will probably wish to study the drawings and to pay a
     further visit.     We would like to be present when any
     further inspection is made and would appreciate contact
     being made with Dr. Wood during Dr. Eastwood's absence
     which will extend to 15 February.
             If the police would like to suggest the kind of police
     post they would like, this can be considered by the club
     and drawings prepared by us as a matter of urgency.
             A meeting to discuss all aspects of the application
     might be held around say 16 February.
             In the meantime Eastwood & Partners will be.checking
     the various electrical services so that we shall be in a
     position to discuss these at the meeting.              j


     Future Ground Capacity
            Following the upgrading of the barriers and the carrying
     out of such other works as may be required it is hoped the
     ground capacity will not fall below 50,000 made up as follows :
             Seating approximately               24,000
             Standing on Spion Kop               16,000
             Standing at Leppings Lane end
             (total including N.W.   corner)     10,100

                                                  50,100

             It will be recalled that in recent years agreement
      has been reached with the police that 55,000 spectators might
     be admitted to the ground.      This involved of the order of
      19.000 - 20,000 spectators being on Spion Kop.       Indeed,   it
      is believed that in the days when crowds of approximately
      70.000 were accommodated in the ground, the figure on Spion
      Kop probably approached 30,000.
             It should also be emphasised that the ground has an
      excellent safety record stretching over very many years.

1.___ Purpose of Meeting

Following the Working Party's meeting with the representatives of the
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. on 13th December, 1978, the
Secretary of the Club had (by letter dated 22nd January, 1979) circulated a
Report, together with Plans, drawn up by Dr. W. Eastwood of Eastwood
and Partners. The Secretary had also suggested a meeting on Friday,
16th February, 1979, to discuss the documents.

The purpose of today's meeting was to consider the views which the Working
Party should put to the Club on the 16th February.

2.     Plans

(a)     Whilst the "Notes for the Guidance of Applicants" stated that detailed
plans at 1 : 1 0 0 scale should be supplied of ail buildings and other accommodation
for spectators, some of the plans supplied were to 1:200 scale. The Fire
Service felt that the latter size were acceptable provided all of the plans were
to the same scale, and itwas AGREED that the "Notes for the Guidance of
Applicants" should be amended to read plans to 1:200 scale.

(b)    The site plan at 1:500 scale had not been supplied as required by the
Notes, but Eastwood and Partners had undertaken to prepare this in time for
Friday's meeting. The firm had also promised that all site fixtures would be
Indicated on that plan.
                                          1.
(C)     It was AGREED that the plans supplied bad inaccuracies and
inadequacies. In particular, they lacked indications of cross sections,
profiles, str u c tu r a l stability, position of handrails and balustrades, widta
of stairways, etc. Where appropriate, these could, as an alternative, be
described in a Beport.

(d)    The County Council's hope was that, in view of limited resources in
the Architectural & Building Services Division, the plans supplied and finally
accepted by the Working Party could form the basis of the Certificate
Drawings.

 3.      Beport    .

 (a)     General

 Itwas recognised that the criteria set out in the Home Office "Guide to
 Safety at Sports Grounds (Football)" required new work or reconstruction
 to be to a standard not lower than the standard set out in the Guide, and that
 In existing situations the criterion was that of a reasonable degree of safety.
 As the Guide stated, itwould be unreasonable, even if itwere practicable,
 to seek the absolute safety of everyone attending a ground.

 With these factors in mind, both the Fire Service and the Police felt that
 the flow of spectators was the most important criteria to be adopted.
 Whilst not disagreeing with this viewpoint, the Building Authority suggested
  itwould be useful to.know the reasoning behind the recommendation in the
  Guide that gangways should not be less than 1.1 metres wide. The County
  Council AGREED to try to find this information out, and the Fire Service
  A G R E E D t h e y w o u ld contact their colleagues in other areas who had been
  involved in the Certification process to ascertain how nearly the 1.1 metre
’ gangway r e c o m m e n d a t i o n had been observed in existing situations in their
  respective areas.

  At the request of the Fire Service, the County Council also AGREED to try
  and find out If there was any general recommendation on reduced
  admission ifa ground were used at a night time instead of during the day
  time.                                                                   •

   (b)     Front Cover

  Whilst Itwas probably a typing mistake, Itwas AGREED that the wording
  on the Front Cover should read "REPORT TO SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY
  COUNCIL" and not "REPORT OF SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL".
(c)    Spion Kop (pages 2,3 & 4}

The Working Party agreed with the Club's view that,with the existing three
exits, there was no way that the recommended discharge time of 8 minutes
could*be met. Where they disagreed was that an evacuation time of Ilf
minutes should be regarded as acceptable. Ifno more exits were to be
provided, the Working Party AGREED that a crowd limitation of 11,040
on the Spion Kop should be imposed.

The existing exit at the North end passed under a bridge with a headroom
below agreed by the Club to be less than the recommended value of 8 ft.
As this was In fact some 6 '6 ", the Working Party AGREED that the Club
be Informed that in their view it is essential that the floor be lowered to
remove this danger to spectators.

The exit at the South side would also require widening, and possibly flow
barriers would need installing.

The area at the back of the Kop would also require close attention.

Ifnew exits were to be provided by the Club, Itwas AGREED that at least
T W O would be required. The most economical way of providing one would
be to use the gates in the existing barrier, provided these were lined up with
the gangways, with discharge onto the pitch surround, and the other would
require to be a completely new exit.

The Building Authority felt that the majority of the crush barriers would fail
the tests, and consequently any necessary re-siting would probably not be
too much of a problem. Certainly the suggested additional barriers would
require careful consideration.

 For the purposes of crowd control, the Police suggested there should be some
 form of lateral separation. The Working Party AGREED, and itwas suggested
 that three metal fences sited centrally in the blocks (as opposed to adjacent
 to the gangways) should be provided, with access between each limited to a
 padlocked gateway under the control of the Police.

 As recent adverse weather conditions had proved*, ice and snow on the Kop
 could cause problems, and itwas AGREED that Paragraph 11 (4) of the draft
 Certificate should be amended so as to require the Club to take steps to
 clear the Kop of ice and snow before a game was played.

 The Building Authority pointed out that information was still required from
 the Club on profile and step dimensions and the slope of the Kop.

(d)    The West Terrace (pages 4&5)

III view of the lack of depth of this terrace, the Club’s offer toreduce the
spectator limit to 7 ,2 0 0 , and the discharge time of 6 . 6 minutes, the
Working Party AGREED that itwould be unreasonable to Insist that
gangways or additional exits must be provided.

However, even if the existing crush barriers were to pass the tests, the
Working Party AGREED that the barriers would require special attention
In view of the apparant sharp edges, corrosion, etc.

(e)     The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace          (pages 5& 6 )

The Working Party AGREED there were no real problems here, but the
Building Authority pointed out that as well as the crush barriers, the
existing corrugated sheeting would require to pass the appropriate tests.

(f)     The North Stand (pages 6 & 7)

Whilst the flow rates and discharge times were p r o b a b ly satisfactory (the
construction and width of the ramps being such that they could quite properly
be regarded as elevated roadways), the fact remained that the gangways in
the North Stand were only 640mm wide for much of their lengtn, compared
with the recommended width of 1 . 1 metres.

Additionally, observations had shown that two-thirds of the spectators used
 the upper exit, whilst the remainder used the lower exit. An ideal would be
,to provide additional exits at the top of the stand but, in view of its cantilever
 construction, the cost would be prohibitive.

 As an alternative, the Working Party AGREED that consideration might be
 given to removing a row of seats from the top of the stand down each gangway
 to the upper exits, with a physical barrier across the stand below the upper
 exits to ensure more equal use of both upper and lower exits by spectators.
 Ifthis would cause difficulties, a barrier in the gangways only below the upper
 exits might be considered.

 So far as the Wire Mesh barriers under the stand were concerned, the
 Working Party AGREED that these must either be removed or made of a
 permanent construction.

 (g)     The West Stand

 Whilst the exits were adequate and well spaced and the discharge times
 were acceptable in view of the type of stand, the Fire Service felt that
                                   - 4 -

to be the m ost acceptable.

if L T h a d incress/egress, the Working Party A G R E E D that two addmona!
       would £ required. It was suggested that the most economical way of
doing this was by means of one discharging at toe Spion Kop end and the
other by breaking through the wall by the Tea Bar.

Additionally, the penning arrangements of the seating would need to be
 looked at closely.

 Contrary to their initial reaction, the Tire Service felt ttat             the
 necessary Increased Are resistance measures were carried out, the stand
 « S d not be the problem from a combustabillty point of view that they had
 anticipated.

  The Building Authority expressed concern as to the cdrrosion of thesteel
  work of the stand, and considered that this would require investigation.

• The Police expressed concern about the use of the car park behind the
  Stand Persons entitled to use this car park frequently arrived just b ;. r~
  the start of a match and drove through the spectators attempting to g a m
  access to the ground. A s they left immediately afterwards the, same tMn
  occurred at the end of a match.. This practice had to be sapped, either by
  banning the use of the car park entirely on match days or imposing some sort
  of time restriction on its use before and after a match.

   {h)     General Requirements

  ■ These were not discussed by the Working Party at this stage.

(I)    Future Ground Capacity

Ifadditional exits are not provided on the Spion Kop, this will have the
effect of reducing the ground capacity to 45,140, made up as follows:-

1.   "   Purpose of Meeting

Following the postponement of the meeting with the Club because of adverse
weather and the difficulty in agreeing a mutually convenient alternative
date, the purpose of the meeting was to review the position since 12th February,
1979, prior to the re-arranged meeting with the Club which was now to take
place on 2nd April, 1979.

2.       Plans

The plans at 1:500 scale and indicating all site fixtures were, It was stillunderstood,
to be supplied by Eastwood & Partners at the meeting with the Club.

3^____ Report
(a)    General

The County Council had contacted the Home Office, but had been given little
information additional to that contained in their various Circulars. Basically,
they had said that any new work or reconstruction had to be to a standard not
lower than that set out in the Guide. However, the maximum flexibility had
to be maintained in the case of existing structures and differences in such
matters as age, size and mode of construction had to be taken into account.

The Fire Service had contacted four other Brigades with designated grounds,
and only in one case had the recommendations of the Guide been strictly
adhered to.

                                  1.




                                         0
(b)      Spion Kop (pages 2, 3 & 4)

Additional to the points mentioned on 12th February, 1979, concern was
expressed by the Building Authority as to the general maintenance of the Kop
and the loose and broken concrete at the bottom in particular. If attention
was not given to this, it was A G R E E D that it would be necessary to restrict
admission to the Kop, additional to the restriction to 11,040 if the extra
exits are not provided.

O n the question of exits, it was again A G R E E D that it was essential to line
up the gates in the existing barrier with the gangways. Of the existing two
exits, concern was expressed as to the effect of the right-angled turn on
the embankment at the exit at the rear. After discussion, it was A G R E E D
that the best compromise was to leave things as they existed, provided
handrails are provided on the stairways, taking into account the
desirability of maintaining a smooth flow.

The Fire Service queried the exact form of the lateral separation discussed
at the meeting on 12th February, 1979, as this would naturally have a
bearing on the means of escape recommendations. After discussion, it
was A G R E E D that the metal fences should not be of the climb-proof type,
that it was not intended that they should obstruct the gangways, and that
in consequence the padlocked gateway recommendation should be dropped.
However, it was A G R E E D that it was still desirable to seek 3 x 2 central
barriers but, if the Club really resisted the suggestion, 2 x 2 could
reluctantly be conceded. The Building Authority stressed that whatever
barriers were provided would have to pass the appropriate strain tests.

The fact that the height of many of the existing crush barriers was below the
recommendation in the Guide, in some cases well below, was pointed out by the
Building Authority. The corrosion point mentioned at the last meeting was
also reiterated. It was A G R E E D that these points must be drawn to the
Club's attention, as must the condition of the Score Board Structure.

 (c)      The West Terrace (pages 4 & 5)

As well as the condition of the crush barriers mentioned at the last meeting,
the Building Authority drew attention to the poor condition in places of the
terracing in small areas near to the stand. The cross-fall on the steps on
the north-west corner exit would also require attention as it tended to throw
people forward. The height of the crush barriers mentioned in regard to the
Spion Kop also applied. It was A G R E E D that all these points must be drawn
 to the Club's attention.

 (d)      The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace (pages 5 & 6)

 Having now had the opportunity of having a closer look at the existing corrugated
 sheeting, the Building Authority confirmed that it would require alteration to
 meet the requirements of the Guide.
  (e)     The North Stand foatres 6 & 7)

 The removal of a row of seats from the top of the stand down each gangway
 to the upper exits and the removal of four seats at those exit3 was
 confirmed as being a reasonable compromise to put to the Club.

 As the asbestos sheets at the top of the stand were protected, the Building
 Authority felt that these could be accepted, and confirmed that the ^lazing
 at the ends of the stands was not glass and so would not shatter.

 (f)      The West Stand toage 7 )

Consideration was given to the Building Authority's suggestion of lateral
gangways and the segregation of exits but, after discussion, it was AGREED
that the additional staircase agreed at the last meeting should be confirmed.
So long as it was of 4-unit exit width, it was A GREED it was not necessary
to insist it should be on the south-west corner. Such staircases could be
bought "off the peg” and, if not installed in the close season, it was
AGREED that a £ reduction in capacity would be necessary.

 (g)      The South Stand (pages 7 & 8 )

As mentioned at the last meeting, the penning arrangements of the seating
and the numbers of seats in the rows caused problems. Bearing in mind the
need for reasonableness and to make the situation better, it was AGREED
that, even though not strictly in accordance with the Guide, that the best
compromise was to seek the removal of the existing barriers and their
re-alignment, together with the widening of the gangways at the position
of the wings.

The Fire Service pointed out and itwas AGREED that Fire Resisting Doors
would be required leading to the Directors' seating, and 1 hour fire
resistance would be required for all problem areas under the stand. This
could be reduced to 5 hour if automatic detection equipment were to be
installed.

For their part, the Building Authority reiterated their concern as to the
corrosion of the steelwork of the stand, and also pointed out the concrete
spalling which was occurring. Again, the likelihood of the balustrading,
barriers and guardrails needing to be reinforced or replaced was mentioned.
It was AGREED all would need to be given attention by the Club,

(b)      General Requirements (pages   8   & 9)

As well as the Fire Service pointing out that the present temporary
structures used for police and first-aid purposes would need removal
from a means of escape point of view ifthe capacity of the North Stand
wus not to ba reduced, the Police stated that they were ready to discuss
with the Club the facilities they would require. Briefly, they envisaged
a permanent structure almost twice as large as the existing temporary
structure, and expected communications, detention, toilet, parade room,
etc., facilities.

So far as First-Aid was concerned, the Sheffield Area Health Authority
had confirmed their willingness to provide advice on First-Aid and ^
Medical Facilities, but the person nominated (Dr. H. Bailey - Specialist
in Community Medicine (Social Services)) was on holiday until
2nd April, 1979. He had been invited to the meeting, with the Club on
2nd April, but it was recognised that possible practical difficulties might
prevent his doing so.

                  H. E. Wright (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

    1.    Scope and Objectives of Discussions

    Mr. H. E. McGee welcomed the representatives, and stressed that the Club were
    ambitious and wanted to make the Stadium the best in Europe. Crowds had been
    averaging 11,000 this season and, viewed purely as a football operation, the Club
«   had been losing money since 1967. Commercial ventures had made the Club
    viable, and Itwas hoped to expand this side of the Club's activities. The Club’s
    eventual ambitions obviously had to be tempered by practical considerations.

    IT WAS A G R E E D -

    1.    That, whilst Designating Orders did not specify time limits for the issue of
    General Safety Certificates, itwas essential to aim for the Certificate to be Issued
    by the start of the 1979/80 Season.


                                            1.
2.    That, as the Club wanted to attract representative games, the aim should
be for the Stadium to be certificated for m a x i m u m crowds.

2^    That as m u c h work as possible should be carried out In the close season,
bearing In mind that because of the recent continuous spell of bad weather, this
will be m o r e restricted than usual. The Annual Jehovah's Witness Bally had
also to be borne In mind.

 2.    Discussion on Standing Areas

A.     Solon Kop

 IT W A S A G R E E D -

 1.    That the siting and angle of the new barriers to be Installed be the subject
 of detailed discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

 2.    That the Club consider the Installation of simple lateral barriers (not of the
 climb proof type) for crowd control purposes in the blocks on either side of the
 central block (but not so as to obstruct the gangways).

 3.    That, In view of the clearance time of Ilf minutes compared with the
 8*minutes specified In the Guide, the means of escape be discussed In detail
 between Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service (Including the re-slting of the gates
 In the existing barriers and, possibly the widening of the existing gates and/or
 an Increase In their number).

 4.      That the headroom at the North end under the bridge be Increased to the
 m a x i m u m possible without going to the extent of underpinning.

 5.     That representative parts of the concrete wall and boundary posts and fences
 be tested to the appropriate standards.

  6.    That the condition of the concrete at the lower end, the height of some of the
  crush barriers and the scoreboard structure be the subject of detailed discussions
. between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

  7.     That the Club's longer term proposals for the Improvement of the means of
  egress be unanimously welcomed.

  8.     That the m a x i m u m capacity of the Spion Kop be determined after the foregoing
  points have been resolved.




                                             2.
B.   W est T e r r a c e

IT WAS AGBEED

1.’ That the Club's proposals for the installation of additional barriers and the
reduction in capacity to 7,200 spectators without the need for additional gangways
should be Implemented.

2.    That the question of the cross-fe.ll on the steps on the north-west corner
exit, the height of some of the existing crush barriers, as well as their corrosion
and sharp edges in places, be the subject of detailed discussion between
Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

C.    North West Corner Terrace

IT WAS AGBEED -

1.    That the Clubs proposals to bring the crush barriers up to standard and
supplemented by new barriers with a consequent capacity of 2,900 spectators should
be Implemented.

2.    That the Improvement or replacement of the existing corrugated sheeting be
the subject of detailed discussion between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

3.    North Stand

IT WAS AGBEED -

1.    That, in view of the obvious difference of opinion between the Club and the
Working Party as to the appropriate steps (Ifany) to be taken over the width of the
existing gangways, both sides be requested to consider all the points made, and
to re-consider the matter at the next meeting.

2.    That the question of fire protection works to the Store Boom and to the Team
Boom be the subject of detailed discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the
Fire Service.

3.    That the replacement (from a fire hazard point of view) of the existing Police
and First-Aid Temporary Structures under the Stand be accepted in principle, and
that the fecillties required in the new permanent structures be considered later in
the Agenda.

4.    That the existing Wire Mesh barriers under the Stand be the subject of
discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service.

5.   That the question of the provision of handrails be the subject of discussions
between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.
                                         3.




                                         a
4.   W est Stand

IT WAS AGBEED -

That, whilst the upper level of the Stand can be emptied in the required time,
consideration be given to reducing the congestion which may occur In the lower
level by examining the possibility of erecting an additional stairway at each
end of the Stand (possibly of the Fire Escape type for emergency use, rather
than for normal use).

5.   South Stand

IT WAS AGBEED -

1.    That Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor discuss in detail the apparent
spalling of the concrete frame at high levels, apparent corrosion of the main
steelwork columns, removal of the timber casing at base level for inspection (2
only as representative sample), and load testing of a representative sample of
single and double skin walls.

2.    That, to overcome the means of escape problems in the upper part of the
Stand (the covered area), the existing barriers be removed altogether, the Club
to deal with any problems about different admission charges by way of coloured
seats or some such alternative.

3.    That Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service discuss the methods of upgrading the
fire resistance in the central area, protected escape routes, and the provision of
handrails down the stairways.

4.    That the means of escape problems in the front open air part of the stand
be dealt with on the West side by making an additional exit for emergency use only
through the Tea Bar wall to the foot of the existing stairway, and that on the east
side consideration be given to providing an additional gangway to exit on to the
derelict land adjoining the Spion Kop.

5.    That no immediate answer seemed to be available with regard to a possible
limitation on the use of the car park behind the Stand by entitled persons immediately
before a match, even though police had control of Its use after a match.

6.    Ground Exits

Dr. Eastwood apologised that the 1:500 site plan had, unknown to him, not been
already supplied some time ago. He undertook to ensure that copies were
circulated without delay.



                                        4.
7.      Communications

IT WAS AGBEED That consideration would be given to the installation of an
improved public address system, with the Police having access to Its control
from their Control Boom, together with Its use as a fire alarm system, subject
to an emergency back-up system In the event of failure.

8.      Police and First Aid Facilities

IT WAS A G B E E D -
1.    That the Club accept the principle of permanently contracted Police and
First Aid Facilities.

2      That the Police would supply the Club Secretary with a copy of their initial
sketch plan showing the facilities they wished to see, and that Dr. Bailey would
inspect the existing first-aid and medical facilities and then discuss future
facilities with Dr. Eastwood.

9   .   Anv other Topics
 IT WAS AGBEED That Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service discuss the existing
 and any proposed emergency generating and fire-fighting equipment.

 10.     Future Action

 The Club stressed that they wished to carry out as much work as possible before
 the Issue of the Certificate by the start of the 1979/80 Season. If this was to be done,
 Itwas essential that any points for discussion between the various representatives
 of the Working Party and Dr. Eastwood had to be cleared without delay.

 11.     Date of Next Meeting

    IT WAS AGBEED That the next meeting should be held at 2.30 p.m. on
    Wednesday, 18th April, 1979, at the Stadium.

Apologies for absence were received from Dr. H. Bailey (Sheffield Area Health
Authority) and H. E. Wright (South Yorkshire County Fire Service).

The Note (previously circulated) of the meeting held on 2ndAprii, 1979, was considered
In conjunction with a Note (circulated at the meeting) of a meeting between Eastwood
and Partners, the South Yorkshire County Fire Service and the City of Sieffield
Metropolitan District Council Building Surveyor's Department held on 13th April, 1979.

The Note of the meeting held on 2nd April, 1979, was agreed, subject to the following
amendments and additions in the light of the further investigations and discussious:-

2A      Spion Kop

Paras. 1 & 2 - Revised copies of drawing no. 1610/lX were circulated at the meeting
showing the proposed new crush barrier layout, including the two lines of radial
barriers. This was A G R E E D in principle.

Para. 3 - A 16,850 crowd capacity on the Kop as existing would mean an unacceptable
evacuation time of some 12^ minutes. Larger and re-aligned gates in the barrier
and improvement of the existing upper exit could reduce this time to some 1 0 minutes,
but 8 minutes could only be achieved by installing a new exit of 3 metre overall width.
This could be Integrated into the proposed future scheme for enlarging and roofing the
Kop. The Club AGREED to give consideration to the proposals.


                                        1.


                                       G
Para. 4 _ The exploratory work regarding the improvement of the headroom had
stilt to be carried out, but was not expected to be a major Item.

Para. 5 - Because of the difficulty In devising a suitable method of testing In places
'(such as the top of the Kop), It was AGBE ED that proposals should be formulated
after further discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

Para. 6 - The Club accepted that the concrete required attention and that the scoreboard
structure should be looked at. It was AG R E E D that the question of the hsight of some
of the crush barriers be considered again after it was seen which of them failed on
testing.

Para. 7 - The Club stressed that their proposals for the Improvement of the means of
egress would hopefully be carried out in the shorter rather than the longer term future.

Para. 8 - The Club hoped that the testing of the existing crush barriers, together with
the installation of the new crush barrier layout and alteration of the gates in the existing
barrier, could all be carried out in the close season. Their aim was to achieve a
16, 850 crowd capacity.

2B       . West Terrace

 Para; 2 - The Club accepted that in view of the cross-fall on the north-west corner
 exit, the steps should be re-built. It was AGBEED that the other matters would be
 considered again after it was seen which of the crush barriers failed on testing.

 2C       North West Corner Terrace

 para. 2 - Whilst accepting the need for the improvement or replacement of the
 existing corrugated sheeting, the Club felt they wished to consider whether to carry
 out more extensive works so as to bring the existing unused area into use for an
 additional 250/300 spectators.                                                       ^

 3   .    North Stand

 Para. 1 - Dr. Eastwood, the Building Surveyors and the Fire Service had reached
 agreement on a scheme which could be recommended to the Club. This would
 Involve the removal of 10 seats from each of the 9 gangways and 4 seats from In
 front of each of the 9 upper exits. The result would mean a loss of 126 seats
 compared to the 225 in the original proposals. The Club A G B E E D to give
 consideration to the proposal.

 Para. 2 - The word at the end of the first line should have been 'Tea' and not ’Team’.
 It was A G B E E D that Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service would discuss in detail any
 fire protection works considered to be necessary.

The Club A G R E E D that additional exits of simple steel construction should be
provided from each end of the upper stand.

5.     South Stand

Para. 1 - The bases of two stanchions had been exposed by removing floor timber.
Whilst rusting was not excessive, It was AGBEED that all bases would be exposed for
inspection and, Ifnecessary, steel plating will be welded to any corroded parts before
encasing In concrete for permanent protection. Because of the apparent accumulation
of waste paper, wood shavings and cigarette ends beneath the floor boards, the
Club also A G B E E D that the space beneath the timber floor should be cleaned out.

Para. 2 - Provided the penning barriers were removed entirely* it was A GB E ED that
it would not be necessary to remove any seats for escape purposes In the upper part
of the stand (the covered area).

Para. 3 - It was AGEEED that timber handrails should be provided down each of the
outer edges of the main staircase; that the existing Iron centre railing shculd remain,
    that a new handrail down the centre of each side of the stairway should be Installed.
It was also AGBEED that the brick staircase walls should be buttressed where crowd
suige pressure could be generated.

paxa. 4 — So far as the front open air part of the stand was concerned, It was A GE E ED
that on the west side a new exit through a new 1.2 metre wide door adjacent to the existing
snackbar should be provided, with appropriate fire resistance measures in the
surrounding area. On the east side, consideration was given to an extension of the
footway at the front of the stand and the removal of the wall, provided the new exit was
Isolated from the Kop exit. It was A GBEED that Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service
should consider precisely what measures could be considered satisfactory so as to
avoid any loss of seats.

 6.     Ground Exits

 The 1:500 site plan was In the process of being circulated.

 7.     Communications

 The Club stressed they were thinking in terms of an upgrading of the existing public
 address system. It was A G B E E D that the Police should have an over-ride facility
 from their Police Eoom, and Dr. Eastwood undertook to look Into the possibility of
 achieving this through radio, rather than wire, means.

 8.      Police and First A id Facilities

 Paras. 1 & 2 - The Police stressed that itwas essential that there was no gap in
 the provision of Police Ricilltles when the temporary structure was replaced by
 the permanent structure. With this in mind, they were happy for the safety aspects

to receive first priority and to wait for the 1980 close season for the work to be
carried out. It was understood that Dr. Bailey had not yet completed his Investigations
into the flrst-ald and medical facilities.

d.    Any other Topics

The evening of the 27th April was agreed as mutually convenient to test the existing
emergency lighting equipment.

10.   Future Action                                                   __

Mr. McGee stressed that It was essential for decisions to be taken urgently if the
Club were to complete their plans, both from a financial and practical point of view.

The Club were to make application for financial assistance under the Football
Association's Ground Improvement Scheme, and had to have over 50,000 crowd             *
capacity If the aim of attracting international matches was to be achieved. The latest
proposals, If implemented, appeared to give a capacity of some 50,750.

So that they could be noted and returned for agreement, the Working Party asked for
2 copies of all plans (as revised) to be supplied by Dr. Eastwood, especially to the
Fire Service and the Building Surveyor.

Mr. McGee requested that he be advised If itappeared that any undue delay was
occurring as the Club wished to ensure that the certification procedure proceeded without
delay.

With regard, to future meetings I think it is essential that all matters agreed
he recorded, as we are now approaching finality in many areas and it is necessary
that we have recorded exactly the agreed matters.

I.would also suggest that in view of the approach of certification it would,
perhaps, he advisable to hold future meetings away from the ground, and that
Mr. Vaughan, as the co-ordinator, should chair such meetings.

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

I have now received the detailed comments of all of the disciplined
represented on the Working Party.

These have been collated into the attached schedule which, together with
plans, confirm formally In writing the matters discussed by the Working
Party with the Club over the series of meetings held so far and which
the County Council feel require attention so as to secure reasonable
safety at the Ground.

They are, of course, Indlvldualrrequlrements on specific matters and are
additionaljto the general requirements set out In the specimen form of
General Safety Certificate forwarded to the Club with my letter of
8th December, 1978, and discussed at the meeting held on 13th December,
1978,

After the Club has had the opportunity of considering the schedule, perhaps
you would let me k m w which of the requlraments you feel will be able to
be carried out In the close season.

Should you have any queries, Mr, D. Vaughan of my staff (ext. 422) would
be happy to discuss thepx v/lth you.

                                    Yours faithfully,

 Emergency Procedure

Emergency procedure notices should be placed at strategic points throughout
the ground.

Access for Emiergency Vehicles

 1.     Adequate roads should be provided to ensure that speedy and direct
         access can be obtained by emergency vehicles to all exterior parts of
        the stadium.

2.      Ensure that parked vehicles will not obstruct emergency vehicles on
        these access roads.

Public Address System

The existing public address system to be upgraded, with the Police having an
over-ride facility from their Police Room.

Police Facilities

A suitable permanent Police Room (with facilities as shown on the sketch plan
marked AA )to be provided in the 1980 close season.

First Aid Facilities

(i)     Structure

        The existing facilities are considered to be below an acceptable standard
        and it is suggested the Club consider providing a more permanent
        structure which is not likely to require up-grading for a very long time.
        The internal finish, particularly of the Treatment area, should be of an
        impervious nature so that it can be easily cleaned and rendered fairly
        sterile and require no decoration. This can be achieved by the use of
        tiles or formica type finish etc....

(ii)    Waiting Area

        The Waiting Area could be arranged within corridor space to minimise
        the cost, where sitting cases could wait for attention on chairs.

(iii)   Treatment Area

        The Treatment Area should be sufficient to accommodate two or three
        patients at any one time, and consideration should be given to the needs
        for privacy within the treatment area, bearing in mind that the three
        patients may well be lying on couches.
(Iv)     Lighting

         Good lighting is essential and strip lighting would be satisfactory. The
         provision of a power point would also be a basic requirement.

(v)      Water

         A supply of hot and cold water is essential; the cold water suitable
         for drinking. A hand basin and a large Belfast type sink should also
         be provided. The Club might consider whether it would be cheaper in
         the long run to provide stainless steel basins which are not subject to
         chipping.

(vi)     Toilet Requirements

         The Club should provide at least one male and one female toilet, for____
         the use of the public, and should consider whether they should provide
         an additional toilet for the use of the staff.

(vii)    Storage

         Storage facilities are required for six stretchers, and for two sets of
         wheels for stretchers, blankets and other bed linen. This storage should
         be lockable.

 (viii) Equipment

         The following is a minimum list to provide a basic service:-

         Treatment couches with lift up ends, two or three in number depending
         on space available and/or number of cuhicles, if the accommodation is
         cubicled.

          Six Stretchers.
          Two sets of stretcher wheels.
          20 Blankets.
          Six Pillows.
          One Minute-Man Resuscitator.

  (ix)    Telephone Facilities

          A telephone facility would appear to be basic in 1979. This could be
          achieved by an extension from the main switch, or by sharing with
          police.

                                                            v   •

 (x)       Car Parking

          The Club might also consider what facilities could be extended to the
          St. John's personnel for the parking of staff cars.

 Crowd Capacity

 The following numbers will be considered to be satisfactory, provided that the
 recommended work as detailed above is carried out:-

1.     Sheffield United Football Ground

The Working Party considered Preliminary Drawings nos. 1917A, 2, 3 and 4 forwarded
by Messrs. Eastwood and Partners relating to the Club's proposals to erect a new
security fence around three sides ofthe pitch at Bramall Lane.

Superintendents Gavins and Johnson confirmed that the proposals followed recommendations
which they had made to the Club on security grounds.

IT WAS AGREED that the proposals were generally acceptable, provided that the security
gates in the fence were not regarded as means of escape and that the necessary stress
calculations were supplied and were acceptable.

As they were primarily concerned with only the Bramall Lane ground, Superintendents
Gavins and Johnson left after this item.

2;____ Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground

The Working Party considered the progress of work at the Ground since their last
meeting on 12th July.

Whilst itwas agreed that the Club had done much of the outside work referred to in the
Schedule of Matters Requiring Attention (dated 8th June), the Building Authority
expressed particular concern about the possible stresses on the extensions at each end
of the West Staircase to link with the simple steel construction emergency staircases
to be erected. Itwas also pointed out that, at the present time, no strengthening of the
corrugated sheeting on the North West Terrace had been carried out and that the Fire
Prevention Works and Structural and Rectification Works in the South Stand had not
yet been commenced. The urgent need to carry out the South Stand work was stressed.

Itwas noted that Messrs. Eastwood & Partners had by letter dated 10th August received by
the County Council yesterday sent revised drawings, calculations for the steel staircase
and cantilever slabs on the West Stand, and details of the prqaosed works to upgrade fire
1




    resistance. Comments had been requested by 3rd September.

    Whilst many detailed preliminary plans had been provided by Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
    these were not suitable for including as part of the Certificate. The conditions and
    date of issue of the Certificate^re also discussed, as was the provision of the
    First-Aid Facilities recommended by the Area Health Authority.

    A letter had also been received that morning from Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
    requesting alterations to the previously agreed barrier arrangements in the North
    Stand.

    IT WAS AGREED

    (a)    that the aim be to issue the Certificate at the beginning of December; that the       ^
            Club be advised of this aim and asked to state their programme for the
            completion of the required works, any works not completed by that date to
            be included in a Schedule of Crowd Capacity Limitation to be incorporated in
            the Certificate;

    (b)    that particular emphasis be placed on the necessity of carrying out the required
            works to the South Stand as soon as possible and that provided that it is feasible
            the Building Authority and the Fire Service be requested to let the County Council
            have their observations on the structural and fire resistance aspects for
            incorporation lijto a reply by 3rd September as requested by Messrs. Eastwood
            and Partners' letter dated 10th August;

    (c)    that the question of plans to form part of the Certificate be re-considered when
            all the preliminary detailed plans being submitted have been agreed;

     (d)   that, as with the proposed Police permanent structure, the Club be requested     {
            to provide the proposed First-Aid permanent structure in the 1980 close season,
            subject to the Club agreeing to provide the recommended equipment immediately;

     (e)   that Messrs. Eastwood and Partners be advised that the alterations to the
            previously agreed barrier arrangement- in the North Stand set out in their letter

  For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


   Dear Sirs,
                                       Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
                                          Emergency Lighting Installation
              Further to our discussions with Mr. K. Jones, we would
   like to set down in detail our proposals for the upgrading of
   the emergency lighting facilities at the above Club.
              At present there is a large central battery system
   providing 240 volts D.C. which is arranged to serve the West
   and South Stands, and adjacent areas.                                                     This is achieved by an
   automatic changeover on mains failure, from AC mains to the
   DC battery supply for those circuits providing the essential
   tungsten lighting.                                For the North Stand and adjacent areas,
   there is available a second YEB supply to act as a back up in
   the event of a loss of the normal supply.
              We are proposing at this stage that new emergency circuits
   and fittings be installed to serve the Penistone Road exits,
   Spion Kop, the North Stand, the North-West Terrace,, the West
   Stand, the South-West Terrace and the Leppings Lane exit.
   The existing normal lighting for the West Stand will be excluded
   from the battery load, and the spare battery capacity made
   available will serve the new emergency installation.

                                                        Registered in E n g r * l ^ j N o . 1134531
EASTWOOD ft PARTNERS




           The duration of the battery supply will be substantially
   unchanged by this redistribution of load, and will give more
   than adequate time for clearing the ground.      As these are
   existing grounds, we would not recommend to the Club that
   their installations should comply in all respects with the
    standards set for new premises, especially as the 3-hour
    duration recommended for emergency battery capacity is quite
    inappropriate to the particular needs of safety.
           We are not proposing at this stage to recommend improvements
    to the South Stand emergency lighting.     Subject to approval,
    we would suggest that the system be reviewed when the time
    comes for replacement of the central battery.      At thfciTtime
    the load reduction which could be achieved with a new emergency
    lighting layout would permit a considerable saving in the battery
    replacement cost, and this would offset the cost to the Club of
    the new emergency lighting installation. .
           We are enclosing a set of drawings corresponding to
    these proposals (1610/101 to 106) for which we are now seeking
    tenders.     We would look forward to your comments and suggest
    that it may be appropriate to arrange a meeting with the Fire
    Prevention Officers concerned if further discussions are required.
           We would also wish to have their comments on the proposed
    locations for the Fire Alarm call points shown on the drawings.


                                        Yours faithfully,

Mr. Whitehead welcomed the representatives and explained tbit delaj'S caused primarily
by the wet weather, had meant that all of the required work had not been completed by
today's meeting as the Club had originally envisaged.

The Schedule of Matters requiring attention (dated 8th June, 1979) was considered, with
the following results (after site Inspection where necessary):-

A.        Splon Kop

*     Work carried out.
& (b)

2 (a) Work carried out.
  (b) The additional exit from the top of the Kop was well under construction and
       should be completed by the end of the month.

 3.       Work carried out.

4.        Except for one or two areas on the steps, all of the concrete terracing had been
           made good.
The future of the score-board building was still undecided but, ifa decision
to be made shortly was to retain it, supporting calculations would be forwarded
to the Building Authority.

Work carried out. Test report to be forwarded to the Building Authority.

Work carried out.

North Stand

Work carried out.

North Stand (Lower Level Access) (Upper Level Access)

Work in hand. Should be completed in next few days.

North West Terrace

To prevent local damage to the sheeting, particularly at the joints and to
spread the anticipated load over a larger area than at present, it was agreed
that a continuous horizontal timber member should be fixed to the front of the
sheets at a height about one metre from terrace level.

Work carried out.

West Stand

It was agreed that, whilst the only positive way. of proving the adequacy of the
joint between the now and existing construction was by means of a test load,
the calculations pi’ovided would be regarded as acceptable.

West Terrace

Work carried out.

Work carried out.

South Stand (Rear)

It was agreed that, provided seat no. 26 was replaced by a flush fitting type

 (vii)   Work mainly carried out.

 (viii) The steel columns had been opened up for inspection and agreement on
        necessary remedial work.

 (ix)    It was agreed that a test load of 200 lb/ft would be applied along the
         whole length.

 (x)     Work in, hand.

 (xi)    It was agreed that a metal rail extending 10" above the wail should be installed at
          the foot of each gangway.

 G.      General Structural Matters

‘ 1.     Work mainly carried out.

 2.      Re-assessment to be carried out shortly.

 K.      Emergency Lighting

 1&      It was obvious that there was a difference of opinion as to what could be
 2       regarded as acceptable as regards the emergency lighting in the South
          Stand. It was agreed that a trial should be conducted during the hours of
          darkness attended by representatives of the Club and the Fire Service so
          as to identify the danger areas. Consideration would then be given to
          possibly installing an extra battery and additional wiring to those particular
          areas not covered by the emergency lighting covering other parts of the
          ground.

  I.     Fire Warning System

          The problems with the public addi'ess s y s t e m seemed to be mainly ones of
          diction and correct volume level. It was agreed that the police would monitor the
          position at the next home match and.' pending ths new police control post being
          erected, would arrange for an officer to sit alongside the.Disc Jockey in the
          meantime.

          It was also agreed that the monitoring point for the fire detection equipment
          should be in the tower between the South and West Stands, and would proceed
          once the electrical work was completed.

  J.      Fi re Extinguishers

          The fire extinguishers had been delivered and were to be fitted shortly as
          shown on the plan. The Fire Service undertook to clear any doubtful points.

            To be done shortly in consultation with Fire Service.

M.          Notices - Exit Signs

            necessary wording.

             would (in consultation with the Fire Service and the Police) mark out a lane
             from the main gate to the South Stand in which parking would not be allowed.
          . It was also agreed that the hydrant outside the South Stand would have to be
             kept clear.

 P.          Public Address System

             Already discussed under "Fire Warning System"

 o _____ P o l i c e Facilltes and R. First Aid .facilities

             As agreed, a suitable permanent Police Room would be provided in the 1980
             closed season.
              The Club explained that it would be preferable from a building point of view
              for boththe police and first aid facilities to be in the same overall bullotng
              although physically separated. The police representatives reserved their
              position on this point, pending the outcome of detailed discussions with the
              Club.
              The question of parking for both police and St. John's personnel purposes
              would also need to be looked at in detail.               v.

     S.       Ground Capacity

              Provided the outstanding points were satisfactorily resolved, it was agreed
              that the crowd capacity would be as shown,_i.e. a total e*f 50,174.

            Note of a meeting held at the Hillsborough Stadium,
             ‘~    Sheffield on 11th August, 1983

PRESENT:     Representing the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

             Dr. W. Eastwood (Eastwood & Partners)
             E. England (Secretary)

             Representing the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District)

             Ms* J. Barker (South Yorkshire Police)
             C. W. Calvert (South Yorkshire Police)
             J. Miles (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
             A. Roberts (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
             D. Sheriff (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
             D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

1 .______ Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was primarily to carry out the "summer"
inspection cf the Ground in accordance with the policy of twice yearly
visits to Football League grounds in South Yorkshire by the appropriate
Officer Working Party.

In particular, the Officer working Party wished to see the position with
regard to the effect of the carrying out cf the improvements at the
Penistone Road end of the Grcund (considered by the Officer Working Party
on 28th June, 1983 and agreed subject to certain reservations contained in
a letter to the Club dated 29th June). Reports being received from the
3uilding Authority had indicated extensive movement of existing retained earth
material, anparently of sufficient magnitude to impair the stability of the
adjacent access raap and associated perimeter walls and barrier rails.

2 ._____ Ground Inspection

A.         Electronic Score and Message Board

It was noted that, since the agreement indicated at the "winter" inspection
of the Stadium on 21st February, 1982, the electronic score and message
board had been erected between the South and West Stands. Evidently, it
was proving tc be a most welcome feature.

B.     West Stand and Terrace

The Club's intentions with regard to the brick built former A.R.P. building
at the rear of the Stand and adjacent to the boundary wall (now used as d
store) were again discussed ifi view of its condition.

The condition of the crack in the brickwork at the rear corner of the Stand .
(nearest to the North West Terrace) raised at the last meeting was inspected.

Dr. Eastwood reported that the crush barriers on the Terrace had been tested,
completing the first cycle of crush barrier testing at the Stadium. One had
failed and been replaced.




                                      CO
IT WAS AGREED -
(i)     That, if the Club intend-    to continue to use the former A.R.P. builcizg
adjacent to the boundary wall, the lintel over the door would require attention
in particular," as would the general maintenance of the building.
(ii)    That the condition of the crack in the non load bearing brickwork at
the rear corner of the Stand (nea~ast to the North West Terrace) should continue
to be monitored.
(iii)   That the Club would give attention during normal maintenance to the
loose concrete rendering apparent in places.
C.     North West Terrace
As the Terrace and the West Stand were separate structures, the Club were of
the opinion that there would continue to be movement between the structures
caused by changes in weather conditions, thus making it difficult if not
impossible to achieve a seal sufficient to permanently prevent the seepage of
water between the two.
IT WAS AGREED that this was not a matter of safety and that the Club would
continue to monitor the position.
D.      North Stand
The Club reported that the further attention to the crack at the expansion
joint adjacent to Stand entrance "S." requested at the last aeetir.fi was in hand
as a matter .of maintenance.
E.      Soion Kon
As requested at the last meeting, Che Club had investigated the spalled concr=t=
and corrosion of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Spion Kop (towards the
North Stand end). Action would be taken shortly to cut off the front (and
worst affected) portion of the roof, which would also have the effect of
increasing the headroom.
Whilst certain remedial work had already been undertaken by the contractor to
stabalise the banking at the rear of the Spicn Kcp following digging out
to provide new refreshment and toilet facilities, the Officer Working Party
were of the firm opinion that further work was essential. Measurements had
shown that in places there had been as much as four to five inches of
movement. Simple visual inspection showed that there was a lack of the
 lormer retained earth material underneath the access ramp in places, and
consequently there had also to be doubts about the stability of the foundations
of the existing barrier rails. The Club would have to look to the contractor
(or his insurers) to meet the cost of the remedial work to the existing access
ramp and barrier rails.
As pointed out in the letter to the Club dated 29th:June, measures would
require to be taken to prevent the public gaining access to the roofs of the
new facilities (as they were not load bearing). Barriers would have to be
provided or other measures taken to enable the new facilities to withstand
crowd pressures where these were capable of being generated (as also pointed
out in the letter of 29th June).                    s
IT WAS AGREED
(i)     That the Club's proposals for dealing with the spalled concrete and
corrosion of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Spion Kop be supported in
principle.




                                     03
(ii)     That as soon as possible, and certainly prior to the first home
match, on 3rd September, the condition of the existing ramp and barrier
rails must be stabilised (possibly by drilling holes at intervals and
inserting grouting under pressure) and the resultant success or otherwise
of the measures tested by test loading the barrier rails (or a representative
sample) to the Green Guide requirements.

(iii)   Also prior to the first home match on 3rd September, measures must
be taken (a) to prevent access by the public to the roofs of the new
facilities and (b) to enable the new facilities to withstand crowd pressures
where these are capable of being generated.

(iv).   That the new buttresses to the existing boundary wall in connection
with the new turnstiles and exit gate must be sited so ds not to reduce the
support to the wall, and that the need for pointing ul the wall externally
in places must also not be overlooked.

?.     "Stands" Club

It was noted that there was spalling of the concrete surrounds to the steel
beams underneath the "Stands" club. It was understood that the'premises
were leased on a full repairing basis to Mansfield Breweries Ltd.

It was also noted that there was a certain amount of deflection in the brick
built screening wall in front of the Male toilets underneath the Club if
pressure was applied to the top of the wall.

IT WAS AGREED:-

(i)     That the Club would request Mansfield Breweries Ltd. to give
attention to the spalling of the concrete surrounds to the steel beams
under the "Stands" Club in accordance with the terms of their lease.

(ii)    That the brick built screening wall in front of the Male toilets
should be test loaded to the Green Guide requirements.

G.     South Stand

It was noted that some of the loose coping stones on the top of the
dividing wall between the South Stand and the Spion Kop had been removed,’
and that a certain amount of pointing of the wall had been undertaken.

It was also noted that there was severe corrosion at the bottom of both
steel supports to the sides of the concertina-'type exit gate from the
Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop).

IT WAS AGREED:-

(i)     That the Club would remove  the remaining coping stones and arrange
for the remainder of the pointing to the upper level of the wall to be
undertaken as a matter of maintenance.

(ii)    That the Club would shortly consider a scheme tobe prepared by
Messrs. Eastwood & Partners forreplacementof'both steelsupports    to
the exit gate from the Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop).
H.      Ground Fitness Certificate

Dr. Eastwood pointed out that many of the matters discussed at the meeting
were contained in his Annual Ground Fitness Certificate. However, he had
delayed submitting this to the County Council, as required by the General
Safety Certificate, in view of the situation on the Penistone Road end of
the Stadium.

IT WAS AGREED that Dr. Eastwood would submit his Ground Fitness Certificate
to the County Council, excluding the Penistone Road end of the Stadium at
the present time.

 Dear Mr. Wright,

 SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

 Further to your letter of the 7th October re your visit and
 appraisal of :he emergency procedure at this ground on
 Tuesday, 4th October, when your Divisional Officer Johnson
 came to see me after the match and explained thatiin his
 opinion there were'dead*areas in our ground, as it appeared
 that stewards had not heard the emergency announcement, to
 say the least this surprised rae, as only this last dose,
 season have we had the P.A. System further improved.

 I have taken the opportunity this morning to try out the
 system in all the areas that were supposedly 'deadj and
 I must report that everything that was said, was heard
 clearly and distinctly.

 I have informed Hamraerton Road police of this, and it
 has been suggested to me that perhaps it would be a
 sensible idea for one or two of your officers to come
 to the ground at say 1.00 o’clock on Saturday, 29th
 October when we play Huddersfield Town and go around the
 ground with the police and hear the broadcasts for them­
 selves.

 Yours sincerely,




 Secretary.

                              Safety of Sports Ground   $
With effect from 1st April 1986, the City Council will be responsible as
Licensing Authority for the administration of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
1985 in place of the South Yorkshire County Council. This preliminary report is
intended to inform Members as to the basic framework of the Act and the
delegations required to carry out the Council's functions.

A detailed report will be presented to the next meeting of the Panel by which
time investigations into the current licensing system will be complete.

The Home Office have provided a useful summary of the duties of Licensing
Authorities and a summary of the Act itself; both these documents are attached
to this Report for members to consider.

Following the Bradford disaster, the importance of the provision of a sufficient
level of safety at sports grounds has been highlighted; the responsibility of
the Council in this regard should not be underestimated.

Members will probably be aware that the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into
Crowd Safety and Control at Sports Ground (the Popplewell Report) was recently
published and a copy of its recommendations are attached to this Report for
information.

Summary and recommendations

A more detailed report will be submitted to the Panel as soon as possible but
in the meantime it is recommended that the following delegations be approved

 (a)    All the powers and duties of the Council under the Safety of Sports Ground
       Act 1975 be delegated to the General Purposes Panel;

 (b)   The emergency procedure powers under Section 10 of the 1975 Act be
       delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal Department in
       consultation with Chairman or Deputy Chairman of this Panel or of the
       Municipal Enterprise and General Services Programme Committee as
       appropriate.

 (c) The power to authorise Officers under Section 11 of the Act be delegated to
      the Head of Administration and Legal Department.

                           Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

Introduction

The Panel will recall that a report was submitted to the March 1986 Meeting

covering the general safety of sports grounds legislation as it affects the City

Council.   This follow-up report aims to deal in detail with the current

situation in Sheffield as inherited from the South Yorkshire County Council.

There are 2 sports grounds currently subject to the legislation - Sheffield

Wednesday Football Club and Sheffield United Football Club; the Owlerton Sports

Stadium is likely to be made subject to the legislation shortly.

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club - Hillsborough

The Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited was designated as requiring a

Safety Certificate in August 1978 and such a Certificate was issued by the

County Council on 21st December, 1979.     The Stadium is currently undergoing

major works which, when complete, will form a roof over the Spion Kop and thus

substantially improve the accommodation for spectators.

Sheffield United Football Club, Bramall Lane

The Club was designated as requiring a certificate in August 1984 but to date

a certificate has not been issued as there are outstanding works to be

completed. The County Council took the view that the certificate should only be

issued as and when the Ground was up to the appropriate safety standard and not

before.    This procedure effectively insured that the terms of the Safety

 Certificate were not breached as soon as it was issued.       It is hoped that the

 Council will be in a position to issue a certificate before the start of the

 1986/87 season.

 Owlerton Sports Stadium

 It is understood that the Home Secretary will shortly be designating the Stadium

 as requiring a Safety Certificate in accordance with the Popplewell Report

 recommendations.   It will, therefore, be necessary to arrange for a full

 inspection of the Stadium in the next few weeks to find out what works are
going to be required to raise the standard of the Stadium to appropriate levels.

The Panel is probably aware that the Stadium is Council owned but is currently

leased to the Owlerton Sports Stadium Limited.    This Lease will expire on 1st

November, 1987.

Safety Certificate Standard Conditions

At the moment the Safety Conditions attached to Safety Certificates are

standardised throughout South Yorkshire and both the Police and the Fire Service

have indicated that they would wish this situation to continue for reasons of

administrative simplicity.   The Conditions do, however, give some cause for

concern, as they appear to be inadequate or inappropriate in some areas.    The

drafting of these Conditions is of particular importance as it is a serious

criminal offence to contravene any of them punishable by the Statutory Maximum

Fine (Currently £2,000) or 2 years imprisonment or both.


It is proposed to re-draft the Certificate conditions, where appropriate, and to

submit them to the Panel for approval.    The Sheffield Wednesday Certificate

would then be replaced in accordance with Section 4 (1) (b) of the Act.    The

Sheffield United Certificate could then be issued with the new conditions before

the start of the 1986/87 season.     The re-drafted conditions would, of course, be

submitted to the Fire Service, the Police and Building Surveyor for comment;

 other authoritiesin South Yorkshire could also be involved in this process.

 Existing Administrative Arrangements

 The County Council system for administering the Act is based on 2 main

 components — (a) bi-annual inspections of the Stadium; and (b) meetings of an

 officer working party.   The bi-annual inspections consist of representatives

 from all the interested authorities and involve thorough inspections of the

 Stadia and the identifying of any defects.    These defects are at the time of the

 visit brought to the attention of the certificate holder and its technical

 representative if one is present.    Depending on the nature of the faults found

 (if any) steps are then agreed between the Authority and the Certificate Holder
to rectify them or so arrange matters that no risk to the public occurs.      The

Working Party consists of representatives from the Police, Fire Service,

Building Surveyors and the County Council — it considers in detail various

matters (such as the Spion Kop development at Sheffield Wednesday Football

Ground) and also any outstanding items from the bi-annual inspections.     The

Working Party is effectively a co-ordinating body which attempts to ensure that

a balanced and consistent approach is maintained to current issues at the Sports

Grounds.    Any recommendations it makes are subject to approval by this Panel.

The Health and Safety Executive

Recommendation 9 of The Popplewell Committee's Interim Report read as follows

“There should be urgent consultation between the Health and Safety Executive and

the Fire Authorities and Local Authorities as to how best to co-ordinate and

communicate their inspections and reports”.    Bearing this in mind the local

office of the Health and Safety Executive was invited to participate in the

administrative system for safety at sports grounds.     This invitation was

declined.    The Executive will apparently take no direct part in the

Certification system.

In view of this problem the Home Office was contacted and the position

explained; it appears that negotiations are under way between the Home Office

and the HSE about Popplewell's recommendation but as yet there has been no

useful outcome.

 In these circumstances the Council could keep the Health and Safety Executive

 informed of all developments in Sheffield and to invite their comments on them.

 It would then be the responsibility of the Executive to decide whether or not to

 respond.

 Fees

 The basis on which fees may be charged is set out in Regulation 14 of the Safety

 of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976 which states ”14.    A local authority may

 determine the fees to be charged in respect of applications for the issue or




                                   E3
amendment of safety certificates but such fees shall not in a particular case

exceed an amount commensurate with the work actually and reasonably done.”      The

South Yorkshire County Council did not fix any fees under the Regulation

apparently as a matter of policy and the Panel is therefore asked to decide

which of the following options to adopt:- (a) state as a matter of policy that

no fees will be charged in respect of Safety of Sports Grounds legislation or

(b) decide in principle to fix fees and to ask for a report back on the costs

to the Council.

Conclusion

The Panel is asked to:-

(a)    Note the broad outlines of the administrative system organised by the

       County Council and authorise its continuation for the time being,

(b)    Note the position of the Health and Safety Executive and request the Head

       of Administration and Legal Department to keep the Executive informed of

       all matters relating to sports ground safety;

(c)    Request the Head of Administration and Legal Department to draft new

       safety certificate conditions in consultation with the appropriate

       authorities approval by the Council;

 (d)   Either resolve that no fees will be charged under the legislation or

       request the Head of Administration and Legal Department to report on the

       Council's costs in this respect.

pubposzT pasel

SAFETY OF   SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 - THE CURRENT SITUATION AND PROPOSALS FOR   THE
FUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF THE COUNCIL'SCERTIFICATION FUNCTION

Introduction

The Panel will recall that on 1st April 1986 the City Council inherited from the
South Yorkshire County Council the role of certificating Authority under the
1975 Act.    The Act itself is basically aimed at ensuring adequate standards of
safety at   designated stadia; there are three of these in Sheffield at the moment
- Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Sheffield United Football. Club,, and the
Owlerton Sports Stadium. A detailed report on the Act and its application in
Sheffield was submitted to the Panel on 6th May 1986.

The Current Situation

The Panel at its meeting in May 1986 identified several main areas for further
investigation.

Firstly it was accepted at the time that the broad outlines of the
administrative system organised by the County Council should be continued for
the time being. This system has now been reviewed and the proposed
reorganisation is detailed later in this report.

The Panel also asked that the Health and Safety Executive be kept informed of
all matters relating to sports ground safety and that the Association of
Metropolitan Authorities also be asked about the HSE's involvement. As far as
keeping the HSE informed of safety developments at the stadia the Executive made
it fairly plain that they would not make any comments. The practice was
therefore discontinued. The involvement of the AMA in the HSE issue has been
somewhat forestalled by action at central Government level to review the HSE’s
relationship with local authorities; this review was announced in the
Government's reply to the Popplewell Report but no results of that review have
yet been received. Fortunately, however, the Council’s Director of Health and
Consuner Services has permitted his Officer’s to provide ahealth and safety
input into the decision making process in relation to safety of sports grounds. »
This substitution, therefore, temporarily covers the absence of an input from
 the HSE.

 The Panel also made reference to consultation on the safety of sports grounds
 policy with the other District Councils in South Yorkshire. Unfortunately,
 attempts at arranging consultation meetings have been unsuccessful to date. It
 is proposed to try again to organise some consultations in the fairly near
 future, perhaps when the Certification system has settled down in each area.

 The drafting of new safety certificate conditions in consultation with the
 Council's advisers has been progressing steadily and new draft conditions are
 currently under consideration by those advisers. It is hoped that the new
 conditions will be submitted to the Panel at its meeting in October for final
 approvaliv ;

 As to the question of charging fees under the 1975 legislation, it should be
 be made cleax^-. that such fees are only payable on the grant of a Certificate.
 It is anticipated that if the Panel approves the new Certificate conditions a
 Certificate will then be issued to Sheffield United and at that time it is
 proposed to deal with the cuestion of rees-
Future Administration of the Council’s Certificating Function    ^ #

Following a thorough review of the legislation it has become clear that a
detailed administrative system needs to be established in connection with the
Council's Certificating function. Discussions on this matter have been underway
for some time with the Police, the Fire Service, the Council's Building
Surveyor and the Director of Health and Consumer Services on the establishment
of such a system.

Accepting that the Council as the Certificating Authority will act on the-basis
of advice from experts (such as the Fire Service) the question arises as to how
that advice may be best formulated. In the past, the County Council organised
an Officer Working Party which was apparently used as a forum for discussion
between Officers prior to the final formulation of advice to the Council. That
particular working party also appeared to have had some decision making powers.

As it is essential that meetings take place due to the potential overlap of
requirements in many areas, all the Authorities and Officers have now agreed
that it would be appropriate to establish a revised form of the working party to
perform a similar function for the City Council. It is recommended that the
“Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group" (which would consist of
representatives from the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor’s
Division and the Department of Health and Consumer Services), would function as
a forum for discussion between Officers; its most regular use would probably be
the discussion of items of advice to the Council before they are finally
foraulated by the appropriate Authority. Meetings of the Group would be held at
the request of one or more Authorities and on receipt of a request the Head of
Administration and Legal Department would-arrange a meeting and despatch a list
of items to be discussed. At the conclusion of the meeting a further list of
items would be prepared and the details of action agreed to be taken by each
Authority would be noted. It is then anticipated that detailed written advice
would be provided by each discipline and be acted upon as appropriate.

In addition the Head of Administration and Legal Department will keep copies of
all relevant correspondence which will be available to all participants in the ^
Group.

Under*the old County Council administrative structure the different Authorities .
represented in their working party had fairly clearly defined roles within which
to operate. Although it can be seen that there is some merit in this idea the
areas of potential overlap of responsibility are quite extensive in dealing with
sports grounds* However it appears that the various Authorities and Officers
wish for some definition of roles and the following have been agreed:—

 Authority                                     Area of Responsibility

 The Building Surveyor                 All matters relating to the structure of

                      After some discussion It was agreed that access should be
                      maintained around the whole stadium even on the top of the
                      old south terrace.: This particular footpath should be
                      restored to a. suitable condition.

■.y.'v. -              the stadium.? The point was made that although exit
                       widths could be recommended for a 4,000 capacity those         capacity
                       widths would need to increase if the capacity was to be        question.
                        raised at a subsequent time. It.is therefore desirable
                        to set a exit width, etc., at appropriate levels to
                        prevent the need for expensive works later on.

1.0   Spion Kop

1.1   The timber ticket hut adjacent to the refreshment bar on the main
      means of escape exit route from the KOP should be removed, since
      it is causing both a high risk and a narrowing of the escape
      width.                                                              B .S .

1.2   A broken concrete post supporting the end of a crush barrier
      adjacent to the tunnel exit at the north end of the KOP to be
       removed, and the crush barrier be modified to join onto the end
      of the new steel supported barrier directly adjacent to it.         B.S.

1.3   A timber hut at ground level, under the KDP structure should be
      removed.                                                            B.S.

1.4   An additional length of crush barrier is required to be installed
      adjacent to the base of the ramped stairway from the extended
      terracing. This was agreed on site by Dr. Eastwood.                 B.S.

1.5   An area of the corrugated metal sheeting used as cladding to the
      side of the Kop is corroded and tom.                                HCS

1.6   It was noted that in some places the stair nosings serving radial
      gangways had become defective.                                      HCS

1.7   At some positions within the new development there is a
      difference in height between a terraced area and radial gangway
       of over 600mm. As such these areas require to be protected by a
       suitably constructed pedestrian guardrail.                         HCS

1.8   Some areas of the front terracing were found to be in need of
      minor repairs. It was agreed, however, that this defect would be
      adequately controlled by means of "ongoing” maintenance.            HCS

1.9   The defective rendering to the final exit gate wall requires to
      be repaired.                                                        HCS

2.0 North Stand

2.1   A broken glass panel in the west gable end should be replaced.      B.S.

2.2   The step between seats 12 and 13 on row 43 is loose and should be
      correctly bedded down.                                              B.S.

2.3   It is important to ensure that the groundman’s store beneath this
      stand is not used for the storage of potentially inflammable
      fertilisers or weedkillers..                                        HCS

3*0   West Stand

3.1   Signs over the front parapet wall at the upper level are to be
      permanently secured at the following positions:-

      a) between seats 1 and 14
      b) between seats 20 and 28
      c) between seats 136 and 150.
       Binding wire ties are not considered to be satisfactory for this
       purpose.

       Additionally the sign brackets adjacent to seats 62 and 72 are to
       be correctly bent (or otherwise suitably checked) and secured.

3.2    Rain water drainage holes through the upper level slab should
       have a gauze inserted so as to inhibit the dropping of missiles
       onto the crowd below.                                               B.S.

3.3    It is felt that discussion should take place regarding the
       suitability of the gate fastening device at the base of the
       emergency exit stairway on the south end of this stand. The
       fastening consisting of a patent lockable barrel bolt which
       cannot easily be unfastened in the direction of travel, and is
       impossible to be unfastened from the other side.                    B.S.

4.0    Miscellaneous Points

4.1    At a number of points within the stadium various pieces of
       abandoned builders’ waste were readily available for use as
       projectiles by the crowd. Such material should be collected and
       suitably disposed of.                                               HCS

4.2    The main first aid room requires to be supplied with adequate
       first aid equipment for the treatment of spectators should they
       become ill or injured within the sports ground.                     HCS

4.3    The provision of qualified first aiders is being reviewedat the
       moment; it is felt that the existing arrangements require
       formalisation. The Club’s views on this point are sought.           HCS

Dear Sir,                                                      -

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975.

I attach a'copy of a Press Release issued by the County Council today,
in response to requests for information by the nedia on the situation
in South Yorkshire following Saturday's trafic events at Bradford.

It is reasonable to assume that revised advice and/or requirements
will be issued by tne Some Office in the near future, and naturally
this will be taken into account at the forthcoming "summer- inspections
by the Officer Working Parties.           *'J      ‘

In ■the Beantime and recognising that the season has ended, 2 would
particularly stress the vital necessity for safety stewards to be fully
aware of and trained in their duties on the manning and opening of doors
and gates on egress routes and in the use of fire fighting equipment.

                              Yours faithfully,




                               Chief Executive.

    Dear Sir,

    I write to ccafirc the concluding paragraph of ny letter of 13th May, the
    discussion which too:; place vith all the South Yorkshire Football League
    Clubs at Police Headquarters, Sheffield, and the comments nade at the
    recent "suraer" inspection of your Ground by the Officer T'orking Party.

    How that the Interim Report of Mr. Justice Popplewsll has been published
    and advice has been received from the Hone Office, the County Council would
    draw the following initial measures to your attention

    (a)   evacuation procedures should be reviewed in consultation with the
          South Yorkshire Police and the. South Yorkshire County Fire Service
          should this not have been done already following previous discussions;

    <b>   safety stewards should

          (i)     be trained and instructed to deal with any emergency relating
                  to fiire or evacuation,

 Dear Sir,

 Many thanks for your communication dated 9th August 1985.

 I can confirm that arrangements have been finalised with South Yorkshire
 Police Authorities, Hamnerton Road, for the staff concerned to Be briefed
 on matters relating to safety/emergency procedures prior to cur. first heme
 game, Saturday 17th August 1985.

 Hie written instructions are already in existence with the amended "warning
 message" of an emergency situation confirmed during season 1984/5.

 My Head Steward and various sectional senior stewards, are kept fully
 informed of the various matters and are responsible for advising, the
 "match day" staff accordingly.

 In addition the staff are supplied with distinguishing attire*, anf are
 given specific duties to. perform and required to be in attendance at those
 points throughout the entire period.                      J         j;

 ' With the approval of South Yorkshire Police, due to holidays and the
 ..unavailability of. a full complement of staff, I have delayed the convening
t of an evenings seminar/instructional course, by the Fire Authorities until
 ; after the season 'Hag conmenced. Having spoken to the Fire Authorities they have
 r confirmed their willingness to attend leaving only the finalisation of the date
   in abeyance.                                               ■.'v'   :;1: ■ ■

1.     '   Purpose of Meeting

Bearing.in mind the F.A. Cup Semi-Final which was to take place on Saturday,
11th April, 1981, it was felt it would be desirable for the Working Party to '
visit the ground, especially as'a small number of matters had arisen since the
last visit on 10th February, 1981.

2 .______Inspection of Ground

(a)        South Stand

The previous comments relating to the roof structure and the exterior windows in
the Ladies’ Toilets below the stand were still applicable.

The L.P.G. cylinders had been removed from beneath the Stand, and the batteries
supplying the emergency power supply for the police address had been enclosed in
a satisfactory fire resisting metal case. Whilst the provision of an automatic
battery charger would be a longer term solution, in the short term arrangements
had been made for the batteries to be charged before each game and for the public
address system to be checked relying only on the emergency battery supply. The
indicator for the batteries condition was presently in the Public Address Box.
It was suggested that it would be less likely to be overlooked if the indicator
was sited adjacent to the new metal case for the batteries.

 (b)       West Stand

As previously agreed, the Club would round off the steel supports to the new
emergency exit (nearest to the South Stand) as soon as a grinder was next present
at the ground.

 The cracked brickwork at   the rear of the stand which required    pointing, the      -
 apparent distress on the   concrete pillar supporting the stepsat the. rear of the   ;';
 stand, the cracks in the   concrete &t the top bo both sets of stairs, as well as
 the currently slight corrosion-in the base plate of the outer       steel column
 (nearest to the South Stand) had all been included in the maintenance programme      n
 and would be undertaken shortly.
(c)     North West Terrace-- ■

The cracking of the concrlting had been attended to by injecting material from      ,■
the topr-The r e s u l t s had’been satisfactory, except in two small areas where        -
water seepage had obviously taken place and which would receive further
attention.                   , .

(d)     North Stand

The expansion cracks which had appeared in the wall of the North Stand (nearest
to the Spion Kop) had been included in the maintenance schedule and would be
attended to shortly.

(e)     Spion Kop

The infilling of the stepadjacent to the handrail on the left of the original
exit at the top of the Kop would be given attention in the close season.      ...            _
                                                   t
Whilst the brick built chip shop at the bottom of the new exit from the Kop had
been erected, it was not yet xn use. Xt was noted that the siting of the
chip shop had resulted in a possible danger to spectators in that a gap into
which spectators could be pushed, or possxbly stumble because of the camber, had
been created. As regards the F.A. Gup Semi-Final,

IT WAS AGREED -

that a temporary barrier of scaffolding tubes should be erected between the end
of the new Kop exit outer barriers and the concrete pillar of the lowest of the
Kop original exit steps. In the longer term, the existing barriers would need
extending to fill the gap and ideally, the area between the bottom of the new Kop
exit staircase and the origxnal Kop exxt steps should be levelled off.

3 .______ Ground Evacuation Procedure

Whilst the Club had been supplxed with a Schedule on Fire Instruction and Drills
on 9th April, 1980, consultations between the County Fire Service and the South
Yorkshire Police had resulted in the production of an Emergency Evacuatxon
Procedure". The Club undertook to circulate copies of the procedure to all
Stewards who would be on duty for the F.A. Cup Semi “Final.

    Copy to Chief Executive
   Dear Sir

   FA COP SEMI-FINAL        -
                         11 APRIL 1981
                           *...     -
   I would refer to the FA. Cup Semi-Final match between Wolverhampton
   Wanderers Football Club'and Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, held at
   Hillsborough Stadium, the home of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, on
   Saturday 11 April 1981.          ..                       ...

   As you will no doubt be aware many similar Semi-Final matches have been
   held at this ground without previous problems. The stadium is issued with
   a certificate under the provisions of the Safety in Sports Grounds Act 1975.
   This limits the total capacity of the ground to 50,174. The area of the
   Leppings Lane enclosure has a capacity of 10,100.

   Prior to the match itself, difficulties were envisaged because both sets
   of supporters were obliged to use the Ml Motorway. This problem was added
   to when a major road accident occurred on the Ml near to ’its junction with
   the A38. The problem was exacerbated by a coach breaking down further along
   the motorway, and by extensive road works. This set of circumstances
   caused a large number of spectators, predominantly Tottenham Hotspur fans,
   to be held up on the motorway for some 90 minutes. As you will appreciate
   traffic jams built up and resulted in a sudden influx of large numbers of
   football supporters to the area of the ground at around the time for the
   start of the match when a fairly steady build up of support throughout the
   afternoon could have been anticipated.

    I now wish to outline an aspect of the problem which could have been avoided
    and which should be anticipated for future similar occasions.

    On the day before the Wolverhampton ticket allocation was put on sale to
    the public, Tottenham Hotspur played Coventry City Football Club at Coventry
    in a league match. Many Tottenham Hotspur supporters stayed overnight in
    Coventry and travelled the short distance to Wolverhampton to obtain tickets
    which were at a premium in London. Others also made the journey from London
    to Wolverhampton on the Sunday. This completely defeated the spectator
    policy which is put into effect at these matches and which places the largest
    groups of standing supporters at opposite ends of the ground. Neither of
-the two participating Semi-Final clubs saw fit to inform the South
Yorkshire Police, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club or the Football
association about this situation and in that event the mixing of supporters
was' not-properly catered for.' The result of this was that some 400
Tottenham fans had to be removed from the Spion Kop, in the interests
of general safety and public order, and were accommodated in the Leppings
Lane end of the ground,, which had been designated for use by Spurs
supporters.

The capacity at the Leppings Lane end is 10,100 and this obviously contains
a safety factor. At a previous match some 400 holders of forged tickets
gained entry into this part of the ground and were absorbed without any
apparent difficulty. However, on this date turnstile readings showed
that 10,435 people were admitted to this part of the ground.

A policy of packing spectators occurs at most football grounds where
large crowds are in attendance so that all the available space is utilised.
On this occasion the Tottenham Hotspur fans, who had arrived early in the
day and taken up advantageous viewing points, refused to move into the
centre of this enclosure/ thereby creating a jamming effect at the
extremeties of it. The late arrivals caused an immediate problem upon
gaining access to the Leppings Lane area because of rushing forward
immediately upon entering after Tottenham Hotspur had scored a goal soon
after kick off. This resulted in a number of crushing injuries on this
terrace including broken arms, legs and crushed ribs. In all, some 38
fans received treatment either at hospital or from the St John. Ambulance
representatives present at the game.

As a result of this the safety gates at the front or the Leppings Lane
enclosure were opened and spectators at the front were allowed to go
onto the playing area perimeter track to relieve the pressure within the
terrace. Due to the problems being created by crushing, my officers also
refused access to the Leppings Lane enclosure to spectators waiting to
get in. In my view no other course of action could have been adopted in
the interest of public safety.

During the half time interval my officers attempted to move the spectators
who were standing or seated within the tracks around onto the normal
spectator areas. During this manoeuvre some rather foolish youngsters
did run onto the pitch but the situation was quickly brought under control
by officers within the ground.

In conclusion I would add that there were no other incidents either
inside or outside the ground other than those caused by the circumstances
I have described. The circumstances I have outlined have been discussed
at length and will be borne in mind in the planning of future similar
events. Discussions are to take place with my officers and officials
of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club regarding suggestions for obviating
j-hp problems caused within the Leppings Lane terrace on this occasion.

 Yours faithfully

     For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan.


     Dear Mr. Vaughan,

                          Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Lt d .
                              Radial Fences at Leppings Lane End

                  We have been instructed by the Club to organise the
      installation of two radial fences on the terrace at the
     Leppings lane end of the ground.

                  It is intended that these fences are so positioned
      that they divide this section of the terrace into
      approximately three equal areas, each served by its own
      entrance.

                  By dividing the terrace more control over supporters
      should result.                 A visiting team with only a few followers
      will be allocated one section, with the other two sections
      retained by the home supporters.

                  Larger contingents of visiting spectators could be
      accommodated in two or all three areas as their numbers
      dictate.

                  A 1.15 metre wide gate is proposed at the rear of
      each fence to give access for maintenance and also policing
      during a game.                 The gate could be left open, but fastened
      back, to connect the areas during a game if adjacent ones

                                                         a,8!,U h l / 1       land - No. 1134531
            EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




               are accupied by supporters of the same team.    When establishing
               the height we have considered that the views to the corner
               flags should not be restricted any further than they are at
               present by the perimeter fence.    We therefore propose that the
               top of the fence should be approximately 1680mm above the
               terrace.
                     This may not prevent the odd spectator climbing the fence
               but should eliminate a mass invasion from one area to the other.
               Fences this height appear to work successfully at St. James's
    j          Park, the home of Newcastle United.

                     We would be pleased if this specific point can be discussed
               within the Working Party and your comments forwarded to us.

                 —   Also to be included in the same contract are some gates at
               various locations around the north stand.    Now the gymnasium is
               open to the general public security to ether parts of the ground
               must be maintained.    It is proposed that gates are provided at
               the top of the ramps at both ends of the stand with additional
               gates at ground floor level at the Penistone Road end of the
               stand.     A separate gate will be placed behind the west ramp to
               prevent people going round the rear of the gymnasium towards
1              Leppings Lane.
        '            Six copies of our drawing 3563/1 together with two copies -
               of our drawings 3563/2 and 3 (for reference only) are enclosed.

 Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                 Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
                                 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
           Thank you for your letter of                                 8       September.          I am grateful
 to you for accepting our letter of 2 September as giving
 the formal 21 days notice under paragraph 5(2) of the
 General Safety Certificate.
               Tenders have to be returned by 23 September and we shall
 be reporting to the club shortly thereafter.                                                      Normally the
  contractor would commence on site in not more than about two
 weeks from receipt of order.                                      Thus work is likely to begin
  in early October subject to there being no objection from the
  County Council.
      We may be wishing to place the formal order for the work
  on about 24 or 25 September so that if there is the likelihood
  of suggestions for major changes to our proposed scheme, I should
  be grateful if I could have notice by that time.


                                                                    Yours sincerely

1 .___ Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the letter dated 2nd September
and plans submitted by Messrs. Eastwood and Partners-on behalf of the
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. relating to the proposed erection
of Radial Barriers on the West Terrace for crowd control purposes and
Security Gates at various locations around the North Stand now that the
gymnasium was open to the general public^.

2.    Radial Barriers on West Terrace

Whilst there were drawbacks to the division of the terrace into
approximately three equal areas, each served by its own entrance, the
Working Party felt that increased control on the Terrace should result
from the proposals. For instance there could well be problems with
opposing fans mixing at the rear of the West Stand and/or the final exit
gates, but the police considered thatfhey could cope with any problems
of this nature.

The adequacy and positioning of the gates to be installed at the rear of
the radial barriers was also discussed, as well as the use of the
existing gates in the pitch perimeter security fence at the front of the
Terrace.

It was noted that the plans submitted did not indicate the amount of head­
room which would be available at the rear of the Terrace should the
radial barriers and gates be installed.

IT WAS AGREED  that Mr. Vaughan should notify Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
thatthe Officer Working Party sees no objection to the proposals to instal
two 1680mm high radial barriers, with 1.15 metre wide gates at the rear,
on the West Terrace at the Hillsborough Stadium, subject to:-

       (i)-        the further calculations required by the Building
                    Authority being satisfactory;

       Cii)        confirmation that adequate headroom will be
                    available at the rear of the Terrace, and

       (iii)         the new gates at the rear of the Terrace also being
                    under police control.




                                 tm
 3.     Security Gates around North Stand

 Now that the gymnasium was open to .the general public, the Club wished to
 erect security gates at. the top of -the ramps at both ends of the North
 Stand, with additional gates at ground floor level at the Penis tone Road
 end of the Stand. A separate gate would also be placed behind the West
 Ramp to p r e v e n t people going round the rear of the gymnasium towards .
 Lepping? Lane.            \

 These gates would .be fastened when the gymnasium only was in use so as to
 provide security for the rest of the ground. However, on match days they
 would be secured in the fully open position to allow unrestricted access.-^

  IT WAS AGREED that Mr. Vaughan should notify Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
  that the Officer Working Party sees no objection to the erection of security
  gates around the North Stand, subject to4 the gates and/or their supports,
  hinges, etc not impinging on the existing critical ramp widths, and to tne
  gates being secured in the fully open position on match days.

' 4.    Police and First Aid Facilities

  It was recalled that the existing unsatisfactory police and first aid
  facilities under the North Stand had been accepted on a n interim basis.
  The Club had undertaken to provide purpose built facilities in a similar
  position to the existing timbered facilities during the 1980 close
  season. Whilst some progress had been made m d i s c u s s i n g details of the
  facilities, no firm indication had yet been given as to when tney would
  actually be provided.

  IT WAS AGREED that M r .. D , Vaughan should press the Club and/or
  Consultants   for a firm indication as to when the new police and rirst
  aid facilities are tovhe provided.

  5.    Lottery Ticket Boxes

  Attention was drawn to the blocked egress which could result if the
  timber lottery ticket boxes presently^sited close to the ramps were to
  be tipped over or ignited, either accidentally or deliberately.

   IT WAS AGREED that Mr. Vaughan should draw the Club’s attention to the
   desirability of re-siting the lottery ticket boxes.

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sport's Grounds Act, 1975                                  _   ......
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club,

Referring to your letter of 9th September, the Officer Working Party- -
(Sheffield District) has considered the proposals referred to in your
letter of 2nd September and accompanying plans.

1.      Radial Barriers on West Terrace

yhilst welcoming the increased control on the Terrace which should ^
result, concern was expressed as to the problems which could occur with
opposing fans mixing at the rear of the West Stand and/or at the entry/
exit- gates. However, it was felt that only experience would show
whether this would nrove to be a reality and, if realised, whether the
problem was of such* a small ccale that it could be easily coped with by
the police.

Accordingly, the Officer Working Party at this stage sees no objection
to the proposals to instal two 1680 naa high radial barriers, with 1.15
metre gates at the rear, on the West Terrace, subject to: -

 (a)    the further calculations required by the Building Authority being
         satisfactory (Mr. Sheriff to contact you direct);

 (b> confirmation that adequate headrocawill be available at the rear
      of the lerrace after installation or the barriers and gates, arm

 (c) the new gates at the rear of the Terrace also being under police
      control.

 2.     Security Gates around North Stand

 The Officer Working Party fully recognises the Club’s need to provide
 security for the remainder of the stadium when only the gymnasium is m
 use.

 Provided that the gates and/or their supports, hinges, etc. do not
 impinge on the existing critical ramp widths and the gates are secured
 in the fully open position on match days, the Officer Working Party
 sees no objection to the erection of security gates around the North Stanc

3.     Other Matters
Two other matter* were also raised by the Officer Working Party relating
to the Police and First Aid Facilities and the siting of certain of the _
Lottery Ticket Boxes.
              - -r\~"
(a) Police and First Aid Facilities

       It was recalled that the existing unsatisfactory police and first
       aid facilities under the North Stand had been accepted on an interim
       basis on the understadding that the Club would provide purpose built
       replacement facilities in the 1980 close season.

       It is appreciated that discussions on the detailed requirements are^
       still continuing, but it is felt that the Club should be asked to give
       a firm indication when the new police and first aid facilities are to.
       be provided-.                      _____     ___    ______ __ _______
 (b)   Lottery Ticket Boxes   ~

        Concern was expressed as to the blocked egress which could result if
        the timber lottery ticket boxes presently sited close to the ramps
        were to be tipped over or ignited, either accidentally or deliberately

        The Officer Working Party felt that the Club should be requested to
        re-site the b°x$s in a less critical position.

I    attach an additional copy of this letter for your use.

                                       Touts faithfully,

         For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

         Dear Mr. Vaughan,

                                    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
                                  Radial Fences at Leppings Lane End
                                                 and Security Gates

                          The work on the radial fences and security gates
          indicated on our drawings 3563/1-3 which we sent to you on
          2 September 1981, is now substantially complete.
                          Three first team home games have been played since the
           fences were erected.                                    We have not heard any formal comments
           from the Working Party about the operation of the fences and
           their access gates but we understand that representatives of the
           South Yorkshire Police have inspected the work and they are
           satisfied with the new arrangements.
                          To increase security it is proposed that pairs of gates
           are installed at the bottom of the two staircases at the back of
           the West Stand.                           Two copies of our drawing 3563/4 are enclosed                                                  '
           showing details of the gates.



                                                                                          Yours sincerely,

  I refer to your letter of 23 December 1981 and to the letter from Messrs.
  Eastwood & Partners - the Club's consulting engineers - relating to their
  proposals to erect a pair of security gates at the base of the two staircases
  at the rear of the West Stand at the ground. From a policing point of view I
  see no problems whatever concerning the erection of these gates, subject of
  course to them being secured in a fully open position during the time the
  public parts of the ground are occupied when matches are being played.

  Dealing now with the radial fences which have recently been installed on the
  Leppings Lame terracing, I can confirm that the fences are working particularly
  well and proving to be most satisfactory in effecting the segregation of
  opposing groups of fans. Since the fences were put up there has been no
  fixture at the ground of sufficient interest to result in that entire section
  of terracing being given to one group of fans and so I am unable to comment in
  that respect, but I see no problems whatever.

  However, there are one or two points concerning the actual construction of the
  fencing which give cause for concern from a police point of view. In some
  places the existing barrier rails have been extended up to and completely
  through the new radial fences at a height of 4'6" or so from the ground,
  making it very easy for fans to climb from one pen to another. In other
  places the existing barrier rails have been cut off short of the radial
  fences, leaving what the police consider to be dangerous pieces protruding
  into some of the gangways. This matter has been drawn to the attention of the
  Club Secretary, who has been advised of my intention to bring it to your
  notice. I would point out that Mr. England totally agrees with police
  observations regarding the construction of the radial fences but I understand
  from him that it is being suggested that any alterations could conceivably
  result in a reduction in the capacity of the Leppings Lane terracing. I am
  not aware of the thinking behind that but for my part see no reason why that
  should be.

I apologise for the delay in replying to you but I am sure you will appreciate
that the recent bad weather has necessitated the cancellation of a number of
matches at the ground which would perhaps have provided greater experience in
the handling of spectators within the new pens - particularly the match on
Boxing Day.

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.

In reply to your letter dated 14th December, 1-931, I understand that
the Building Authority has contacted your office direct for clarification
on a small number of points regarding the proposed installation of pairs
of gates at this bottom of the two staircases at the back of the West
Stand. Subject to the satisfactory resolution of these points and, of
course, to the gates being secured in the fully open position during the
time the public parts of the stadium are occupied when matches are
being played, the Officer Working Party has no objection to the proposals.

As regards the radial fences installed on the West Terrace and the^
security gates around the North Stand, the Officer Working Party wishes
to make the following comments:-

(a)    Radial Barriers on West Terrace

The matches played at the stadium since the installation of the barriers
confirm that* they appear to be working well and satisfactorily effect the
segregation of opposing groups of fans. However, the entire section of
the Terrace has yet to be given to one group of fans.

The Police inform me that, on installation of the new radial barriers,
the existing crush barriers have been extended in some places up to and
completely through the new radial barriers at a height of 4'6” or so
from the ground. The effect is to make it very easy for fans to climb
from one pen to another. In other places the existing crueh barrier
rails nave been cut off short of the radial barriers in a manner which
leaves dangerous pieces protruding into some of the gangways.

 (b)   Security Gates around the North Stand

You will recall that my   letter of 14th September, 1981 stated that,
provided that the gates   and/or their supports, hinges, etc., do not
impinge on the existing   critical ramp widths, the Officer Working Party
saw no objection to the   erection of the security gates.

I am informed that the manner in which the gates have been installed
has resulted in each gate's hinge impinging at least 7i" into the width
of the raop. This means that there is a 15” reduction in width of the

                                         As the Annual winter inspection of the Hillsborough Stadium is due

                                         taken to discuss these matters at the inspection.

      For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


      Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                               Safety of Sports Ground Act
                      Thank you for your letter of 20 January.
                      I believe the .small number of points needing
      clarification have already been discussed between
      John Strange and Mr. Sheriff.                                            One of these refer to the
      need for a goal post type frame over the gates but this is
       in fact already provided by the sheeting frame.                                                                  There is
      also a small amount of rust staining arising from misplacement
       of reinforcement in the 100mm thick retaining wall.                                                                    There
       is no immediate danger arising from this and an appropriate
       maintenance repair will be carried out.
                       Turning now to the radial barriers on the West
       terrace it is of course accepted that where there is a
       crush barrier passing through or close to the radial barrier
       it will make it easier for anyone who so wishes to climb
       over.           Nevertheless we believe it is not unreasonable to
        leave the crush barriers as they are.                                                 If all barriers
       Were removed back to a distance say 1.2m from the fence it
       would mean a 2.4m wide gap which is not protected by barriers.
                                                                                                                                            -jr>-j "ixi C
                                                              R e g is tL f    B la n d - No. 1134531                                                    &   A
  OOD & PARTNERS




There would be a consequent loss of calculated spectator
capacity which is undesirable from the Club's point of
view.   However from the point of view of safety a strip
of that width without a single crush barrier would be a
major hazard.
_______    It   should be kept in mind that the introduction
of these radial barriers has effected a very great
improvement .from the point of view of segregation of
spectators but to achieve perfection from the point of
view of segregation brings with it other disadvantages.
I believe that what we have done is a reasonable compromise
between the various interests.
          In the second paragraph on this subject you
refer to dangerous pieces of rails protruding from the
crush barriers.     I have not had an opportunity to check
this since receiving your letter but I am informed that
the word 'dangerous' is a little exaggerated and they
do not of course protrude into a gangway as there is no
gangway at this position.
          With regard to the security gates around the North
stand the point at issue is whether the encroachment into
the gate width is at all critical.     The remaining clear
width is 3.300mm which is equivalent to a six unit exit.
Thus the theoretical number of people who can get out in
eight minutes using the green book figure of 60 people
per minute per exit width is 5,760 shared between the two
routes.     The stand capacity is of course 10,000 and in
practice more than half the number tend to use the lower
exits since most spectators are reluctant to walk uphill
 to the upper set of exit stairways.    The picture is that
 fewer than 5,000 people will be trying to get out of
 exits which can accommodate 5,760 in eight minutes.

              There were very good structural reasons for placing
   the gates in this way.   The theoretical exit capacity has
   not been changed since it was always a six unit gateway.
   There is no funnelling effect, and there is a good
    'reservoir' area upstream of the gates.
            I         telephoned your office yesterday but gather
   you were on leave and have again telsphoned this morning
   with a view to agreeing a tentative date for the winter
   meeting of the working party.   I will try again in the
    next day or so.

                                     Yours sincerely,

1 .____Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss <the apparent difference of opinion
on certain aspects of the radial barriers installed on the West Terrace
and the security gates at the top of the North stand ramps, as well as to
carry out the usual winter inspection of the Stadium.

2.      Ground Inspection

A.      West Terrace

Whilst the whole Terrace had yet to be used, the matches played since the
erection of the radial barriers indicated that generally they worked well and
satisfactorily effected the segregation of opposing groups of fans.

However, the police pointed out that in places the existing crusn barriers
had been extended up to and, in some cases, completely througn the new
radial barriers, which had the effect of making it relatively easy for anyone
who wished to do so to climb from one pen to another* Also, in the pen
nearest to the South Stand, a small length of existing crush barrier had been
left unsupported.

 IT WAS AGREED -

 (i)   That, on balance, it was preferable from a safety point of view to
 prevent crowd surge by the existing barriers being extended up to and/or
 through the new radial barriers than to completely prevent persons being
 able to climb from one pen to another, subject to review at the end of the
 current season.

 (ii)    That the uns upported small length of existing crush Darrier would
 be cut off.

        3.     West Stand'"      -- '—   ---- --- ; •• • :’- '      •- -

        One of the security-gates .which the Club           wished to instal at the bottom       of
        the two staircases had now been erected.

        IT WAS AGREED     that this could be regarded as satistactory.

        C.     North Stand

        The Fire Service felt that the manner in which the security gates had been
        installed at the top of the ramps unduly restricted the exit width available.

        The Club’s Consultants and the Fire Service disagreed on the interpretation
        of paragraph 16 of the "Green Guide", and consequently on the figure to be
        applied in the calculation for assessing  whether the exit width lost at the top
        of the ramps by the method of security gate installation was critical or not.

        IT WAS AGREED" that, as the point might well have been covered in the
        initial consideration of the Club's application for a General Safety
        Certificate, the point would not be pursued at the moment.

               NOTE - A search of the file subsequently revealed that, as
                      suspected, the point had been considered at a
                      meeting of the Officer Working Party on 12.2.79,
                      the relevant part of the Note of the meeting reading:-

                          "the construction and width of the ramps being
                           such that they could quite^ properly be
                           regarded as elevated roadways".

        D,    Spion Ko?

        Xt was noted that the infilling of the step adjacent to uhe handrail on
        the left of the original exit at the top of the Kop had taken place; that
        the boundary fence at the top or the Kop had been reinforced, and tnat the
        existing barriers had been permanently extended and the area at the foot
        of the new Kop exit (adjacent to the brick built refreshment point)                  •        J
        levelled off as agreed.

        E„        South Stand

        The agreement to visually inspect the roof trusses for apparent deflection
        after exceptional gale or snow loading conditions was recalled.

         F.    Items   of General Maintenance

         IT WAS AGREED    that the following items of general maintenance required
         attention:-

         (i)   The rounding off of the corners on the steelwork of the underside of
         the exit at the southerlyend of the West Stand   (to be done that day), as
         well   as the rounding off of thebrackets to the North Stand securitygates.

         (ii) The repair or replacement of the corroding stanchions supporting the
         fencing and sheeting above the boundary wall on the right hand side of
         Gate "0".


                                                     -2 -


                                          os
'(iii)' The cracks*in the- concrete' terracing of the Spion Kop to be filled.'

(iv) The wooden support Xfl the electrical line between the brick built
refreshment point jand the Owls Club to be fixed more securely.......

(v)    The brick wall between the South Stand and the Spion Kop (nearest
to the South Stand) to be pointed.

(vi) The concrete supporting strut to the wall between the Spion Kop and
S e S o S h Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop) to be protected (cracks and
exposed b a r).

G.       Temporary Structures

 Concern was expressed as to the possibility of inadequate structural stability
 Sf teSJorary Sructures, such as scaffolding used rn connection wrth
 television transmissions•,

 Paraeraph 20 of the Club's General Safety Certificate required T.V. cameras
 and portable equipment to be placed only in such positions as may be agreed
 and portable equip           F                       generally required to
 ensure11that the^tadium complied with good engineering and building practices
 a n d w i t h the reievant British Standard Specification or Code of Practice.

 IT WAS AGREED that the question of temporary structures should be kept
 under review, and that the Club’s Consultants should give advice to the
 Club.

 3.      Future Developments

 A.      Police and First Aid Facilities_

 It was likely that, following continuing consultations with the Police, the
 L b would s L r U y ’be in a position to formally notify the County C o u n c U
 that the new Police and First Aid Facilities would be provided m the
 forthcoming close season.

  B.     Additional Turnstiles and Exit Gate in Penistone Road

  The Club hoped to formally notify the County Council shortly of t h ^ r
  intention to proceed in the forthcoming close season_with the demolition o.
  some of the existing toilets on the Penistone_Road siae of the R a d i u m in
  order to provide additional turnstiles and exit gate o p that side of the
  Stadium.

  C.     Widening of Walkway and Erection of New Fence

  Because of drainage problems, the existing concrete panel fence to the
  rear of the Spion Kop (nearest to the Owls Club) had had to be removed.
  When settlement was complete, it was intended to widen the existing
  walkway and erect a new fence on the revised line.

 For the attention of Mr D Vaughan

 Dear Mr Vaughan,
             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd
          Segregation of Visiting Spectators at Leppings Lane End

             The club is anxious to segregate the visiting team's supporters
 as they enter the ground, and also to enable the police to control
 their exit at the end of a gams.
     We have prepared the scheme shown on the attached print of our
  drawing 6705/2. This involves the construction of two new banks of
  turnstiles              (Nos 17 - 21 and 22 - 29), and various runs of fencing
  and new gates.
      It would be appreciated if the Working Party could consider this
  proposal at an early date. Mr Chester has already given a copy of
  the drawing to the police so that they have had some advance notice.




                                                                           Yours sincerely,




   c„c. Mr R. Chester
                                       An Unlimited C om p H H                   in England - No 1833144
                            SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

                    Note of a meeting of the Officer Working Party (Sheffield
                    District) held at the Police Sports & Social C lub, Niagara
                                  Sheffield, on 18th April 1985


PRESENT: N. Atkinson (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
         C   Calvert  (South Yorkshire Police)
         R. Grimshaw (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
         G. Stanley   (South Yorkshire Police)
         T. Stewart   (South Yorkshire Police)
         G. Sykes     (South Yorkshire Police)
         D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)
         a ! Vickers (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)



1.          Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the letter dated 9th April
and plan from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners relating to the proposals of
the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to construct two new banks of
turnstiles and various runs of fencing and new gates in order to achieve
segregation of visiting supporters at the Leppings Lane end of the
Hillsborough Stadium.

2.          Consideration of Proposals

The Police representatives pointed out that the proposals had been
prompted in the main by comments they had made to the Club. At one
time both the West Stand and Terrace had been regarded as exclusively
for the use of visiting supporters, but recent patterns of attendances
at the Stadium made it necessary to allow for some element of use by
home supporters as well.

The proposals now outlined by the Club were generally acceptable to the
Police representatives, subject tot-

             additional gates being provided between the turnstile numbered 16
 (a)
             and the wall of the inner access road;

             the central area of the Terrace (indicated as the neutral area or
 (b)
             visiting supporters’ terrace) being divided in half by a new
             central radial fence running from the tunnel entrance to the
             pitchside security fence with gates erected so as to permit entry
             to be diverted to either half as appropriate (the proposed new
             secondary radial fence adjacent to the existing fence indicated
             on the plan to be abandoned);

 (c)         the right hand area of the Terrace (indicated as home supporters'
             terrace) also to be divided in half by a new central radial fence
             running from back to front with two gates (the existing radial
             fence dividing the present two Terrace areas - neutral area and
             home supporters - to have a second gate installed;

     (d'k    the existing pitch perimeter fence to have additional exit gates
             installed - one in the neutral area and one in the home supporters
             area

                                               .1.

3.   Action

IT WAS AGREED:-

(a) That R. Grimshaw should investigate as a M t t e r of urgency the means
if escape aspects of the proposals and let D. I. Vaughan know the
outcome.
     That     subiect to satisfactory clearance of these aspects by the
County^Fire Service, the outline proposals submitted by Messrs            Eastwood
. Partners be.agreed as                            ^ " s X i s s i o n “of ^

                   Further to the joint meeting on 18 April 1985, to discuss the proposals for
                   new crowd control arrangements, the means of escape implications have now
                   been considered. The scheme would appear to be satisfactory providing that
                   certain gates have the minimum widths (in metres) as indicated on the enclosed
                   plan. It is understood that these gates will be supervised by either the police
                   or club officials.

                   Should you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact
                   this Department.

                   Yours faithfully

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                      Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975
                    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
                 Thank you for your letter of 2 May giving the comments
of the Officer Working Party on the proposals which we sent
to you on 9 April.
                 In the interim period several of the points which you
raised had already been incorporated in our latest scheme
which has yet to be considered by the Club Board.                                                                        However I
would ask that further consideration should be given to the
request in paragraph                            (c) of your letter for a second gate to
be installed in the radial barrier and for the new radial
barrier which you have asked for to have two gates.                                                                       If these
gates are meant for use in emergency it would mean having                                                                           a
steward in attendance on each occasion, the expense of which
would hardly be justified.                                         It is our view that in the event of
emergency,spectators can be evacuated quickly enough by the
gates on to the pitch and by the normal exit gates at the rear.
We will of course be prepared to discuss the matter with the
Fire Officer's staff should you so wish.

                                                        | | H |                          Yours sincerel y .

Dear Sira,

Safety of Sport3 Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PIC

In reply to your letter of 8th May, the extra gates referred to in paragraph
(c) of my earlier letter of 2nd May were included primarily at the request
of the South Yorkshire Police.

Provided that the remainder of the points raised by the Officer Working Party
are incoprorated in the latest proposals (yet to be considered by the Club),
the Police are prepared to concede the request for two gates per radiSal fence
in the right hand area of the beppings Lane End Terrace (indicated as heme
supporters' terrace on the plan).

                                              •iBw     *

Note of a Meeting of the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) held at
the Police Sports and Social Club, Niagara, Sheffield, on 29th July, 1985

PRESENT:     S. Allcock (South Yorkshire County Fire Service).
             N. Atkinson (City of" Sheffield Metropolitan District Council).
             Ms. J. Barker (South Yorkshire Police).

             D. Sheriff (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council).
             D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council).

1.       Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the detailed plans submitted by the
letter dated 25th July from Messrs. Eastwood and Partners of arrangements
for the segregation of visiting spectators at the Leppings Lane End of the
Hillsborough Stadium of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. It was
recalled that consideration of outline proposals had taken place by the
Officer Working Party on 18th April, 1985. Whilst formal application had been
made for Building Regulation approval and some of the work had actually
commenced, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners had apologised by 'phone that
submission of the detailed proposal's for. Safety of Sports Grounds Act
approval had apparently been overlooked due to pressure of work and staff
holidays. The plans also included details of repairs to certain crush
barriers on the Spion Kop.          ..

2 ._____Consideration of Proposals                                 '

The 14     detailed plans submitted were^ each, considered   and discussed individually.

IT WAS AGREED that, subject to the following points and to the submission of
the necessary detailed calculations to the Building Authority, the proposals
for segregating visiting supporters at the Leppxngs Lane End of the
Hillsborough Stadium were generally, acceptable:-

(a)    Plan No. 6705/6 - for both security access and emergency egress purposes,
a pitch perimeter fence gate to» be: provided;

(b)    Plan No. 6705/8A - the new handrail by Turnstile 23 to be either
shortened or re-aligned so as to maintain the exit width between the outer
(river) wall and Turnstile 23, and the exit width between Turnstile 16 and
the new handrail not to be less than the width of the roller shutter gate
between Turnstiles 16 and 17;

(c)    Plan No. 6705/9A - the single block thickness of the interal walls
(e.g. the cubicles) is not considered to be substantial enough, and a
substantial stud partition (timber or steel — suitably faced) is felt to
be required;

(d)        Plan No. 6705/10A - same conments as for plan     9A;

(e)    Plan No. 6705/11A - no objection in principle» but details of exact
location required;

(f)    Plan No. 6705/12 - no objection in principle, but no barrier height
indicated;

(g)    Plan No. 6705/14A - so long as increased thickness is achieved by steep
slopes as indicated or. the plan and not bj "atapsed*' arrangements to give
(h)    Plan No. 6705/16A - in view of experiences last year, the front
corner of the Spion Kop (by the crush barriers numbered^, 8 and 22) to
either have a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate or radial barrier(s) to overcome
possible lateral crushing hazard when large crowds are present;

<i)    Plan No. 6705/17 - for both security access and emergency egress
purposes , a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate to be provided;

(j)    Stewarding of New Gates - as mentioned in my letter of 2nd May, 1985
it is essential that all the new gates are fully supervised by Stewards*
who must be fit, able and properly trained.

(g)     Plan No. 6705/14A - 30 long as increased thickness is achieved
by steep slopes as indicated on the plan and not by "stepped" arrangements
to give foothold, the nrooosals are satisfactory but the possible need to
take measures on top of the wall to discourage persons from attempting to
clifada over will have to be borne in mind;

(h)    Plan No. 6705/16A - in view of experiences last paar, the front
corner of the Spion Kop (by the crush barriers numbered 5, 8 and 22) to
either have a Pitch Perimeter Pence Gate or radial barrier<s) to overcome
possible laterallcrushing hazard when. large crowds are present;

(i)    Plan No. 6705/17 - for both security access and emergency egress
purposes, a Pitch Perimeter Penes Gate to be provided;

(j)    Stewarding of NewGates - aa mentioned in my letter of 2nd May,
1985, it is essential that all the new gaees are fully supervised by
Stewards, who oust be fit, able and properly trained.

    For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


    Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                      Safety of Sportsground Act/ 1975
                              Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
                    Thank you very much for your letter of 30 July giving the
    outcome of the Working Party meeting on 29 July.                                                         We note
    the general comment that the calculations have to be approved
    by the Building Surveyors Department.                                            We believe that all the
    calculations which are likely to be required have been sent for
    checking and comment.
           With regard to your detailed observations our response
    is as follows
    (a)             We are not sure of the location on the West terrace of
    the proposed"extra security gate.                                         There is already a gate in
    the       2m    wide g a g formed by the new radial fence for use by the
    police.           This same gate will still be available for the spectators
    in emergency as"there are gates into the                                            2m     gap from the terrace
    which will be under the control of the police.                                                      This point may
    perhaps be clarified during the Working P a r t y rs visit on 7 August.

    (b)             The foundations "for this fence are in fact already aligned in
                                    An Unlimited Co                     littered in England - No, 1833144
.A S T W O O D   £* P A R T N E R S




   the way you suggest.

   (c) and        (d)
                 We are a little surprised by the suggestion that a
   single block thickness is not sufficient for the cubicle
   walls.         The inside of a toilet cubicle is not a very
   vulnerable area and the walls are          braced by the door frame.
   Studding is not at all suitable in terms             of strength or
   durability, and would probably invite vandalism.

   (e^           The refreshment area is under the most westerly
   staircase up to the north west corner terrace.             There will
   be- an opportunity to inspect on 7         August.

   (£>       - The handrail is to be at a      height of 1250mm (4'1")
   above the horizontal step, measured at the face of the vertical
   step.

   fgl           The stepping of the face of the wall is achieved by 45°
   chamfers which will not form good footholds.

                 Mr. Chester says that the club will certainly not
   object to the provision of another gate at this point, and
   the- precise location can be discussed on 7 August.

                 As with point (a), we are not sure what is intended,
   ancfc the matter can be discussed on 7 August.

                 Your comment regarding stewarding will no doubt, be
   taken care of by Mr. Chester.


                 It will be much easier for your Working Party to
   appreciate wliat is intended when they see the works under
   consrtructior^^: There will also be an opportunity to see
   the metal decking of the South stand.


                                      Yours sincerely,




   cr.cr.        Mr. R.H. Chester

     Note of a meeting held at the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield on
                           7th August, 1985

PRESENT:   Representing the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

           Dr. W. Eastwood (Messrs. Eastwood & Partners)
           P. Hough (Deputy Secretary)

           Representing the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District)

           C.   Calvert (South Yorkshire Police)

           D.    I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)
           F.    Waterhouse (South Yorkshire County: Fire Service)

1.    Purpose of Meeting.

The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the-"summer" inspection of the
Stadium with particular reference to the Leppinga Lane end improvements and
the metal sheeting of the upper seated area off the South Stand.

2.    Ground Inspection.

A.    Leppings Lane End

The progress'of. the works to segregate visiting, supporters behind and on the
West Terrace and Stand were- inspected with particular reference to the
points raised at the Officer Working Party’s meeting, held on 29th July,
(forwarded to Messrs. Eastwood and Partners by the Chief Executive s letter
of 30th July) and Messrs. Eastwood & Partners reply of 1st August.

Messrs. Eastwood^& Partners had confirmed that all the calculations which
were likely to be* required had now been sent to the Buildings Authority for
checking and ccment.
              _                    '"-I'- i
On t h e i n s p e c t ^ ^ t f i e Building^Authority pointed* out what they considered
 to be the poor’ standard .of workmanship i n .the construction of the new
dividing wall which was being built behind the Stand. The position of the
 Police Personnel access gate and the stepping of the face of the wall by
 45° chamfers so as not to form footholds were acceptable.

 The foundation-of the new handrail by Turnstile 21 had actually been""
 aligned so ait fc<^ m aintain the exit width between the outer (river) wall.,«.
 and the T u r n s (uniike the indication on the plan submitted). ~

 As regards thesfngle block thickness of the internal walls of the cubicles
 in the new maler and female toilet facilities at the rear of the stand,
 Messrs. Eastwood and Partners considered that the inside of a toilet cubicle
 was not a very vulnerable area, and pointed out that the walls were braced
 by both the outer walls and the door frames. The Building Authority noted
 the assurances given by Dr. Eastwood, but expressed concern that the
dividing walls in the new toilet facilities evidently did not have any
foundations, apparently having been built straight onto the existing
concrete-slabs. It was noted that there were some 9 inch thick brick walls
in the Male Toilets, it being considered that any hooliganism or vandalism
would be more likely to occur there than in the Female Toilets.

The Club pointed out that the new toilet facilities would not be completely
finished by the first match of the season (on 17th August) but that
temporary facilities would be available and that no building material would
be left on site.

The position of the new refreshment area under the most westerly staircase
up to the North-West corner terrace was noted. This again had been built
straight onto the existing concrete slabs.

On the Terrace itself, it was noted that there was an existing gate in the
new 2 m. wide gap formed by the new radial fence for use by the Police.
This gate would still be available for the use of spectators in an
emergency as the gates at the top of the Terrace under the control of the
Police would enable spectators to be directed down the 2 m. wide^gap.
However, it was agreed that steps or a longer gate would be required. It
was also agreed that a new gate would be required from the new South
Central Terrace Pen.

As regards the upper seated stand area, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners had
sent by letter dated 2nd August plans of the new fences and barriers in
both the Stand and at the Access level.

IT WAS AGREED

(a)   that the condition of the internal walls in the new male and female
toilet facilities at the rear of the Stand should be monitored;__

(b)   that the existing gate in the pitch perimeter fence should either be
extended or have steps to provide easier access from the new 2 m. wide gap
formed by the new radial fence;    -                   '"    ' '

 (c)   that a new'gate in the pitch perimeter fence should be provided from
 the new South Central Terrace Pen; '                         -

 (d)   that the advertising hoardings at the front of the upper seated stand
 area should be securely fixed to the concrete wall;                     .....

 (e)   that the spalling of the concrete of the wall at the front, of the .
 upper seated stand area should receive attention as a matter of maintenance
              _        yz?   v"1,      '    .   .       _ . .;x           - v ..r
 (f)   that the'corrosion of the” steel columns at the rear of the Stand" ■■
 should receive attention on a maintenance basis.       .. *•'           -


 B*                                                 1       vak;-   3dJ                          •*
 Messrsv Easfcwopl^Partners" reported that" the* condition’ of the uppeir
 concrete outer;portion of the exterior wall of the Stand had been ' °                    '
 investigated and was considered to be satisfactory.
         -r           if •          4*»v;                            t      t-.jr - • -r-’ • *
 It was noted thit “the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
 Stand had been largely completed, and the spraying of the non-slip
 surface was to commence very shortly (and certainly be completed by the
 start of the season).
      IT WAS AGREED that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
      Stand should largely overcome the flanmability problems inherent in such
      timber structures, and the. Club stated that they would ensure that the
      wooden intermediate steps were securely replaced upon completion of the
      laying of the metal sheeting*                                 —

      C.   - Spion Kop                                      ■

      M essrs. Eastwood & Partners recalled that outline details af;^3ie Club* s
      proposal to cover the Spion Kop had been sent for the information of the
      Officer Working Party by letter dated 22nd July. As part of ;tbat scheme,
      the bridge portion of the Kop would be removed. Its present condition
      remained acceptable with continuing maintenance.           ;

      In v i e w of *«perifences last season, the Club were requested to. provide an
      additional gate in the pitch perimeter fence in the front corner nearest
      to the South Stand to overcome the lateral crushing hazard vhicfe could
      occur when large crowds were present.

      IT WAS AGREED that the Club would provide a new gate in the pitch perimeter
      fence in the front corner nearest to the South Stand with a stepped
)\    arrangement to assist access and egress.
 )
      D.     North Stand      .

     ' The temporary storage facilities created by the erection of a timber wall
       (in front of the Ladies* Changing Facilities in the Sports 3fc££L) were
       inspected.                                                 ‘‘'4 "

      IT WAS AGREED that so long as light combustibles (such as p aint) were not
      stored in this area, its use continued to be acceptable on a temporary
      basis.

      E.     Closed Circuit Television Facilities

      The advantages for general crowd control and security (both in and 'outside
      the Stadium) which would be given by the recently installed dosedXtfrcurt
      Television System were explained to the Officer Working Party.

9      IT WAS AGREED:-

       (a)   that a 2| kg. CO 2 Fire Extinguisher should be installed in "both the
       Police Control Box and the Disc Jockey Box;

       (b)   that loose external wires on the outside of the Boxes should "be made
       secure.

    ote of a Meeting of the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) held at
   the Police Sports and Social Club, Niagar^ Sheffield, on 13th November, 1985


   PRESENT:    N.   Atkinson (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
               C.   Calvert (South Yorkshire Police)

               R.   Woodhouse (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)


   1 .___ Purpose of Meeting

   The purpose of the meeting wa3 to- consider the response to be given to the
   proposals outlined in the letter dated 25th October, 1985 and plans received
   from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners relating to facilities for the disabled, an
   increased capacity for the Spion Kop and consequent additional exit routes.
   Outline details of the roof to be erected over the Spion Kop had also been
   provided.

   2.    Disabled Facilities

   The Officer Working Party expressed' reservations on both of the suggestions
   proposed by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners for the disabled. If the disabled
   continued to be accommodated iir front of the North Stand, they would still
   be in the "firing line" of ms-aimed"'shots and any clear sheeting over the
   top of the area they occupied'coul'd" constitute an unacceptable hazard to
   persons who might vacate the North Stand in an emergency situation by
   climbing over the front waXI of the stand onto the pitch perimeter. It was
   accepted that the means of escape duf not provide for this to be done, but
   it had to be recognised that i» practice this was a real possibility. The
   structural strengih of such a structure would also be something of a problem.
   The other suggestion of accommo<&t£h& the disabled in front of the perimeter
   fence along the front of the Sgion Kbs. (nearest to the North Stand) was also
   unacceptable for the reasons stated bx Messrs. Eastwood & Partners.

    The suggestion of the Police representatives was that the front area of the
^ f lower Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) should have the terracing levelled
    to provide, say, a two-tier level landing, on which to accommodate the disabled,
    with a substantial fence at the rear. The ejdLsting._pitch perimeter fence in
    front of this area could be removed*, and the disabled would continue to gain
    access from the ramp between the Spion Kop and the North Stand as at present.
    This would also enable free access by the disabled to the proposed disabled
    toilets under the rebuilt terracing of" the Spion Kop.

    The current legislation relating to the disabled was also discussed.

    IT WAS AGREED that.the proposals for the disabled^ as now
   •outlined by the Police representatives* should be supported and
   -^transmitted to Messrs.’Eastwood & Partners as the views of
    the Officer Working Party, subject to there being, no obstruction of exit
    routes and flows. ---

    3 .____ Enlarged Spion Kop             ~                 !

    The Fire Service and the Building Authority, agreed that calculations showed



                                    0                 -
     £-.5-   . . . c~;-~ r-,-, ;.;o':l(l provide for nn incraas*' of some 5,000
spectators' on"the present capacity of 16,850, and that the number of exit
widths required to achieve evacuation was 46.         The proposals to increase the
tunnel exit on the north side of the Kon to 8 clear units and to provide a
complete new six unit staircase on the south side were regarded as acceptable.
As when the original calculations had been made, the units of exit width
included the emergency gates in the pitch perimeter fence, but it was cons­
idered that landings in front of these gates should be constructed (as has
been done at Bramall Lane).

IT WAS AGREED that, subject to the following points, the proposals from the
enlarged Spion Kop submitted by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners were generally
acceptable:-

       (a) adequate headroom being provided between the new roof and the
            upper rear and the new south side exit routes:               ^
       (b) to barriers being provided adjacent to the refurbished .gents
            toilets and the new ladies’ toilets in the new six unit staircase
            on the south side;
       (c) to landings being constructed in front of the existing emergency
            gates in the pitch perimeter fence;         _
       (d) to confirmation of the number of new turnstiles to be provided on
            the south side and on the Penis tone Road side ;
       (e) until acceptable alternatives are available, the new exit gates to
            be fitted with a turn-bar arrangement under the control of
            stewards.

4.      Roofing of Spion Kop

Whilst it was accepted that onlyan outline of the roofing proposals had been
supplied to date, the Building Authority pointed out that the plans showed
that the gables were not lined.

 IT WAS AGREED that this should be pointed out to Messrs. Eastwood & Partners,,
 as well as the fact that should any of the proposed works on enlarging or
 roofing the Spion Kop take place other than in the close season, it will be
 a requirement that the areas concerned will have to be secured to prevent
 unauthorised access.

 5.     Crowd Flow at the Leppings Lane End of the Stadium

 The Police reported on the continuing problems caused by the merging of
 spectators from all parts of the Stadium at the Leppings Lane end.

 It was difficult to see how this   could beovercome, as the physical restraints
 to achieve this could conceivably be morei of a danger than allowing the present
 position to continue.

 6 .____Duties of Stewards Booklet

 IT WAS AGREED that the draft of a Booklet prepared by the South Yorkshire P®1*0®
 outlining the duties of safety stewards was acceptable and should be distributed
 to designated grounds for the information and guidance of stewards employed at
 such grounds. Factors peculiar to particular grounds could, of course, be
 added if considered appropriate.

  7.    Spot Checks at Designated Grounds

  The Fire Service reported on the success of the recent spot check carried out



                                     tED2

     standards were being maintained by the Clubs.

Dear Sirs,

Safety cf Sports Crounds Act, 1975                          ..{■•y :
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

The Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) met yesterday afternoon to
consider the proposals contained in your letter dated 25th October, .1935
and accompanying plans.

1.    Disabled Facilities

The Officer Working Party expressed reservations on both of your suggestions
for the disabled. If the disabled continue to be accomodated in front of
the North Stand, they will still be in the "firing line" of nis-aimed shots
and any clear sheeting over the top of the area they occupy could constitute
an unacceptable hazard to persons who might vacate the North Stand in an
emergency situation by climbing over the front vail of th$ stand onto the
pitch perimeter. It is accepted that the means of escape does not provide
for this to be done, but it has to he recognised that in practice this is a
real possibility. The structural strength of such a structure could also be
something of a problea. The other suggestion of accomodating the disabled
in front of the perimeter fence along the front of the Spion Kop (nearest to
the North Stand) is also unacceptable foT the reasons stated by you.

The suggestion of the Police representatives was? that the front area of the
lower Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) should have the teraacing
levelled to provide, say, a tvoitier level ianding on which to.accorarodate
the disabled, with a substantial fence at the rear. The existing pitch
perimeter fence in front of tfess area could be removed, and the disabled
could continue to gain access from the ramp between the Spion Kop and the
North Stand as at present. This would alao enable free aceess by the
disabled to the proposed disabled toilets under the rebuilt terracing of
the Spion Kop.


                                                           /Costd .

The current legislation relating to the disabled was also discussed.
In the circumstances, the Officer Working Party consider that the
proposals for the disabled suggested by the Police should b« supported
subject, of course, to there being no obstruction of exit routes and
flows.

2.    Enlarged Spion Kop

The Officer Working Party agreed with your calculations and proposals to
increase the tunnel exit on the north side of the Spion Kop to 8 clear
units and to provide a complete new 6 unit staircase on the South side.

Accordingly, the Officer Working Party agree that, subject to the following
points, the proposals for hhe enlarged Spion Kop are generally acceptablei-       !

(a)   adequate headroom being provided between the new roof and the upper
       rear and the new south side exit routes;
(b)   to barriers being provided adjacent to the refurbished gents’
       toilets and the new ladies’ toilets in the new six unit staircase
       on the south side;
(c)   to landings being constructed in front of the existing emergency
       gates in the pitch perimeter fence (as at Bramall Lane);
(d)   to confirmation of the number of new turnstiles to be provided on
       the south side and on the Penistone Road side;
(e)   uniil acceptable alternatives are available, thie new exi* gates to
       be fitted with a turn-bar arrangement under the control of stewards.

3.    Roofing of Spion Kop

It was accepted that only an outline of the roofing proposals has been supplied
to date, but the 3uilding Authority point out that it appears that the gables
are not to be lined and thus it would be comparatively easy for them to be
climbed.

Also the Police asked me to stress that should any of the proposed works on
enlarging or roofing the Spion Kop take place other than in the ci&sc season,
it will be a requirement that the areas concerned will have to be secured to
prevent unauthorised access.

4.     Crowd Flow at the Leppings Lane end of the Stadium

The Police reported on the continuing problems, caused by the merging of spectators
from all parts of the Stadium at the Leppings Sane end.

 It was agreed that it was difficult to see how this could be overcome, as the
 physical restraints to aciieve this could conceivably be more of a danger than
 allowing the present position to continue, but I was requested to register the
 point.

                                       Yours faithfully,



                                        County Solicitor.

Mr. Vaughan pointed out that the Local Government Act, 1985," would abolish
the South Yorkshire County Council (and the other Metropolitan County Councils)
on 31st March, 1986. From 1st April, 1986, the Certificating Authority under
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975, would be the appropriate District
Council. In the case of the Hillsborough Stadium this would naturally be
the Sheffield City Council. For this reason, it had been suggested to the
City Council that appropriate representatives in addition to the Building
Surveyors’ Division might find it useful to be present at the meeting, and
Mrs. L. Bashforth and Mr. J. Derricott were welcomed and introduced to the
remainder of the representatives present . .•           . ^

Mr. Vaughan took the opportunity of expressing appreciation and thanks to
the representatives for the help and assistance which they had given to him
in his role as Co-ordinator of the Officer.Working Parties .since 1978. Tftere
had obviously been occasions when differences, of opinion and interpretation
had occurred but', in the main, these had been^resolved b o ^ a m c a b l y and
constructively.       .-„ -      v       c

For the Club, Dr. Eastwood thanked Mr. Vaughan for his ser^ces^andjoshed
him well for the future. Other representatives e n d o r s e d . JDr^astwood*s
remarks.                      ^

 2.        Purpose of Meeting
                                                                                    •       ■ ■^r.T " ^ . ' V -■*
 The purpose of the meeting was two-fold; firstly to discuss^the further
 details of development proposals at the stadium forwarded^wltb the letter
 dated 23rd December, 1985, from Messrs. Eastwood and Partners and, secondly,
 to carry out the "winter" inspection of the Stadium.

 A.        Development Proposals for the Spion Kop

 The further d e t a i l s 'were'in~addi.tion::to the comments set out in the .letter
 dated 29th N o v e m b e r 1985, /on the observations made following the Officer
 Working Party meeting held on ^ M ^ ^ / e m b e r .
             (i)    Sheeting of Outer Face

             Dr. Eastwood reported that the sheeting of the enlarged Spion Kop at
             the rear and sides would result in the structure being virtually
             sealed. In reply to queries from the County Tire 'Service, he confirmed
             that no storage would be allowed under     structure and that checks
             for any accumulations.of rubbish would be undertaken-'on a regular basis.

             (ii)        Climbing of the-Jnner Steel Frame

 % B."' '-Facilities for the Disabled

    To illustrate that the figures originally quoted to-provide facilities for the
    disabled at the foot of the Spion Kop (nearest to the Uorth Stand) were'not
    unrealistic, Dr. Eastwood reported on the breakdown of tihe "tender figures
    (opened on Monday) for the enlarged, roofed Spion TLop.. "He still considered
    that any such proposals would involve the loss of .up to'X,000 of Jfhe extra
    5,000 spectator places which would be provided by the enlarjgedSpionKop.
    Other areas of the Stadium had also been considered      investigated, but
    none could provide as large a flat, easily accessible area as that in front of
    the North Stand, which had been successfully used for so long without any major
    problems. Up to 80 disabled persons, plus attendants., used the area. The only
    major drawback he saw was that when there was a strong southerly wind, rain
    could be blown onto the disabled, despite the cantilever xoof -of the North
    Stand extending virtually to the pitch. For this reason, the Club were willing
    to roof an area from approximately the letter ”0" on the results hoard to the
    end of the Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop) with a substantial roof, including
   rarmoured glass where there might be a visibility problem, .provided that this
    was supported by the Officer Working Party.

 “ Whilst accepting much of what Dr. Eastwood said, the Officer Working Party
    (and the Police representatives in particular) still expressed some concern as
  .to whether making semi-permanent facilities for the disabled in front of the
   North Stand was the appropriate and correct thing to do.

    The Building Authority confirmed that, after further investigations, it was
    considered that the disabled facilities requirements of the Building
    Regulations 1985 did not appear to strictly apply to the roofing of the
    enlarged Spion Kop.
IT WAS Agw » ’n that, in the first instance, Dr. Eastwood would prepare sketch
plans of •*-"*» .suggested roofed disabled facilities in front of the North Stand
for consideration by the Officer Working Party.

C.          Ground Inspection
            (jj   West Terrace and Stand

The Police representatives confirmed that the revised segregation arrangements
to the -rear of    Stand worked well on by far the majority of occasions.

The.area'for the suggested covered disabled facilities was inspected.

As p r e v io u s ly - : mentioned by Dr. Eastwood, the possibility of providing an
increased widt±t access to the pitch area (between the North Stand and the
Spion Kop) for_poss33>le use by emergency vehicles, as well as for maintenance
by the Club was discussed. The facility could be incorporated into the
enlarged Spion*Kop jnroposals relatively easily.

 It WAS A n E F m that, -whilst the County Fire Service felt that such a facility
 was not essential :£or their purposes, it could be useful for use by emergency
 vehicles in certain situations and generally should be supported.

             (iv)            Spion Kop

 Dr. Eastwood indicated the extent of the work to construct the enlarged,
 roofed, Spion "Kop, and confirmed that steps would be taken to prevent
 unauthorised access to areas where work might be in progress during the
 course of the season.

 It was noted that the additional gate in the pitch perimeter fence in the
 front c o m e r nearest to the South Stand, with a stepped arrangement to
 assist access and egress, had been provided.

             (v)              South Stand

 It was noted that the metal sheeting of the wooden floor of the upper
 portion of the Stand (with sprayed non-slip surface) had proved to be of an
 acceptable appearance in use, and generally appeared to provide a compromise
 solution to the flammability problems inherent in such wooden structures.

 IT WAS AGREED that its condition would continue to be monitored.

                                   SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB LTD.

                  INSPECTION JULY/AUGUST 1980 OF HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL STADIUM



                  Items of maintenance which it is suggested should be carried
       out in the reasonably near future.


       1.         Some of the fencing posts at the top of the Kop need painting
                  near the base.


       2.         The fencing at the rear side of the gangway over the lower
                   exit from the Kop is becoming very corroded.


        3.        The concrete posts forming part of the retaining wall at the
                   foot of the bank at the rear of the Kop (behind Penistone
                   Road turnstiles)                     are showing signs of spalling due to
                   corrosion of the reinforcement.                                         The cracks should be repairec
                   with either liquid epoxy or by epoxy mortar.


        4.        The Denso tape wrapping on some of the starter bars at the
                   back of the North West c o m e r is coming loose.


        5.        Cracks running from the top to near the bottom of the concrete
                   terrace at the North West corner have grown more pronounced
                   in the past year with salts leached out of the concrete
                   being deposited on the underside.                                           These cracks should be

         sealed to prevent the reinforcement corroding.


  6.    There is a very small area of rust spalling on the
         ballustrade at the front of the West stand.


  7.     The boundary wall at the South West c o m e r needs
         pointing in places.


  8.     Certain timbers in the roof of the South stand may    be
         suffering from damp penetration.      These can be checked
         when part of the ro<pf is examined at the end of 1980.

1.         Purpose of Meeting

Mr. H. E. McGee, the Club's Chairman, welcomed the Working party.      *

As had been explained in theChief Executive's letter dated 10th January to
the Club, the County Council felt it was desirable to introduce a twice-
yearly programme of visits by the Officer Working Parties to all five of
the League Football Grounds in South Yorkshire (namely, early in the year and
also in the middle of the Year) in an effort to maintain public confidence
in their safety at football grounds. Additionally, at the other grounds,
it was hoped that this procedure would obviate the real possibility of the
Clubs carrying out works which might prove- abortive or require additional
work on designation. This was the first of such a programme of visits.

2.         Inspection of Ground

Mr. McGee left to attend to other business, and the remainder of the
representatives made a tour of inspection of the ground.  It was agreed
that the majority of matters revealed (detailed below) could be regarded
as routine maintenance.

(a)        South Stand

The detailed inspection of a mutually agreed part of the roof structure
had taken place on 13th/14th January after the erection of scaffolding and
platforms.  Bearing in mind the age of the stand, relatively little
deterioration had taken place. It had been agreed that the apparent
deflection in the steel trusses should be monitored over a period of time.
Whilst there were signs of water staining on the roof timbers, it was by
no-means certain if water penetration was still taking place.  It was
agreed that the area around the roof hatch should be particularly investigated,
which would also give the opportunity of inspecting the roof tiles generally:

It was also agreed that should any of the exterior windows in the Ladies'
Toilets below the stand be broken, they would.be replaced by wired or some
such safety glass.




                                  m
Except for the continuing maintenance of the concrete terracing and crush
barriers,..the ,.only_matter..requiring attention was., the infilling of a step
adjacent to the handrail on the left of the original exit at the top of
the Kop.
                        V *
The Club had received Planning Permission and Building Regulation approval
to the erection of a brick built chip shop at the bottom right of the new
exit from the Kop (viewed when descending).      The siting of the chipshop
would not interfere with the egress from the new            Kop exit.

(c)‘    North Stand
                      * t
Expansion cracks had appeared in the wall of the North Stand(nearest      to
the Spion Kop) which required attention.

The Club were in the process of building showers and changing accommodation
attached to the existing gymnasium at the rear of the Stand. The public
did not have access to the facilities. Additionally, the Club were
investigating the possibility of acquiring property in Vere Road so as to
provide an alternative exclusive access to the gymnasium without using
the existing access through the ground.

Revised proposals for the facilities to be provided in the new Police Post ^
and Firsc Aid facilities had been agreed, and it was intended to build       '
permanent accommodation in virtually the same position as the existing , v
temporary structures.

(d)     North West Corner Terrace

The Club had received quotations for making good the cracking of the concrete
on the terracing, which the Board were to consider shortly.

 (e)    West Stand

Some cracked brickwork at the rear of the stand required pointing and then
checking to see if the cracks re-opened.

^Apparent distress on the concrete pillar supporting the steps at the rear
 of the Stand required urgent attention, and attention ought also to be
 given to cracks in the concrete at the top of both sets of stairs.

The weathering and corrosion in the base plate of the sheeting column in
the south-west c o m e r of the stand required attention, possibly by concrete
sheeting.

Finally, the steel supports to the new emergency exit (nearest to the
South Stand) still required to be rounded off.

 (f)    Police Control Facilities

 The Club pointed out that the police now had exclusive use of the box
 (overlooking the whole of the ground) previously used by the disc jockey.
 The disco unit had been re-sited underneath the original box.




                               CD
3 .______Revised Entrance Facilities-    ---

The Club outlined the consideration being given to the siting of caravans
outside the Penistone- Road and Leppings Lane ends of the ground to sell ... -
tickets.  It was hoped.;that if this took place, increased entry flow of
spectators to the ground would result by reducing delays at the turnstiles.

4 .______Bar Facilities

The Club also outlined' the consideration being given, at the request of
the Police, to revised bar facilities at the Leppings Lane end of the
ground.                         .

5 .______Future Developments

Whilst the proposals were in a very preliminary stage, consideration was
being given by the Club— to the provision of an Executive Club', at the .
Leppings Lane end of the car park under the South Stand and the adjoining
store area. There was also a possibility of the existing office accomm­
odation being extended outwards. Additionally, the reception lounge
might be extended, the kitchen area moved and a new Directors* Room built.
It was stressed that these wexa long term plans and no firm proposals existed
at the moment.

1^_____ Purpose of Meeting

The visit was the second in the twice-yearly programme of visits by Officer
Working Parties to all five League Football Clubs in South Yorkshire, as
mentioned at the meeting on 10th February, 1981, and originally referred to
in the Chief Executive's letter to the Club dated 10th January, 1981. The
visit on 7th April had been a special one in view of the Stadium being the
venue on. 11th April for a F.A. Cup Semi-Final match.

2._____Inspection of          Stadium

The representatives made a joint inspection of the Stadium.

 (a)         South Stand

The progress of the monitoring of the apparent deflection in^the steel
trusses referred to at the meeting on 10th February was queried but, in
the absence of Dr. W. Eastwood, no specific answer could be g\ven.

It was noted that the monitoring device to be sited adjacent to the new
metal case for the batteries supplying the emergency power supply for the
public address system (referred to at the meeting on 7th April) had yet to
 be provided.

 (b)         West Stand

 The cracked brickwork at the rear of the stand, as well as the apparent
 distress on the concrete pillars' supporting the steps at the rear of the
 stand and the cracks in the concrete at the top of both sets of stairs,
 had been made good.

 As previously agreed, as soon as a grinder was next present at the Stadium
 the Club would round off the steel supports to the new emergency exit
 (nearest to the South Stand).

 Following experiences at the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match, the Club were
 considering revised arrangements on the terracing in front of the Stand.
 An assurance was given that the Officer Working Party would be consulted
 when these had substance.

          (C)'';'
          The two small areas where water seepage had continued to take place after
          treatment had now been satisfactorily treated. _

          It was also noted'that the tie bars through the upper level concrete
          area to the rear had been protectively wrapped.-   —                   :

          (d)       North Stand

          The expansion cracks'in the wall of the North Stand (nearest to the Spion
          Kop) had been made good.

          (e)       Spion Kop

          The infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on the left of the
          original exit at the top of the Kop had not been done to date but would     ^
          be attended to shortly.




•
          The temporary barrier of scaffolding tubes erected between the end of the
          new Kop exit outer barriers and the concrete pillar of the lowest of the
          Kop original exit steps- (adjacent to the new brick built chip shop) prior
    ■>)
          to the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match remained. However, the Club intended to
          extend the existing barriers to fill the gap on a permanent basis and to
          level off the area between the bottom of the new Kop exit staircase and the
          original Kop exit steps prior to the commencement of the forthcoming season.

          (f).      General

          It was noted:-

          (i)    that the steel girders with mesh on top adjoining the wall at the
          rear of the Butcher's Shop on Penistone Road required attention because of
          corrosion, and (ii) that the top of the brick built wall between the Spion
          Kop and the South Stand required pointing.

 ______Purpose
  1            of Meeting

The visit was the usual summer inspection carried out of all Football
League Clubs in South Yorkshire (originally referred to xn the Chief
Executive’s letter to the Club dated 10 January 1981).

 _____
 2     Ground Inspection

A      West Stand

•It was noted that there was light surface corrosion at the foot of the
 steel supporting pillar nearest to the North-West Terrace. As there was
 no enclosing wing to the stand, the pillar was open to the elements.

The possibility of spectators climbing onto the roof of the store shed to
the rear of the stand and adjacent to the boundary wall was discussed.

IT WAS AGREED -

 (i)    That the Club would    arrange for the foot of the steel    supporting
 pillar to be cleaned and painted and possibly for the gusset plate to be
 covered by a concrete haunch.

 (ii)   That the Club would consider whether any useful purpose would be
 served by retaining the store shed adjacent to the boundary wall.

 (iii) That the Club would      investigate and make good the crack in the
 concrete adjacent to stand entrances "W" and "X".

 B      North West Terrace

 It was noted that the cracks in the concrete underneath the Terrace had
 been repaired and appeared satisfactory. However, there was seepage of



                              SB
                                                                         Vs-' .V-,
water between the North. West Terrace and the,West Stand in heavy rain

IT WAS AGREED - That the Club'would make good the bitumastic sealing
between the-Terrace and the West Stand.

C         North Stand:"    ^

A crack in the concrete at the expansion joint adjacent to Stand entrance
"R" was noted.

IT WAS AGREED - That the Club would investigate and make good the crack.       -

D         Spion Kop

The Building Authority suggested that at some future date the Club should
consider giving attention to the original steps at. the rear of the ^°P
(at the bottom of the new staircase) so as to remove the slight downward
tilt and ensure a common height of risers.

IT WAS AGREED - That, whilst there had been no reported incidents, the Club
would bear the suggestion in mind for attention at a future date.

E         South Stand

The Club reported that the gantry access to the Commentary Box on the top
of the      Stand was not now used, except byground   maintenance staff.

IT WAS      AGREED - That theClub would replacethe     missing ringsinthe chain
used as a handrail on the gantry.

F         Crush Barriers

The Club reported that the remaining third of the crush barriers on the
Spion Kop had now been tested. The only problem had been rusting of some
of the clips over the top tubes. These had been replaced or would be
replaced by the start of the Season on 28 August.

A visual inspection had also been carried out of the clips on the crush
barriers on the West and North-West Terraces, and similar action taken.

G         Police and First     Aid Facilities

The new police and first aid facilities under the North Stand were well
on the way towards completion, and would be utilised at the opening match
on 28 August.

H         Penistone Road Side

It was noted that the steel girders adjoining thewall at therear of the
Butcher’s Shop had been satisfactorily attended to, and that the Folding
Exit Gates had had new tops and runners installed and the concrete made
 good.

So far as the proposal to re-site an existing toilet block to the rear of
the Spion Kep to enable additional turnstiles and an exit gate to be
installed was concerned, the Club had reported to the Chief Executive
by letter that this had had to be deferred until the end of next season
due to the size of the problem and the possibility of creating hazards for
    spectators.




                                   m
l"    Tele vis ion Camera Facilities   ^   ;,,   _      .... ...

It was'noted 'that the scaffolding^ower erected;on the Spion Kop for
Television camera.purposes had now been removed.          .

There did not appear*to have been any progress with the Television-
Authorities to date on_the subject of permanent or semi-permanent
facilities.
                     ■Irt   -
J     Fire-Fighting Equipment

Whilst the Club were*confident that all of the fire extinguishers, etc,
were still sited as originally required by the General Safety Certificate,
the County Fire Service felt that a routine inspection of the equipment
would now be appropriate.

K      Maintenance

Certain- areas of spalled concrete in. the Stadium required attention, and
the Club had the work in hand as items of routine maintenance.

 For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


  Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                            Sheffield Wednesday Football Club L t d .
                               Minutes of Meeting held on 24 August

               Thank you for sending us a copy of your note of the
  proceedings of the meeting.                                                My one comment                                         on these minutes
  is that although the leakage of water between the north
  west terrace and west stand was discussed, there was
  no commitment to effect a repair.                                                                   This is not a matter
  which in any way affects the ground safety at this moment.
  As I explained, creating the perfect seal at a junction
  of this kind which is subject to opening and closing with
  change in temperature is extremely difficult and quite
  expensive.              The polysulphide sealant which would need to
  be used would itself cost not less than £200 to install
  but we fear that unless a carefully shaped chase is cut
   into both the concrete and the brickwork the sealant
  will not work.                       Thus an expenditure of quite a few hundred
   pounds would be necessary and the Club is unlikely to
   wish to spend this money on a matter which does not
   present a hazard to spectators.                                                                Nevertheless, we will                                                         Co-py        to
   suggest that this be put on the list of items which might
   be attended to during future maintenance by the Clubs own staff?                                                                                                                       r -J
                                                                                                                                      V     1■*»»   g s w n a T O 1 \T   .

 Note of a Meeting held at the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, on
 21st February, 1983

           F.   J. Waterhouse (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

1.     Purpose of Meeting

The visit x;as the usual winter inspection carried out of the Football
Leaguegrounds in South Yorkshire (originally referred to in the Chief
Executive's letter to the Club dated 10th January, 1981), as well as to
discuss and coranent on the Club's proposal to erect a new score and
message board (referred to in the letter and plans from Messrs. Eastwood
& Partners dated 7th February, 1983).

2.     New Score and Messace Board

The new board was to be erected in the south west corner of the ground
between the South and the Vest Stands at a-height of some 7 metres above
the terrace level. The siting and construction of the supporting pillars
were such that there would be no appreciable effect on the number of
spectators who could be accommodated on the terrace.

The Building Authority regarded the detailed drawings and calculations as
satisfactory, and Messrs. Eastwood & Partners outlined the steps taken to
take effect of wind and ice-loaaings on the structure. The South Yorkshire
Police were satisfied with the assurances given that the structure would,
for all practical purposes, be climb proof. Th? South Yorkshire County
Fire Service saw no objection to the proposal.

IT WAS AGREED That the Officer Working Party saw no objection to the
proposal, and that Mr. D. Vaughan would reply to Messrs. Eastwood & Partner:
to this effect.

3._____Ground Inspection

A.    West Stand

It was noted that, whilst the foot of the steel supporting pillar had been
cleared of light surface corrosion and its gusset plate had been covered
by n concrete haunch (as agreed at the summer inspection on 24th August,
1932), it still required to be painted.
It was also noted that the crack in the concrete adjacent to stand entrances
"W" and "X" had been made good.

The Club had also been requested at the sunnier inspection on 24th August,
1982, to consider whether any useful purpose would be served by retaining
the store shed at the rear of the Stand and adjacent to the boundary wall.
This point was repeated, and the South Yorkshire Police added that at
some time in the future they hoped the Club would be able to provide some
form of segregation, as well as separate bar and toilet facilities, to
separate home and visiting supporters at the rear of the Stand.

IT WAS AGREED that the new expansion crack in the brickwork at the rear
corner of the Stand (nearest to the North West Terrace) should be
monitored to ensure its condition did not worsen.

B.     North West Terrace

It was noted that the seepage of water between the North West Terrace and
the West Stand in heavy rain (also raised at the summer, inspection) apparentlv
continued to occur.

IT WAS AGREED that, whilst not being a matter of safety, the Club should
be recommended to replace the bitunan impregnated fibre board as a matter
of maintenance to overcome the seepage problem.

C.     -North Stand

The crack at the expansion joint adjacent to Stand entrance."R"(which            the
Club had been requested to investigate and make good at the summer
inspection) had received some attention but could not be regarded as
satisfactory.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would give further attention to the crack.

D.     Spion Kop

All of the crush barriers had been tested since certification, the main
problem having been rusting of some of the clips over the top tubes on
certain barriers.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would investigate and make good the spalled
concrete and corrosion of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Spion Kop
(at the North Stand end).

E.     South Stand

In view of recent adverse weather conditions, the agreement to visually
inspect the roof trusses for apparent deflection after exceptional gale
or snow loading was recalled.  It was noted that the sixth roof truss from
the East Gable (including the Gable) p a r t i c u l a r l y appeared to have deflected
since the summer visit.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)    That some form of measuring the evident def-lection in the roof
trusses was desirable, and the Club were requested to consider w'necher suae
form of quick and/or economic method of doing so could be devised.

(ii)  That the ChiefFireOfficerbe requested       toconsider    thrsuitability
from a fire resistancepoint  ofview of  theel;iddin>;  in t h e l i i r s t floor
enclosed link bridge from the Stand to the Restaurant.

F.    Police and First Aid Facilities

The new police and first aid facilities under the North Stand had been
welcomed by the users and were proving to be most useful.

G.    Maintenance

It was noted that certain items ofmaintenance throughout       the ground
required attention.

IT WAS AGREED that under this general heading the Club would look particular
into the loose wiring at both ends of the South Stand, at the pointing and
spalled concrete in the Male Toilets at the Spion Kop end of the South
Stand, and at the pointing required to the wall (including coping stones)
and the loose metal sheeting between the South Stand and the Spion Kop.

H.    Floodlighting Pylons

Whilst the electrical contractor's staff obviously had to climb the flood­
lighting pylons from tine to tine, it appeared that no regular inspection
of°the pylons took place from a structural safety point of view.

IT WAS AGREED that a regular   inspection of the floodlighting pylons from
a structural safety point of   view was desirable, say, every, two or throe
years, and that to*establish   the present position, an inspection of one of
the pylons should be carried   to see wnat was revealed.

I.    Painting of StructuralSteelwork,    Roof Trusses, etc.

Whilst not being a matter of immediate concern", the Officer Working Party
felt it would be in the Club's own interests to institute a programme for
the painting of structural steelwork, roof trusses, etc.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club should be requested to consider instituting a
programme for the painting of structural steelwork, roof trusses, etc. on
a regular basis .

J.    Penis tone Road Side                    ?

The Club were not yet in a position to say when the proposed improvements
at the Penistone Road side of the Ground were likely to be implemented.

ANNUAL INSPECTION OF THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM AS REQUIRED BY THE
                                   CERTIFICATE OF GROUND SAFETY


                      On 16 August 1982, I made an inspection of the ground,
after having had approximately one fifth of the crush barriers
on Spion Kop tested by members of my staff under my control.
                      At the end of June, crush barriers numbers 43, 44, 45,
46, 51, 52, 53,                     54,           62, 63, 63A,             65,66, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 78,
79, 80, 86, 87,                     88,           89, 91, 92, 94,                95, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 103,
104, 105, 107, 108,                               109 and 110 were                tested in accordance with the
procedures laid down in the Guide to                                              Safety at Football Grounds.
All the barriers sustained the test load although in some instances
the clips retaining the horizontal tube deformed.                                                                These clips have
been replaced.                        At the same time, other clips and horizontal rails
showing signs of advanced corrosion were replaced.
                       I am now able to certify that all 41 barriers have a
satisfactory strength.
                      Two radial fences have been installed on the Leppings
Lane terrace to segregate spectators.
                      Gates have been installed at various locations around
the ground to prevent intruders entering the stands.
                       Repairs have been carried out to six stanchions
supporting sheeting along the boundary wall near gate 'O' on

           Note of a meeting held at the Hillsborough Stadium,
                  Sheffield on 11th August, 1983

PRESENT:   Representing the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

           Dr. W. Eastwood (Eastwood & Partners)
           E. England (Secretary)

           Representing the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District)

           Ms- J. Barker (South Yorkshire Police)
           C. W. Calvert (South Yorkshire Police)
           J. Miles (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
           A. Roberts (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
           D. Sheriff (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
           D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

1 .______ Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was primarily to carry out the "summer"
inspection of the Ground in accordance with the policy of twice yearly
visits to Football League grounds .in South Yorkshire by the appropriate
Officer Working Party.

In particular, the Officer Working Party wished to see the position with
regard to the effect of the carrying out of the improvements at the
Penistone Road end of the Ground (considered by the Officer Working Party
on 28th June, 1983 and agreed subject to certain reservations contained in
a letter to the Club dated 29th June). Reports being received from the
Building Authority had indicated extensive movement of existing retained earth
material, apparently of sufficient magnitude to impair the stability of the
adjacent access ramp and associated perimeter walls and barrier rails.

2 .______Ground Inspection

A.      Electronic Score and Message Board

It was noted that, since the agreement indicated at the "winter" inspection
of the Stadium on 21st February, 1983, the electronic score and message
board had been erected between the South and West Stands.  Evidently, it
was proving to be a most welcome feature.

B.     West Stand and Terrace

The Club's intentions with regard to the brick built former A.R.P. building
at the rear of the Stand and adjacent to the boundary wall (now used as a
store) were again discussed in view of its condition.

The condition of the crack in the brickwork at the rear corner of the Stand .
(nearest to the North West Terrace) raised at the last meeting was inspected.

Dr. Eastwood reported that the crush barriers on the Terrace had been tested,
completing the first cycle of crush barrier testing at the Stadium.  One had
failed and been replaced.
  IT WAS AGREED -
  (i)     That, if the Club intend   to continue to use the former A.R.P. f a u i l c i r . g
• adjacent to the boundary wall, the lintel over the door would require attention
  in particular, as would the general maintenance of the building.
 (ii)    That the condition of the crack in the non load bearing brickwork at
 the rear corner of the Stand (nea ’ast to the North West Terrace) should continue
 to be monitored.
 (iii)   That the Club would give attention during normal maintenance to the
 loose concrete rendering apparent in places.
 C.       North West Terrace
 As the Terrace and the West Stand were separate structures, the Club were of
 the opinion that there would continue to be movement between the structures
 caused by changes in weather conditions, thus making it difficult if not
 impossible to achieve a seal sufficient to permanently prevent the seepage of
 water between the two.
 IT WAS AGPvEED that this was not a matter of safety and that the Club would
 continue to monitor the position.
 D.       North Stand
 The Club reported that the further attention to the crack at the expansion
 joint adjacent to Stand entrance "R" requested at the last meeting was ia hand
 as a matter of maintenance.
 E.       Spion Kop
 As requested at the last meeting, the Club had investigated the spalled concrete
 and corrosion of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Splon Kop (cowards the
 North Stand end). Action would be taken shortly to cut off the front (and
 worst affected) portion of the roof, which would also have the effect of
 increasing the headroom.
 Whilst certain remedial work had already been undertaken by the contractor to
 stabalise the banking at the rear of the Spion Kop following digging out
 to provide new refreshment and toilat facilities, tne Officer Working Party
 were of the firm opinion that further work was essential.   Measurements had
 shown that in places there had been as much as four to five inches of
 movement. Simple visual inspection showed that there was a lack of the
  !ormer retained earth material underneath the access ramp in places, and
 consequently there had also to be doubts about the stability of the foundations
 of the existing barrier rails.   The Club would have to look to the contractor
 (or his insurers) to meet the cost of the remedial work to the existing access
 ramp and barrier rails.
 As pointed out in the letter to the Club dated 29th June, measures would
 require to be taken to prevent the public gaining access to the roofs of the
 new facilities (as they were not load bearing).  Barriers would have to be
 provided or other measures taken to enable the new facilities to withstand
 crowd pressures where these were capable of-being generated (as also pointed
 out in the letter of 29th June).
 IT WAS AGREED
 (i)      That the Club's proposals for dealing with the spalled concrete and
 corrosion of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Spion Kop be supported in
 principle.




                                        m
(ii)    That as soon as possible, and certainly prior to the first home
match on 3rd September, the condition of the existing ramp and barrier
rails must be stabilised (possibly by drilling holes at intervals and
inserting grouting under pressure) and the resultant success or otherwise
of the measures tested by test loading the barrier rails (or a representative
sample) to the Green Guide requirements.

(iii)   Also prior to the first home match on 3rd September, measures must
be taken (a) to prevent access by the public to the roofs of the new
facilities and (b) to enable the new facilities to withstand crowd pressures
where these are capable of being generated.

(iv)    That the new buttresses to the existing boundary wall in connection
with the new turnstiles and exit gate must be sited so as not to reduce the
support to the wall, and that the need for pointing of the wall externally
in places must also not be overlooked.

F.     "Stands" Club

It was noted that there was spalling of the concrete surrounds to the steel
beams underneath the "Stands" club.  It was understood that the premises
were leased on a full repairing basis to Mansfield Breweries Ltd.

It was also noted that there was a certain amount of deflection in the brick
built screening wall in front of the Male toilets underneath the Club if
pressure was applied to the top of the wall.

IT WAS AGREED

(i)     That the Club would request Mansfield Breweries Ltd. to give
attention to the spalling of the concrete surrounds to the steel beams
under the "Stands" Club in accordance with the terms of their lease.

(ii)    That the brick built screening wall in front of the Male toilets
should be test loaded to the Green Guide requirements.

G.     South Stand

It was noted that some of the loose coping stones on the top of the
dividing wall between the South Stand and the Spion Kop had been removed,’
and that a certain amount of pointing of the wall had been undertaken.

It was also noted that there was severe corrosion at the bottom of both
steel supports to   the sides of theconcertina-type exit gate from the
Stand (nearest to   the Spion Kop).

IT WAS AGREED:-

(i)     That the Club would removethe remaining coping stones and arrange
for the remainderof the pointing to the upper level of the wall to be
undertaken as a matter of maintenance.

(ii)   That the Club would shortly consider a scheme to be prepared    by
Messrs. Eastwood & Partners forreplacement of  both steelsupports   to
the exit gate from the Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop).




                                 03
H.      Ground Fitness Certificate

Dr. Eastwood pointed out that many of the matters discussed at the meeting
were contained in his Annual Ground Fitness Certificate.  However, he had
delayed submitting this to the County Council, as required by the General
Safety Certificate, in view of the situation on the Penistone Road end of
the Stadium.

IT WAS AGREED that Dr. Eastwood would submit his Ground Fitness Certificate
to the County Council, excluding the Penistone Road end of the Stadium at
the present time.

           Annual Inspection of the Hillsborough Stadium as required
                                  by the Certificate of Ground Safety


                    On 25 July, 1983 I made an inspection of the ground after
 having had approximately one fifth, of the crush barriers
  tested by members of my staff under my control.

                    At the end of June, crush barriers numbers 121, 122, 123,
  124A, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130,                                              131, 132, 133, 134, 135,
  136               (part), 137, 138, 139, 140, 141,                                 142, 143, 144          (part), 145
   (part), 146               (part), 147, 148, 149                                (part), 150, 151, 152, 153
  and 154               (part), all at the Leppings Lane end of the ground
  were tested in accordance with the procedures laid down in the
  Guide to Safety at Football Gr o u n d s .

                    In all but one case the barriers sustained the test load
  although in two cases the clips retaining the horizontal tube
  deformed.                 These clips were on barrier 136 between spans 6-7
  and 8-9.                New clips have been fitted.

                    The only failure was the centre support of barrier 141
  where the angle leg parted where it was badly corroded.                                                           The
   angle has been plated and new bolts inserted.

                    I am now able to certify that all the barriers tested
  have a satisfactory strength.

                    Various minor items of remedial work to concrete walls
   at the back of the North stand, steps and terracing on Spion

                                                           Registered              No. 1134531

Kop and protection of the North side gable stanchion in the
West stand have been completed as part of the maintenance
programme.

     Certain other items of maintenance work which it is
suggested should be carried out in the near future have been
recommended to the Club.     A list is attached.

     New toilets and turnstiles have recently been constructed
behind Spion Kop.     During these operations the ramp down the
back of Spion Kop was disturbed b y movement of the embankment.
In particular the hand rail and concrete wall guarding the
edge of the gangway moved sideways.     The hand rail and wall
have now been tested in accordance with the requirements of
the Code of Practice and in all but one case, where there was
excessive deflection of a hand rail post, successfully
resisted the test load.

     Following these inspections and tests, I certify that in
my opinion the various structures on the ground are in a
 satisfactory condition and are appropriate for the stadium to
be used to the full capacity laid down in the Certificate of
 Ground Safety.

 1.        Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "winter" inspection of the
Ground in accordance with the policy of twice yearly visits to Football League
grounds in South Yorkshire by the appropriate Officer Working Party.

 The Club reported that the majority of the items listed as normal maintenance
 items following the "summer" inspection had yet to be carried out. This was
 due to a combination of the change in Club Secretary and certain development
 proposals (outlined on a confidential basis) which the Club had in mind.
•However, those which the Club's staff could undertake would be commenced shortly
 and tenders had been invited and received for the urgent remaining larger
 items (to be carried out commencing in M a y ) . The exception was the roof of the
 tunnel exit from the Spion Kop (towards the North Stand end) in view of its
 possible inclusion in the development proposals outlined.

 2.        Ground Inspection

A.         West Stand and Terrace
                                                      f.

It was noted that the former ARP building adjacent to the boundary wall was
in the process of demolition and the site cleared and levelled.  This would
have the additional benefit of improving the access/egress.

B.         North      West Terrace

It was noted that whilst generally the sealing of the cracks beneath the Terrace
to prevent seepage of water had been successful, there was still a slight
seepage from one of the repairs.

The possible need for protection of the wire mesh on the inside of the upper
access deck was also discussed.

 IT WAS AGREED -

 (i)         T h at t h e Club would c o n t i n u e to m o n i t o r the s l i g h t           seepage of w ater

        C.     Spior. Kop

        As oreviously indicated, the Club confirmed that the remedial work to the
        existing access ramp and barrier rails required as the result of the
        construction of the new refreshment and toilet* together with the erection
        of barriers to prevent access to the roofs of the new facilities, had been
        carried out.

        The present condition of the spalled concrete and corrosion of the roof of
        the tunnel exit from the Spion Kop was inspected.

        The stability of the perimeter wall at the Penistone Road   end of the ground
        was also discussed.

        IT WAS AGREED -

        (i)    That the Building Authority and Mr. J. Strange of Messrs. Eastwood &
        Partners should discuss and inspect that part of the perimeter fencing
        erected at the northern end of the ramp to prevent access to the roofs of the
        new facilities.
f t ,
        (ii)   That the Club wouldundertake continuous maintenance work on the roof
        of the tunnel exit, pending a decision on any de%relopment proposals.

        (iii) That the Building Authority and Dr. W. Eastwood should discuss and        inspect
        the stability of the perimeter wall at the Penistone Road end during the
        forthcoming close season.

        D.    Lighting Pylons

        The Club undertook to carry out a visual inspection of the lighting pylons during
        the forthcoming close season and to make more detailed inspections should this
        prove to be necessary after the visual inspection.

        E.    Emergency Lighting,   Fire Alarm and Public Address   Systems Test

        IT WAS AGREED - That the County Fire Service in conjunction with the South
        Yorkshire Police and the Club's staff, would carry out a test of these systems
        at the evening match against Fulham to be held on 7th March.

 For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


 Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                                               Testing of Crush Barriers
                 The barriers at the North West corner of the ground
  are due to be tested this year, which will complete the fir’st
  fiveyear cycle.                    As the ground is being used by a congress of
  Jehovah's Witnesses during early July, we shall be carrying
  out the tests during June.
                 Mr. Sheriff will be informed of the arrangements so
  that he can carry out his usual inspections.


                                                                                      Yours sincerely,

               On 18 and 19 J u n e , crush barriers 155, 156, 15 7, 158, 159,

 were tested iir accordance with the procedure laid down in the
 Guide to Safety at Football Grounds.                                             The barriers are shown
 on the attached print o f our drawing 1610/64C.
               Barriers 161, 162, 163, 180 (spans 1 and 2), 181, 183
  (spans 3 and 4) and 186 could not be tested because being                                                                        very
 close to the back of. the terrace the testing rig would not fit
 into the space available.                                           Because the distance behind these
Carriers is so resitricted it is extremely unlikely that the few
people behind them will exert the full load suggested in the
 •green’ guide*
               In all cases tested the barriers sustained the test load.

 access walkway at the rear if the north west corner terrace was

 tested.           Thirteen spans were tested and although the wire mesh
deformed by as much as 36mm during the load application,

recovery at      the end of the final test was          100%.
      On 22 June      the concrete         parapet wall along the front cf
 the suspended section of terracing, in the north west c o m e r
was tested.    During the load application, movement of the
wall was so small that readings using the measuring equipment
 could not be taken.
     Enclosed’are single copies of our record sheets showing
the results of all the tests on the barriers and fencing.
We are pleased to report that none of the barriers needs
strengthening w o r k .
      This set of tests now complete the five year test cycle
at the ground.

         The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "sunmer"inspection cr the
         Stadium   in accordance with the policy of twice yearlyvisits toFootb-s._l
         League Grounds in South Yorkshire.

         2.         Ground Inspection

         A.         South Stand

         The progress of the alterations and extensions to the understand area of the
         Stand (ndtified by the letter dated loth May frcm Mr. G. Gardner, Chartered
         Architect, and connented on by the Officer working Party through the Chief
         Executive's letter dated 31st May) were noted. The Club reported that the
         contractors had stated that all except the Banqueting Suite would be finished
         by the start of the season.

         IT WAS AGREED that the areas of spalled concrete on the vertical col*~=^s at the
         rear of the Stand required attention.

         B.         West Stand and Terrace

         IT WAS AGREED   -

         (i)       That the cracked brickwork (adjacent to the concrete vertical ceiu=i
         at the rear of the Stand adjacent to the North-West Terrace) should ccmtinue
         to be monitored.

         (ii)     That the damaged angled support brackets to the pitchside s-scurir*
         fence at the front of the Terrace should be repaired or replaced.

         C.         North West Terrace

         The wire mesh barriers on the inside of the upper access desk had bee-
         test-loaded (as suggested at the meeting on 29th February, 19S4), and had    •
         satisfactorily met the Green Guide requirements.




                                               E)
D-       North Stand

It was noted that a metal water storage tank had been installed adjacent to the
ramped access to the upper stand level.  It was also noted that a store area
had been formed by timber screening under the stand between the outer edge of
the walkaway and the Gymnasium building.

IT WAS AGREED that the County Fire Service would investigate the acceptability
of the timber screened store area and/or the items stored, and inform Mr.
Vaughan of the outcome.

E.       Spion Kop

That part of the perimeter fencing erected at the norther end of the ramp at
the rear of the Kap to prevent access to the roofs of the new facility (referred
to at the meeting on 29th February, 1984) had been up-graded and satisfactorily
tested to the Green Guide requirements.

The brick built screening wall in front of the Hale Toilets underneath the
"Stands" Club had been braced by metal supports.

It was noted that the condition of the spalled concrete and^corrosion of the
roof of the tunnel exit from the Kop had continued to deteriorate, as had the
dividing wall between the Spion Kop and the South Stand and the outer perimeter
wall at the Penistone Road end of the Stadium.

IT WAS AGREED   -

(i)       That Mr. Strange should let Mr. Sheriff have proposals in writing^
for stabalising the condition of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Kop (in
view of the Club’s reported intention of proceeding with development proposals
in the comparatively near future), following which Mr. Sheriff will let
Mr. Vaughan have detailed comments.

(ii)      That the removal of loose coping stones and the pointing of the.
between the Spion Kop and the South Stand (mentioned at the 11th August, 198.3
inspection) should be carried out as an urgent maintenance item.

(iii)     That, as it apparently now serves no useful purpose, the damaged
corrugated metal sheeting between the Spion Kop and the South Stand should be
removed.

(iv)      That pointing work should be carried out as a matter of urgent^
maintenance to the outer perimeter wall pending agreement between the Building
Authority and Dr. Eastwood as to its stability (during the present close season,
as mentioned at the 29th February, 1984 inspection).

 (v)       That the redundant wooden post and loose   wire adjoining thewalkaway
 at the top of the Spion Kop should be removed.

 F.       Lighting Pylons

 The visual inspection of the lighting pylons during the present close season
 (as mentioned at the 29th February, 1984 inspection) had not yet been carried
 out.

 IT WAS AGREED that, pending the visual inspection of the lighting pylons,
 corrosion of the base of the pylon at the rear of the West Stand and of the
 adjoining fence posts and manhole cover, required attention.




                                    m
G.         Crush Barriers

It was pointed out that the sets of tests carried out in June had con=leted
the five year test cycle at the Stadium.  The cycle would re-commence next
year.

3.         General Safety Certificate

The numerous alterations to the Stadium since the issue’of the General Safety
Certificate on 21st December, 1979, were recalled.

IT WAS AGREED that up-dated plans were required for incorporation int- the ^
General Safety Certificate in order to indicate the present facilities at t-a
Stadium.

4.         Toilet and Catering Facilities

The Club gave an advance indication of the likely up-grading of toiler and
catering facilities (particularly in the South Stand), subject to the autcc=s
of an application for grant from the Football Improvement Trust.  In trie mcr=
immediate future, the caterer in question had expressed a wish to serre focz^
from the rear of the West Stand through serving hatches instead of fr=n insiia
The area used would remain the same.  If structural alterations were rrsquir^-,
the Club would also require building regulation approval from the City Council

1.    Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "winter inspection of the
Stadium in accordance with the policy of twice yearly visits to Football
League Grounds in South Yorkshire.

2.    Ground Inspection

A.    South Stand

The alterations and extensions to the understand area of the Stand (which
had been completed since the "summer" inspection) were shown to the Officer
Working Party.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That any further areas of spalled concrete on the vertical columns at
the rear of the Stand would continue to be monitored and receive attention
by the Club as a matter of maintenance.

(ii) That the unsecured wire to the illuminated "Exit" sign in the Match
Day Sponsors Lounge would receive attention by the Club.

(iii) That the remaining bridge between the Stand and the Club at the rear
of the Stand (now used solely as a means of escape from the Kitchen area)
should be infilled with mesh from a safety point of view to accord strictly
with the appropriate Regulations.

 (iv) That the two emergency lights in the Club not operative at the time
 of the inspection would receive urgent attention by the Club*

 B„   West Stand and Terrace

 The Club recalled the practice followed in consultation with the South
 Yorkshire Police of separating home and visiting supporters at the rear
 of the Stand at certain matches (such as with Liverpool) by erecting
 temporary barriers.  This worked well but on all other normal occasions it
 was the policy of the Police to aim for exclusive use by visiting supporters
 of the West Stand and Terrace. On those occasions when the number of
 visiting supoorters was small and the weather was inclement, it was
 obviously desirable to allow home supporters access to a sheltered area.
     IT WAS AGREED -

     (1 )  That the Club would consider at some future date a scheme for
     permanent barriers at the rear of the Stand, subject to any proposals
     being submitted for prior approval by the Officer Working Party in the
     usual way.                                                    J

     (ii)     That the cracked brickwork (adjacent to the concrete vertical column
     to be monitored!"              adJacent to the North-West Terrace) should continue


 (iii) That the apparent rusting of the steel columns at the rear of the
 btand should receive appropriate treatment by the Club.

 C.          North West Terrace

 No comments.

 D.          North Sta-nr?

 IT WAS AGREED that so long as larger, not easily combustible, materials
 continued to be stored in the timber screened store area under the Stand
 the area would be regarded as acceptable.                                ’

                                                                         ~
4.   Toilet and Catering Facilities

The Officer Working Party confirmed that plans for the revised catering ^
facilities at the rear of the West Stand had been received from the Club s
Architect and had been formally approved.

catering facilities (particularly in the South Stand) was shortly to be
considered by the Board.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would submit the proposals for improved toilet
and catering facilities for approval in the usual way, subject, of course,

During Mr. Fownes’ visit to the natch on 25th August it was noted that very
little of the fcncing which should have been installed to protect the sheeting
at th* rear and sid“* of the Kop was In fact in place and It is also understood
that the P.A. System on the Kop was not in operation during that natch. It-was
alao noted that several pieces of fencing were in fact wired to the structure o?
the Kop presumably as a temporary measure. 1 consider these items important and

 For the attention of Mr. D. Bownes.


 Dear Mr. Bownes,

                                   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
                                      Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

                   As requested in your letter to the Club date d                                                    8

 January, we reply to your letter dated 4 December.                                                                 We will
 reply to your earlier letter, dated 22 April, in the next
 couple of days.

                   Going through the list of items accompanying your
 letter of 4 December the following are being done or have
 already been done by the ground staff -                                                 1   .1 ,    1   .3 ,   1   .5 ,    1   .6 ,
 1.8,              2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2 and 4.1.

                   The concrete post mentioned in item 1.2 has been
 taken down and a new barrier rail fitted to an existing
 steel post.

                   I have not had the opportunity of speaking to Dr.
 Eastwood about the rail in item 1.4.                                              He left for
Australia the day after I returned from six weeks leave.
However, enclosed is an extract from the terrace layout.
 Is it the rail which is shown in red that was agreed to?

                   Item 1.7 is not understood.                              You will recall that
 just before opening the Spion Kop, handrails were erected

alongside the radial barriers where the members of the
Officer Working Party considered that the step between the
gangway and terrace was excessive.       I cannot find anywhere
on the new terracing where an unprotected drop of over
600mm exists.       Perhaps the location can be pointed out to
me please.

     We do not consider that the rendering on the gable
wall adjacent to gate 'O' warrants immediate repair.          How­
ever any loose rendering will be knocked down to prevent
it falling on passing spectators.       That job can be done by
the ground staff.

     As I recall, when the store mentioned in item 2.3 was
inspected on    6   August, there was nothing in there that
constituted a hazard.

     A prototype of a gate fastening is to be trialed
shortly.     I will let you know when it has been fixed so
that it can be inspected.       Perhaps that type of fastening
will also be acceptable on the gate mentioned in item         3   .3 .

     The comment in item 4.1 is noted but we consider that
a greater hazard exists outside the ground, caused by the
road works on Penistone Road.       I have personnaly seen two
members of the public injured when leaving the ground.
One fell into an unprotected deep excavation, another
tripped over a partly excavated pavement and required
medical attention after receiving cuts and grazes.       I am
not aware of any similar injuries occurring within the
ground over the past few years and feel that more benefit
to safety would be gained by tidying up the pavements on
Penistone Road.

     The comments in item 4.2 are noted.

For the attention of Mr. G. Mackrell


Dear Mr. Mackrell,
                                            Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975
                                                            Barrier Testing 1988

              Over the four days 14,15,18 and 19 July 1988, the fourth
part of our five yearly cycle of barrier testing was carried out.
The barriers tested were numbers 121 to 124, 124A, 125 to 128,
 128A, 129 to 136, 136A, 137 to 153 and 187 all of which are on
the lower area of terrace at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.
The location of the barriers tested is shown on our drawing
 1610/64E, a print of which is enclosed.
              The load testing was carried out in accordance with the
 procedure set out in Appendix C of the 'Guide to Safety at Sports
 Grounds 1.
                  In all but one case the barriers tested, successfully
 withstood the applied load.                                              A clip over the rail of barrier 124
 broke before reaching the full test load.
                Visual inspection of all the barriers on the ground revealed
 that some of the ends of the rails are corroded although those
 tested on the Spion Kop last year and also those tested on the
 Leppings Lane terrace this year all safely supported the test
 load.

      The rail on barrier 133 is badly corroded and should be
replaced now.      There was also a lot of movement of thie rail on
barrier 144, when tested,and we also recommend that that rail
is also replaced.
      As agreed we have arranged for the clip on barrier 124 to
be replaced together with rails on barriers 133 and 144, before
the start of the coming season.
      Enclosed are single copies of our record sheets showing the
results of the barrier tests.

               Following your telephone call I am very pleased to enclose
a copy of my report to the Club concerning the barrier testing

the carbon on page                            2    that a copy of the letter part of our report
was certainly sent to Mr. Butler in your department and to
Mr. Bownes in the Legal department.                                                   I know it is our normal

so, a full set is now enclosed.
               I            also enclose a copy of the test certificate from Sheffield
Testing Works who checked the calibration of the testing equipment
the previous week.

For the attention of Mr. G. Mackrell

Dear Mr. Mackrell,
                     Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975
                           Barrier Testing 1988
     Over the four days 14,15,18 and 19 July 1988, the fourth
part of our five yearly cycle of barrier testing was carried out.
The barriers tested were numbers 121 to 124, 124A, 125 to 128,
128A, 129 to 136, 136A, 137 to 153 and 187 all of which are on
the lower area of terrace at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.
The location of the barriers tested is shown on our drawing
1610/64E/ a print of which is enclosed.
     The load testing was carried out in accordance with the
procedure set out in Appendix C of the 'Guide to Safety at Sports
Grounds1.
      In all but one case the barriers tested, successfully
withstood the applied load. A clip over the rail of barrier 124
broke before reaching the full test load*
      Visual inspection of all the barriers on the ground revealed
that some of the ends of the rails are corroded although those
tested on the Spion Kop last year and also those t rated on the
Leppings Lane terrace this year all safely supported the test
load.


                                33
      The rail on barrier 133 1* badly corroded and ahould be
 replaced now. There was al.o a lot of noveaent of the rail on
 barrier 144, whan tested, and we al.o reco.rn.nd that that rail
 is also replaced.
      A. agreed we have arrayed for the clip on barrier 124 to
 b. replaced together with rail, on barrier. 133 and 144, before
 the start of tha coming season.
      Enclosed are single copies of our record sheets showing the
 results of the barrier tests.



                              Yours sincerely,

        DESCRIPTION:                            One hydraulic pump complete with two hydraulic cylinders.
                                                The force on the cylinders, under an applied force is
                                                measured by a pressure gauge mounted os the pump.


         IDENTIFICATION:                        Pump: D948005
                                                Gauge: BGP 168 SR
                                                Cylinder 1: 04773                     Model RC 53AP9N

         METHOD

         The calibration was carried out in a Grade 0.5 lever arm testing machine                                                   in
         terms of the Technical unit of force the ton force (tonf). The uncertainty                                                 of
         the forces applied during the calibration is +0.5^*

         Three tests were made on each cylinder.

         Tests were made to determine the reading indicated on the gauge at filed loads.

   Dear Sir,
   SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975
   SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB

   I refer to your letter dated the 14th March 1980, concerning the above
   subject and would inform you that so far as our primary responsibilities
   are concerned, we do not have any current problems in respect of^access
   for emergency vehicles, terrace to touch line area or communications.

   The only matter outstanding so far as the Police are concerned is the
   provision of a suitable Police room and I understand that an undertaking
   has already been received from the Club that this will be constructed
   in the closed season of 1980. In dealing with this particular aspect,
   it would also be advantageous for a site to be made available, whereby
   ground control could be maintained from a position overlooking the play
            this is a matter which may be properly discussed at future


    tours faithfully,




    Chief Constable

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                          Safety of Sports Grounds Act,' 1975
                          Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
              Thank you for your letter of 14 November setting                                                out the
comments of the officer working party or, the proposals for the
new roof over the Kop.                             Our response is as follows :-


1.        Disabled Facilities
              First it should be emphasised that the disabled will have
to be accommodated at ground level.                                       No other arrangement is
possible at reasonable expense.                                      The choice is between putting
them in front of the North stand or in front of the Kop.
              Considering first the Kop, you will know that the terracing
drops down below the level of the perimeter track.                                                       It     would
therefore be necessary to place the disabled slabbing, and- seating
behind the line of the present perimeter fence.                                                      Each disabled
chair including manoeuvring space and also a runway in front
of the chairs occupies the same space as about 20 standing
spectators.           It would therefore be necessary to sacrifice the

                                                    23           istered in England - No. 1833144
equivalent of about 1000 standing spectator places to accommodate
50 disabled people and their attendants.       This would be
extremely costly.     The Club has decided to increase the
capacity of the Kop by 5000 people and the additional cost
compared with merely roofing over the present Kop is in
excess of £500,000.      Thus, if 1000 standing places were
sacrificed the cost to the Club would be £100,000 at least.
Anci11 a r y expenses would include moving the boundary fence
and reconstructing it to safety barrier standards plus the
cost of the concrete hardstanding.      We also have to keep in
mind that not only would the spectators be in the firing
line if anywhere near the goal but that in addition the new
Kop roof only extends to the front of the terracing so that
the disabled would be virtually unprotected from rain.
     The alternative proposal of leaving the disabled in front
of the North stand has the advantage that the cantilevered
roof extends some way in front of the seating so that there
is some protection from rain except when the wind is blowing
 from the South.       The Club would like to give complete
protection from rain and is prepared to consider the cost of
 the glazed roofing which we have suggested as a possible way
 of "increasing the comfort of the disabled.     The glazing
 would of . course be of toughened glass.
         If the working party has strong reservations about the
 glazing then obviously it will     not be carried out.      However
 I should stress that there is no possibility of the disabled
 being placed in front of the Kop because of the exorbitant
 cost.      The Club will continue to use the present location and
 the only question to be decided is whether it should be under
 cover or not.
      I should add that new toilet facilities for the disabled
 are an integral part of the scheme for the Kop and will be
 conveniently placed under the North      end of the Kop.

2.     Enlarged Spion Ko?
       Ca) All exit routes will have 2.4m clear head room
         (approximately 8ft.).


         (b)    We will need to discuss the proposed barrier
       adjacent to the new ladies toilet.          The exit route
       widens- out very considerably from 4.1m wide at the
         location where the six unit width has been calculated
       and is approximately 6m wide alongside the toilet block.
       We therefore believe that there is no bottleneck effect
         and that a barrier might merely provide an unseen
         obstruction which could create difficulty.        We will
         forward.a larger scale drawing of the area so that
         our comments can be considered in more detail.


         (c)    W e   will of.course provide the landings in front
         of the existing emergency gates in the pitch perimeter
         fence but you will know that there have been changes of
         view on this particular matter in the past and we would
         not wish the Club to be put to the expense of taking          .
         them out again when members of the present officer working
         party axe- replaced, with the passage of time.


          (d)   There, will be four new turnstiles on Penistone
         Road and six new turnstiles at the South end of the Kop.


          (e)    Gates with a t u m - b a r arrangement will be provided
         at the exits and the Club will of course provide stewards
          to control them.


  3.      Roofing of Spion Kop
          The gables will be sheeted on the outside face only and
  will     not be lined.       This is normal in Kop buildings and we      .
  think it extremely -unlikely that there will be any difficulty
  with hooligans climbing.          The horizontal rails are at such
  wide spacings that it would be difficult for even the most
  .a-ile to climb up-
      We are very mindful of the need to complete the areas
open to spectators before the start of the new season.        It
is conceivable that the contractors will have difficulty
in completing the new terrace steps at the rear of the Kop
before the first game.   In that event secure fencing will
have to be provided as a temporary measure. However we
are reasonably confident that the whole of the terrace
area of the Kop will be complete by the due date.       We
also intend to have all the new exit arrangements completed
but it is possible that work will still be. going on. in toilet
areas, particularly the new toilet for the disabled.


4.    Crowd Flow at the Leppings Lane End of the Stadium
      The Club is aware of the difficulties which the Police
have to contend with at the Leppings Lane end and has o f ...
course been very pleased to help the problem by the major,
works which were undertaken during the last close season.
We find it very difficulty to envisage anything, more which
could be done at reasonable expense.


 5.    Fire Brigate Access to the Front of all Stands
       As part of the works on the Kop, we are completely
 remodelling the area around the existing tunnel.       The
 head room is being increased to 2.4m and the width of the
 tunnel is being increased also.   A considerable amount of
 earth shifting will have to take place and this
 presents an opportunity to widen the gangway so as to
 enable say a fire engine to pass between the North stand
 and the retaining wall of the Kop.    If the Fire Service
 think this is of value, I should be pleased to know the
 width they would like so that we can see whether it can
 be provided at reasonable cost and without sacrificing, too .
 many standing spaces.

                           You^s   sincerely,
                                                                                                                    St. Andrews Hcuse

              SSsae months ago we applied for Planning Approval on behalf of
   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, for a new entrance on Penistone
   Road.         Approval was granted last September.
              nrvo. purpose of the entrance is to provide access for the public
   using the- Sports Hall so that they will no longer have to use
   Gate *Q*« whick"also leads to other parts of .the ground.                                                                          Another
   purpose is to provide a separate access for police vehicles, ambulance:
   and vehicles £or the disabled which park at the back of the gymnasium
    on                d a y s ^ ' T h i s effectively reduces any possible dangers which

                           Since you spoke to me yesterday by telephone, the St. John’s
                      Superintendent rang and I have today had a very long discussion
                      with him about the requirements at the Hillsborough Football
                      Ground. I have put my observations into a separate report which
                      I attach for your perusal* Perhaps you would contact me if you
                      require any elucidation of the points and I would esteem it a
                      favour not to get involved in any long meetings with the Club
                      Officials as there are so many demands on my time that I cannot
                      afford to be away from the office for any length of time.


                                                            Yours sincerely,




                                                      H. BAILEY

                                                 EZ)
The existing facilities are much below an acceptable standard and. I
would suggest the Club consider providing a more permanent structure
which is not likely to require up grading for a very long time. The
internal finish particularly oi* the Treatment area should be of an
imi>ervious nature so that it can be easily cleaned and rendered
fairly sterile and require no decoration. This can be achieved by
the use of tiles or formica type finish etc....

WATTING AHEA

The Waiting Area could be arranged within corridor space to minimise
the cost, where sitting cases could wait for attention on chairs.

TREATMENT AE3A

The Treatment Area should be sufficient to accommodate two or three
patients at any one time and consideration should be given to the
needs for privacy within the treatment area, bearing in mind that
the three patients may well be lying on couches.

LIGHTING

Good lighting is essential ard at the present time strip lighting
is very much in vogue and would be satisfactory. The provision of
a power point would also appear to be a basic requirement.

WATER

A supply of hot and cold water is essential J the cold water suitable
for drinking. It vrould also appear reasonable to request provision
of a hand basin and a large Belfast type sink. The Club should
consider whether it would be cheaper in the long run to provide
stainless steel basins which are not subject to chipping.

TO11ST
—
         HEPUIK5K5STS
     W l W i H — »wi ■ I— — ——


The Club should provide at least one male and one feniale toilet, for
the use of the public and should consider whether they should provide
an additional toilet for the use of the staff.

STORAGE

Storage facilities are required for six stretchers, and   for two sets
of wheels for stretchers, blankets and other bed linen.   This storage
should be lockable.

EQUIPMENT

The following is a minimum list to provide a basic service.

Treatment couches with lift up ends, two or three in number depending
on space available and/or number of cubicles, if the accommodation is
cubicledo

CAR PAEEIES
The Club may also consider what facilities should be extended to the
St. John's personnel for the parking of staff cars*

ambejiakces

Access for ambulances at the present time appears to be adequate but
must not be overlooked in any redesigning. It is understood that t
perimeter track is insufficient in dimension to easily run the
ambulance around the football pitch*

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports f-romds Act, 1975

Following approval by the County Council and clarification of ccrtoin
structural aspects of the South Stand construction, I am now able to formally
issue the attached General Safety Certificate in respect of the Hillsborough
Stadium.

As previously mentioned to you, the fee payable has yet to bs dstesrinad by
the County Council and I will, of ceaarse, ocntact you further cn. this point
as soon as possible.

I would particularly draw your attention to the following paragraphs of
Schedule 2 of the Certificate

8(1)   -    the existing First Aid facilities are accepted on an interim basis
            cnly pending the erection of purpose-built facilities in the ,1980
            close season;

12(1) - the arranganents for Emergency Lighting in the South Stand (as set
         out in the letter from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners to the South
         Yorkshire County Fire Service dated 12th Decenber, 1979) are
         regarded as acceptable only for the duration of the existing
         battery life;

14     - the existing Police facilities are accepted on an interim basis only
          pending the erection of purpose-built facilities in the 1980 dose
          season;

30     ~ vise of the Stadium in excessively high wind conditions
                                     and
       - use of the Stadiun in excessively high snowfall conditions.

Perhaps you would also treat this letter as the formal notice of issue required
by Paragraph 7 of the Safety of Sports Gromds Regulations 1976.

Should you have any queries on the Certificate, Mr. D. Vaughan of ny staff
will be happy to discuss than with you.

Finally, I would like to take this opportunity of recording the County Council's
appreciation of the oo-aperaticn and goodwill which the Club aid its Consultants
has extended to the Officer Working Party over the months of the necessarily
involved detailed investigations.

P.S.   hnilst it may be stating the obvious, the issue of the Certificate is
       of course, conditional on payment of such fee as may be determined bv
       the Countv Council.

   Dear Sir,

   Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

   I refer to your letter dated 5th April and to the recent ’phone conversation
   which you had with Hr. D. Vaughan of ay staff.

   I confirm that the Officer Working Party has now considered the Club’s outline
   •irawing of the new police and first aid facilities and, subject to the following
   points and consideration of detailed drawings, regards the proposals as
   acceptable in principle:-

   (i)      the walls of the first aid room to be lined withsuitable non-
             combustible material to enable the room to be easily cleaned and
             also avoid the need for re-decoration;

   (ii)     lockable storage facilities for blankets, strntchcrs,etc. to be
             provided in the first aid rocn;

   (iii)    in v i e v cf the location of the ~.P.O. jacV point in the police room,
             the telephone facility to be extended into the first aid room also;

   (iv)     the faoors of both the first aid and police rooms                                    to be of easily
                ■n a b l e m a t e r i a l (such as quarry tiles, etc.);

   (v )     u..- -G o £ o f c h e d e t e n t i o n roozi i n t h e p o l i c e r o c n           to be a t       le a st

            in the direction cf the top of the plan supplied;

            n a te ria lj

   (vii)    the need for the building to be rob-astly constructed, (especially
            tne detention roon) without reducing the internal dimensions to be
            borne in mind;

   (viii)   the building generally (and the toilet accomodation particularly)
            to be adequately ventilated, and suitable drainage facilities to be
            provided.

                                                                                 .../Gont.

(x )---- simple fire fighting equipment (such as a fire extinguisher)to        be
         provided in both the_ first aid and police rooms;
                         r
(xi)    the Club to be reminded of the necessity of seeking formalBuilding
         Regulation approval from the Building Authority.

Additionally, two other matters were raised at the Working Party         meeting. The
first relates to the subject of temporary structures. This was,          of course,
referred to in my letter dated 31st March, and no doubt you will         let me know,
in due course, what progress is being made on the preparation of         the proposals
for semi-permanent or permanent facilities.

The second matter relates to the concern felt from a public order and safety
p o i n t - o f v i e w by-spectators-(particularly during evening fixtures) spilling out
on to Penistone Road whilst trying to gain admission to the Ground. As you are
aware, the Penistone Road at thet point is both the main AG1 Sheffield/Barnsley
road and. a feeder toute from the city centre to the ^ML Motorway at Tankersley
and, as such, carries considerable volumes of traffic at all tines. There is
a very real fear th<rte * s«rious accident will result unless something can be
done to enable spectators queuingto gain access to the Ground              ■that point to
enter more rapidly than is possible presently.

This was, of course, a natter discussed at the Ground Inspection on 4th February,
1932.- It was understood at that time that the Club intended to carry cut vcrk
in the close season to rectify the problem. In this connection, it is suggested
that the most viable method of improving the situation is to re~site an ei-.i.sting
toilet block to the rear of the Spion I^op to enable an additional minimum cf
six (but preferably twelve) turnstiles to be installed, together with an
additional exit "ate. The exit --i-iths on the Pensstone Road side of the Ground
are, of course, just acceptable and an extra e;:it vrnuic. relieve tue situation.

The County Council feels justified in requesting mo»t firmly that the Club
sho->.v *   action in the forthcoming close season to relieve the admission
(and to a lesser extent, the egress) problems at the Tenistone Road side Oi the
Ground, should a decision to do so not have already been taken by the eiuL .

     For the attention of Mr. D . M. Bownes


     Dear Sir,

     SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 - SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB

     Thank you for your letter dated 3rd November, 1986, in respect of the above
     Club.

     Please find below my observations in response to outstanding matters.

     An inspection of the ground was carried out on 17th November, 1986.        The
     comments appended below do not take into account the numbers of persons using
     individual areas, lateral and radial gangways or units of exit widths, as
     it is assumed that from previous correspondence and documentation that the
     various working parties and committees have adequately dealt with these items.

     MEANS OF ESCAPE IN CASE OF FIRE

     North Stand

     Timber framed and clad buildings are constructed and located under the stand.

     The only reference as to the acceptance is minuted in meeting dated 7 .8.85
     in which one large store for bulky items was agreed on a temporary basis.

     There is also no record to indicate whether these buildings have been treated
     with fire retardant paint or solutions. Confirmation is required as to treat­
     ment of these buildings.

     Spion Kop

     A.   Timber framed and clad unit located on main central exit route has -not
           received any approval, no approach has been made by the Club for its
           installation, this should be removed immediately.

     B.   It is understood that the gates in the pitch perimeter fencing form
           part of the emergency exits. The gates for reasons of security, fasten


                             All communications        'Sed to the Chief Fire Officer.
      with barrel bolts secured to the gate both top and bottom and open in
      q sideways direction.   It is doubtful that if it were necessary to
      evacuate the stand onto the pitch in an emergency that the gates would
      open if pressure were generated by a crowd.      No record can be found
      in respect of discussion on gate fastenings.     It is recommended that
      a satisfactory security device easily openable from the pitch side should
      be found and fitted to all perimeter gates.

C.    During the inspection it was observed that several concrete steps on
       the lower terracing were in need of repair and in one case the complete
       step had erroded away.    Every endeavour should be undertaken to ensure
       that all steps are kept in a good state of repair.

D.    The wire mesh protecting the stanchions and bracing supports from being
      climbed is ineffective.   It has been observed that patrons visiting
      the Kop can, in large numbers from the back of the Kop, climb into the
      lower half of the roof.   The mesh should be extended to alleviate this
      situation.

E.    It was observed that where the terracing is above 1 m     higher than the
      lateral gangways wire   mesh infill had not been located along the full
      lengths.    Where the mesh had been provided this had been spot welded
      but the mesh had not been given an additional vertical support.

F.    Exit gates should be unlocked and keys held by stewards manning                the
       gate before patrons enter the stands.

West Stand'

A.    Timber framed and clad units located under this standhave been there
       for some considerable time. No record exists of:-

       (1)    acceptance of these units or,

       (2)    that they have been treated with fire retardant paint or solutions.

B.    Exit gates to the pitch perimeter as item B under Spion Kop above.

South Stand

The accommodation is divided into four areas:-

A.    Ground floor     offices,   directors   suite,   players   area,   function   suite,
      kitchen etc.

 B.   First floor, upper stand walkway,        press lounge, players lounge,         paint
       stores, disused bar area.

 C.   Lower stand, uncovered stand seating.

 D.   Rear stand, covered seating.

 With respect to the four areas, the following observations are made:-

 A.   Ground Floor:-

             (i) During normal working hours most doors from the office area
                  are kept locked shut.   All doors marked    'Fire Exit'   should
                  be made readily available for use by any person within the area.
                                   - 3 -


  (ii) A number of rooms at this level i.e. kitchen, laundry, stcres
        and directors' suite ventilate via openable windows and/or extract
        fans into the long corridor between areas A and C above.       It
        also appears that a number of the openable windows are protected
        by corrugated, lightweight plastic sheeting.

         The separation between the corridor and such ground floor areas
         should be to a minimum half hour fire resistance, any ventilation
         requirements being met by ducting to outside on the South Wall.

 (iii)   All storage should be removed from stairway enclosures and these
         areas always maintained free from such storage.

First Floor:-

   (i)   Again, a number of rooms i.e. players' lounge, press lounge,
         the store room previously used as a licensed bar and the paint
         store ventilate into this area.     Any ventilation requirements
         should be met by ducting to outside on the South wall.

  (ii)   Valves should be fitted to the gas supply line to each of the
         five refreshment positions in order that the supply can be cut
         off should an emergency arise.

 (iii)   All timber construction within this       area   should   be   suitably
         treated so as to be flame retardant.

  (iv)   The paint stores contain a quantity of flammable paints and
         mixtures and present a hazard .which it is considered should
         be removed from this area.     Proposals to relocate the stores
         should be discussed with the Fire Authority before any work
         is commenced in order that suitable siting and any need for
         licensing under Petroleum legislation can be ascertained.

   (v)   The timber constructed cupboard and the portable          sales kiosks
         should be removed from this area.

  (vi)   In the cleaners'     cupboard to this area, the fire resisting
         separation between    the ground and first floor levels is breached
         by the passage of     cables through a wall.   The area around the
         cables should be     infilled with material to ensure a minimum
         fire resistance of   thirty minutes.

 (vii)   All rooms onto the upper stand walkway should be separated from
         it by minimum half hour fire resisting construction, any doors
         being to the same standard and made self closing onto 25 mm
         rebates.

(viii)   Spaces above toilet accommodation are being used for storage
         purposes. Again, these areas must be maintained clear of storage.

Uncovered Seating Area:-

The means of escape from this area is along the corridor in front of
the rear part of the stand.   Should this route not be available then
evacuation onto the pitch is possible subject to persons having the
ability to climb over the front wall on to the pitch perimeter track.
This wall is approximately 1.5 m high at the Spion Kop end decreasing
to 1 m high at the West end.

FIRE ALARM

West Stand




North Stand

As West Stand above.
S o u th S ta n d

This stand appears to be well covered with regard to the provision and siting
of call points.

Indicator Control Panel

The indicator/control panel is situated within the Police control centre
between South and West Stand.    Whilst this is reasonable for match days it
is not considered to be practical for the majority of the time.

This panel should be duplicated with control at each location which should
be: -

1.      Police control box

2.      Main office reception area

FIRST AID AND FIRE-FIGHTING EQUIPMENT

The current standard and displacement of First Aid fire-fighting equipment
is considered satisfactory.

GATES

The sliding gates already in situ in the ground have been accepted by this
Authority after due consideration and account being taken both of their location
and the fact that they are of existing construction.     I would wish, however,
to point out that it is the view of this Authority that doors required for
means of escape should open outwards and it is recommended that notice be
given to the Club to the effect that when any such sliding gates are to be
replaced then their replacements must open outwards even if this involves
structural work to recess the opening to avoid impinging over footpaths.
While the sliding gates remain in use however, they must be immediately avail­
able for use from the inside by any person should an emergency situation
arise. Any method of securing the gates against illegal entry from the outside
must be by way of a simply operated device not requiring the use of a key,
additional security being afforded by the presence of a steward who should
be familiar with the emergency evacuation procedures for the ground.

If there are any queries on these matters please do not hesitate to contact
the Officer concerned.

Yours faithfully,________

The Secretary,
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club FLC,
Hillsborough,
SHEFFIELD.
S6 LSW

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sport* Grounds Act 1973 - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

le November 1986 1 asked both the Police and Fire Service to conent on the
condition of your stadiua having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act. I
have also asked the Building Surveyor to sake similar conents but I have not
received thea as yet.

The Police have indicated that as at 6 th January, 1987 they are quite satisfied
with the stadiua and have indicated that the degree of co-operation which they
receive is very satisfactory.

The Fire Service have, however, made a number of comments and I attach for your
information a copy of their letter to me of 18th February. Some points in the
letter have now been further clarified as follows:-

(a) The timber buildings referred to should (if still required) be re-sited away
from the walkways.

(b) As far as the locked doors in the south stand are concerned they        will be
dealt with by the Fire Service under the Fire Certificate.

(c) Gates must be unlocked and stevarded at all times, during matches: if this
cannot be arranged, panic fastenings would probably be insisted upon.

1 think the rest of the letter is largely self-explanatory but I would
particularly like to refer to the comments which are made in respect of final
exit gates. As you can aee from the letter the Fire Service are concerned about
the sliding gates and have indicated that as and when they reach the end of
their useful life they must be replaced with outward opening doors. The Fire
Service have also produced a drawing (a copy of which 1 enclose) toshow  a
better arrangement for securing the sliding gates against forced entry from the
outside during the course of the game. The Fire Service feel that this hook
type arrangement will be more easily used in the event of an emergency than the
current locks, about which they are very concerned.

Encs.

                 Means of Escape in Case of Fire

                 North Stand

                           With the exception of a small hut and the steel
                     clad groundsman's accommodation, which are both
                     located under the ramp and not the stand, the timber
                     clad buildings have been removed.
                           We believe that the reference in the minutes
                     dated 7 August, 1985 was to storage facilities and
                     not to buildings.

                     Spion Kop

                     a)    The small timber programme kiosk will be

     removed so that the width of the exit route is not
     reduced.
     b)   This item has already been dealt with in our
     letter dated 15 January.
     c)   Some of the concrete terrace steps have been
     repaired but, as has always been accepted, the
     repairs will continue to be a regular maintenance
     job.
     d)   The intention of the mesh was not to prevent
     people from climbing onto the steelwork bi|t to act
     as a guard preventing spectators damaging and
    possibly loosening the rear sheeting.
          We disagree that spectators climb onto the
     steelwork in large numbers although we do not deny
    that the police have, at some matches, had to tell
    a few spectators not to sit on the steelwork.
          The cost of erecting a full height fence
    would be several thousands of pounds.     The Club is
    not at present contemplating that magnitude of
    expenditure just to protect a few spectators from
    their own foolish behaviour.
    e)    There are four or five lengths of barrier
    where the drop in front is just over one metre,
    but as far as we are aware this has not created
    any hazard.    In fact to the contrary, because
    people can leave the ground by going under the
    barriers onto the lateral gangway.    This is a
    common feature of most league grounds.
          The welding is performing well and it seems
    that any additional vertical support is
    unnecessary.   However, the welding can be inspected
    at regular intervals to make sure that it con­
    tinues to hold the mesh securely.

     f)    Exit gates are unlocked before spectators enter
     the ground.     The keys then remain in the possession
     of the steward(s), given the responsibility of
     unlocking the gates, until after the end of the
     match and all spectators have left the ground.

     West Stand

     a)   Do we understand correctly that the
     reference to 'timber framed and clad units'       is to
     the bar fittings at first floor level?        if so, then
     those fittings were part of the original construction
     for which Building Regulations Approval has been
     granted.     There has not been any previous comment
     about the presence of the bar fittings in that stand
     or other stands.     We do not consider that they
     present a hazard.
     b)   This item has already been dealt with in our
     letter dated 15 January.

     South Stand

     a)    (i)    We note the comment about the doors and
     this point has been dealt with under the regular
     procedures of obtaining a Fire Certificate under
     the Fire Precautions Act of 19 71 for the offices.
     Fire Officer Roger Woodhouse has been dealing with
      the matter.
          (ii)         We see the principle behind the creation
      of fire compartments.    That is sensible.     Sealing
      off the windows is not difficult but the provision
      of ducting to the south wall is, and furthermore
      very expensive.    A major exercise such as providing
      ducting would by necessity have to wait until the
      redevelopment of the South stand in 1991.
EASTWOOD ft PARTNERS
                                                                SHEET




           (iii)    We agree that stored materials should be
     removed from stairways and exit routes.       There is a
     particular problem outside the kitchen area, at
     ground floor level, but the caterers have been asked
     to clear that particular area well before the public
     are admitted on match days.
    b)       (i)    It was agreed in 1979 that the fans
    ventilating the lounges at first floor level should
    be fitted with intumescent grilles with smoke
    controlled shutters.       Those grilles and ihutters
    were fitted although we see that two recently
    installed fans do not appear to have similar grilles
    and shutters.       As the form of fire protection from
    those lounges has already been agreed with the Fire
    Service,the Club are not prepared to have ducting
    installed, although the new fans should perhaps be
    fitted with intumescent grilles and smoke controlled
    shutters.
                   A close inspection of the gas supply pipe­
    work in the five bars revealed that four bars have
    valves fitted to the feed pipe or to the appliance
    when there is only one appliance in the bar.          The
    pipework in the bar nearest to the Spion Kop has
    been replaced recently but without a valve.
                   However, there is a master valve, at
    ground floor level, which isolates the gas supply
    to the whole of the first floor.      That valve was
    installed at the request of the Fire Service in
    1980.
         (iii)        We confirm that all the timber facing onto
   the public circulation areas was treated with an
    intumescent paint during the work carried out in
   1980.     Since then the walls have been re-decorated
EASTWOOD f t PARTNERS                                         SHEET




     but this does not reduce the effect of the
     intumescent paint underneath.
             (iv)        We cannot understand this comment because
     the paint store was constructed in its present
     position on the advice of the Fire Officer.          A
     special 'non-sparking'      light fitting was even
     installed on his recommendation.       It is not contem­
     plated to move the store again after spending money
     to build the store in its present position.
             (v)    We do not consider that the twoflaminate
     covered toilet kiosks present a hazard.       As for the
     wooden cupboards, they have been on the first floor
     for many years and no previous adverse comments
     have been made by the Fire Service about their
     presence.
            (vi)    we agree that the holes round the cables
     should be plugged with an appropriate fire resisting
     material.
           (vii)    As far as we are aware all doors leading
     onto the first floor and ground floor circulation
     areas were provided with 25mm rebates and the doors
     made up to a nominal one hour standard.       That work
    was done in 1979-80.
          (viii)    We agree that the spaces above toilet
     accommodates should not be used for storage but
    believe that the Club have now removed the stored
    materials.

     c)     We believe that clinbing over the existing low
    wall does not present any difficulty in the event
    of an emergency.       Spectators will go over the wall
    whether there are gates or not.       We do not consider
    that the installation of gates is necessary.

    a)     Escape through the rear of the stand has always
    been accepted by the officer Working Party.     Further-
    more, it has been readily accepted with the
    protection which has been provided so far to the
    escape routes.


    Automatic Fire Protection

          We will suggest to the Club that proposals
    should be put forward for the provision of a fire
    detection system but the system is not likely to be
   installed until the major re-.development of the South
   stand which is planned for 1991

   Emergency Lighting

          Testing of the emergency lighting system is
   being organised and we will be contacting the Fire
   Sfervice in the next day or so to agree a date and
   time for carrying out the test.
         The testing of the general electrical circuits
   will also be organised over the next few weeks and
   a current IEE Certificate produced.
   Fire Alarms

         The Club was told by the Fire Service to put
  the call points in the bars in the stands.   Moving
  the call points again is out of the question.

  Inidcator/Control Panel

         The Officer Working Party was asked, at the
  time of installation, where the indicator/central
  panel should be placed.    The Club was told that it
  should be located in the Police control centre,
  where it is now.    No duplicate panel was asked for
  and it is not considered that one is necessary.

     Gates
             The comments about the gates are noted.


     The Club have expressed to us their increasing con­
cern that with the introduction of each new member of the
Fire Service to the Officer Working Party new or
different recommendations are put forward by that officer,
which in some cases openly contradict the recommendations
offered by his predecessors.     Whereas we agree that   many
of the observations and recommendations are of a
subjective nature the Club cannot be expected to continue
spending money on matters which are purely a matter of
psrsonal opinion.     Some consistency in the comments
offered by members of the Officer Working Party would be
appreciated.




                                           Yours sincerely,

For the attention of Mr. D. Bownes



Dear Sirs,-

SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB -
SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUND ACT

Following the inspection at the above sports ground on 19th May 1988, the following
items are forwarded for your attention.

Spion Kop

Rubbish is accumulating under the new structure and requires removing.

South Stand

a)        The extractor fan from the laundry has an accumulation of fluff and requires
          cleaning.

b)        The new Sponsors Lounge on the first floor has been fitted with an extractor
          fan that breeches the fire resisting wall. At the time of the inspection it
          could not be determined whether it is fitted with an automatic heater detector
          operated shutter or not. If not, some such device will be required.

West Stand

There were only two small EXIT signs situated above the exits from the covered
walkway which could not be seen from the extremities of the walkway. As this
stand is used by visiting fauns it is recommended that larger signs be fixed,
in a more prominent position.




                                                                     m

Fire Safety

It is recommended where gas cookers are used in the snack bars that a fire blanket
be provided.

Should you require any further information concerning these matters, please do not
hesitate to contact me.

Ypurs faithfully

          THE SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

          ANNUAL INSPECTION OF SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB
          ON THE 19th MAY, 1988

          I write with reference to the above and following our recent site meeting
          and safety inspection of the named premises.

          I would confirm that while the general standards of health and safety
          being maintained were found to be satisfactory a number of points did
          require attention. I have itemised these below for your convenience.

          Spion Kop Development

          1.   The pylon situated to the left-hand side of the kop was not suitably
               protected from unauthorised access and climbing.

          2.   To- several locations around the kop, accumulations of associated
               builders wastes and stonework that could easily be obtained for use as
               projectiles were noted.

          3.   At some positions within the new development, there is a difference in
               height between a terraced area and radial gangway of over 600mm. I
               would advise that these areas be protected by a suitably constructed
               pedestrian guardrail.

          4. An area of stair nosing was found to have become defective upon the
              "new" part of the spion kop and a similar defect was located upon the
              older radial gangway.

          5.   Some areas of the front terracing were found to be in need of minor
               repairs.

          6.   A loose rainwater pipe and length of guttering were located to one of
               the Penistone Road turnstiles.

          7.   An area of glazing serving one of the Penistone Road turnstile huts
               has been broken.

          8. The club might consider the now combustible nature of much of the
              vegetationsituated immediately behind the spion kop and take the
              appropriate remedial action.

          9.   The rendering to the entrance gate side wall was still found to be in
               a loose and defective condition.

          West Stand

          1.   In a number of cases terrace nosings require to be repaired.


                                                                   /Contd....

                                      -2-


2.   A number of seats were defective and require to be renewed or
     repaired.

3.   To the left-hand side of the stand, some pieces of old barbed wire
     were found to project over a walkway at head height.

 I.     Purpose of Meeting

 The original Intention of the visit had been to check that the outstanding matters
 referred to In the Note of the meeting held on 12th November had been completed
 or were In the course of completion prior to the anticipated issue of the Certificate
 by the County Council this week.

 2.     Minor Matters

 An Inspection of the ground showed that a number of minor matters still required
 attention, but the Club undertook to ensure that these were attended to in the next
 few days.

  3.    Major Matters

  A.    Emergency Lighting - South Stand

  The meetings which had taken place between the County Fire Service and Messrs.
  Eastwood and Partners since 12th November on the South Stand Emergency Lighting
  had produced agreement on an interim arrangemeit which would be regarded as


                                        . 0 ®
                                                                                          \
acceptable for the duration of the existing battery Ufe. Further modifications at
that time would remedy the shortcom ings of the existing installation. Details were
contained in the letter dated 12th December which Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
had addressed to the Fire Service.

B.     South Stand Construction

The Building Authority expressed concern as to what they saw as a lack of structural
Integrity in the South Stand. In their opinion, corrosion was contributing to the
progressive deterioration of the Stand which, It was felt, could only be properly
determined by a full structural survey. The report forwarded by Messrs. Eastwood
and Partners In the last week was not considered to be sufficiently comprehensive
to provide tte required information, and the basis of calculation used could not be
agreed as appropriate. Whilst Itwas agreed that there had not been *                      {
written request for such a full structural survey of the South Stand, ttei Building
Authority felt that Ithad been inherent in the detailed discussions which had taken
place that such a report would be forthcoming. The Building Authority were
 concerned at the possibility that the requirements of the Building Relations and
 the Code of Practice Safety Factors could not be met; In particular the Structural
 stability of the South Stand in conditions of gale force winds and heavy snowfall
 was mentioned.
 For the Club, Dr. Eastwood agreed that the Stand would obviously not be built to the
 same specification or the sans construction standards nowadays, but pointed out
 Lt, for Instance, none of the buildings in Sheffield built before 1970 could meet
 the latest wind pressure requirements. Even the Building Besearch Statiwi was n
 evidently thinking in terms that these requirements were unrealistically high. In
 his professional opinion, the Stand was structurally safe and able in practice to meet
 the loadings demanded. In any case, the conditions which had been described as
 being possibly dangerous would mean In practice that a match could not be played
 and consequently no spectators would be present.

  Experience of the corrosion of Indoors steel in the Sheffield area showed this to be
  minimal, and the Stand was regularly test loaded by spectators. Structures sue
  as this would show obvious external signs, such as cracks, well before there was
  any possibility of collapse, and would be readily apparent on even a superficial
  visual inspection. Even though he did not consider It essential, plafng of the
  front steel columns had been carried out as a compromise to try and meet the
   Building Authority’s concern.  H e  agreed there might well be a continuing        .
  maintenance problem with to stand, but this was a different matter to saying there
   was a structural problem. Beference was maide to the Guide’s advice that when
   assessing whether existing situations provided adequately for the safety of spectators,
   the criterion to be used Is that of a reasonable degree of safety. In Dr. Eastwood s
   view It would be unreasonable and unnecessary to Insist on a foil structural survey
   of the South Stand or to delay the Issue of the Certificate. It was his professional
   opinion (which he was most jealous of and would not put In jeopardy) that the Smth
    Stand was structurally safe and that the basis of the calculations provided was
    appropriate. He was prepared to advise the Club to use the appeal procedure open
    to them should this be necessary.



                                         SBCUD
IT WAS AGEEED that:

      as there was no obvious deterioration In the South Stand structure of such
      a nature as to be of Immediate concern, no objection wculd be raised to the
      continuance of the derby game with Sheffield United on Boxing Day morning
      provided that no extreme weather conditions occurred Inthe intervening
      period, and

(b)    a furfcermeeting should be held as a matter of urgency between the Building
       Authority and Dr. W. Eastwood to discuss tie structural Integrity of the
      South Stand and the appropriateness of the calculations used (Mr. D. Vaughan
      to be present at Dr. Eastwood’s request).

NOTE As the discussions on the South Stand Construction hinged on structural
     theories and practices, the Fire Service and Police representatives felt
     there was little they could contribute and left the meeting prior to its
     termination.

           Purpose of Meeting
m view of the F A. Cup Semi-Final at Hillsborough on 12th April and following recent
Ssttsbyt^dl.cVpU«S represented on the Working Party, the Chief Executive of the
South Yorkshire County Council had raised with the Club by letter dated 31st March various
matters which apparently were still outstanding.

 A letter of reply dated 3rd April had b e e n received from the Club, as well as letters dated
 4th and 8th April from the Club’s Consultants, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners, giving
 details of the present position.

> 2 ._____ Inspection of Ground
 The Working Party inspected the ground in company with the Club's representatives.

    (i)    Training of Safety Stewards

           The Club had felt there was little point in pursuing the training of the Safety
           Stewards until the fire warning system had been completely installed, but wi h
           agreement the County Fire Service had instructed some stewards yesterday.
           A schedule specifying the duties and responsibilities was handed to the Club s
           representatives.

    (ii)    Exit Signs
            The Club's representatives felt that the exit signs generally had been sited where
            required and were of adequate size and/or illuminated.

            B was agreed that there were a number which could be more advantageously sited
            and/or illuminated, and some which might be more effective with larger lettering
and/or direction arrows. The County Fire Service undertook to liaise with
Messrs. Eastwood and Partners.

Emergency Lighting in the South Stand

As was evident, complete re-wiring of the South Stand with separate circuits had
already commenced, and the County Fire Service undertook to let Messrs. Eastwood
and Partners know their detailed requirements.

Fire Warning System
The Fire Warning System had been installed, except for the trickle charger and
battery equipment. These items had been subject to delivery problems, but the
system should be complete by the end of the month.

It was agreed that as regards the F.A. Cop Semi-Final, the Police Communications               .
base which would be at the ground would also be used for Fire Service purposes if
necessary.             *                                          *

Sealing of Fire Resisting Frames

The sealing of the fire resisting door frames against the supporting walls had generally
been carried out, but there were a small number which were now showing signs of
small gaps.

 Fire Retardent Paint

 The Club pointed out that "Nullifire" fire retardent paint had been specified on the
 partitions within the South Stand but, as the Contractors were on holiday until
 14th April, it was .not possible to say with certainty at this time whether it had actually
 been used.

 Wired Glass
 The Club pointed out that to the best of their knowledge wired glass had been used
 wherever required by the County Fire Service.

 The County Fire Service and the Police were generally satisfied that the small panes
 of glass in the upper half of the wooden partitions within the South Stand would not in
 normal circumstances be regarded as a fire and/or safety hazard. The Club agreed in
 the longer term to consider the fitting of wired glass and, in the short term, to
 consider fitting wooden battons as an interim measure.

  Sharp Edges to Steelwork on South-West Stand

  Whilst there were a number of sharp corners on the supports, these were at a height
  of at least seven feet. However, the Club undertook to round them off.

  Perimeter Fencing on the Spion Kop

  The Club pointed out that this had been tested where feasible and the results forwarded
  to the Chief Executive in January. A copy had been passed to the Building Authoiity on
  30th January.
P o ssib le Step Obstruction on Upper Exit Area on Spion Kon

Whilst it was agreed that the erection of the barriers at the Upper Exit Area had left
a small adjacent area of approximately one foot wide by four foot long at a lower level
     t^.retm a m f r lhe                 telt that its position coupied with the crowd
flow at that point meant that it did not unduly create an hazard. However the Club
undertook to give attention to it in the longer term.                          ’

Mesh Fencing under North Stand

               n°rmal Cr°7d n °W rat6S 0n the      lic side the mesh fencing and the
fact that there was no public access to its rear, it was felt that the timber framed
mesh fencing under the North Stand providing security to storage areas was acceptable

     Dear Graham,

     SAFETY IN SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 - PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM

     You will be aware of the shortcomings in the public address system installed
     at Hillsborough, which were highlighted at the trial of emergency evacuation
     procedures which took place during operational conditions on 14 November 1987.
     The emergency evacuation instructions proved to be inaudible in the concourses
     at the rear of the Stand, at the rear of the Spion Kop, and in the club reception
     and office areas. Plainly, this situation detracts from the overall safety of
     the ground and there is a pressing need for the deficiencies to be remedied as
     soon as possible.

     You will know at the meeting which took place                                                on Thursday 26 November 1987,
     which was attended by your- contractors Messrs                                               D P Sounds Ltd, that it will be
     necessary to substantially upgrade the public                                                address system. I would be
     grateful therefore, if you could proceed with                                                this work and notify me when
     this Has been cocrpleted.

      I am copying this letter to Mr David Bownes of the Sheffield District Council
      Admin and Legal Department.

                                     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
                 Annual Inspection of Hillsborough Stadium as required
                                         by the Certificate of Ground Safety



                  On 18 July 1988, I made an inspection of the ground
during the time that this year's quota of crush barriers
were being tested by my firm.
                  The results of the crush barrier testing are given
in a separate report of today's date.
                     I made a visual inspection of all the main structural
features of the ground.                                                                Particular attention was paid to
gates and entry and exit routes and to boundary walls and
fences.                           No significant defects were noted.
                  The roof of the South stand was inspected from the ground.
Ko deterioration in its condition was observed.
                     I certify that in my opinion the various structures on
the ground are in a satisfactory condition and appropriate for
the stadium to be used to the full capacity as laid down in
the Certificate of Ground Safety.

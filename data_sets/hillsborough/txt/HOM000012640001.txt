TAYLOR REFORT - POLICE ISSUES

1. Your note of 9 February asks for comments on a draft
letter for Mr Boys Smith’s signature. My concern is with
Recommendation 52, which calls for a specific training course
for senior officers, including training in the basic strategy
of policing football matches.
2. The Police Staff College has included in its 1990
programme two courses on "The Management of Disaster and Civil
Emergency". These courses have been set up in response to
recent major disasters, including Hillsborough, and indicate
an increased awareness of the need for best practice to be
shared and for appropriate police personnel to receive common
training in the handling of civil emergencies.

3 . One course is for officers of ACPO rank, the other for
senior policemen likely to have responsibility for the co­
ordination and management of major incidents, particularly as
"incident officer", "senior investigating officer", "incident
control post co-ordinator", or "major incident control room
co-ordinator". It is intended that both courses will run in
June 1990. In addition, it is hoped to hold a number of
conferences at the College during 1990, one of which will have
as its theme the operational management of football matches.
4 . Against this background, you may wish to add the following
at the end of your proposed response on paragraph 52:-

     "I understand also that the Police Staff College at
     Bramshill is planning to run two carousel courses and a
     conference on this subject during 1990."

                         of
LIVERPOOL       IwiLL SAY AS FOLLOWS



I am writing this a c ou pl e of hours after be in g released

from the Nort her n Ge neral Hospital in S he f f i e l d following

the tragic events of the Liverpool v. Forest Football Match

and I would like to tell you about the events            leading up to

me being in hos pit al and also to get this          terrify ing experien ce

off my chest.



I arrived at the g r o u n d be tween 2.40/2.50      to find a bottle

neck of people trying to get in the match.

As I was st anding in the qu eue of people h e a d i n g towards          the

turnstile the mas si ve poli ce horses and the officers on them

were getting u n e a s y by the size of the cr owd gat h er in g around

them.

People started to push forward to avoid the fr igh te ni ng horses,

I slipped around the back of the horses in a panic               to g et away

from them.

I forced myself aroun d       the back of the crowd and to the s i d e s .

I was swamped by the crow d towards          the turnstiles,     you could

feel the crush,    you co ul d hear people scr e am in g out      then.

As I was near the turnstile           there was a ma ssive surge forward

and people we re g e t ti ng seriously c r u s h e d ,everyone was screaming

for the gates    to be opened,        it was ge tting serious.

Luckily, someone help ed me into the turnstile but I was still

getting crushed in there.

I struggled through and jumped over the turnstile,               once inside

people including myself were screaming at the police to open

                                  -   1-

them fatal gates b e c a u s e of the danger outside.

People were g e t ti ng st uck at the turnstile by the pure volume

of people there whi ch was dela yin g peopl e ge tti ng in.

I and others    tried to help them over,         the polic e w er e u n c er ta in

what to do but    th an kfu ll y   (I thought)   they did open the gates.

As I turned to go i n si de the gr ou nd there was only one obv ious

entrance I coul d see.

There were no ste war ds or police to direct us            to the flanks

or other parts of the gr ou nd so we all h e ad ed to the section

behind the goal.

I thought it was     like Anfield wh ere when you arri ve on the

Terraces you fan out,       there was no di re cti on     to the flanks.

It was i mm ed iat ely obv iou s   that this se ction was full,        pa ck e d

to the brim.

I couldn't turn back bec au se of the people behind.

I was forced to the left hand corner of the section,                it was

too packed,    it was n' t comfor tab le and I felt then that I w a n t e d

to get out.

Apparently the game had kicked off and caused a further sur ge

forward,   I avo id ed the barriers and was pu sh e d further fo rward

towards the fence.

The crowd had sto pp ed moving forward but the surge of' pr es su re

had not.

I was get ting cr us he d and there was no let up from behind.

It was get ting much harder to breath.

I was wai ting for it to ease up but it never.

People started to panic and tried to get out.

There was yet an oth er massive surge, popping the air out

of my body.
                                    -2-

The pressure on my b ack was forcing my            throat onto       the

person in front of me,        into his elbow.

I couldn't move,      not a single part of my body.

I tried to call out but couldn't.

I couldn't breath,      it felt like a bench vice t ig ht en ing up

slowly,   it must have be en su st a in ed for at least 5 minutes.

I was so cr ushed ag ai ns t oth er people I could not get ano ther

breath.

I felt my life o oz in g out of me.

I honestly felt I was        dying.

There was no physical pain,           not until much later.

I felt light hea d ed and very sleepy,         I   w an te d to go    asleep

as if I was going to bed,        my eyes were      heavy and I       started

to close them,      it was   like going into a dream.

My body was get t in g p us he d and forced to the left and my

head to the right,      still un abl e to move.

My hands were cru sh ed against my chest but they w e r e useless.

I couldn't even      get the man's elbow out of my throat.

I thought   "This    is it - I'm going to die".

A friend of mine had seen my predicament and so me ho w got

the man's elbow off my throat,           he said later that I was          turning

blue.

My face was forced into        the back of someone's       PVC jacket.

I was suffocating,      f ri gh te ned and scared.

The shock of s u f f o c at in g brought me out of my sl eep y state

and I strugg led     to get free.

I was pushed to      the gr ou nd next    to the railings wh er e by a

miracle there was air.

As I was violently g e t t i n g my breath back there w e r e peopl e
C o n t .........

standing all over each other,          to get over the railings.

People stood on me as if I was a spr in g bo ar d to safety.

It was sheer panic.

I was scared that I w o u l d n ' t get up.

I just grabbed hold of someone's          leg as he was go in g over the

railings which pu lle d me off the ground and t h e n ,thank God,

I was helped over the railings.

I was in shock and trying to recover.

I looked up to see a man i mpa led on .the spikes,         a man was trying

to push him back,      out of pure instinct I h el ped him push him

back and over the ra ilings       to safety.

I turned to go out of      the tiny doors.

There was a man in a red jumper on top of the railings

trying to pull pe opl e out,      I jumped up there with him dra ggi ng

people over the rai lin gs    anyway I could.

I could see all these p eo pl e crushed and scr ea mi ng for help.

It seemed like hund re ds of hands waving in the air for help

reaching out hopi ng you wo u ld get their hands,         it was   terrible.

I .remember ge tting    7 or 8 out with this other man.

We pulled a girl out,      she must have been 16 or 1 7 she was crying

and white as a sheet,      but you could see others who we ren't

so lucky,     they looked dead,    I think.

I felt so weak,     as if I was n' t    trying hard enough.

I just collapsed with exhaustion,          the next thing I was on the

pitch and helped to bre a th no rmally again.

I could see next to me 2 policemen          trying f ra nti ca lly to

revive a man, he was b l u e in the face and so white,          his

eyes grey and glassy,      they we re pumping his chest and giving

him the kiss of life,      for a brief moment it looked as if they

had saved him but he sli pp ed away,        God they tried,I    just wept

     unc on tr ol la bl y as   they put a coat over his face.

     I looked up to see p eo pl e b ri n g i n g more bodies out of the crowd.

     I was just in total shock.

     I was helpe d to the side lines.

     I wa nd ere d the pitch in a daze.

     Some fans c o m fo rt ed me and sat me down again.

     Opposite me w ere some of the bodies.

     Then I re member be in g rushed to hospital with chest and

     breathing problems but I felt no great pain just in shock

     and crying,        crying b e c au se of the dead or for the fact I was

     alive after bein g so close to death.

     The staff at the hosp ita l w er e abs olu tel y fantastic,               they

     never let you stay on your own for long.

     5 or 6 different doctors ch ec ki ng on you every 2 minutes.

     Then the full scale of the ho rr o r was unfolding,                 50,60,70

     dead.

     I just couldn't b e l i e v e it.

     My heart sank at the disbel ief of it all.

     The wards were packed,         people screaming,       h y s t e r i c a l ,others

     being revived,        it was   terrible,   a horror,    a ni ght ma re come

     true.

     It's a day I'll never forget for the rest of my life.

     Then the news of a boy of 18 years Gary Jones who was in

     our mini bus party - he was missing,            later to be co nf irm ed dead.

     Friends of mine who one minute were over the moon to find out

     I was okay,        all h o pi ng Gary w o u l d be somewhere and okay aswell,

     were suddenly d e v a s ta te d by the news,d um b founded.

     They were bla mi ng each other,        looking for a reason for this

     nightmare,     Why? How? questions must be asked about the w h o l e

     operation of the pol i ce and Sheffi el d Wednesday FC and their stewards.
C o n t ........



We we re   trapped in cages li ke animals and God knows how many

died in them, w ha t a way to die,     nobody deserves   that surely

to God?     Who do you blame,    I've read the papers,   seen   the TV

and it kills me.     I do n't care who they bl ame just as long as

it never happens again,     lessons must be learnt so they didn't

die in vain.



My heart goes out to the family and friends of the b e r e a v e d

and the friend I lost and may God go with them.          I thank God

today that I was one of the very,       very lucky survivors,     but

I'll never forget wha t ha pp en ed yesterday,    not ever.     April

15th will stay in my min d and in thousands of others for the

rest of my precious days.        I hope this scar never re-opens.



I MAKE THIS STA T EM EN T K N O WI NG THE SAME TO BE TRUE.

DATED THIS 16TH DAY OF AP R IL 1989.

We spoke today about Mr Kelly's kind invitation to Lord Justice
Taylor and guest to attend the 1989 F A Cup Final Tie.

I mentioned to you that Lord Justice Taylor was extremely
grateful to Mr Kelly and the Association for this kind
invitation.  He felt, however, that in present circumstances,
when his Inquiry into the Hillsborough tragedy is in progress, it
would be inappropriate for him to accept this invitation.

He would, nevertheless, like to have the opportunity to attend
the Cup Final other than as a guest of the Association, if his
other commitments on 20 May allow. You therefore kindly agreed
to send me two tickets at £32 each, which I will reimburse from
the Inquiry's funds. You also kindly agreed to make arrangements
for a car parking pass.                  N/

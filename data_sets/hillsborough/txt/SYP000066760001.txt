                      etc a nd from the w i n d o w             I can clearly see what was                       happening.              T he re

                     was at this        time    large          groups    of L iv e rp o ol         fans    going         into t h e ______

                      s h op and just        hanging       about       none of w h o m a p p e a r e d         to be       inra ny h urry

                      to get     to the ground.                I saw also fans              go    into the                          ■flub*    and

                      some   of them were        s inging w h e n they                later       came out.

                      In my o p i n i o n a l t h o u g h most         of them a p p e a r e d        to have been drinking,

none of them were                   drunk a nd e ve r y b o d y a p p e a r e d to be                  in a h appy frame

of     mind.

T h e r e was one            incident       in particular               that     I can remember at about a

q u arter       to three        (1445)          I was    in my back            g a rd e n w h e n      I n o ti c e d two

cars a rrive            in                                   B ot h     cars were         full and         I would

e s t i ma te     the ages          of the       people       inside the           cars was         b et we en 2 5 - 30

years.          The driver           of    the blue          car      w ho's r e g i s t r a t i o n    number    or make

I can't         remember        p arked very            close         to my gates          making it very a w k w a r d

for me to get out.                        I spoke to the driver who                      I w o u l d d es c ri b e as

being aged about 25                       - 30 years,          clean s h av e n and was w e ar i n g a dark,

c o l o ur ed suit.            The       driver    readily a g r e e d           to move        his     car a n d s t at e d

that he w o u l d be o nly                 their about an hour and a                         half,      from this        I

assumed         that     he was           a football         s up porter.           A t bo ut 5 - 6         people got

out    of the       car and that was                   the    last      I saw of them until                 a short

w h il e    later.

At about          half       past    three       one of the g roup               from the         car a r r i v e d back at

my house          crying.           He    s tated that         there        had been a tragic a c c i d en t and

that       there were          bodies       lying about               everywhe re . He told me that                 he

would       never       go to a n o t h e r       football            match again          and he told me that he

w o u l d stop      inside          the    car w hile         he w a i t e d for         the driver         to    return.        I

asked       him    in for a drink                of tea but he r ef us ed and                     I saw him go the

the    s econd of the two                  cars.

It must         have     been about             four    o'clock         before       the next          lot a r r i v e d there

w o u l d be about 8 - 9 of them and                           I i nv it ed        into my house and gave                    them

a drink of tea.                 T he y     told me what            had h a p p e ne d a nd at             the same       time

the news          flash       came on the TV a n d they all                        sat    in the        lounge w a t c h in g

it.        During       the next          hour,    most       of them used our                phone       to ring    home

assuring          the    people at the other end that                            they were alright.                 All

the    people       that used             the    phone       left the m o n ey for the                  calls a nd all          of

 them were          very       polite a nd very upset.                        I saw the s ec on d           car    leave

         «    tog et he r w it h the y o u t h who        had first      come     into our         house a n d       the

             ,group who had been w a t c h i n g          the TV went        o ut si de a nd s ee me d to            be

              w ai t i n g about for the driver            of the blue         car.        They    were all

              eventually           picked up by a mini         bus and t ak en home.

              The      blue   car    r emained    in the street        until      the f ollowing         day.        At a bout

              12.30 pm        (1430)    two    people a r r i v e d they w er e a ge d a bout             f orty years

              and from the a p p e a r a n c e        of one of them he a p p e a r e d            to be the     father of

              the driver.            I spoke     to them a sking       them     in general          how his son was.

              The man told me that               he had been k il le d thats all                  he said a nd he was

              v ery upset.          W he n they got       into the     car,     they found also that                 the

              radio      had been s t o l e n but       I don't    think      they    repo rt ed the m a tt e r to

              the      police.

              The      f ollowing     Saturday     two of the       lads    bought         some    flowers    for myse lf

              a nd wife       thanking     us for all       the help that we had given them,                         also

              five      or six more t ur ne d up that           day    carrying        bags       of g ro ce ri es    and

              they th an ke d us for all              the help and kind ne ss              that we had s ho wn them.

              My w ife w a n t e d their         names and a d dr es s      but    nobo dy w o u ld give         them to

              us.       The   reason we w a n t e d this       i n f o r m a t i o n was    to w rite a letter             of

              thanks      to their      families.

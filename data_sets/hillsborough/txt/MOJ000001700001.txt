Dear Ms Adltngton

Adlingion -v- Duckenfield and Murray

Further to the attendance before Mr Cadbury SM in Leeds on Monday we have been asked
by Counsel to raise the following matters:

Firstly, in regard to an application for leave to move for judicial review, we have noted the
request made in your letter of 18 December, to be given notice; in regard to an application,
which was echoed again by Mr Jones QC in Court. We are content to give an undertaking
to tell the Divisional Court upon making that application that you have asked to be heard on
the issue. We arc bound to say, however, that we do not accept that you have any right to
be heard and are content to leave the matter for the Court. It is our understanding that it is
likely such an application will not be determined on the papers but will require an oral
application.

Secondly, we have noted that on several occasions Mr Jones has indicated the possibility
that should a committal hearing take place, it is possible that witnesses may be called
without written statements having been served in advance. Accordingly we give notice that
if any such witnesses are to be called, we be given the names and addresses of those
witnesses in advance, otherwise it may be necessary to seek an adjournment from the Court
in regard to the evidence so given, to allow for proper consideration of that evidence and
any appropriate cross-examination to take place.

Thirdly, in regard to voluntary disclosure either from the CPS or the DPP, we would be
grateful if you could make available copies of all correspondence in regard to this matter.
As you will appreciate we are not directly involved in resolving this question.

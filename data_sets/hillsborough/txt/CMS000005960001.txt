NATIONAL PLAN FOR STADIA: THE TAYLOR REPORT


You wrote to Roger Miles on 24 October about the invitation made
by the FA to attend an all-day presentation of their National
Plan for Stadia on 26 November.   As Roger is absent on leave I
am replying.

I certainly wish to attend this presentation and, as Roger's
diary presently shows him to be free on the 26th I shall commit
him also. However, as he has other responsibilities he may haver
to reconsider his position or, like you, review the all-day
commitment but I hope we shall both be there for the full show.
We look forward to receiving a copy of Tony Baden's preliminary
list of points in due course.

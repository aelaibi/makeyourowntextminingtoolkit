HILLSBOROGH - POSSIBLE INTERIM SAFETY MEASURES

Lord Ferrers has seen Mr Watts note of 19 April and has commented:

    "Don't let up panic into taking quick decisions - especially at
    the end of the football season.

    It would be bizarre if we told clubs to remove the barriers
    only to find that Lord Justice Taylor considered that they
    should be retained."

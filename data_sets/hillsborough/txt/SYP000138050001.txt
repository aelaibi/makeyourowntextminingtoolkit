Dear Mr. Popper.,

I am writing to request that Mr.                                   be   called   to
give evidence to the Hillsborough Inquest.

We feel that          to hear   Mr,                    evidence would be a 'gr
help to us.




Yours sincerely.,



                                              /    i

            around.           T h en a line of         police s^ood             in front           of the N o r t h S t a n d as

            t h o u g h they were           trying      to keep the L iv er p oo l                 fans off the          pitch.

            Obviously          people near           the front who had              r elations           in the      pen m ight

            have gone          on,      I don't      know,    but     I could not see what                    that      line was        for,

            At    first       there didn't           seem to be e nou gh             police         behind that          goal,        but

            then      it was all          hands      to the deck.              I saw an a m b u l a n c e         come onto           the

            p itch and         it s eemed          to take ages        to get       round by the goal.                     T he re

            were      f i re m e n    in the ground,          m ov in g    people        from the S o u t h Stand,

presumably             to get       their    e quip me nt        in.I    think the          incident       took

e v e r yo n e    so m u ch by s u r p ri se           there was         noco-ordination             in the       rescue

from my          point       of view.        P eople      up in the West Stand,                    who   had a better

view than us,                were    screaming         that the         police were not doing                  enough.

By about 3 . 4 5 p m           (1543)       t h e c e nt r e    pens were a lot emptier and you                        could

move about.              A few people w er e still                     s ta n di n g there,     w he t he r     they

expected          the game           to go on or not              I d o n ’t know.           I w a l k e d to the back

of   pen 3 and back                  down the tunnel,                 I saw some             scarves       in the tunnel,

th ought         that    Ihad        pos si bl y seen 2 dead               people            on the      pitch but again

we had not              been i nformed of what was                    going     on.         I just w a n t e d to get

home     now.           As    I came out of the tunnel                   I saw to        my right          that P o li c e

an d A m b u l a n c e m e n were w o r k i n g          on some        injured fans.              One fan was

being held upside                   d own w i t h his head facing                  the floor,        they were

t ry i ng    hard to do some thing                     to him,         I ’m not     into medical           things      but

he was       in s uch a funny               pos it io n        I don't     know what         they were         t rying    to

do to him.             I saw about 2 bodies w i t h their                        faces      covered.          I c o u l d n ’t

r ea ll y    look,       I was       thi nk in g     in my own m in d that               I c o u l d n ’t really

help anyone,             I d i d n ’t want         to be in the way,                I thought        the q ui cker

people got out the                   safer      it w o ul d be.          As    I w a l k e d t hr o ug h the

courtyard,              near to w h e r e the          progr am me       b oo th   is       I saw a w a t c h lying on

the floor.              It was a mans silver                   gate   brac el et watch.             I d i d n ’t notice

the make          of    it.     I just        picked       it up a nd h a nd e d         it strai gh t a w a y to a

woman       police officer.                 She d i d n ’t ask me for any d et ai ls                      or ask me to

s i gn a nything.               She    t ha n k e d me and            I left    the ground.              I d i d n ’t know

what     s h e ’d w i t n e s s e d    in the tunnel              or the g r ou n d that            day,      she may

have     been      in shock.

As   I left the g ro un d t h r o u g h the m a i n blue gates                              some    fans were

sh ou t in g at the            police,        saying      they shou ld have              been      inside the g ro un d

J ag uar.         I pulled him a w a y             saying        he was only m ak in g             things worse.             A

him to get           inside.       It was       like the A la mo          or s o me th in g       like that,           or

something           stronger     probably.           I still     hadn't seen                 or            ,     Iwas

I got a bus           first,     there w ere           no phones to be             got near,      at   the g ro un d

so w h e n     I got     into S h ef fi el d ,         I phoned        home there was            no answer,        so

I phoned the           s i s t e r - i n - l a w and    let her        k n o w I was OK,         to phone my wife

b ef or e     she    put the t elly on to               let her        know I was s h oo k- up but              a lr i gh t

a nd   I was        coming home.           I did feel          shook    up a nd a bit tender

around        the    ribs.      I got on a t rain about                 4. 4 5 p m    (1645)      it s t op p ed

into Pi cadi 1 ly at 6 . 2 0 p m              (1S20).         I phoned home a g a in and the two

lads hadn't           been    in touch.             My m in d was      then w o rk i n g overtime.                I

had a pint and             phoned one of the                 lads' parents and they hadn't

h ea rd a ny th i n g      from them.

It was a bout 7. 4 0 p m            (1940)      before        I heard     that       they were OK.             T he y had

got    into the side            pen str ai gh t         off,    they didn't          go    into the      centre

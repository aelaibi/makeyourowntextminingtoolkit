                near     impossible          task    due    to the sheer           number of    people      there.         At this

problem was          such that "aN^arge mass                   of    people were attem p t i n g             to    reach

the turnstiles.               There was           no   crowd control,            other    than the attempts

pK^evicusly made by the horsemen,                          and      it was      the    case of event u a l l y

climbing          over the t urnstiles                  w hich    I believe was to get out of the

crowd     crush.        It was      so bad,             that it was a great relief to get through

lot of      people milling around.                        There was a large             number of people                but

were able          to move with a certain amount                        of ease,        e specially when

compared with           the      crush outside.

two officers,           I believe         they were         the      rank of       constables,         and

crowd     control       or dir e c t i o n duties at this                  point.        Due to the          crowd

thro u g h the turnstiles,                  I heard a large crowd                 roar,    from w h i c h     I

presumed          it was at or near           K\ck off         point.       The obvious         route to               the

terraces          is through the tunnel                whsLch is       i mmediately recognisable                       when

passing       the turnstiles.                 I made towards the                t u n n e l , together wit h

other     supporters.            Again,      this was          not a severe            crowd of    people,             I was

able    to pass with ease along the tunnel.

put this         time as being about 3,01                    pm    (1501    hrs).



I did not experience                     a crowd surge as           in a normal       crowd surge        forward,

it was more            of a general             forward m o v e m e n t with    little or no backward

movement         to enable a ny b o d y to             regain their         position.

about 134 10 pm <1510 hrs).                       1 cannot        say what    the state       of football

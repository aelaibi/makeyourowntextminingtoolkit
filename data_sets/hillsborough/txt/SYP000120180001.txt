                I am a Police Constable with the South Yorkshire Police Force

                stationed at Heeley Police Station,        Sheffield.

                At 8.30 am on Saturday,      15 April   1989,    I commenced duty at Heeley

                Police Station,      Sheffield.    From there I travelled with other
c/s
                Division crime and vandal officers to Hillsborough football ground

                arriving there at 9.45 am that day.

                At 10.00 am that day we sat in the North Stand and were briefed by

                Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and other senior officers.

                At 10.30 am we obtained our meals and sat in a police transit to

                consume these behind the North Stand.

                At 11.15 am we were on the Leppings Lane terrace as a stand by

                serial.       We remained there until   12 mid-day when we were deployed to

                Penistohe Road.       At this time there were about 6 Liverpool fans in

                the centre enclosure of the Leppings Lane terrace.

                From 12 mid-day until      2.55 pm that day I was stood at a turnstile at

                the North Stand end of Penistone Road turnstiles,             searching and

                checking Nottingham Forest fans who were going onto the Kop.              When I

                arrived at the turnstile it was just opening.            From where I was stood

Liverpool     fans at different times who stated that they had tickets                    j

for the Kop but that they were afraid to go on the Kop and wanted to                      J

go on the Leppings Lane terrace.          I advised them that if they had Kop             j

tickets then t$at was where they had to go but I didT'hot see them      j

and the Forest fans were entrring the ground easily and quickly.                  Therej

were a f^&H^gi^pst fans obviously drunk who were arrested.            As the              j

time approached 3.00 pm (1500) there were small groups of fans who did j

not have tickets and were attempting to Jump the                             1 saw        |

At 2.55 pm (1455)      that day I was called away from the turnstiles

PS 2603 Eddison.       I went together with other officers from our serial

to the gym area of the ground.

We were then told to go as a Unit to the Leppihgs Lane end of the

ground.       As I walked down the side of the pitch the game: had already

started.      As I past the half-way line there were three fans who were

sat in front of the advertising hoardings at the side of the pitch

and I could see fans climbing over the fences from the Leppings Lane

terrace.       I told the three fans to get back behind the advertising

hoardings and then proceeded to the corner of the Leppings Lane stand

and the North Stand where a gate to the terrace was open.             There were          |

fans on the track behind the goal.          I stood at this point with other

officers trying to get the fans J>ack onto the terrace where there was

plenty of space.       I then saw Superintendent Greenwood go onto the pitch

and the game was stopped*       I then walked from the corner of the gound

to the right .h^nd side of the goal.         I went to the gate onto the                  •

terraced and assisted fans through the gate onto the pitch.                  In front

of me I could see PS Payne stood on the fence between the enclosures                    '.-i

pulling people from Pen 3 and out through the gate.             Some of the fans          ;

were shouting that there was someone dead at the front of the terrace, j

1 could see PC Frost and PC Justice on the terrace it appeared that                     )

an officer was giving resuscitation to someone on the floor.                I saw a

fan come up and attempt to kick the o f f i c e r s .     At this time the fence        j

was being pulled in an attempt to break it by rans ana police                           i

officers.      At this time an ambulance came onto the pitch              and behind    !

the goal.      I went up to the rear doors with PC 1141 Smith waited for                I

the d r i ^ r }'t(5 ^unlock them and took out a stretcher from the back.                >

W i t h PC Smith I took it to where the fence had been broken and pulled                !

a large ma>le who appeared dead through the fence and on|b :the                         i

stretcher and then     into the ambulance.      I then assisted in pulling

more fans onto the     pitch.       I then looked round     and saw       bodies laid j

out on the pitch and fans and police officers running up the pitch

with advertising hoardings.          I then helped pull a male person who

appeared dead onto the hoarding and ran            the other fend of the pitch

with him.     He was left outside the gym and then returned to the                      '

Leppings Lane end of the pitch.          There were still lots of fans on the           |

pitch but all the bodies had been t:aken away and all the             advertising       j

hoardings          were dumped in the goalmouth.                                        ,j

A message was given out over the tannoy by Kenny Dalglish and a                          j

further one to say     that the game was abandoned and the fans began to                j

leave the ground.      I remained on thife pitch and joined the rest of my

serial from which I had become separated.          When the ground was empty

we went as a unit out into Leppings Lane.

After a short while we returned to our transit by the            gym from where

we went out on a mobile     public order patrol on Infirmary Road and

Penistone Ro a d /   Then later in the City Centre.        We returned to the

ground at 8.00 pm when we were stood down and went off duty at               ’E ’ DHQ

at 8.30 pm that day.

I was part of serial 21     ’E ’ Division Crime and Vandal      comprising Insp.

                    to assist both the officer on the pitch and the fans.

Dear Mr Church
Inquest into your son’s death
Thank you for your letter of the 7th January 2000 received today.
As you will appreciate, I was not the Coroner at the time of your son’s death so I have no
direct knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the autopsy. However, I note from the
post-mortem report that the pathologist (Dr Slater) listed only a small sample of blood
under the heading “specimens taken” in his report.
I am writing to Dr Slater today to ask for his comments and will let you know his reply as
soon as I receive it.
Yours sincerely

Dear Dr Slater
Gary Church (deceased)
Hillsborough Disaster
I enclose a copy of a letter received today from the deceased’s father.
I note from the autopsy report that under “samples taken” you have listed only a 5ml
sample of blood. Nonetheless, the issue is obviously very sensitive and I would be grateful
if you could let me have a written reply in answer to Mr Church’s letter so that I can
forward a copy to him.
I hope that the move to the Hallamshire has gone well.
Yours sincerely

 Dear Mr Church
 Inquest into your son’s death
 Further to my recent letterl have now received a reply from Dr Slater confirming that the
 only specimen retained at post-mortem was a sample of blood for alcohol analysis. Dr
 Slater confirms that no part or whole organs were retained.
 I hope that this puts your mind at rest on this particular point. If I can assist further please
 do not hesitate to contact me.
 Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Dorries

Re:     Gary CHURCH (deceased)
        Hillsborough Disaster

Thank you for your letter dated the 10th January and the copy letter from Gary’s father (Mr
David Church).

I am able to confirm that in all my autopsies in relation to Hillsborough, the only specimens
retained were samples of blood for alcohol analysis. This was as a consequence of a
directive from the then HM Coroner (Dr S. Popper) in relation to all individuals autopsied.

I can confirm that no part or whole organ(s) were retained. I would be very happy for a copy
of this letter to be sent to Mr Church or indeed any other relatives.

Kind regards.

Yours sincerely

       RE;         GARY CHURCH DECEASED

       I refer to ray letter of the 12th January and your reply of
       the 13th January.

       Having made enquiries of the South Yorkshire Police I am
       informed that post mortem photographs have been retained by
       you.   I shall be grateful if you will let me have them
       without delay.

       Please note that I require the photographs to investigate a
       possible claim for damages for pre-death trauma.

       Yours faithfully

       Dear Sir

       RE;         GARY CHURCH DECEASED
       I confirm our recent telephone conversation in which I
       advised you of the reason for my request for the post-mortem
       photographs   of  Gary   Church.     I repeat   that   I am
       investigating the possibility that Gary suffered pre-death
       trauma for which a claim would lie in damages.   In order to
       place the relevant information before a pathologist who will
       advise further I need relevant photograph^and other material
       hence my request.

       I understand that you are already making enquiries in order
       to locate the relevant material and that you will be in
       touch with me as soon as you have done so.

       Yours faithfully

         Dear Mrs Hedar

         I refer to your recent telephone conversation of 19 January 1993 with Police
         Constable Greenway,   and  your   letter   reference  FJH/DEB/CHURCH   dated
         22 January 1993.

         I understood, mistakenly,    that the photographic material you initially
         requested related to the material used for identification purposes in the
         temporary mortuary at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground.

         I have caused Police Constable Greenway to research the Hillsborough file
         and, unfortunately, we are not in possession of post mortem photographs
         of any of the people who died in the Hillsborough tragedy.

         All material relating to post mortem procedures are held with HM Coroner,
         Mr C Dorries, and as such I have forwarded your request to him.

         I am sorry I am unable to assist you further.

         Yours sincerely

Dear Mrs Hedar

Gary Church (Deceased)

Thank you for your letter of 1st February 1993.  Some confusion seems to have
arisen in this matter.  When I received your original letter I assumed
(wrongly) that you were asking for copies of identification photographs of
the deceased rather than post-mortem photographs in the literal sense.

Full realisation of your intentions places me in some difficulty.  The
voluminous amount of photographic and video material relating to the
Hillsborough Inquest has now been archived and thus is no longer held at this
office.  I have no doubt that a number of photographs were taken during the
post-mortem examination. Our archive material will only contain one set of
such photographs and I could not release those "originals" to you for obvious
reasons.  The negatives are most certainly not held by my office, they will
be with the Scenes of Crimes Department at the South Yorkshire Police
Headquarters which seems rather to bring us back to the situation I set out
in my first letter to you.

However, I can say with almost complete certainty that the post-mortem
photographs would not have been taken in evidence at the Inquest.  Although
Coroners are frequently given post-mortem photographs it is very rare indeed
that it is necessary to put the relatives to the trauma of having such
photographs produced in Court.  Rule 57 of the Coroners Rules 1984 indicates
that I am only empowered to supply copies of documents that have been taken
in evidence.  I think it is the case of R v Hammersmith Coroner ex parte
Peach (1980) Q.B.211 in which it was made quite plain that papers given to
the Coroner by the police or a similar organisation for the purpose of an
Inquest remain the property of that organisation.  I have always taken the
view therefore that I have no authority to release such extraneous material
without the specific consent of the owner - in this case the South Yorkshire
Police.
This seems to me to be of particular relevance in the situation where you are
kind enough to make it clear that your request for the photographs is for
the purpose of litigation - where one of the defendants is likely to be the
South Yorkshire Police.

You will appreciate therefore that as the law presently stands I cannot do
anything further.  However, I am anxious to assist insofar as I can and I
have had a long conversation with Chief Superintendent Mole in which I
expressed certain views.  Mr Mole has undertaken to me that he will make
contact with the legal advisors to the Police Force and will write to you
further within the next 14 days.  I am sending a copy of this letter to
Mr Mole.

I am sorry if it appears that you are being pushed from pillar to post.   I
I have set out the situation as clearly as I can and I hope you can now
appreciate the very limited powers that I have in such circumstances.   If you
wish to discuss the matter further with me on the telephone I shall be
pleased to hear from you.

Yours sincerely

         Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990,


         If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
         of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of wh o m you represent,
         on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m.  Details of venue will be notified in
         due course.

         I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
         evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
         coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
         inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

         Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Co r o ne r s ’ Rules, the Inquest is
         under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
         witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
         this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

         Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
         to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
         appropriate details of any witness or witnesses w ho m you would like me to
         consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

         May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
         attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

         I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
         names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
         to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

         I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
         heard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
         submit.

         Yours faithfully,

Dear Dr Popper,

RE:   Gary Church

I have spoken to Mr and Mrs Church, they have no questions to raise
on the contents of the Summary or Post Mortem Report.

Mr and Mrs Church wish to be present in Court to hear Gary's Summary
presented, they will have at least one other member of their family with
them.

I trust this information is of assistance.

Dear Dr. Popper,

Re:   Gary Church Deceased (Hillsborough)

I have recently         been      consulted          by     Mr.      and    Mrs.      Church        the    parents
of Gary.

They want me to take over conduct of all matters arising following
Gary's death from their former solicitors Messrs. E. Rex Makin &
Co., and I have agreed to do so.

I understand that my clients have not been offered sight of the Post
Mortem Report, would you please let me have a copy subject to the
usual terms and I can let them know I have it and they can see it
if they want to.

Dear S ir s ,

He= a m c arncB                                               so.u.
As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not' to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to tuadertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

 I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
 is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
 fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,



S.L.Popper,
H.M. Coroner

 Dear Sirs,

 hai       (kmr Chrlflia^x_gbttCQh (daoiiflftAl.
 Thank you for your letter of the 8th of August.

 I enclose a letter Reference SIiP/JT/H/PM/001 which deals
 with the question of the release of the post mortem
 reports to you. On that basis, I enclose the post
 mortem report. If you cannot accept it on these terms,
 please return it unused.

 I am not clear whether you represent your clients in
 connection with the Inquest proceedings.

 As I am anxious to sort out the legal representation
 in order that I may know who to communicate with, I
 would be grateful if you could please let me know as
 soon as possible whether or not you are instructed
 in connection with the Inquest.

 If you are so instructed, I would be grateful if you
 could please let me know who precisely you represent.

 Finally, I would be grateful if you could please let
 me know whether you intend to associate yourself with
 the Hillsborough Steering Committee group of solicitors.
 This is of course a matter entirely for you, The purpose
 of my inquiry is to try and sort out which firms are
 within the group; and which will need separate communications.

  I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

 Please quote our reference.

 Yours faithfully,



  S.L.Popper,

I M F e r to your recent conversation with Superintendent
Sleath concerning the release of the deceased persons from

Mr D G Church




Dear Mr Church
With reference to your letter of 16 January and earlier correspondence,
there seems to be some misunderstanding 1n relation to your son's Inquest.
The generic part of the Inquest started on 19 November 1990 and the evidence
which we have heard to a large extent applies to all the deceased people,
including your son. We are 1n some cases calling evidence from Individuals
who, in addition to being able to give general evidence, may also make
some comment or have seme connection with a particular person, and
presume that , what you are referring to 1s the evidence of such a witness.
YQu; have, of course, been at liberty to be present throughout and, Indeed,
from earlier correspondence I had thought that you might well be there.
It 1s, of course, a matter entirely for you whether you attend or not.
With regard to the witnesses, I do not intend to ask Mr Jones to give
evidence and 1n any event a substantial number of the questions would be
either outside his knowledge or quite Inappropriate to an inquest.
Some of the questions which you raise have 1n fact already been dealt
with at least 1n part by the evidence of people who I did call and no
doubt if you were to study the transcripts you might find some of the
answers you are looking for.
I must stress that I am a Coroner, dealing with Inquests and not with a
public enquiry.
Yours sincerely




S L POPPER

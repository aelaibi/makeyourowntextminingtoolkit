Material held by CPS: categories and questions.

1. Categories:
a. material generated by Police for purposes of Public Inquiry;
b ditto for possible criminal proceedings;
c material under a or b which is already in the public domain, ie published or available to HFSG.
d material generated by CPS ( and counsel, LSLO, etc.).

2. Questions:
aa. can CPS properly disclose material at b without the consent of the statement maker? I think your broad
public interest argument has some force.
bb. re statements made for the purposes of the Public Inquiry (if not available to the parties anyway): the
public interest argument is even stronger. But were these statements taken under terms as to disclosure which
were set by the Taylor Inquiry itself?
cc. how much of all this material is in fact already in the public domain?
dd. has the CPS generated material been considered in detail with a view to deciding which items should
properly be withheld on the grounds of either LPP or PII ?
dd. is there any material which should be disclosed but which requires to be edited (apart from the possible
exclusion of witness addresses, as noted above)?

Thank you for your draft letters. I will speak to you about these shortly.

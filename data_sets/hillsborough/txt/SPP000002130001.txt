                                 AFFIDAVIT



                         > a Solicitor of the Supreme Court, MAKE OATH and
say as follows:


1.         I am employed by Sheffield City Council in the Legal Department. For
the purpose of this application for Judicial Review, I am acting as the
Solicitor for Dr Stefan Popper.       Save as otherwise indicated I make this
Affidavit from matters within my own knowledge or from documents within my
control.
2.     I make this Affidavit in order to bring to the notice of the Court
certain factual matters that have occurred since the Inquest jury returned its
verdicts on the 28th March 1991.


3.     The relevant chronology so far as the Coroner's Office is concerned is
as follows:


       28.3.91: 95 verdicts.

       15.4.92: Memorial on behalf of 6 Applicants sent to the Attorney
       General.

       May 1992: Coroner's Office notified of approach to Attorney General.
       5.5.92: Form 86A issued and first Affidavit of Jeremy Hawthorn with
       exhibits containing the Memorial itself and 2 bundles of evidence -
       Appendices 1 and 2 to the Memorial.
       15.5.92: Ex parte application for leave to move for Judicial Review
       heard by May J. Adjourned pending application to Attorney General and
       for service on relevant parties.
      2.6.92: Coroner's office served with Form 86A and Affidavit and exhibit.
      3.6.92: Applicants served further material upon Attorney General.
       18.8.92: Attorney General refused fiat.

      11.9.92: Second Affidavit of Jeremy Hawthorn with exhibits relating to
      an extract from a television programme broadcast on 4th March 1992, a
      report from Dr Ian West dated 20.8.92 and a chronology prepared from the
      Applicants' viewpoint.
      March 1993: Notification of restored date for application for leave.
      6.4.93: Applicants obtain leave before McPherson J.
      28.4.93: The City Solicitor receives (in addition to material already



                                          2
         received by the Coroner's office) the Notice of Motion and the Order of
         the 6th April 1993 and the Affidavit sworn on the 11th September 1992.


 4.      I am advised by Counsel that all matters of argument are properly to be
 addressed at the hearing.      However, as to fact, it is plain that it is now well
 over 4 years since the tragedy itself and over 2 years since the verdicts were
 returned.     The initial application was nearly 14 months after the verdicts.
 Whatever the reasons for the delay, it cannot now be in the public interest for
 decisions made in 1990 and 1991 to be re-examined.                All the Applicants were
 legally represented at the Inquests./ Indeed, before the verdicts were returned * )
 Dr Popper was informed (by Mr and Mrs Jones in a letter dated the 12th February             Co u xJlesj
 1991) that if he failed to call Doctors Phillips and Ashton this would form
 part of a case for Judicial Review irrespective of the verdict.


5.      On the 18th August 1992 the Attorney General refused to give his fiat
for an application under Section 13 of the Coroner's Act 1988.                In part, the
letter provided:



        "The Law Officers have considered the matter very carefully but thev
        have come to the conclusion that there is nothing which would justify
        ^ o t e gcaS saPPllCatl0n    t0 ^ ^        C°Urt f°r a new                 C of

        ™ ? L hfcVe feaChed     decision on the grounds that the application
        would have no reasonable prospect of establishing that it is necessary
        held 'f       m ^ intefeStS °f jUStiCC fOT a fresh InquesH o8^



6.     Those observations apply with equal force to the present application.


7.     From enquiries I have been able to make, I am aware that the civil


                                            3
proceedings have all now been compromised and that all Police disciplinary
proceedings have been concluded. Insofar as I am aware now, over 4 years after
the tragedy, there are no extant judicial proceedings other than this
application for review.


SWORN etc.

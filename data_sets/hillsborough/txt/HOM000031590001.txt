         Dear Home Secretary,

              Thank you for your letter of the 30 June 1997 and I was
         delighted to hear that you have called for an independent scrutiny
         into the Hillsborough disaster.

             I would just like to make one more request.  In view of the
        suffering of the families over the past eight years, I would be
        most grateful if the scrutiny could be carried out as quickly as
        possible and I am sure that this will be done.

                                                            Yours sincerely,

                                                                    2/7cc      -'-t £                 ’- k


                                                            LORD MAYOR

         shop.         The       shop was           busy with Liverpool                          fans        consuming              food and           beer.

         Even     though           people          were      drinking           around           the       area      of       the    shop       everyone

         was     well       behaved.

Everyone           a r o u n d me         seemed          to    be     tightly           packed          together           at       t hi s    time

and     unable          to m o v e        any     p a rts       of     their         bodies.             Even      though my              glasses

were       on t his         b l o k e ’s s h o u l d e r s           I c o u l d n ’t m o v e            my arms           to    get m y

glasses          b ac k a n d        he    cskjildn’t m o v e                his     arms        to    g i ve     them       back       to me.

During          the     crush        I h ad       d i flsj. c u 1 1 y        in b r e a t h i n g .            Nobody was moving,

t h a t ’s ho w         tightly           p a c k e d we w er e.                I c o u l d n ’t e v e n m o v e                my    upper         body.

T he    crush         to me         d i d n ’t s e e m         to    h a ve a r i s e n          from a sudden                  surge         but,        in

fa ct,      just        gradually              became          more       p acke d.

It w a s        probably            the    people          at       the      b ac k w h o        f elt      any    su r g e,         where       I was

standing           we      j us t    got       packed          tightly when                 it    happened.

When       the     crush       started            people            started          shouting            out      t ha t     they were

being       crushed and were                      shouting             open        the      g ate s .          I could          see     pe op l e

climbing           o ve r     the        fence      to     the       perimeter              of    the       ground.             At    this       tim e

the     gam e      h ad     kicked         off      but        I c o u l d n ’t se e             anything          but       legs       running

around.

This       was     because           s om e      people         h ad      their        arms       in the a ir              and       c o u l d n ’t

l o w er    them        during           the    crush and also                     because            people       were         climbing            the

fence.

I then          saw a       g ate        slightly          to       the      r i ght     of      the     goal      w as      open.            Because

we     werV^acked              so        tight      toge'tj^er a n d               c o u l d n ’t g o v e r n        our m o v e m e n t s            I

didn't          actuaHv             see    people          go       thr^ogh          th e     gates.

At     t h is    t ime      I coVLd            s t il l    see       p e o p l e \ 1 imbing              o v er    the       fences           and

being       aided          by the         police          to    get       over.          To      begin with            the       police         w er e,

or     seemed         to    be,      a    bit     reluctant               to    let      them         o ve r    but w h e n          they

                                                                                                                                 S 1 711

realised what                h ad    happened and                t hat      people          were     being     c r u sh ed ,        they

were    giving            as m u c h a s s i s t a n c e         as    they       could.

Eventually             the     crush        eased         off.        T he a m o u n t       of    people      lessened.               I

could        now m o v e       my arms           and      retrieved my              glasses.              I could move              about

even    though            it w a s      s t i ll     packed.

I realised what                   had     h a p p e n e d and,         in o r d e r         to    p r e v e n t me    being         crushed

              I f o r c e d me            ay     b a ck    to    the       back     of      the    terrace.

Here     I             assisted           by g i f t i n g       me    up    into        the      seating area            of    the

stand        by    other       fans.           When       I got       into       the     seating,          I walked         back       a

further           f i f t e e n y a r ds .

From     h er e      I could          see      fans,       who were          inside          pen 4,        with      the a i d       of

police        officers            and     other          people       who    were        outside,          trying      to      rip     the

f e nc e .        They were           trying         to m o v e       it    backwards             and     forwards.            I t h i nk

at    t his       ti me     the      fire      brigade          h ad a l s o      arrived and              I noticed a hole                     in

the    fence         leading          onto       the      pitch       from       pen 4.           I saw      people       g o in g

through           t his     hole.

I could also                see      people         go    through          the    g at e     I h av e      mentioned           earlier

on.

On    the     pitch         I saw       the      police         officers          and ambulance               people        giving

mouth        to m o u t h a n d         heart        massage          to    the     injured          p e o p l e and,       generally,

e v e r y b o d y was        doing        what       they       could       to    help       the     situation.

When     I was         in    pen 4        I d i d n ’t see w h a t               w as    going       on    in p e n 3.          I d i d n ’t

see    anybody actually                     getting         i nj ur e d.           I remember             th at w h e n     I was          down

in the        terrace          and      the      crush      had       begun       s o m e b o d y was       shouting           t hat       an

old m a n was             dead.         I d i d n ’t a c t u a l l y         s ee       this      man.

I only        s aw     the     extent          of    the    crush when              I got         up to     the      seating         area

and    saw        people       l y i ng     on      the    pitch,          obviously             seriously        injured.             Some

I would           presume         were      dead.

I stayed           standing           in the         seating          area       u n ti l    it w a s a n n o u n c e d        on    the

loudspeakers                t ha t    the      game       was abandoned.                    We    were     instructed           to w a i t

                                                                                                                             S1711

             before          leaving    but    people    started       to m a k e      their    e xi t      from    the   ground,

            About        ten minutes          after    this,    I left       the    ground and made                my w ay    b ack

             to    the       ground.     When    I got    up to     th e     car    the   others         were already

            waiting           for me.     I didn't       know about          me    brother,                   ,    because     he

             had made          his    own way    up to    the    ground with            his    m a te s .

            Because           I was    shook    up,            drove    us    b ac k    home.

             I didn't          receive a ny      injuries       during       the    crush.

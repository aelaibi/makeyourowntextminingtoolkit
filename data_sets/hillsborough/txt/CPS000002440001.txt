        Dear Madam

        RE:      ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD and MURRAY
                 LEEDS MAGISTRATES' COURT: Adjourned Hearing

        On 18 December, 1998, you were informed of the Crown Prosecutions Service’s
        decision in this case, that we would not intervene to take over any of the charges
        before the court.

        On 31 March, 1999, the Divisional Court handed down judgment on an application by
        Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray for judicial review of the CPS’ decision not to take
        over the private prosecution in order to discontinue, as was requested by the two
        defendants. Whilst the Director's policy and his decision not to take over and
        discontinue the charges of manslaughter and wilful neglect to perform a public duty
        were found to be lawful, the Court quashed the decision not to intervene insofar as it
        related to the charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice laid against Mr
        Duckenfield, on the basis of a breach of legitimate expectation.

        I have, therefore, reconsidered my decision in relation to that charge in the light of the
        judgment of the* Divisional Court and I have decided, on behalf of the Director of
        Public Prosecutions, to exercise the power under section 6(2) of the Prosecution of
         Offences Act, 1985, to take over the private prosecution by yourself, of the charge
         against Mr Duckenfield of attempting to pervert the course of justice on 15 April
         1989. The prosecution of the remaining charges against both Mr Duckenfield and Mr
         Murray is not affected by this decision.

        I have reviewed this charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice and have
        applied the tests set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. I have decided that the
        charge should be discontinued under section 23(3) of the Prosecution of Offences Act
        1985.




                           Crown Prosecution Service • Working in the interests of justice

Winckworth Sherwood.

                                   NOTICE OF DISCONTINUANCE


    Dear Sirs

    RE:     DAVID GODFREY DUCKENFIELD
            LEEDS MAGISTRATES COURT - ADJOURNED HEARING

    I have today written to the Clerk to the Justices at Leeds Magistrates’ Court, informing him
    first, that I have taken over and secondly, that I am discontinuing under Section 23 of the
    Prosecution of Offences Act, 1985, the following charge against your client: that on the 15th
    day of April, 1989, at Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield, with intent to pervert the
    course of justice, he did an act which had a tendency to pervert the course of justice in that he
    lied about the circumstances in which gate C at the Football Stadium became open; contrary to
    Common Law.

    The effect of this notice is that your client no longer needs to attend court in respect of this
    charge and any bail conditions imposed in relation to it cease to apply.

    The decision to discontinue this charge has been taken because there is not enough evidence to
    provide a realistic prospect of conviction.

    This notice does not apply to any other charges against you client. Your client must still attend
    court in respect of these charges and any bail conditions imposed in relation to them continue to
    apply.

    Your client has the right to require the discontinued proceedings to be revived. If you wish to
    exercise this right, you must give written notice to the Clerk to the Justices at the above
    magistrates' court as soon as possible (and in any event within 35 days).

    Should your client wish to apply for any costs incurred in respect of our taking over of this



                          Crown Prosecution Service • Working in the interests of justice
charge, you may make a written request to the Clerk to the Justices. It is not necessary to apply
for the proceedings to be continued in order to apply for your costs.

CAUTION: this notice only applies to the charge specified in it, and does not have any effect in
relation to any others that may be pending, or other proceedings against your client.

Yours faithfully

     Dear Sir

     RE:      DAVID GODFREY DUCKENFIELD
              LEEDS MAGISTRATES COURT - ADJOURNED HEARING

     I am writing to give you notice under Section 23(3) of the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1985,
     that I do not want proceedings against the above named to be continued on the following
     charge, namely that:

           David Godfrey Duckenfield, on the 15th day of April 1989 at Hillsborough Football
           Stadium, Sheffield, with intent to pervert the course of justice, did an act which had a
           tendency to pervert the course of justice in that he lied about the circumstances in
           which gate C at the Football Stadium became open; contrary to Common Law.

     The reason for my decision is that there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of
     conviction.

     I have notified the accused of this decision and of his right to have the proceedings revived.

        Dear Sirs

        RE:           ADLINGTONvDUCKENFIELDAND        MURRAY
                 LEEDS MAGISTRATES' COURT: Adjourned hearing

        On 31 March, 1999, the Divisional Court handed down judgement in the case of R v
       DPP ex parte Duckenfield and Murray. The court ruled that, whilst the overall Crown
       Prosecution Service policy on private prosecutions and the Director’s decision not to
       take over and discontinue the charges of manslaughter and wilful neglect to perform a
       public duty were lawful, that policy was only partly followed in the consideration of
       the allegation against your client concerning an attempt to pervert the course of
       justice. Accordingly, the Divisional Court quashed the decision insofar as it related to
       that charge.

       I have, therefore, reconsidered my decision in relation to that charge in the light of the
       judgment and I have decided that the CPS should take over that single charge in order
       to discontinue it under section 23(3) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985. The
       reason is that there is clearly no case to answer on that charge.

       Accordingly, on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions, I am exercising the
       power under section 6(2) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 to take over the
       private prosecution by Ann Adlington, of the charge against Mr Duckenfield of
       attempting to pervert the course of justice on 15 April, 1989. The prosecution of the
       remaining charges against both Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray is not affected by this
       decision.

       A formal letter of discontinuance is enclosed.




                         Crown Prosecution Service • Working in the interests of justice
I have informed Leeds Magistrates' Court and Ann Adlington of this decision.

        Dear Sir

       RE:       ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD and MURRAY
                 LEEDS MAGISTRATES' COURT: Adjourned Hearing

       On 18 December, 1998, you were informed of the Crown Prosecution Service’s
       decision in this case, that we would not intervene to take over any of the charges
       before the court.

       On 31 March, 1999, the Divisional Court handed down judgment on an application by
       Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray for judicial review of the CPS’ decision not to take
       over the private prosecution in order to discontinue, as was requested by the two
       defendants. Whilst the Director's policy and his decision not to take over and
       discontinue the charges of manslaughter and wilful neglect to perform a public duty
       were found to be lawful, the Court quashed the decision not to intervene insofar as it
       related to the charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice laid against Mr
       Duckenfield, on the basis of a breach of legitimate expectation.

       I have, therefore, reconsidered my decision in relation to that charge in the light of the
       judgment of the Divisional Court and I have decided, on behalf of the Director of
       Public Prosecutions, to exercise the power under section 6(2) of the Prosecution of
       Offences Act, 1985, to take over the private prosecution by Ann Adlington, o f the
       charge against Mr Duckenfield of attempting to pervert the course of justice on 15
       April 1989. The prosecution of the remaining charges against both Mr Duckenfield
       and Mr Murray is not affected by this decision.

       I have reviewed this charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice and have
       applied the tests set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. I have decided that the
       charge should be discontinued under section 23(3) of the Prosecution of Offences Act
       1985.




                         Crown Prosecution Service • Working in the interests of justice
A formal letter of discontinuance is enclosed.

Yours faithfully




C W P NEWELL

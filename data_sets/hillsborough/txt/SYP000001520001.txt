started          to       -fall    forwards            down        the      terraces            and       I remember                there             was

somebody             on     the    ground         that           1 was      treading            on,           I Knew          it wa s         a

person,          although             I c o u l d n ’t see              him,       because           of       the       crowd.           There             was

of    him,       and        all    of    a    sudden         we       were       a space            at    the       side       of    a

barrier.               The      barrier          was    still           standing           up.       I think             we    had       become

trapped          behind a barrier / n d                          the       pressure          had         increased             until          t hi s

barrier          eventually                g a v y w a y , this             caused         the       pressure                drop and             the

surge         forward           and     its      only       by     good         fortune         that          we    managed          to       get

sideways             to     the    left       and      went        up      in f r o n t      of      that          barrier          that          I

mentioned              earlier          the      one    that          was       still      standing.                    1 never          actually

We     went      through          an    open        gate      beiwaai           the     west      Stand         and

anytime          did       I see       any     criminal            acts       taking        place        although           after        the

match        there         wa s   a    lot     of      disgust          from      the      Liverpool            fans       towards          the

Th e    whole         thing       after        the      m a t c h w as        stopped           was    just      c h a o s , thee           was

ambulances             on     the      pitch with             few       P o 1 ice     were       trying         to    pull       the     pen

the     fans       appeared            to    be     doing        more      to     help      each       other         than       the    Police

were,,        I th ink t h e P o 1 ic& their                        t oo k      too     long      to     notice           the    gravity

of     the    situation and                  when       they       did,       it wa s       too       late,,         I think          the

ma^jackd^n                  this       whole        s i t u a t i o n was         the      o p e n 1 n g of      the       g a t e s r ig h t

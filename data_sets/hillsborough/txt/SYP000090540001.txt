                On Saturday 15th April           1989 <150489?         I attended the F .A. Cup Semi­

           I obtained my ticket from a friend,

                         I believe he is a member      of the supporters club.         I pai

           £6.00 for the ticket which gave me access to the Leppinqs Lane

           Ter racing



           The journey to Sheffield took about 2 and three quarters hours and we

           ar ri ve d at our destination at 1415 hours        (2«15pmK_    Da-ring the journey

           I saw no fans consuming alcohol and there was n<^rtfr i nk on the coach.

           The coach was searched by police prior to >jjyriving at the stadium,




           and I walked down tj6    the match with                    of

                                      about a 15 minutes walk.        I saw Police Officers

           at most street    corners who were pointing fans the w ^ ' t o       go to the

  U - |    ground. On arriving at the entrance           Hi 1 Is bo rough at 1430 hours     (2.^

           semblance of order. Hjr was unsuccessful.          1 saw no stewards outside

           I joined on the end of the crowd and ma na ge             push my way to the

           my knowledge and i never saw any gates being opened.              I never

           witnessed any supporters entering the ground illegally.

             take that into the ground.            He left me with the flag.               I saw no signs

             indicating where the terracing were.                    All   I saw was the tunnel

             en t ran ee.    There was no disorder,         drinking or anything unusual going

             on it was generally a very good atmosphere.



                     and I made our way onto the terracing                   into Fjfen 4 to the left of

             the goal       posts and forward to a post marked L4 dh the attached grid

             pressure was still building up and I was beginning to become

             concerned.       I was s^fll standing with                     at this time.       There was

StOf          ield for the warm-up.           The presyjire around us was becoming

             'increasingly greater       I was carried back and forward involuntarily by

             the sway of the crowd at one time I ended up facing in the opposite

             direction altogether facing the West Stand this continued for about 10

             minutes and I was very frightened.                  The crowd carried me back to the

             position I have m a r k e d N4 on the grid plan (E>; No                       ) (Ref   No        )

             and I was twistedysround several times and my legs were pinned against

             a crush barrier^r        I kept shouting and screaming for assistance and a

             man stood to M y       left kept encouraging me and told me to keep my face

             up and t r y / o    keep calm.     This carried on for several minutes and the

             next t t i i I     knew was the man behind me s 1ump forward and fall onto my

             right shoulder.        I managed to look round and I could see he was dead.

           His eyes were open and were full of water is though he had been

           crying.   His eye 1ids were bright red. /X         would describe him as a

           white male, 5*11 tall very well b u i l y with a beer b e l l y .    His face was

           almost white and his lips purple, y m e        had short cropped,   strawberry

           cannot remember anymore about Him.

           At this point I believe the game had started and been stopped.              I

           became very anxious of my own predicament,          my legs were trapped

           against the crush barrier and I        c ou ld n’t move. All feeling had gone

           from my legs. Another man managed to assist me and I was able to free

           one of my legs, but the other leg remainsyi trapped for a further

           5 minutes when I was suddenly aware o f ^ h e       pressure around me easing

           and I was pul led o u t .   Several suppojfte r s then lifted me out and over

           into pen 5 and onto the pitch. Whej^e I fell over and lay for some

           minutes unt i 1 I recovered suf % cj^?nt l y .



           Prior to being lifted out of Pen 4,          I saw t h ^ man who had collapsed

           onto my shoulder lying near the front of           /in 4.   A Police Officer and
Q & C .C
           other fans were lifting him over the fro/ft perimeter fence and onto

           the pitch he was obviously dead,



           When I eventually got to my feet I began searching for friends who I

           knew were at the match.      I found          by the 18 yard line and saw he
                                                    y
           was            Liverpool fans came over and remonstrated wxth us to

           get off the pitch so the match could re-commepce.            I could see he was

           quite                        to his                   there were                   m

                        which I assume had been caused by being trapped up against

           the barrier.    I shouted to a St. Johns ambulance attendant for

           assistance and he handed me his bag and ran off to fetch some water.

               After about   10 minutes a Police Officer and a fan arrived and carried

                     to a point at the corner of the North Stand.                 remained with

                     for what appeared to be about 45 minutes




               South Yorkshire Police    laid on a bus which took us to the Railway

               Station and onward to Liverpool    by t f a i n .



               My injuries consisted of severjr bruising to my left thigh.              I did not

               attend hospitals   in Sheffie^r.   I could see there were more urgent

               cases than mine.



       ^       During all the crushing in Pen 4       »>fan attempted to steal money from

               my pocket.    He was only about If?    ars of age.            I would not recognise

               I feel the supporters outside the y o u n d         were not handled well by the

               police there did not appear to        much organisation,

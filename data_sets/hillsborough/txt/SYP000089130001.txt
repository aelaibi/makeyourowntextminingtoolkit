                     I reside at the ^ o v e             address with my family.                     I am a supporter          of

                     Liverpool        Football       Club,    but not a season ticket                  holder.        I attend

                     most    home      games,   with a gang of mates who meet at                        the ground.

             S h e f f ie l d without     stopping.          We got     to the S po r ts m an Public House                  in

             S h e f f i e l d at about    12.30      pm    (1230).         We had a rr an g ed to meet all                the

             others     there.     While we wa it ed for the others,                        the five     of us went

             to a nearby      cafe for         something        to eat.           We then    returned to the

             in a group talking            together.           1 had only met Nicholas and Francis

          Late r I realised that                  people had been         injured,     and    I saw a lad being

          given a t t en ti on        near       to the    corner      flag.      I could only say        that    this

          lad was aged about                18 to 20       years,      I cannot remember a ny thing more

          about      him.       I then saw several              people    being treated on the            pitch;, and

          the m at ch had been stopped.

          made     our way        to the     car,    and made our way home.                 The only difference

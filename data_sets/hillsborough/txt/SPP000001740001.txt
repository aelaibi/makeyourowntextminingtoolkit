DPP d oc fils available to me and marked by me

attached copies from files at Medico-Legal Centre

1. Doc 109             TB 1          740 -74 1 DPP submission

2. Doc 110             TB2           742-747 DPP submission

This doc refers to a shot at 14.18.39 showing plenty of room in the pen (?which)
I have not marked this section and so presumably did not think it relevant. I have not
viewed this scene recently so do not know whether I would recognise it but even if I
saw it I do not know whether I would remember whether I would have viewed it.

It would seem from bottom of first sheet of Doc 110 that the camera was focused on
the turnstiles and Leppings Lane This changes to Terraces on West Stand at
15.02.53. Presumably this is the clip introduced by Sgt Killoch C539. I have had a
copy supplied but unfortunately my copy does not track properly. I do not recollect
that problem at Inquest and can be verified by video of proceedings.

3. Doc 128    MAPI BBC Film 774-775           DPP submission

Marked by me on page 744 Part at least of this shown at Inquest.

4. Doc 129     MAP 2 BBC film 776-778 DPP submission

This film starts at 15.37.47. I have marked p 2 as the recorded timings appear to be
entirely wrong as recorded at 16.11.35 when match still in progress ended about 15.06

Good. I think. Not clear what this means now but could I suppose indicate viewing???

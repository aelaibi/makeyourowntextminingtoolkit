          Dear Sirs

          HILLSBOROUGH - ADLINGTON -V- DUCKENFIELD & MURRAY

          I refer to my two telephone calls to you at your home yesterday where I understand you
          are now engaged upon the drafting of your report having completed consideration of the
          papers, May I please first confirm that it is our intention to make a further submission
          to you. It had been understood that you were hoping to have been able to finish your
          report by the end of September. Our further submission would have been with you by
          now had we been provided with the enclosures with the letter of 24 August 1998 from
          HFSG to yourself.

          Our submission will in any event be with you before 30 September.

          We would therefore not wish you to have completed your consideration and the report
          consequent thereon, until such time as you have had an opportunity to read our
          representations. In relation to the two points that you made specifically:

          1.              There is no logistical issue with regard to the photocopying albeit that it
                          apparently is quite a mass of paper. We have offered to make operatives
                          available to you to work under your direction to carry out this photocopying
                          without it needing to be done by you personally or indeed anyone from your
                          office. We have already undertaken responsibility for the cost.

          2.              You now say that it is not intended to provide any further copy papers to
                          anyone. This flies in the face of the agreement that has pertained hitherto, that
                          such submissions as were made to you by HFSG, Winckworth and Pemberton
                          or ourselves would be copied. The exception to this rule seems to have started
                          with the enclosures with the letter of 24 August. You did say that you were
                          expecting to speak to Ann Adlington, Solicitor advising HFSG, following our
                          second conversation and that you would raise with her the provision of the
                          enclosures with the letter of 24 August 1998. We have heard nothing from her,
                          nor received any papers.

                                                                          FAO George R Croston
                                                                             24 September 1998
                                                                                        Page 2


           At this moment therefore we are left with an unsupported allegation from HFSG that
           there exists new evidence or that there has been a suppression of material evidence.
           Save where a Public Interest Immunity Order has been obtained, there is a clear duty on
           the Prosecution to make disclosure which duty is being abrogated, For your part,
           knowing that the Prosecutor seeks to impose conditions which are utterly ludicrous and
           without legal foundation on the one hand you considered the documents attached to the
           letter of 24 August and on the other hand you do not give us any opportunity to respond
           thereto. That cannot be right.

           We ask you to reconsider your decision not to provide us with the papers attached to the
           letter from HFSG to you of 24 August 1998.

           We would ask you not to submit your report until such time as we have had the
           opportunity to consider those documents and to amend our representations in the light
           thereof.

           Yours faithfully              ,

              I have been a Liverpool supporter all my life,                I go to a good few of

              the away matches and all of the home matches.                  I am not a season

              ticket holder.          It was my intention to go to the match being played

              between Liverpool and Notts Forest at the Hillsborough stadium on

              Saturday 15 April        1989 (130489) and therefore obtained a ticket from

              last year's season ticket.              The ticket was a £6 Leppings Lane

              terrace ticket.



              On that particu lap- gjat.,urday/it was my intention to travel to the game

              with my brothe rj              and two friends,                          (seen) and

                                    We travelled by car,                 had hired one from work

              I do not recollect the time we left Liverpool                but I guess it would

              have been about 10-10.30am            (1000)-(1030)     that Saturday.

                There were a few travel delays due to roadworks but nothing excessive.

                We got to Sheffield about half an hour before the kick-off.                                                                                                       We

                parked the car about five minutes away from the ground,                                                                                         somewhere on

                the left at the top of Leppings Lane.                                                                        We then walked down to the

                ground.                 There were loads of people walking                                                            in the same direction.

                There were no disorders of any nature that                                                                         I saw although there were a

                lot of people,                       they were just casually walking to the ground and the

                atmosphere was good.



                When we arrived at the perimeter gate there was just a blanket of

                people,            there were no queues at all.                                                              I saw a few police officers

                standing around but not many and one officer on a horse.                                                                                               We made an

                effort to join the crowd of people Lpf'tR^der to get X o                                                                                    the turnstile                        ._

                I saw a police officer just standing on the inside as it opened.                                                                                                           I
                    —          —    ----------------------------------------------------------------------


                did not see any stewards or any othj^r officers at all.                                                                                           I would say

                that we were probably in the grouo^of about the first thirty people

                that went through this gate.                                                         Tyere was no surge just a casual quick

                walk as we knew the game was about to start.



                I had been to the ground the year before and near the layout of the

                ground I knew that if you went to the right or the left you could get

                to the outside pens of the terracing,                                                                       but because of the time, for

                quickness,               we headed for the tunnel to get a spec.                                                                        There was no

                police presence or stewards at or near the entrance of the tunnel.

  Us**-         There was a crowd of people going through the tunnel but there was no
                                                :                          ------------
                rush it was very dark going through I recollect three stairs but you

                co ul dn’t see them at no time here did I feel uncomfortable.

                                                                                      S3637



          When we got to the end of the tunnel there was nowhere to go,              it was

          absolutely packed,       so we had to stay where we were, we couldn't turn

          back because of the volume of people coming behind us.               At this point

          the players were on the pitch and about to kickVoff.               The four of us

          drifted apart and got separated by about four/foot, but at the same

          time I couldn”t get to my friends at all.           /Gradually I was being

          carried forward by the mass of people b e h ^ d ,      my whole body was being

          controlled by the crowd.           I must have been moved almost half way into

          the pen and about       10 feet away from the perimeter fence.          My feet

          were not even touching the floor.            By this time the players had just

          kicked off.        Gradually people started to climb over the side fence

          and the front fences and also into the stand above.                I Lnen just

          asked the fellows that were around me to lift me up and/I was

o r r     subsequently passed down over the          crowds of people,     night to the front

          fence.         I then scrambled over the fence and onto j/ne pitch at this

          point the match got stopped.           I sat down on ths^/irack just behind the

          goal to get my breath back,        I guess   I sat here for just a couple of

          minutes.        The Police then began to move everyone onto the side,            I

          then went to look into the pens to see if I could find

                   and     but I couldn’t,   it was just absolute   chaos.
                                                                                    7
          I then joined in to help rip the hoardings off to make them into

          stretchers.         I helped to carry about five ot^jriaybe six people.           We

          picked them up from the front of the goal mouth,              carried them down the

          pitch and laid them at the front of the Spion Kcrp.       J      About four of

          these people were still       conscious.      One of\j^ne people I carried was

          already dead,       some person was giving this/person, who was a male,              the

          kiss of life, a policeman came over aAd then threw a coat over his

          face.      He was a big person,      he ^lj/oked quite strong,    possibly in his

             was approximately 6^root, if not more, in height.     The coat the

             him up from other than the penalty area.

             I guess       I must have been helping out for       ten minutes or so maybe

             longer,       time just seemed to go.      I went up into the North Stand than,

             and got       a   cup of tea out of the canteen,     after this I went back to

             look for                       and               When I couldn't find them I made

             my way back to the car,        this must have been around four thirty (1630),

             via the North Stand entrance.            There was no one at the car but on my

             way back to the ground I bumped into the lads.



             Once everyone had realised what had happened they did all they could

             to assist the injured and the dying,             it was unfortunate the people

             didn't realise what was happening earlier.               I feel that in future

             people should be stopped from entering the ground fifteen minutes

             before the kick-off and that the Police should have a say about the

             match being put back if there are any traffic delays or other problems

             not envis age d.



             I cannot recollect what I was wearing that day,             I might have been

             wearing a white or light grey top with a sky blue wind-cheater over

             the top, jeans and trainers when I was being             carried over the peopl e’s

   ^         heads down the pen I was holding a red woollen hat.



             I retained the ticket and                 sent    it back to Anfield and the £6

             went towards the disaster fund.

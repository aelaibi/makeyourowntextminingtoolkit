       Mrs Teresa Glover,




                                                             iS August 1992

       Dear Mrs Glover,

       I write in response to your letter to the Attorney General in
       support of the application made by Messrs Malcolm J . Gregg &
       Company on behalf of yourself and the relatives of five other
       persons who died in the Hillsborough tragedy.    You sought the
       authority of the Attorney General to make an application to the
       High Court for an order directing a fresh inquest.


/      I enclose a copy of a letter which I have today sent to your
       solicitors explaining that the Attorney General, after careful
       consideration, has declined to grant that authority.


       The Attorney General recognises that the decision will be deeply
       disappointing to you and has the greatest sympathy for all those
       who lost members of their family or otherwise suffered through
       the disaster.



       Yours sincerely,

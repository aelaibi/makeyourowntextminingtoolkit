                                    PRESS RELEASE



     By Mr J. Mervyn JONES, the Deputy Chief Constable of Cheshire and Officer in
     day-to-day command of the initial investigation and more recently has acted

     as the Coroner’s Officer.


     He said:-


              "I have no comment to make about the verdicts, nor has the Coroner,

              Dr Stefan POPPER.


              The investigation into the circumstances surrounding the tragedy at Hillsborou
              has been exhaustive and comprehensive.   At the height of the investigation
              nearly 500 West Midlands Police Officers were involved.         Upon completion
              of the bulk of the work by the Summer of 1989, the team was reduced to
              62, and from November 1990 onwards, a team of 12 Officers has been
              dedicated to supporting the Coroner for his Inquests.


               During the course of the inquiry as a whole, contact has been made with
               over 13,000 people, over 5,000 statements have been taken, 9,000
               questionnaires completed, over 2,400 photographs examined and 71 hours

               of video   viewed.


               The product of these extensive investigations was made available to
               Lord Justice TAYLOR, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Police
               Complaints Authority, and latterly to the Coroner.


               At the opening of the investigation I stated that this tragedy would
               be investigated thoroughly; this we have done.


                                                                                       ''Hi-
                                                                       Continued .....


                              EMBARGOED UNTIL AFTER THE VERDICTS

         "As a matter of interest the Coroner's Inquests, sitting with a Jury, have
         been the longest running in recent history, if not for all time.           Including
         the interim inquests in April/May of last year the Coroner’s Court sat
         for a total of ninety three days over a total of nineteen weeks.           There
         were over 520 appearances by witnesses and 540 exhibits examined.           The
         transcripts of the proceedings amounted to over 8,650 pages recording
         over 3.6 million words spoken.




         THERE WILL BE NO SEPARATE INTERVIEWS WITH MR JONES OR THE CORONER."

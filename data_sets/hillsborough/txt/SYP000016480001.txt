Dear Richard,

I note from your News Letter that certain Clubs have been in receipt of grant
aid to assist then in up-dating their video equipment.

I have been approached by South Yorkshire Police to see if financial
assistance can be given in enhancing the system here at Hillsborough. I would
    your guidance therefore as to how you would wish any proposal to be made
to the Football Trust.

Further to this I would advise you that towards the end of last season, at the
request of the Police, we up-dated certain of our close circuit television
equipment at a cost of £6,549 + VAT and I would ask whether the Football Trust
would consider granting us financial assistance towards this sum.

I look forward to hearing from you in due course.

Yours sincerely,

                       POLICE SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS
                       AND CONTROL ROOM.



    CAMERAS
              The quality of the three existing cameras is such that they are
}             totally inadequate for the job that they are supposed to do.
              The design of the cameras if of the outboard P.C.B. type. This
              means that the ciruitry and the tube has no protective case for
              weather or nechanical damage protection.
              The tube in the Leppings Lane camera is nota low light tube,
              which means that in bad light conditions the picture transmitted
              to the monitor is virtually unusable.
              The Colour camera at the Penistone Road end of the ground is of the
              same design as described above. The tube gives a good picture in
              good light conditions but in poor light there is no picture at
              all.


CONTROLS & MONITOR
              The control for the camera functions although adequate in themselves
              are poorly positioned nnd th«* video tape recorders are only three
              hour recortii'v*.
              This means that it is impossible for the police to record from the
^             time the system is switched onto the time when it is shut down.
              If an'incident needsto be recorded, the police controllerhas to not
              only control the camera, he also has to reach down and switch the video
              play and record buttons at the santu t.im**. As wellas the difficulty
              involved in 1his •>norm <<-.t> ih»* «          n<» 1 »*•••»* vh id» i
              approximately four to five seconds means that the likelrhood of the
              wciHont being midd«d «>n tape: i-      ly snrreased.
              As you can see the design and ld.voul of ihe system [ilus the type of
              equipment used makes the surveillance system less than adequate for
              the use for which it was intended.

              We are pieasWl therefore to submit our re-design and specifications
              of the surveillance system in con/junction with the police and your

      I am pleased to advise you that at their meeting on 2 July, the
      Trustees agreed to accept the recommendation from the Chairmans
      Working Party that we contribute a total of £25,000 towards the
      installation of closed circuit television at your ground, on the basis
      that the equipment is owned and maintained by the police.

       When you are able to confirm that you have incurred expenditure
       in excess of that amount, I should be happy to let you have our
       cheque.
       I shall incidentally be writing to the chairmen of all clubs in the
       course of the next few days outlining the national policy of the
       Trust on CCTV: we viewed your application as a special case, not
       least because it was submitted before the national policy was agreed.

       Dear Mr. Faulkner,

       I refer to our recent telephone dicussions, following your talk with
       Mr. John Smith, Chairman Liverpool F.C., relative to the installation
       of a comprehensive security system incorporating close circuit
       television cameras.

       The scheme in its entirety covers all aspects of safety and security,
       giving a dual counting system on the turnstiles, individual ground
       section totals, overall ground attendance figures, close circuit
       television cameras giving full coverage of approaches to ground,
       surveillance of turnstiles, both inside and outside the entrances,
       and full coverage of all aspects of crowd control within the
       stadium. The full operation will be housed within a security room
       and its control will involve the active services of the South
       Yorkshire Police. The part of this scheme, exclusive of the CCTV aspect,
       has already been submitted to the Football Grounds Improvement Trust and
       letter of offer re grant aid received.

         The decision to instal such a comprehensive scheme has been brought about
         by three main reasons:-

         1.         The avoidance of a repeat of a recent incident, when capacities in
                    certain areas of the ground were exceeded without any pre-warning
                     system being available.
          2.        The real necessity to have a surveillance system, controlled by
                    Police Officers, whereby pending trouble makers can be observed
                    early and entry, if necessary, restricted.  In addition its  ^
                    availability for full crowd control and its ability to effectively
                    identify any trouble spots and associated offenders.


                                                                                                                                cont.

                                          Chairman- H E McGee, Secretary: R. H. Chester, Manager: H. Wilkinson.

'•   #                               -   2   -



         3.   The desire by this Club to provide a constrol system which could
              effectively be used to avoid publicity of an adverse nature.

         It is difficult to document all the detailed aspects of this system
         but suffice it to say if it were necessary, or deemed advisable, I
         would be only too pleased to present myself, along with a Senior member
         of the South Yorkshire Police who thoroughly endorses, supports and
         approves the scheme, at a future meeting of the Trust to elaborate
         further and answer any questions that may arise.  I would add that the
         scheme, in my opinion and certainly others whom I have spoken to in
         confidence, would be one of the most sophisticated ones in operation
         in football today.

         There is, however, as I explained, very much a degree of urgency
         attached to this application. The crowd problems which I related
         to in (1) above were incurred on the occasion of our fixture with
         Liverpool.  In the immediate future we have the visits of Manchester
         United (9/4/85) and Everton (4/5/85), and in view of current League
         positions both could attract near capacity crowds.  I feel that with
         an early decision the appointed contractor could have all, or at least
     M   part, of the system installed by these dates but whilst we have approval
         from the Football Grounds Improvement Trust, the Club could not authorise
         the CCTV aspect.

         I have enclosed copies of the relevant estimates and would be obliged
         of your early observations.  I can confirm that the cost of the
         counting and close circuit television is approximately 50% of the
         total estimate but, of course, on submission of the grant application
         form this would be qualified precisely.

         Yours sincerely,




          Secretary.

      Dear Richard

      Fnn-hwn and the Community: Sheffield Wednesday FC

      As agreed, please find attached Sheffield Wednesday's submission for a
      Football Trust grant which we have discussed briefly.

      I support our Yorkshire and Humberside region's recommendation that a grant
      of £15,000 be made by the Trust towards this project. I am informed by the
      region that the Club has developed community use of the facilities both at
      its training ground and at Hillsborough particularly, through Keith Bannister,
      an ex-player.

     The Sports Council has previously made substantial grants to the Club -
      £49,000 in 1979 for the provision of a pavilion and floodlighting, and
      £66,384 for the changing accommodation, reception area, lounge and multigym
  ^ t Hillsborough. In addition, £2,250 has been made available for the equip-
  W m e n t to be used in this current proposal. These previous grants show the
      Sports Council's commitment.

          I would be grateful if you would let me have an early decision.

          Yours sincerely




          Sports Development Unit

Dear Mr Chester

Football and the C ommunity
Sheffield W e dn e sd a y Football Club PLC

     I am pleased to inform you that the Football Trust has
     decided to make a capital grant of 50% of the approved cost
     up to a maximum grant of £15,000 for the provision of an
     extension to the weight room and store for the sports hall.

     The grant is offered in recognition of the fact that the
     professional football club is providing sporting oppor­
     tunities for the general community.

     Please confirm acceptance of the grant by returning one
     copy of the enclosed declaration t      o         [ The Sports
     Council, 16 Upper Woburn Place, London WC1H 0 Q P . The
     declaration should be signed by a person authorised to do
     so on behalf of the Club.

 4   The grant will be paid in instalments as the work progresses
     by submitting statements of the value of the work completed
     to Mr J Patton at the address given in paragraph 3 above.
     Each instalment will be paid at the rate of 50% of the value
     of the work completed.  Not more than 90% of the grant will
     be paid until Form FT20 is received on completion of the
     work.  Before the final payment is made an inspection of
     the project is likely to be made by an officer of the
     Sports Council.

 Yours sincerely

     Dear Richard

     Football and the Community: Sheffield Wednesday FC

     As agreed, please find attached Sheffield Wednesday’s submission for a
     Football Trust grant which we have discussed briefly.

     I support our Yorkshire and Humberside region's recommendation that a grant
     of £15,000 be made by the Trust towards this project. I am informed by the
     region that the Club has developed community use of the facilities both at
     its training ground and at Hillsborough particularly through Keith Bannister,
     an ex-player.

     The Sports Council has previously made substantial grants to the Club -
     £49,000 in 1979 for the provision of a pavilion and floodlighting, and
     £66,384 for the changing accommodation, reception area, lounge and multigym
     at Hillsborough. In addition, £2,250 has been made available for the equip­
    ment to be used in this current proposal. These previous grants show the
     Sports Council1s commitment.

     I would be grateful if you would let me have an early decision.

     Yours sincerely

              FOOTBALL TRUST - SUMMARY OF TRANSPORT        "CIS


1*   Warwick Road (For Manchester United)

     Work is now in progress on this scheme.

     It is interesting to note that BT Police have decided to provide a new
     CCTV camera at the station linked to their central control room,paid
     forout of their own police budget.

2.   Wadsley Bridge Sheffield

     Considerable amount of work now completed.
         4

     BR requesting revised grant of £9,360 to cover shortfall from Department
     of the Environment Derelict Land Grant.

     Recommended that grant be approved.


3.   Proposed Rail Halt at Derby

     Considerable progress made in this matter.

     Funds now promised from Department of Trade and   In d u s try,Derby   City Council,
     Derbyshire County Council and Derby County FC.

     Recommended Trust approve grant of £125,000.

4.   Blackburn Proposed Rail Halt

     Ibis proposal is still under consideration by Lancashire County Council.

5.   Proposed New Rail Halt Birmingham City

     This proposal emanated from British Rail but as is the norm in most cases
     they are looking to others to fund.

     Their initial approach to the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive
     has been poorly received.
     I believe this to be a good scheme but there may be problems in attracting
     finanancial support to match any offer made by the Trust.

6.   Witton (For Aston Villa)

     Waiting for BR to respond on the matter of provision of a police control
     centre. We are still not aware of whether they are proceeding with the
     scheme.

7.   Leicester Station
     Interest now being shown by the Department of Trade and Industry who have
     indicated they will provide some financial support for the scheme. Active
     discussions in hand with BR.

     Now looking more promising.

           8.        Port Vale FC

                     Grant recommended for improvements to car park.

           9.        Preston North End FC

                     No justification for grant for transport or public order needs.

                     Any grant awarded can only be based on community or disabled persons
                     considerations.
                 *
           10.       Sunderland FC

                     Problems with car and coach parking.

                     Club now examining provision of new car park which if progressed may
                     lead to grant application.

           11.       Bristol City FC

                     Request by club for discussions on transport problems. To be examined.

           12.       Arsenal FC

                     Request for discussion on proposal by club.   To be examined.

           13.       Merseyside Local travel Arrangements

                     Awaiting proposals from British Rail and Merseyside Passenger Transport
                     Executive.

           14.       Liverpool and Everton Car Parking Arrangements

                     Awaiting information from Liverpool City Engineer regarding possible
                     examination into traffic flows to the two grounds.

           15.       Millwall Proposed New Rail Halt
                     Now waiting for London Underground to provide further information on the
                     possible underground extension, which if approved would provide a new
                     station adjacent to the stadium.
                     In the meantime BT Police propose certain alterations at New Cross Gate
                     BR station. To be examined.

           16.       Relocation of Walsall FC

                     West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive is interested in ensuring
                     suitable provision for rail passengers for the proposed new stadium.
                     To be examined.

           17.       Hull
                     Problems with rail movements to Boothferry Halt.   To be examined.

           18.       Newcastle
                     BT Police have advised me that there are some problems in the Newcastle
                     area and this will be examined.

19.   Leeds Proposed New Rail Halt
      Detailed discussions still taking place betv.\=~.      . - Lity Council and
      the property developers.
      This matter is becoming very protracted but I am advised by the City Council
      that they hope to be in a position to discuss the transport arrangements
      within the next month or two.

20.   Scottish Region BR

      Awaiting proposals from BR.

21.   York City. Control of Visiting Supporters
      The suggestion for a new rail halt was not supported by either the police
      or the club itself.
      An alternative suggestion made by the police to improve the exit arrangements
      at York station had considerable merit.
      This proposal was however rejected by BR as it conflicted with plans to
      extend the car park.

22.   Wembley Stadium
      There is an ambitious plan to improve access   fro m   Uembley Park station
      to Wembley Stadium via Olympic Way.
      It was initially thought that these were plans by Wembley Stadium Limited
      but after discussions with the interested parties it is now clear that
      it is a Brent Council proposal.
      Too early to comment on the proposal or to say if there would be any
      justification for a grant.

23.   Fulham Broadway (For Chelsea FC)
      Awaiting further developments in this somewhat complex situation.

Dear Mrs.   Finney,
Thank you for your letter o£ the 12th October, 1988.         I now have
details of the costs at W a d sl e y Bridge for w hich we wo u l d ask you to
consider grant aid.  I have tried to c o n t a c t d i r e c t ,         but
so far without success.     The items which cannot be covered by
Derelict Land Orant are:

  Renewal of basic platform lighting.                     £2700
  Tarmac on existing platform.                            £2000
  Repairs and minor work on platform.                     £2000

  20* of land reclamation costs        (not met
  by D.L.G. which covers 80*).                            £2660
                                                          £9360

The Trust's assistance in meeting these costs will be grea tl y
a p p r e c i a t e d . In your letter of 16th November, 1987 you did - d . c a t e
that the Trust would complete the funding required although at that
stage it was estimated that this would be some £6000.

I look forward to hearing from you.       If in the m e a n t i m e j o u or any of
the T r u s t ’s Officers would like either to come and visit " a * ® * ® *
Bridge or to discuss these items further, please do not he s itate to
 contact me.

Yours sincerely.

  Dear Sir

  Wadsley Bridge, Sheffield

  Thank you for your letfter of 21 September, which I have discussed with the
  Deputy Chairman.

   We are in agreement,     in principle,   that platform lighting may                                 be
   considered for grant aid. Perhaps you will advise me when you have                                  an
   indication of costings and we can discuss this further.

   Your/^>lincerely

Dear Mr Parkins

WADSLEY BRIDGE STATION

I would refer to the telephone conversation between             the Trust's
transport consultant, and Mr       your Area Passenger Manager.

As you will be aware Sheffield City Council have been discussing with us
the question of a grant towards the proposed work at Wadsley Bridge station.

We have now agreed with the Council that it would be more                                          sensible for
us to deal directly with yourself on the matter.

In 1986 the original cost of the scheme was £20,000 but we now understand
that this has increased to £24,000. We have been advised that the Depart­
ment o f the Environment have approved a grant of £18,000 towards the
project.  In the circumstances, the Trust will offer a grant o f £6,000 to
complete the full funding required.

This grant will be paid on written confirmation from yourself that the full
work has been completed. This being the normal procedure we have estab­
lished with British Rail with the other various schemes we have supported.

 Ynnrs sincerely

                         WADSLEY BRIDGE STATION




Background


Wadsley Bridge station is a disused passenger station on the former Great
Central Main Line from Sheffield to Manchester via the Woodhead Tunnel. This
line is now closed as a through route between Sheffield and Manchester and has
now been reduced to a single line freight route between Sheffield Woodbum
Junction and Deepcar, a few miles beyond Wadsley Bridge.

Whilst there are no regular passenger services over the line it is authorised
for the operation of special football trains to Wadsley Bridge,

Wadsley Bridge has the great advantage of being located within reasonable walking
distance of Hillsborough Stadium. A fact much appreciated by the police and
Civic Authorities.

The Operating circumstances at Wadsley Bridge are such that it is possible
to deal with a considerable number of special football trains at roughly 15
minute intervals. The trains remain at WadsleyBridge ready for their return
services resulting in minimum delay in loadingreturning supporters.

The station being unstaffed and out of regularuse has been subjected to a
considerable amount of local vandalism and is deterioratingfairly rapidly and
will soon become unfit to use.
British Rail decided that to allow the continued use of Wadsley Bridge for
special football trains the station buildings would need to be demolished and
the area landscaped. They costed a scheme in early 1986 at £20,000 and realising
the problem of obtaining internal BR funding for the scheme approached Sheffield
City Council to see if the City Council would provide a grant.

Sheffield City felt unable to do so but were aware of The Football Trust and
wrote to The Trust in September 1986 setting out the case and making application
for a grant. On 29 October 1986 the Trustees agreed to offer a grant of £10000
or 50% of the cost (whichever is less).

 In the meantime Sheffield City advised the local BR Area Manager to apply to
 the Department of the Environment for a Derelict Land Grant. After a considerable
 delay BR made such an application in April 1987. With the passage of time the cost
 had increased to £24,000 and this figure was used in the application to the
 Department of the Environment.


 Current Situation

 On 4 November I met representatives of Sheffield City Council and local BR
 Management took us to Wadsley Bridge to see the current situation.
 The Department of the Environment were contacted by Sheffield City and advised
 the City that a letter would be sent in the near future confirming that the
 Department would offer BR a suitable grant for the work at Wadsley Bridge.
 I agreed with the representatives of Sheffield City that they would drop out
 and The Football Trust would deal directly with the BR Area Manager on the
 further development of the matter.
                            If


In subsequent discussions with Sheffield City and BR Area Management it has
been confirmed that a letter has been received from the Department of the
Environment containing an offer of £18,000 grant towards a total cost of
£24,000.
The scheme is now not only fully funded but overfunded, taking account of the
earlier offer from The Trust and it would be wrong for BR to obtain financial
advantage from the situation.

Since BR advised the Department of the Environment that the total cost is now
£24,000 I cannot see how they can change this figure and The Trust should work
on the basis of this being a true figure.

This means that The Trust should reduce their grant to £6,000.



Action
A letter be sent to Sheffield City Council thanking them sincerely for all the
work they have put into this matter.

The BR Area Manager should be advised that The Trust is very pleased to learn that
the Department of the Environment has given them a grant of £18,000 and in the
circumstances The Trust will modify their offer to a grant of £6,000 to ensure
full funding of the scheme.

    Dear Sir,

    Wadsley Bridge Station

    Following my letter dated 25th November, 1986, I am writing to inform you of

•   the progress made in finding additional funding to supplement your grant
    of £10,000 or 50% of the cost towards reinstatement of Wadsley Bridge Station
    for the use of football supporters.  I am sorry for the delay in writing to
    you again, but the grant application process has taken some considerable time.

    I advised British Rail in November 1986 to apply for a Derelict Land Grant
    through the Department of the Environment.   Initial consultations between
    B.R. and the D.o.E. commenced in December 1986, but progress has been hampered
    by vacant posts in B i R . local management. On appointment of a new Area
    Manager, B.R. submitted an application to the D.o.E. in April 1987.   B.R. are
    currently waiting for a reply.

    B.R. intend to run football special trains to Wadsley Bridge on a temporary
    basis for the next season subject to the approval of their surveyor.

     I am also keeping Mr. McGee, Chairman of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
     informed of the progress.

     I will be in touch again once B.R. have heard from the D.o.E.

     Yours faithfully,




     Head of Joint Transportation Policy Unit

 Thank you for your letter of 21 January.

 We made our offer in respect of the Wadsley Bridge station in October,
 following a request from the Sheffield City Council.       I hope very
 much that the earlier difficulties about how the work would be
 undertaken have now been resolved, but you may like to make your
 own contacts locally. I am therefore sending you copies of the relevant
 correspondence.

    Dear Richard,
    I have received my copy of background paper on the work of the Football Trust
    dated December 1986.
    On page 6 it states that the Trust made a grant of flO,000 towards the cost
    of a railway halt for visitors to Hillsborough.
     I have studied the correspondence my predecessor, Dick Chester, had with
W    British Rail over this matter. It appears that the proposal foundered over
     t h e unions refusal to allow M.S.C. labour to undertake the work.


     Mv Chairman and Board are eager for the idea to be re-opened. Before doing
     so however? I need confirmation that the £10,000 referred to in your report
     is still earmarked for this scheme.
     I have tried telephoning you over the last ten days without success so I
     felt I should drop you a line to ascertain the current state of play.

     Kind regards.
     Yours sincerely,

 Thank you for your letter of 23 September about access to Sheffield
 Wednesday football ground.

 What you are proposing for Wadsley Bridge Station seems to make
 sense and I should be happy to put your request on the agenda for
 the next meeting of the Chairman's working party. In the meantime,
 it would be helpful if I could be sent a letter from British Rail confirm­
 ing that theyintend tocontinue using this line for football specials for the
 foreseeable future. (As we meet on 13 October, it would be helpful if
 I could hear from them by the end of next week)

  Dear Sir,

  Access to Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground

  A problem frequently occurs within the City of accommodating large numbers of

• football supporters of away teams. As you may be aware, football supporters
  visiting the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground currently travel on Football
  Special Trains to Wadsley Bridge Station.   This Station is not used for normal
  passenger services and the line is used for freight only on one track with the
  other track disused.

  I am writing to inquire whether you may have any funds available to provide safe
  accesfe to Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground by rail.

    British Rail inform me that the station buildings on both platforms are in a very
    poor state of repair and the British Transport Police are concerned about passenger
    safety. British Rail have stated that unless the buildings are demolished and
    the site landscaped, they will be unable to continue to use the Station for
    Football Special Trains.  All Football Special Trains would then terminate at
    Sheffield Midland Station in the City Centre.  This w o u l d present further problems
    of transport for supporters through the City by road.

     British Rail are not in a position to fund the demolition and landscaping alone,
^ ^ / h i c h is estimated to cost around £20,000.

    I understand that some recent work on Platform 6 at Nottingham Station to allow
    direct access for football supporters from a side street entrance was funded by
    the Football Trust together with the City and County Council.         I would, therefore,
    be grateful if you could indicate as soon as p o s s i b l e whether the Wadsley Bridge
    Scheme may be eligible for funding.

    Yours faithfully,




    Head of Joint Transportation Policy Unit

                                 DUTIES OF CORONER


1.   The duties of the Coroner are to enquire into the death including the
     cause of death of certain persons either by holding an inquest or by
     having a post mortem examination made.

2.   It is the duty of every person to give information which may lead to the
      Coroner having notice of circumstances requiring the holding of an
      inquest. Although this duty cannot be enforced in respect of individuals
      by any legal sanction, except where the duty is laid upon particular
      persons by statute if an inquest is not held then the township shall be
      anerced i.e. subject to a fine.

3.   Where two or more deaths have resulted from the same accident or
      occurrence bodies may lie within the jurisdictions of different Coroners
      for example because they have been taken to different hospitals. It may
      be expedient for one Coroner to hold the inquests into all fatalities.
      With the consent of the receiving Coroner another Coroner may order the
      removal of the body out of his jurisdiction into that of the Coroner who
      is to hold the inquests.

4.   Once a Coroner is seised of a death he must consider whether an inquest or
      post mortem examination is required or whether he should notify the
      Registrar of Births and Deaths that an inquest is unnecessary. In coming
      to a decision the Coroner must act upon the information of other persons
      and, if he has reasonable grounds for believing that the information is
      such as to call for an inquest or post mortem examination he must hold an
      inquest or order a post mortem examination to be made. He has no absolute
      right to hold an inquest in every case in which he chooses to do so. The
      fact that there is no evidence that a sudden death was due to violence or
      to unnatural causes is no reason for the Coroner not holding an inquest.

5.   If itappears to the Coroner either before he proceeds to hold an   inquest
      or in the course of an inquest begun without a jury that there is reason
      to suspect that the death occurred in circumstances the continuance or
      possible recurrence of which is prejudicial to the health or safety of the
      public or any section of the public he must summon a jury.

6.   Representation at inquest. Any person who in the opinion of the Coroner
     is a properly interested person is entitled to examine any witness at an
     inquest either in person or by Counsel or Solicitor. The Chief Officer of
     police unless interested otherwise than in that capacity must only be
     allowed to examine a witness by Counsel or Solicitor. The Coroner must
     disallow any question which in his opinion is not relevant or is otherwise
     not a proper question.

7.   Attendance of witnesses can be secured   either by message or formal
     summons.

8.   A Coroner's inquest is not bound by strict laws of evidence but they are
     usually observed. A witness is not bound to answer any question which may
     incriminate him.

9.   Scope of inquest. The proceedings and evidence at an inquest must be
     directed solely to ascertaining who the deceased was and how, when and
     where he came by his death. Neither the Coroner nor the jury may express
     any opinion on any matter outside the scope of the inquest except in the
     form of a recommendation concerned with preventing similar fatalities
      (Coroners Rules 1953 Rule 27).
No person is allowed to address the Coroner or the jury as to the facts.
When the Coroner sits with a jury he must sum up the evidence to the jury
and direct to them as to the law before they consider their verdict. He
must also draw the attention of the jury to the scope of the inquest and
to the rules regarding the framing of the verdict and the recording of
riders.

Publication of evidence. The publication of a fair and accurate report in
any newspaper of proceedings publicly heard before Courts exercising
judicial authority in the United Kingdom is privileged as regards the
proceedings for liable if published contemporaneously with such
proceedings. A Coroners Court is a Court exercising judicial authority.
No privilege attaches to a report however fair and accurate of judicial
proceedings properly heard in camera.

Comments on inquests published in newspapers may in certain circumstances
amount to contempt of Court punishable by the High Court.

Verdict and closing of inquest. After hearing the evidence the jury or
the Coroner as the case may be must return a verdict and certify it by an
inquisition in writing, setting forth, so far as such particulars have
been proved, who the deceased was and how, when and where he came by his
death and if he came by his death by murder manslaughter or infanticide
the persons if any whom the jury finds to have been guilty of such
offence. The jury or Coroner must also inquire of and find the
particulars for the time being required by the Registration Acts to be
registered concerning the death. The Coroner is bound to accept the
verdict of the jury, however perverse, though he may further direct and
charge them as to the law and as to the nature of the evidence given by
the witnesses. The verdict of the jury, when found, is formally recorded
in the inquisition. No verdict is to be framed in such a way as to appear
to determine any question of civil liability, and the Coroner must not
record any rider, unless it is, in his opinion, designed to prevent the
recurrence of a fatality similar to that in respect of which the inquest
is being held. (Coroners Rules 1953, RR.33.34). A rider is not part of
the verdict.

Contents and form of verdict.
1. Name of deceased.
2. Injury or disease causing death
3. Time place and circumstances in which the injury was sustained
4. Conclusion of the jury or the Coroner as to the death
5. Particulars required by the Registration Acts concerning the death

The conclusion of the Coroner as to the death is colloquically called the
verdict and notes as to the prescribed form of inquisition suggests the
form the verdict should be adopted. If the death is due to any cause that
the inquisition does not charge anybody with murder etc. then the
following recommended list of verdicts is available. Suicide, accident or
misadventure, justifiable or excusable homicide or an open verdict. No
distincition is drawn between accident and misadventure in the verdict.

                           HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER


       Inquiry into Crowd Safety and Control of Sports Grounds -
  Report of Mr. Justice Popplewell into the Bradford Fire Disaster and
       the death at Birmingham Football Ground on 11th May, 1985


                             TERMS OF REFERENCE

The Terms of Reference of the above Inquiry was,rto enquire with particular
reference to the events at Bradford City and Birmingham Football Grounds
on 11th May into the operation of the Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975 and
to recommend what if any further steps should be taken including any that
may be necessary under additional powers to improve both crowd safety and
crowd control at sports grounds .
                                v‘

Timetable
11th May - Disaster took place
13th May - Mr. Justice Popplewell was appointed to undertake Inquiry

A public inquiry was held into the Bradford Fire Disaster - a preliminary
hearing took place on 23rd May - the full hearing began on 5th June and
ended on 13th June. No public inquiry was held into the events at
Birmingham Football Ground.

Mr. Justice Popplewell presented his interim report to Parliament in July
1985 and the full report was presented to Parliament in January 1986.

Persons Involved
The following persons were appointed as assessors to the inquiry
1. The Chief Constable of Leicestershire
2. The former Chief Fire Officer of Greater Manchester

Areas covered by the final report
1. The Hejjssel Tragedy
2. Previous inquiries
3. The Safety at Sports Grounds Act
4. Crowd Control
5. Hooliganism

A list of the persons who gave evidence is enclosed.

The   Public Inquiry at Bradford
Mr.   Justice Popplewell considered three questions -
1.    How the fire started
2.    Why the fire started and why did itcause such casualties
3.    What lessons were there tolearn  for thefuture.

It is interesting to note that in the course of the inquiry Mr. Justice
Popplewell mentions a report that was presented to the Minister of Housing
and Local Government in 1969 which suggested that the responsibility
controlling of crowds behaviour was divided between the police and the
club - broadly that the police were responsible for the public
thoroughfares and the entry from the public thoroughfares into the ground,
whilst the club were responsible for the control of spectators inside.
Mr. Justice Popplewell agreed that this was indeed the case.

The report goes into great detail about every aspect of the two tragedies
and the responsibilities of the Health and Safety Executive, Local
Authorities, and the powers of the Fire Authority.
One paragraph is of interest to the current tragedy - paragraph 4.136-8 -
here Mr. Justice Popplewell made a suggestion to standardise perimeter
fencing. The FA was asked to set up a small working party to help the
clubs standardise a design but they declined the invitation.


The public inquiry does not seem to have been set up under any particular
legislative provision, rather simply by the Secretary of State.

                   DRAFT MEMORANDUM. TO THE TAYLOR INQUIRY




1.   The Association ;f Metropolitan Authorities represents the 36

Metropolitan District Councils, 31 London Boroughs, the City of London,

the Inner London Education Authority and the Joint Authorities responsible

for Police, the Fire Service and Public Transport in the Metropolitan

Areas. The Association's role is to promote and protect the interests of

its member authorities and the community they serve, to provide a forum

for member authorities to discuss and act collectively on matters of

conmon concern and to provide a service to member authorities, including

the dissemination of good practice.   The County of Merseyside includes the

districts of Knowsle2/, Liverpool, St. Helens, Sefton and Wirral where the

majority of the dead, the injured, their families, friends and neighbours

lived   The County of South Yorkshire includes the districts of Barnsley,

Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield.     The district councils appoint the

elected members to the Fire & Civil Defence Authorities and Police

Authorities.



2.   Since March 1983, the Association has maintained a Working Party on

Football, which is now called the Football Development Working Party.       In

1934, the Association published "Football Violence : The Metropolitan

Viewpoint" (copy appended) and the Association also gave evidence

before Mr Justice Pcpplewell in 1985.     The Association provides joint

secretariat services for Football's Family Forum which will also submit

evidence to the inquiry.



3.   The Association recognises that it would be possible for the Inquiry

'to interpret narrowly-i-fcs second term-of-reference-"to-make........           .

 recommendations about the needs of crowd control and safety at sports
grounds".   The Association urges the Inquiry to adopt the broadest

approach because



(a)    "the needs of crowd control and (crowd) safety" go beyond issues of

      movement, density, policing and building materials into areas of

       public policy such as responsibility for organisational procedures,

       co-ordination and liaison in the aftermath of disaster and medium to

       long-term commitments to victim support; and



(b)    "at sports grounds" interpreted narrowly would preclude the Inquiry

       from making recommendations on crowd control and safety at other large

       scale events such as pop concerts held elsewhere than in sports

       grounds.



A.    The Association recognises the necessity to balance the maintenance of

public order at large scale events with preserving the personal safety of

individual spectators.   While recognising the difficulties, faced by the

police and against the background of the police's commitment to maintain

public order and control during the causes celebres of the 1970s and 1980s

from Saltley Coke Depot through the "Winter of Discontent" and the inner

city disturbances to the miners' strike, the Association believes these

experiences may have bred an atmosphere in which order and control

considerations have predominantly flourished at the expense of

consciousness towards the safety of people as spectators.    The emphasis on

control and order detracts from a full awareness of public safety issues.



The Association also accepts that the operational considerations relating

to any sporting event are unique.    Not only is each football ground

different in terms of construction and environment, but crowd size and

demeanour are affected by many different factors such as the weather, the
importance of the natch, and the relationship between the clubs involved.

In these circumstances local knowledge is as crucial as any set of

centrally agreed guidelines.    Never'theless, principles relating to the

growth of community involvement in football set out in "Football Violence:

The Metropolitan Viewpoint" remain 23 valid today as they were in 1984

and the document was publicly endorsed by the then Minister for Sport,

Neil KscFarlane MP within weeks of publication.           The Association would ask

the Inquiry to give due weight to these principles in any recommendations

which it makes about the general context of the Hillsborough tragedy.



Furthermore the Association has long held, and will continue to take, the

view that any member of the public should have the same expectation of

safety at a public event whether this be an enclosed premises (such as a

theatre) in   the.open air, (a pop concert for example) or a sporting

stadium (football, cricket or rugby eg.).



5.    With specific regard to the circumstances at Hillsborough, the

Association's position is quite clear and was stated to Mr Justice

Popplewell.    At any football match, the playing surface constitutes a

major place of safety for spectators in the event of an emergency.            Whilst

recognising the need to maintain public order, the Association said that:



(a)    there should be a choice of alternative means of escape from a stand

       which would provide so far as is reasonably practicable, for spectators

       to turn their back on the source of the fire or other problem and

       travel to a place of safety;



(b)    each exit should have direct acge^s to open air and should be
                                  / S'          *
       separated from other exits/to'avoid funnelling people into a congested

!                        (c)    many seated stands are constructed so that people have to move

                                forwards and downwards in order to get out.      This means that they may

                                have to go towards the source of danger before reaching safety.              This

                                is contrary to the interests of public safety, and the guidance

                           6.   Since Hillsborough, the Association's secretariat has inspected the

                           anti-panic barrier now installed at the municipal stadium in Mimes, in

                         .operation, at -a-match- .Although the. .sys.tem .hag only, recently .been- .

                           introduced, it does appear to provide a means of maintaining public order
                                   and safety at the same time. The Association would hope that the system

                                   could be given ar. early trial in England to see if it is appropriate to

                                   conditions at an appropriate ground.         The cost of installing a complete

                                   system at an English ground would ':•= about £100,000.        Partial installation

                                   on existing fencing is estimated at around £40,000.          In addition, the

                                   system at Nimes includes other features which are worthy of consideration:



                                    (a)      there is far less casual, pay on entry, admission for matches.

                                            Tickets are a constant feature even for the standing enclosures,

                                             this means that for major events the police can turn away spectators

                                             in vehicles who do not have tickets at some distance from the ground.

(b)   Counselling anc support for victims and carers/rescuers:    the

      Association firmly believes governmental initiative and commitment

      are necessary in two major areas.   First, there is a need for

      guidance and training packages to be promulgated to local authorities

      and District Health Authorities (the Association is represented on

      the Department of Health/CRUSE Working Party.    Secondly, long term

      victim and rescuer/carer support is expensive. The Association

      understands Liverpool City Councl's additional commitment is around

      £2 million; and therefore urges the Inquiry to recommend prompt and

      full reimbursement by government to local authorities faced with the

      consequences of disaster among their people, families and

      communities.   The Association is aware that the Local Government and

      Housing Bill, clause 133 at Report stage, enables the Minister to

      codify the so called "Bellwin Rules" but is unconvinced that

      government has any commitment to meeting in full the financial costs

      of disaster.



(c)   Major disasters generate public appeals.   The law's complexities and

       inequities are well known from the experiences of recent disaster

       funds. The Assocition does not consider it necessary for every local

       authority to have a Disaster Appeal discretionary trust on the shelf,

       updated as experience and case law develop.    However, the danger of

       buying in the state of the art after the next disaster is that

       irrevocable decisions can be made early on.    The Association

       accordingly believes it would be sensible and prudent for government

       to issue guidelines on the establishment, administration and

      '•terminatiomo'f-disaster-appeals': ... " •*....... ..... ... . —    ' •*

                                                 dynamics. Because these departments know how crowds behave in tight

                                                 spaces, before d u r i n g anc a fter a majcr event   (like a semi-final or a

             for Police,      the Fire Service and Public Transport in the Metropolitan

             Areas.   The Association's role is to promote and protect the interests of

             its me mber authorities and the community they serve,          to provide a forum

             for m e m b er authorities    to discuss and act collectively on matters of

             common concern and to provide a service to member authorities,            including

             the dissemination of good practice.          The County of Merseyside includes the

             Authorities.




             2.   Since March 1983,       the Association has maintained a W o r k in g Party on

             Football,    which is now called the Football Development Worki n g Party.            In

             1934,    the Association published "Football Violence : The Metropolitan

   •••       Viewpoint"       (copy appended)   and the Association also gave evidence

             before Hr Justice Popplewell in 1985.           The Association provides joint

             secretariat services for Football's Family Forum which will also submit

             evidence to the inquiry.




             3.   The Association recognises that it would be possible for the Inquiry

- .......-to interpret -narrowly-its second term-of- reference-"to m a k e ................

             recommendations about the needs of crowd control and safety at sports
grounds".    The Association urges the Inquiry to adopt the broadest

approach because




(a)    "the needs of crowd control and     (crowd)   safety" go beyond issues of

       movement,   density,   policing and building materials into areas of

       public policy such as responsibility for organisational procedures,

       co-ordination and liaison in the aftermath of disaster and m e d iu m to

       long-term commitments to victim support;      and




(b)    "at sports grounds" interpreted narrowly would preclude the Inquiry

       from m ak i ng recommendations on crowd control and safety at other large

       scale events such as pop concerts held elsewhere than in sports

       grounds.




A.    The Association recognises the necessity to balance the main t e na n ce of

public order at large scale events with preserving the. personal safety of

individual spectators.        While recognising the difficulties, faced by the

police and against the background of the police's commitment to m aintain

public order and control during the causes celebres of the 1970s and 1980s

from Saltley Coke Depot       through the "Winter of Discontent" and the inner

city disturbances to the miners' strike,       the Association believes these

experiences m ay have bred an atmosphere in which order and control

considerations have predominantly flourished at the expense of

consciousness towards the safety of people as spectators.          The emphasis on

control and order detracts from a full awareness of public safety issues.




The Association also accepts that the operational considerations relating

to any sporting event are unique.        Not only is each football ground

different in terms of construction and environment, but crowd size and

demeanour are affected by many different factors such as the weather,         the
      ■ /

      /




importance of the natch,           and the relationship between the clubs involved.

In these circumstances local knowledge is as crucial as any set of

centrally agreed guidelines.            Nevertheless, principles relating to the

growth of community involvement in football set out in "Football Violence:

The Metropolitan Viewpoint"           remain as valid today as they were in 1984

and the document was publicly endorsed by the then Minister for Sport,

Neil HseFarlane MP within weeks of publication.            The Association would ask

the Incuiry to give due weight to these principles in any recommendations

which it makes about the general context of the Hillsborough tragedy.




Furthermore the Association has long held, and will continue to take,              the

vi ew that any m e mber of the public should have the same expectation of

safety at a public event whether this be an enclosed premises            (such as a

theatre)       in the. open air,    (a pop concert for example) or a sporting

stadium (football,        cricket or rugby eg.).




5.    With specific regard to the circumstances at Hillsborough,          the

Association's position is quite clear and was stated to M r Justice

Popplewell.         At any football match,    the playing surface constitutes a

major place of safety for spectators in the event of an emergency.              Whilst

recognising the need to maintain public order,            the Association said that:




(a)       there should be a choice of alternative means of escape from a stand

          which i-;ould provide so far as is reasonably practicable,     for spectators

            to turn their back on the source of the fire or other problem and

            travel to a place of safety;




(b)         each exit should have direct access to open air and should be

            separated from other exits to avoid funnelling people into a congested

            area;
(c)   many seated stands are constructed so that people have to move

      forwards and downwards in order to get out.          This means that they may

      have to go towards the source of danger before reaching safety.                This

      is contrary to the interests of public safety,          and the guidance

      document,   (Guide    to Safety at Sports Grounds) should be updated to

      limit the forward travel distance where there          is no alternative means

      of escape at the rear of the stand;




(d)   the training and      number of stewards at public events requires

      scrutiny.   Most are casually employed.          Measures are necessary    to

      ensure that their knowledge of the ground,          its safety systems and the

      correct procedures are of the highest o rder because of the public

      responsibility which they carry;




(e)   s p e c i f i c ‘measures w hich should be taken in respect of enclosure fences

      include : the siting o f emergency gates in fences at least at the same

      frequency as gangways;      such gates to be secured by panic bolts o r

      electronic switches; such gates to be manned by sufficient stewards;

      stewards to be trained      (see above); stewards to have independent

      communication with a central control point          (this is now m u c h easier

      w it h the development o f radios and portable telephones or possibly a

      numbe r of on-line call points fixed at strategic points).




       These points, w hich arose from      the Bradford fire disaster are equally

       applicable to the Hillsborough       tragedy.




6.    Since Hillsborough,    the Association's secretariat has inspected the

anti-panic barrier now installed at         the municipal stadium in Nicies,     in

.operation, at-a.match-     .Although the. .sys.tem Jha£ only, recently .been- . -

introduced,   it does appear to provide a means of m a in t ai n i ng public order
and safety at the same time. The Association would hope that the system

could be given ar. early trial in England to see if it is appropriate to

conditions at an appropriate ground.           The cost of installing a complete

system at an English ground v?ould be about £100,000.             Partial   installation

on e xisting fencing is estimated at around £40,000.             In addition,    the

system at Nimes includes other features which are worthy of consideration:




(a)      there is far less casual,      pay on entry, admission for matches.

         Tickets are a constant feature even for the st anding enclosures,

         this m e an s that for m aj o r events the police can turn away spectators

         in vehicles w ho do not have tickets at some distance from the ground.




(b)''    public responsibility for the event rests on the promoter.              Stadium

         proprietors are un d e r an obligation to act swiftly in the event of

         problems.    In addition, a designated official of the municipality is

         also present w ho has    the power to direct the proprietor to act in

         the interests of public safety.




7.      At this stage in the acquisition and evolution of experience from the

recent spate of major disasters including Hillsborough,              the Association

urges the Inquiry to build into its report and recommendations positive

and forward-looking views on a number of issues:




(a)     The powers,   practices and systems of local authorities'           planning for

        m a j o r disasters and responses to them.      These are addressed in detail

        in two documents accompanying the covering letter "Local Authorities

        and Peacetime Emergency Planning:         a Review of Current Arrangements

        and Proposals for Improvement"         (Jlovember 1988) and an amended

 '    ' Ve'rsion O f the"Ass'oci'atidn *'s' final 'submission' '(June '1989') "to'the "Home

        Offic e in an end e av o u r to influence the latter's Review of Peacetime
      Disasters.




(b)   Counselling anc support for victins and carers/rescuers:               the

      Association f i m l y   believes governmental    initiative and commitment

      are necessary in two m aj o r areas.    First,      there is a need for

      guidance and training packages to be promulgated to local authorities

      and District Health Authorities (the Association is represented on

      the Department of Health/CR'JSE Working Party.           Secondly,   long term

      victim and rescuer/carer support is expensive. The Association

      understands Liverpool City .Councl's additional commitment is around

      £2 million;    and therefore urges the Inquiry to recommend prompt and

      full reimbursement by government to local authorities faced with the

      consequences of disaster among their people, families and

      communities.     The Association is aware that the Local Government and

      Housing Bill,    clause 133 at Report stage,        enables   the Mi nister to

      codify the so called "Bellwin Rules" but is unconvinced that

      government has any commitment      to meeting in full         the financial costs

      of disaster.




(c)   Major disasters generate public appeals.            The law's complexities and

       inequities are well known from the experiences of recent disaster

       funds. The Assocition does not consider it necessary for every local

       authority to have a Disaster Appeal discretionary trust on the shelf,

       updated as experience and case law develop.           However,    the danger of

       buying in the state of the art after the next disaster is that

       irrevocable decisions can be made early on.           The Association

       accordingly believes it would be sensible and prudent for government

       to issue guidelines on the establishment,          administration and

      "termirratian'-of••disaster-appefals': ....   " •                                   •*
T he Association is aware that post - P o p p l e w e l l , building control

departments in local authorities are moving by virtu e of their

responsibilities fcr safe structures and buildings into the area of

training stewards and assisting the police on crowd movement and

dynamics. Because these departments know how crovids behave in tight

spaces, before d u ring and after a major event        (like a semi-final or a

Michael Jackscn concert),      the Association considers this emerging

trend should be encouraged by government and standard approaches

promulgated.    Equally, on site natch day inspections by appropriate

officials frcxs b u i l di n g control and fire prevention should also be

encouraged.    A vital issue is the need drastically to review the

recommendations of the metho d of calculation o f safe ground

capacities for terraced areas and viewing slopes as out l in e d in

Chapter 16 of the Home Office Guide to Safety of Sports Grounds.               The

"higher" figure of 54 persons per 10m2 for good terraced areas

(paragraph 222(a)    leaves no safety margin.       Hi g h priority should be

given to researching and reassessing this guidance.            The figure of 54

persons per 10m2 can produce crowds with a ve r y high packing density

which provides n o factor of safety whatsoever.          It is suggested that

a factor of safety of at least 25% should be built into this figure

thus producing a new "higher" figure of 40 persons per 10m2.




Where the playing area is considered to be a safe place for

evacuation from stands,      and there is a sta n d in g paddock or terrace

area between the stands and the playing area,          the packing density for

this terraced area should not exceed the lower figure of 26 persons

per 10m2 to reduce the risk of crushing in the event of forward

evacuation from the stands towards the playi n g area.




The incoming calls at Casualty Bureaux and hospital switcboards
     always cause the system to collapse.




     This is because the public telephone network does not have the

     capacity to absorb a, huge and unanticipated increase in calls.       The

     Association recognises that the perfect answer is unobtainable but

     recommends the Inquiry to take evidence on forthc o mi n g proposed

      improvements and assess their likely effectiveness.




8.   In conclusion,   the Association believes that public safety and public

order can be exercised to a high degree of compatibility in football

stadiums provided that the principles set out above are applied to the

particular circumstances of each individual ground and each event.

Improved standards of construction and training should assist the control

of each match, but this will need funding.    The funding required could be

provided by using a small percentage of the duty currently collected by

the Treasury from football pools.    This is a small s u m to pay f or ensuring

public safety.




The Association will be pleased to present more detailed technical or other

arguments to the Inquiry as appropriate.

The County Treasurer andthe Chief Fire Officer submitted reports on the
Capital Programme and Revenue Estimates 1976/77, together with an
Analysis of Variations betweenthe 1975/76 andthe 1976/77 Estimate,
statements showing uncommitted development andthe effect of a 5%
reduction in expenditure andprints of the Capital Programme and
Revenue Estimates.

The Chief Fire Officer indicated the adverse effect onthe operational
efficiency of the Fire Service, whichwas a highlylabour intensive force
(869b of the estimates being attributable to salaries andwages), if a 5%
reduction in expenditure were to be effected by introducing the whole of
the 'cuts' shown in the Reduction Statement.

RESOLVED - That the following recommendations be made to the
Budget Sub-Committee of the Policy Committee on the estimates documents
nowsubmitted:
(a)      that thebase Capital Programme be approvedwith a strong
recommendation that the additional schemes detailed in the
Appendix, with the exception of item 2 (Damall Road - Workshop
Hoists), should also be approved and included in the Capital Programme,

(b)     that the base Revenue Estimates be approved

(c)     that the Reduction Statement (total £191,850) be not approved
because of the adverse effect onthe standard of fire cover if they were to
be implemented, but that shouldsome cuts be inevitable, reductions
which might be implemented, albeit with reluctance, come from items
(1) Repairs and Maintenance (2) Nomex Fire Tunics and (5) Hose
replacements

(d)     that the Statement of Uncommitted Developments be approved
andthat the Committee press for its inclusion in the 1976/77
Estimates with the possible exceptionof item 9.

A joint report of the Chief Executive, the Chief Fire Officer and
the County Treasurer was submitted ontenders received for the
supply of breathing apparatus equipment necessary to continue the
programme of conversion topositive pressure equipment and to
replace some of the sets already in use whichwere obsolescent.
There was adequate provision in the 1978/79 Revenue Budget
tomeet the expenditure.

RESOLVED - That the tender from Draeger Safety Limited for
the supply of 20 breathing apparatus sets, 20 compressed air
cylinders, 40 conversion kits and 3 test box assemblies, in the
sumof £9,828, be accepted.

Ajoint report of the Chief Executive, the Chief Fire Officer and
the County Treasurer was submitted on tenders received for the
supply of safety lamps and charging racks needed to continue the
standardisation of equipment within the Brigade. There was a
mixture of safety handlamps in service, and it was intended that
the Oldhamminers' lampwouldbecome the standard issue. There
was adequate provision inthe 1978/79 Revenue Budget to meet
the expenditure.

RESOLVED - That the tender from OldhamBatteries Ltd. for the
supply of 8 battery chargers and 104 safety lamps, in the sumof
£3, 755, be accepted.

C.     Purchase of Triple Extension Ladder

A joint report of the Chief Executive, the Chief Fire Officer and
the County Treasurer was submitted on the need to purchase a
45 ft. alloy triple extension ladder.

Since formation of the County Fire Service in 1974, ladders
carried onpumping appliances hadbeenbased in the 'Angus 464',
manufacturedby Angus Fire Armour Ltd. to effect standardisation
throughout the Brigade fleet.


                              D.2
There were now25 such ladders within the Brigade which,
because of the nature of their use, were subject to regular testing
and required, by code of practice, thorough workshop inspection
and maintenance at 12 monthly intervals.

To ensure that all appliances were properly equipped, it was
essential for a spare ladder to be available for issue and use
during the periods when ladders were in the workshops for
servicing and repair.

RESOLVED - That approval be givsi to the purchase of one
'Angus 464' 45 ft. alloy triple extensionladder fromAngus Fire
Armour Ltd. at a cost of £1,069.

            It was agreed that the Co-ordinating Group would have
            wide terms of reference to provide an up-to-date exchange
            of information on matters relating to the Hillsborough

            Media relations will form an increasingly important aspect
            of the Authority's actions in response to the disaster.
            It was agreed that all responses to media enquiries for       All Members
            information would be drafted in the form of a press release

            PERSONNEL

            Concern was expressed regarding the confusion which
            had arisen in connection with the request for a full site
            plan of the Hillsborough stadium showing all relevant
            details, including barriers, improvements, amendments
            etc., as at 15th April 1989.

         It was recognised that Lord Justice Taylor had now ordered
         that all the Council's investigators should withdraw from
         the site, but it was still considered essential that the
         plan be prepared as soon as possible.                          Mr K Blount

         Arrangements to be made for liaison with Inquiry personnel

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER


MEETING HELD ON FRIDAY 21 APRIL 1989 AT 8.30 AM




Presents

Mr   H M Webster,      Mrs E Bashforth,   Mr DBownes,   Mr M Ogle
(Administration and Legal Department; Mr P O ’Neill (Chief Safety
Adviser); Mr K Blount and Mr G Levers (Building Surveyors Division);
Mr P Dent (Publicity Department); Hazel Smith (Conference Organiser);
Fran Homewood (Police Liaison Officer); Mr D W Purchon (Director
of Health and Consumer Services).

(1)   Minutes of Previous Meeting

      The Minutes of the last meeting were agreed.

(2)   Matters Arising

      Mr Blount indicated that the detailed site plan of the Leppings
      Lane end ofSheffield Wednesday was well on       the way and it
      should be available for the meeting on Monday.       Mr Webster
      mentioned that the Director of Design and Building Services
      had offered    model making facilities for   the Inquiry and it
      was generally felt that this would be a useful move.

      Mr Dent said that he was being pressed by "The Sunday Times"
      on the Hillsborough issue.    Mr Webster said that he also had
      had contact with them.     It was agreed that it must be said
      to the press that this whole issue was a question of priorities.
      Mr O'Neill agreed to sort out "The Sunday Times" and explain
      the pressures on the Council and that as a Judicial Inquiry
      is shortly to begin there is no further comment that can be
      made.   Mr  Dent mentioned that the press refused to      accept
      this view from the Press Office.

(3)   Minute Silence

      Mr Dent said that it had apparently now being agreed that
      the buses would be stopped in the City Centre at 3.05 tomorrow
      afternoon, the traffic signals would be put at red in Barker's
      Pool and the Cathedral Bells would be likely to toll at the
      same time. Apparently in Nottingham there will be a ceremonial
      lowering of flags with the Lord Mayor in attendance. Apparently
      the Clubs have been asked by the Football Association to also
      organise a minute'ssilence.     It   was   also mentioned that
      Councillor Price had made comments to the press about the
      possible effect of Hillsborough on the World Student Games.

(4)    Inquiry Venue

       There had been a meeting between      Bob Whally, Bill Brendan
       (both of the Home Office), Chief Superintendent Don Denton,
       a representative of the Central Office of Information, Hazel
       Smith and Pat O'Neill about the possible venues for the Inquiry.
/
/

          It was made clear that the Judge was particularly sensitive
          that the venue should be of a suitable capacity and there
          was an indication that on the provisional start date (28 April)
          the Octagon Centre might be used.      There were still on-going
          discussions between Mr Whally and the Judge.     Mr Webster felt
          that the Council Chamber was perhaps the "right" venue in
          that it was dignified, etc.       There is also the possibility
          of closed circuit television and it will be necessary for
          stewarding to be provided and rooms for Counsel.      Mr Webster
          also mentioned that it could also be possible to use the Council
          Chamber and Members' offices which are all reasonably close
          together.    The idea being to keep the Conference Room and
          the   Committee   Rooms   free  for ordinary Council business.
          Apparently the estimate for the length of the Inquiry is six
          to eight weeks but it could last as long as three months.
          Mr Webster said that he would update Members on the situation.
          There were     also questions    about how to charge for the
          accommodation,    'phones, etc.    Mr Dent said that Canon (a
          supplier of photo-copies, etc) may well be prepared to offer
          facilities to the Inquiry.      It was mentioned that there were
          advantages to having the Inquiry in the Town Hall.

          Mr O'Neill announced that, with effect from today,         he was
          full-time employed in relation to the Inquiry.       All   contact
          from the West Midlands Police should go through him.

          According to Mr Dent, Mr Ware of the Octagon had announced
          to the press last night that he had made arrangements for
          the Inquiry to take place at the University. Mr O'Neill said
          that he would talk to him.

    (5)   Letter to Sheffield Onited/Press Release

          These copies were available and Mr Dent circulated           press
          releases to date and an example of the cutting service.

    (6)   Licensing Documentation

          Mrs Bashforth said that theHome Office had been sent copies
          of the    Safety  Certificate    Plans.    Mr Webster said that
          apparently the Home Office has briefed Counsel, possibly because
          Hillsborough is regarded as one of the safest stadia in the
          country and there may possibly be criticism of the Green Guide.
          Mrs Bashforth went on to say that the Head of Department's
          room would be used as secure accommodation for the storage
          of documents, etc. She said that she was preparing an annatated
          Safety of Sports Ground Act and that a memorandum to Chief
          Officers had been prepared,     indicating that they    would not
          release information unless it was publicly accessible.          If
          the   release of    information    was    appropriate   in   given
          circumstances, records must be made of the disclosures and
          sent to this Department.     At this point Mr Webster, Frances
          Homewood and Mr Blount left the meeting (at 9.00 am).           Mr
          Purchon arrived shortly afterwards.      There was some discussion
          about the release of planning information and, as explained
          by Mr Levers, that planning applications are public but not
          building regulation applications.       Apparently there was some
          problem in the Land and Planning Department yesterday and
          staff are now instructed to, if at all possible, take notes
of the person requiring the information.       Mr  Purchon said
it would be right to err on the side of caution in the release
of information area.    Mrs Bashforth said that     there was a
danger that if the information was insufficient or incomplete
the press would probably draw the wrong conclusions and Mr
Dent agreed with this.     Building regulation applications can
only be shown to another person with the consent of the
Architect (presumably who drew them).      Mr Levers said that
a lot of people had been in the Department earlier this week.

New Developments

Mr Bownes mentioned that Sheffield United would be playing
at Bramall Lane on 25 April (Mansfield), 1 May (Aldershot)
and 6 May (Swansea).    Mr Dent mentioned at this point that
he had people asking him how they would give evidence to the
Inquiry.   Mr O'Neill confirmed that there will be a press
statement issued shortly with a 'phone number.

Mr Purchon asked "what happens if the police do not come up
with the Operational Plan which they promised at the meeting
on 19 April". Mr Bownes said that Mr Broomhead had promised
to let him have copies of it today.     Mr Purchon asked if we
should check that    the plan was satisfactory.   Mrs Bashforth
explained that crowd control, policing, etc, was really the
prerogative of the Police and that the Council would be hard
pressed to criticise the police plan unless they had particular
expertise in that area.     Mr Purchon mentioned that the most
useful question that can be asked on the plans is "What if?".
Mr Purchon mentioned that the plans were important and that
he needed them for Sheffield United, Sheffield Wednesday and
Owlerton.

Mr Levers mentioned the safety work     at Sheffield Wednesday
which apparently involved protective    works.  It was agreed
that this was a separate issue.

Mr Sewell joined the meeting for a short time at this point
and mentioned that Liverpool City Council’s Solicitors’ Office
had offered local statement taking facilities in Liverpool
for fans. There is the question as to whether the investigating
police officers knew about this and the Judge.        Mr Sewell
said that he did     not think that the decision had yet been
made.   Apparently   the Fire Service has been   promised nine
hours of BBC videos and Mr Purchon wondered if the Council
could have access to the same facilities.    He mentioned again
the plans required for Sheffield United.

Mr Purchon said that he had been contacted by the Casualty
Consultants at the Northern General and the Hallamshire, who
indicated that lessons on First Aid and medical facilities
could be learned from a disaster.  They specifically mentioned
"Disaster Packs" and had asked for a meeting on this subject.
It was agreed that use should be made of the advice of the
professional staff.  Mr Purchon wondered whether it was worth
the Council having Disaster Packs and the Peacetime Emergency
Plan was mentioned.   Mrs Bashforth said it would be useful
//■


            to receive the advice but the Council could not really discuss
            the arrangements actually at Hillsborough on Saturday, obviously
            owing to the on-going Inquiry.

            The question of a visit to United, prior to the match tomorrow,
            was discussed.    It was agreed that there should be a meeting
            in the Administration and Legal Department office at 3.30
            pm today to look at the police operational plan and then to
            visit the stadium. Mr Purchon mentioned that the ground should
            be told of the visit and to ensure that spot welding of the
            perimeter fencing should take place, as and where required,
            before the visit.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER


MEETING HELD ON FRIDAY 21 APRIL 1989 AT 8.30 AM



Present:

Mr H M Webster,      Mrs   E Bashforth,  Mr D Bownes,     Mr M Ogle
(Administration and Legal Department; Mr P O'Neill (Chief Safety
Adviser); Mr K Blount and Mr G Levers (Building Surveyors Division);
Mr P Dent (Publicity Department); Hazel Smith (Conference Organiser);
Fran Homewood (Police Liaison Officer); Mr D W Purchon (Director
of Health and Consumer Services).

(1)   Minutes of Previous Meeting

      The Minutes of the last meeting were agreed.

(2)   Matters Arising

      Mr Blount indicated that the detailed site plan of the Leppings
      Lane end of Sheffield Wednesday was well on the way and it
      should be available for the meeting on Monday.       Mr Webster
      mentioned that the Director of Design and Building Services
      had offered model making facilities for the Inquiry and it
      was generally felt that this would be a useful move.

      Mr Dent said that he was being pressed by "The Sunday Times"
      on the Hillsborough issue.    Mr Webster said that he also had
      had contact with them.     It was agreed that it must be said
      to the press that this whole issue was a question of priorities.
      Mr O'Neill agreed to sort out "The Sunday Times" and explain
      the pressures on the Council and that as a Judicial Inquiry
      is shortly to begin there is no further comment that can be
      made.   Mr Dent mentioned that the press refused to accept
      this view from the Press Office.

(3)   Minute Silence

      Mr Dent said that it had apparently now being agreed that
      the buses would be stopped in the City Centre at 3.05 tomorrow
      afternoon, the traffic signals would be put at red in Barker's
      Pool and the Cathedral Bells would be likely to toll at the
      same time. Apparently in Nottingham there will be a ceremonial
      lowering of flags with the Lord Mayor in attendance. Apparently
      the Clubs have been asked by the Football Association to also
      organise a minute's silence.      It was also mentioned that
      Councillor Price had made comments to the press about the
      possible effect of Hillsborough on the World Student Games.

(4)   Inquiry Venue

      There had been a meeting between Bob Whally, Bill Brendan
      (both of the Home Office), Chief Superintendent Don Denton,
      a representative of the Central Office of Information, Hazel
      Smith and Pat O'Neill about the possible venues for the Inquiry.
      It was made clear that the Judge was particularly sensitive
      that the venue should be of a suitable capacity and there
      was an indication that on the provisional start date (28 April)
      the Octagon Centre might be used.      There were still on-going
      discussions between Mr Whally and the Judge.      Mr Webster felt
      that the Council Chamber was perhaps the "right" venue in
      that it was dignified, etc.       There is also the possibility
      of closed circuit television and it will be necessary for
      stewarding to be provided and rooms for Counsel.       Mr Webster
      also mentioned that it could also be possible to use the Council
      Chamber and Members' offices which      are all reasonably close
      together.    The idea being to keep the Conference Room and
      the   Committee   Rooms   free for ordinary Council business.
      Apparently the estimate for the length of the Inquiry is six
      to eight weeks but it could last as long as three months.
      Mr Webster said that he would update Members on the situation.
      There were     also questions about     how to   charge for the
      accommodation,    'phones, etc.    Mr Dent said    that Canon (a
      supplier of photo-copies, etc) may well be prepared to offer
      facilities to the Inquiry.      It was mentioned that there were
      advantages to having the Inquiry in the Town Hall.

      Mr O ’Neill announced that, with effect from today,        he was
      full-time employed in relation to the Inquiry.       All   contact
      from the West Midlands Police should go through him.

      According to Mr Dent, Mr Ware of the Octagon had announced
      to the press last night that    he had made arrangements for
      the Inquiry to take place at the University. Mr O'Neill said
      that he would talk to him.

(5)   Letter to Sheffield United/Press Release

      These copies were available and Mr Dent circulated           press
      releases to date and an example of the cutting service.

(6)   Licensing Documentation

      Mrs Bashforth said that the Home Office had been sent copies
      of the    Safety Certificate    Plans.    Mr Webster said that
      apparently the Home Office has briefed Counsel, possibly because
      Hillsborough is regarded as one of the safest stadia in the
      country and there may possibly be criticism of the Green Guide.
      Mrs Bashforth went on to say that the Head of Department’s
      room would be used as secure accommodation for the storage
                                                        .      /        O   '
      of documents, etc. She said that she was preparing an annotated           i
      Safety of Sports Ground Act and that a memorandum to Chief
      Officers had been prepared, indicating that they 4j$t>uld not
 '‘   release information unless it was publicly accessible.         If
      the   release   of   information    was   appropriate  in   given
      circumstances, records must be made of the disclosures and
      sent to this Department.     At this point Mr Webster, Frances
      Homewood and Mr Blount left the meeting (at 9.00 am).          Mr
      Purchon arrived shortly afterwards.     There was some discussion
      about the release of planning information and, as explained
      by Mr Levers, that planning applications are public but not
      building regulation applications.      Apparently there was some
      problem in the Land and Planning Department yesterday and
      staff are now instructed to, if at all possible, take notes
      of the person requiring the information.         Mr Purchon said
it would be right to err on the side of caution in the release
of information area.    Mrs Bashforth said that there was a
danger that if the information was insufficient or incomplete
the press would probably draw the wrong conclusions and Mr
Dent agreed with this.    Building regulation applications can
only be shown to another person with the consent of the
Architect (presumably who drew them).      Mr Levers said that
a lot of people had been in the Department earlier this week.

Mew Developments

Mr Bownes mentioned that Sheffield United would be playing
at Bramall Lane    on 25 April (Mansfield), 1 May (Aldershot)
and 6 May (Swansea).    Mr Dent mentioned at this point that
he had people asking him how they would give evidence to the
Inquiry.   Mr O'Neill confirmed that there will be a press
statement issued shortly with a 'phone number.

Mr Purchon asked    "what happens if the police do not come up
with the Operational Plan which they promised at the meeting
on 19 April".   Mr Bownes said that Mr Broomhead had promised
to let him have    copies of it today.  Mr Purchon asked if we
should check that the plan was satisfactory.      Mrs Bashforth
explained that crowd control, policing, etc, was really the
prerogative of the Police and that the Council would be hard
pressed to criticise the police plan unless they had particular
expertise in that area.      Mr Purchon mentioned that the most
useful question that can be asked on the plans is "What if?".
Mr Purchon mentioned that the plans were important and that
he needed them for Sheffield United, Sheffield Wednesday and
Owlerton.

Mr Levers mentioned the safety work     at Sheffield Wednesday
which apparently involved protective    works.  It was agreed
that this was a separate issue.

Mr Sewell joined the meeting for a short time at this point
and mentioned that Liverpool City Council's Solicitors' Office
had offered local statement taking facilities in Liverpool
for fans. There is the question as to whether the investigating
police officers knew about this and the Judge.        Mr Sewell
said that he did not think that the decision had yet       been
made.   Apparently the Fire Service has been promised      nine
hours of BBC videos and Mr Purchon wondered if the Council
could have access to the same facilities.    He mentioned again
the plans required for Sheffield United.

Mr Purchon said that he had been contacted by the Casualty
Consultants at the Northern General and the Hallamshire, who
indicated that lessons on First Aid and medical facilities
could be learned from a disaster.    They specifically mentioned
"Disaster Packs" and had asked for a meeting on this subject.
It was agreed that use should be made of the advice of the
professional staff.   Mr Purchon wondered whether it was worth
the Council having Disaster Packs and the Peacetime Emergency
Plan was mentioned.    Mrs Bashforth said it would be useful
to receive the advice but the Council could not really discuss
the arrangements actually at Hillsborough on Saturday, obviously
owing to the on-going Inquiry.
      The question of a visit to United, prior to the match tomorrow,
      was discussed.    It was agreed that there should be a meeting
      in the Administration and Legal Department office at 3.30
      pm today to look at the police operational plan and then to
      visit the stadium. Mr Purchon mentioned that the ground should
      be told of the visit and to ensure that spot welding of the
      perimeter fencing should take place, as and where required,
      before the visit.

(8)   Date and Time of Next Meeting

      The next meeting will be held on Monday 24 April at 9.00 am
      in the Head of Department's office.

      Stadium would be available for     the meeting on Monday.   The
      Director   of Design and Building    Services has offered model
      making facilities for the Inquiry.

      Reference was made to the pressure which was being exerted
      by the Press. The Group re-iterated the view that as a Judicial

      made at this time.

      will also be held in Nottingham and Liverpool and at soccer
      matches.

(4)   Inquiry Venue

      Following meetings with Home Office representatives regarding
      the venue for the Inquiry a provisional start date of 28 April
      was suggested and it was confirmed during the course of the
      meeting that the venue would be the Town Hall.       The Group
      considered the possibility of closed circuit television and
      the necessity for stewarding to be provided and rooms for
      Counsel.   The official estimate for the length of the Inquiry
      was six to eight weeks but it was possible that it would last
      considerably longer.    Many outstanding questions remained,
      including how to charge for the accommodation, 'phones, etc.
      Mr Dent was requested to investigate any offer of facilities
      for the Inquiry.

      Mr O'Neill announced that, with effect from today,         he was
      full-time employed in relation to the Inquiry.       All   contact

      of the safest stadia in the country.

      Mrs E Bashforth also stated that she was preparing an annotated

      the   release   of   information   was   appropriate  in   given
      circumstances, records must be made of the disclosures and
      sent to this Department.      There was some discussion about
      the release of planning information and Mr Levers explained
      that planning applications are public but building regulation
      applications are not.     Following problems    in the Land and
      Planning Department yesterday staff are now instructed to
      take notes of the person requiring the information.      It was
      agreed it would be right to err on the side of caution in
      the release of information area.       It was pointedout that
      building regulation applications can only be shown to another
      person with the consent of the Architect.

(7)   New Developments

      Mr Bownes mentioned that Sheffield United would be playing
      at Bramall Lane on 25 April (Mansfield), 1 May (Aldershot)
      and 6 May (Swansea).  It was agreed that a further meeting
      be held at 3.30 pm today to consider issues relating to the
      Bramall Lane Stadium.

      Mr Purchon questioned the position if the police do not make
      available the Operational Plan today as promised.   Mr Purchon
      was of the    opinion that we should check that the plan was
      satisfactory.   Mrs Bashforth explained that crowd control,
      policing, etc, was really the prerogative of the Police and
      that the Council would be hard pressed to criticise the police
      plan unless they had particular expertise in that area. Mr
      Purchon emphasised that the plans were required for Sheffield
      United, Sheffield Wednesday and Owlerton stadia.

      Mr Sewell reported that Liverpool City Council's Solicitors'
      Office  had offered    local  statement   taking  facilities in
      Liverpool for fans but it was not known whether Lord Justice
      Taylor and the investigating police officers knew about this
      offer.   It was stated that the Fire Service has been promised
      nine hours of BBC videos and Mr Purchon queried whether the
      Council could have access to the same facilities.

      Mr Purchon said that he had been contacted by the Casualty

      Mrs Bashforth said it would be useful to receive the advice
      but the Council could not discuss the arrangements actually
      at Hillsborough on Saturday or arrangements at any other ground,
      obviously owing to the on-going Inquiry.

(1)   Inquiry Arrangements

      It was confirmed that the Inquiry by Lord Justice Taylor would
      commence on Friday 28 April in the Town Hall.     It is thought,
      however, that the Inquiry will not begin the hearing of evidence
      from witnesses for several weeks.

      on the arrangements for the removal of the gates in the
      perimeter fencing at the Stadium.

      Owlerton Stadium

      David Purchon identified areas of concern at the Owlerton
      Stadium which must be considered during a formal inspection Hr D Bownes
      in the near future.

      It was stressed that the inspection arrangements in respect
      of stadia in the City must be undertaken on a thoroughly
      professional but low-key basis.
      Hillsborough Stadium

      It was stated that the first priority as respects the inspection
      of stadia, must be the arrangements for the football match
      at Hillsborough Stadium between Sheffield Wednesday and West
      Ham United on Saturday 29 April.

      It was agreed that Pat O'Neill would make preliminary contact
      with South Yorkshire Police    to clarify whether the matchwould
      proceed and, on the receipt    of confirmation of the eventbeing Mr    P O'Neil!!.
      held, a meeting be arranged as soon as possible with all
      interested parties at the Stadium on Tuesday 25 April to agree
      the detailed arrangements for the match.

(3)   Licensing Documentation

      It was reported that the licensing documentation file in respect
      of the Hillsborough Stadium would be ready by tomorrow.

      It was agreed that similar      files be established for theother Mr   D Bownes
      stadia in the City.

(4)   New Developments/Other Issues

             by the BBC.

      (b)    The Municipal Mutual Insurance Company have appointed
             Keeble, Hawson (Solicitors) to act on their behalf
             in respect of the incident.

             The Group was given a clear instruction that they must      All Members
             not, in any circumstances, discuss the nature of the
             events relating to the incident with any person outside
             the Group without first obtaining clearance through

      the Council's Officers involved to attend at the Stadium         All Members

      Officers/departments should refrain from conducting separate
      negotiations with the Club.

should be given publicity but that the two telephone lines
and their respective purposes should remain clearly separate
and independent from each other.      Attention was drawn to

as to which line/service they required and Phil Dent was          Mr P Dent
required to investigate how this might best be arranged.

                Consultants from the Sheffield Health Authority,

                be of use in potential emergency situations.

          (c)   No decision to be taken at present regarding the
                venue for the resumed Inquest although the Memorial

      notification    had not been conveyed directly to     the
      Local Authority     although the Club were now looking
      to make arrangements to hold        the match with West
      Ham United on 9 May.      Furthermore, the Club had also
      requested   the   Works   Department   to undertake   the
      necessary remedial work on their behalf in view of
      the shortage of time available.

                                                                        ACTION


(   1)      MINUTES

            The Minutes of the meeting of the     Group held   on   3
            May 1989 were received and noted.

(   2   )   INSPECTION ARRANGEMENTS

            Bramall Lane Stadium

            The   Group  noted   the  current   position   and the
            developments which were taking place in connection
            with the inspection of the Bramall Lane Stadium.

            Hillsborough Stadium

            The Group noted the arrangements which had been made
            to enable 'First Division' football matches to resume
            at the Hillsborough Stadium on 9 May.     It was stated
            that a charge would be made in respect of certain           Mr G Levers
            work carried out by the Authority in this matter.

            Attention was also drawn to recent speculation within
            the press regarding potential problems which might
            arise on Saturday 13 May due to the anticipated influx
            of many fans from Middlesborough, without tickets
            for the match.

            It was agreed to enquire what arrangements the South        Mr P O'Neill
            Yorkshire Police were making to deal with this problem.

            INQUIRY UPDATE

            It was reported that Lord Justice Taylor had extended
            his thanks to the City Council for their co-operation
            and assistance in the arrangements for the Inquiry
            to commence on 15 May.
I


           Widespread press coverage was anticipated, particularly
           during the first few days of the Inquiry although
           it might well be possible to release certain elements
           of the accommodation 'earmarked'     for the Inquiry,
           including a part of the Reception Suite, if and when
           the level of demand becomes clear.

           It was also reported that the Coroner had expressed
           the desire for similar arrangements to be provided
           for the resumed Inquest.    This was viewed with some
           caution by the Group at the present time, pending
           clarification of the implications, particularly with
           regard to finance and accommodation.

    (4 )   FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF INQUIRY

           It was reported that the Home Office had agreed to
           meet all reasonable costs arising from the Inquiry
           by Lord Justice Taylor.

           As costs were being incurred by a number of departments
           throughout the Authority, both in respect of the
           Inquiry and the wider implications arising from the
           disaster, it was agreed that an approach be made
           to the City Treasury to establish a structure to          Mr M Ogle
           collect and evaluate all the financial data and cost
           implications to the Authority, with a view to the
           preparation of an appropriate submission to the Home
           Office and, if necessary, a report to the Policy
           Committee in due course.

           With this in mind, officers were reminded of the
           need to record details of any action taken and costs      All Members
           incurred in connection with the disaster.

    (5 )   LICENSING DOCUMENTATION

            It was reported that a meeting would be held this
            day with Counsel to consider the Authority's position
            as respects the Inquiry.      It was suggested that,
            if possible, the Authority should aim to put forward
            positive recommendations to the Inquiry.    Attention
            was also drawn to the rigid nature of the Authority's
I          powers in the area of safety/licensing and it was
|          considered that a greater degree of flexibility might
f          well be recommended as a way forward,
r
I   (6 )   REPORTS TO POLICY COMMITTEE

           The Group were reminded of the need for all reports
           relating to aspects of the Hillsborough Disaster
           to be submitted to the Policy Committee via Mr M
           Webster.   It was stated that a formal report on the
           disaster would be prepared by Mr D Purchon for            Mr D Purchon
           submission to the Committee as soon as possible.
        Discussions were to be held with the Leader and/or       Mr M Webster
        Deputy Leader to obtain their views on the method
        of dealing with the financial/staffing issues arising
        from the disaster.

(7)     OTHER ISSUES

        It was noted that, at the request of the West Midlands
        Police, a copy of the Council's Scheme for Major
        Peacetime Emergencies had been forwarded to their
        Inquiry Team.   Interest had also been shown regarding
        the actions taken by the Council immediately following
        the disaster, although no request for a formal report
        on this action had yet been received.

(8)     FUTURE MEETINGS

        It was agreed that future meetings of the Working
        Group be held on an ad-hoc basis as and when required.

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975                                            '

Following approval by the County Council and clarification of certain
structural aspects of the South Stand construction, I am now able to formally
issue the attached General Safety Certificate in respect of the Hillsborough
Stadium.

As previously mentioned to you, the fee payable has yet to be determined by
the County Council and I will, of course, contact you further on this point
as soon as possible.

I would particularly draw your attention to the following paragraphs of
Schedule 2 of the Certificate:-                                '■■ ■■,

^ '!)       ~        the existing First Aid facilities are accepted on an interim basis
                     only pending the erection of purpose-built facilities in the 1980
                     close season;

12(1)        - the arrangements for Emergency Lighting in the South Stand (as set
               out in the letter from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners to the South
            - Yorkshire County Fire Service dated 12th December, 1979) are
               regarded as acceptable only for the duration of the existing :
               Battery life;                                                •

14          - the existing Police facilities are accepted on an interim basis only

                                     and
            - use of the Stadium in excessively high snowfall conditions.

Perhaps you would also treat this letter as the formal notice of issue requir id
by Paragraph 7 of the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976.

                          HILLSBOROUGH ENQUIRY


I spoke to Graham Mackrell at approximately 1.15 p.m. on Tuesday, 18th
April, 1989.  He told me that the Cl ub will not use the whole of the
Leppings Lane Terrace for the rest of the season.

He also went on to say at the direction of the Judge heading the enquiry
Mr. Mervin Jones, the Assistant Chief Constable of West Midlands Police
would, in future, take charge of all matters pertaining the investigation
at the stadium.  Mr. Mackrell also mentioned that, in future, all visits
should be co-ordinated by Mr. Jones.  Apparently Mr. Jones also wishes to
avoid duplication of enquiries and that perhaps some arrangements can be
made in connection with the interview of witnesses.  I should point out
that all this information was received third hand.  Mr. Jones can be
contacted on 021 2365000 ext. 2025.  Obviously he will not always be in
his office but he can be contacted via "bleep".

            HILLSBOROUGH - MEETING WITH LIVERPOOL DELEGATION, WEDNESDAY 19 APRIL
            1989

            You will perhaps recall that during the course of the above meeting
            certain of the Liverpool representatives raised certain issues and
            in fact asked for copies of certain documentation.

            I now enclose, for your information and attention, a list of the
            matters which they requested but I think       weneed to give further
            thought as to whether we should in fact comply with those requests.
            My inclination, at the moment, is that we should not action the
            same unless they start to press for theinformation       and  at that
            stage to discuss amongst ourselves and probably with the Council's
            Insurers' Solicitors the release of the documents.

            However, I think that certain of the issues they raised could be
            checked upon so that we have the information tohand.
MEETING WITH LIVERPOOL DELEGATION - WEDNESDAY 19 APRIL 1989


(1)   Copy of the Operational Orders for the semi-final last year.

(2)   Largest attendance on   all ticketgames.

(3)   Largest attendance at   the Stadium for payment at turnstile.

(4)   Number of turnstiles?

(5)   How many open on the day?

Re:
                       | i mT] fijM llii
We confirm our discussion of the 21st April, when it was agreed that
Mr. A. Gregory of Keeble Hawson Solicitors, Sheffield would on our joint
b e h a l f instruct Mr. Richard Maxwell Q.C. and Mr. Michael Murphy of Council
to represent our interest at the forthcoming Public Enquiry into the
Hill s b o r o u g h Football Stadium Disaster, and also in respect of Civil Claims
w h i c h may arise against you in that connection.

W e believe that Mr. Gregory has arranged that any letters of claim be sent
direct to h im but, we have n ow agreed with him that it would be preferable if
all intimations of claim made against you arising out of this incident be
f o r w a r d e d direct to us in order that we may allocate the appropriate sub file'
n u m b er before p a s s in g them to Keeble Hawson.

This will enable us to identify each claimant against the definitive list
t h a t we ®ire- hol d i n g and to keep control of all the claims that arise.

W e agree th a t the documentation that y ou were to prepare on general matters
rel a t i v e to this enquiry can, of course, go direct to Keeble Hawson.

Y o u r s faithfully,




K .G .

Telephone Call with Mr. Pemberton - 26.4.89

I spoke to Chief Superintendent Pemberton of the West Midland Police
(telephone 727599) at approximately 9.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 26th April,
1989. Mr. Pemberton is the Officer in charge of the Police Inquiry in
Sheffield.

He first of all asked about a letter which the Council sent to Sheffield
Wednesday immediately after the disaster which indicated that Council
Officers wished to interview Stewards at the game. He asked if this had
been done and if the Council had plans to do it. I confirm that no
Stewards had in fact been interviewed and that as soon as the Inquiry had
been announced these plans had been dropped. I also confirm that if the
Council wished to interview people it would of course obtain the
permission of the Inquiry before doing so.

Mr. Pemberton also indicated that the interviews of Stewards, etc. would
be carried out by his Officers who would use a type of questionnaire to
achieve a measure of consistency.

He indicated that the Inquiry would start on 15th May.

Mr. Pemberton then goes on to the reason for his call which was to discuss
the Council's Safety ofSports Grounds role. I confirmed with him (from
the information he evidently already has) that the Police, Fire Service,
Building Surveyor, Health and Consumer Services Department and this
Department are involved in the Certification system in Sheffield. I also
agreed that this Department is actually responsible for issuing the
Certificate, etc.. He wished to know whether my name and telephone number
could be used as a contact point for Safety of Sports Grounds. I
explained that as litigation was in the air I would have to seek
directions on this point but that I would ring him back and tell him as
soon as possible what the arrangements would be. I confirm that any
information which he reasonably required would, of course, be supplied if
at all possible.

Mr. Pemberton then went on to indicate that he had identified four or five
main areas in connection withSafety of Sports Grounds which needed to be
investigated and that the number of Senior Police Officers had been given
the task of investigating these areas. He thought that it might be
possible for the Safety of Sports Grounds information to be transmitted to
him on a factual basis only and without the need for interviews although
interviews may be required.

I promised to ring him back as soon as possible with details of contact
arrangements.

              Dear Sir

              Hillsborough. Disaster


              Thank you for letting us have a copy of the news release together
              with the series of helpful documents set out in the Index that
              you have kindly provided.

              We have taken the liberty of writing to the Secretary to the Inquiry
              to notify hiLm of our interest although we imagine that you will
              have done likewise.

              We have spoken to Mr Richard Maxwell QC and his tentative view is
              that there is no need for him to attend the Inquiry on the opening
              day. He is having a word direct with Mr Murphy to confirm that
              that is a satisfactory arrangement.

              We have passed to Mr Murphy the papers that you have provided
              under the cover of a short Brief asking him to attend at the
              Legal and Administration Department to meet with Mr Gregory and
              Mrs Bashforth at 10.30 am on Friday the 28th April.

              Yours faithfully

Note for C ouncillor C live B etts

On 23th April 1989, Liz Bashforth was requested by your Secretary to see two
representatives from Legal and General*
They Introduced them selves as Mr Andrew T asker and Mr T erry Harrison.

They explained th a t they are m em bers o f an over 35s football team w ith close
connections w ith Hallam Football Club and Hallam V eterans.

They wish to ask you if you will support them in an idea to raise money fo r the
Hillsborough Appeal and the Hallam Football Club.

A pparently 22 of th eir members would pay a t le a st £250 to play a t Wembley.

Their idea is to play them selves for th e firs t half and auction 22 places fo r the
second half. They are also considering sponsorship for each place.

When they contacted Wembley and suggested the possibility, the m anagem ent said
they couldn’t use the stadium and in any event the Football Association wouldn’t
allow it.

They th erefo re cam e to see you, to see if you could lend your support to th e ir
schem e. They   arealso  contacting
                                 David Blunkett,      apparently.
They asked th a t you be given details o f th e ir idea and also indicated th a t they w ere
open to any o th er suggestions.

   Dear Mr Webster



   Someone from your department telephoned          Richard's Sheffield
   office earlier this week enquiring about         a report being pro­
   duced  about  football hooliganism  with          contributions from
   a number of countries.

   I have made enquiries with the Minister for Sport's office
   at the Department of the Environment and the report is in
   fact going to be presented at the next formal meeting of
   the European Convention at R e y k j a v i k _ on 31 May-2 June of
   this  year.   This  results  frofm the last meeting         of the
   Standing Committee of the European Convention at Athens in
   1988 when ministers of member countries were asked to prepare
   a list of possible measures against spectator violence.

   It is unlikely that this list will be published on the general
   market, but if you are interested I will try to obtain one
   from Mr Moynihan's office after the meeting in Reykjavik.



   Yours sincerely

                                    HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY


        LORD J USTICE TAYLOR
               On 15th April there was an horrendous disaster at Hillsborough.
        95 people died, many were injured.    I have been appointed by the Home
        Secretary to conduct an Inquiry into the disaster.

              May I convey my deepest sympathy    to the bereaved and injured and
        the same from the Inquiry Staff.

              The terms of reference of the Inquiry are to investigate the events
        at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground on 15th April and make
        recommendations in relation to crowd control and safety of sports grounds.

              I am solely responsible   for the Inquiry,   representation and
        recommendations.

              I am assisted by two assessors;    Brian Johnson, Chief Constable of
        Leicestershire and Professor Maunder,    a professor in Mechanical
        Engineering at Newcastle University.

              This is a preliminary hearing to set out the nature of the Inquiry,
        procedures and to hear applications from parties wishing to be
        represented.

              This is not a law suit where it is a case of winning or losing,       it
        is not akin to a criminal trial.  No one is on trial.

               The Inquiry will look at:-

               (1)   What happened
               (2)   Why it happened
               (3)   The lessons to be learned and recommendations.

              If allegations are made I will consider      them and if appropriate make
        a finding.

              The object is to find the facts with all speed.  I do not want this
        constructive purpose spoilt by accusation and counter-accusation .

              Regarding the scope and length of the Inquiry, because the people
        involved  as witnesses run into the 1,000's, West Midlands Police are
        carrying out the exercise of gathering evidence.  I welcome letters.  All
        relevant evidence should be available but I want the Inquiry to be quick
        and thorough .

              I want to keep oral evidence within bounds.  I will not allow oral
        evidence which does not add to that already given but written statements
        will be considered.

               The Inquiry will have three Counsels, Andrew Collins Q.C., Alan
         Goldsack and Bernard Phillips.  All witnesses who give oral evidence are
         called on my behalf.

               That witness may also be called by their advisors.




HB3AAB/PGT/1
                Before any witness is called they have to have first given a written
          statement.  The witness may be cross-examined but I will limit
          cross-examinations as I think fit.

                If an allegation is made against a body or an individual, that body
          or individual must be informed and can call evidence in answer to the
          allegation.

                The oral hearing will commence on the 15th May at 10.30 a . m . , and
          will concentrate on the events of the 15th April and why it happened.       The
          Inquiry will be public.

                The second part of the Inquiry - relating     to the future- I will give
          directions later on how this will be conducted.

                I would like to receive written submissions on recommendations for
          crowd control and safety at sports grounds as soon as possible.

                The press will be given proper assistance and save in exceptional
          circumstances copies of statements made by a witness will be available to
          the press shortly before that winess is called.

                 There will be no photography or filming or sound recording during
           the Inquiry.  I can and will enforce that rule.

                I request the press not to interview any witness before they have
          completed their evidence to the Inquiry.  I believe that will only impede
          a difficult task.

                I expect parties to be represented by lawyers.  Any person or body
          wishing to be represented must show good cause.  They must have a direct
          interest and it must be fair to be represented.

                 If there are several parties covered by the same interest they
           should join together.

                 Any decision today on representation is not final.

                 If a party does not wish to be represented they can offer to make
           evidence available through a statement as soon as possible.

                 In relation to costs, there are no statutory provisions.  The
           Secretary of State is able to meet costs and I make recommendations to the
           Secretary of State.

                 I will consider that at the end.    Costs would be on a common fund
           basis.

                  I intend to make recommendations to pay the reasonable costs of
          anyone who ought to be represented who may not know if they can afford it.
          Ce rta inly the families of the injured and deceased.

                   I will be sympathetic to football supporters, in particular
           Li verp ool supporters.  I will be recommending that Liverpool supporters
           costs are paid.

                                       Counsel very busy.  I represent so many interests
                                       already there may be difficulties in only one

                 Lord Justice Taylor - I don't see any difficulty.  If for good
                 reason, separate representation is needed, I will consider it, but
                 it will have to be quite extraordinary.

                 - work out what part want to play in first stage and what better for
                 second stage.

                 Costs - I will probably recommend are paid by the Secretary of
                 State.

          N.B. If anyone wastes the time of the Inquiry I will consider the matter
          of costs very carefully.

HEALTH A N D C O N S U M E R SERVICES.



                          SHEFFIELD W ED NESD AY FOOTBALL CLUB



You asked m e for a summary of my involvement with the Safety in Sports Grounds
Working P arty in regard to the above Club which I enclose below.



Introduction

Following the designation of the ground, effective from 1st January,           1979,
Sheffield W e d n e s d a y Football Club required a safety certificate.

The ce rtif i c a t i o n process, as defined in the 75 Act, was administered by the
County C o unc il after consultation with the Fire, Police and Building
Authorities.        No other safety specialists were named as part of this process.
The County Council issued a safety certificate to start on 21st December,
1979, and w a s entirely subject to their inspection and verification
procedures.

On the 1st April, 1986, the City Council took over the certification procedure
following the disbandment of the South Yorkshire County Council.              It was the
Council's A dmi nist rat ion and Legal Department that were allocated the
ad m i n i s t r a t i o n and certificating function which I understood to come under
their Gener al Purposes Panel.             The role and activity of the other authorities
remained larg ely unchanged.

On the 1st July, 1986, the representative of Administration and Legal, a
Mr. Bownes, w r o t e to the Environ men tal Health Department because he was not
satisfied w i t h the assistance offered to him by the H.S.E. and was seeking
sa fety advice from alternative sources.            It was proposed that because
En v i r o n m e n t a l Health already carried out safety duties under licensing
provisions for football clubs a m o r e developed role would be efficient.        The
m e m o was a d d r ess ed to the Director and I am not aware of what reply was given.



7.8.86         Re pre sentatives of Environmental Health, John Batley (Acting
               Assistant Principal Officer), and myself visited the new spion
               kop development at the informal request of David Bownes, the
               Ad min istr ati on and Leg al representative.

               A number of aspects of construction were considered to be unsafe
               and did not conform to the guide Safety in Sports Grounds.      I
               pointed these out to Mr. Bownes verbally on site at that time.
               The points w e r e not accepted by the club's representative, '
               Dr. E astwood (Consulting Engineer) or the Building Surveyors.     I
               was not able to agree wit h their insistence that areas of the new
               structure wer e "reasonably safe".    Some conflict resulted and I
               left the ground w ith Mr. Batley.    Upon return to the department,
               I explained the situation to the Acting Principal Officer, Chris
               Reed.
14.8.86        Ad mi nistration and Legal sand a memo to Sheffield Wednesday
               Football Club containing some of my objections.

19.8.86        Adminis tra tio n and Legal requested a formal report upon the issue
               to be submitted to the General Purposes Panel Meeting that was to
               be held on the 21st August, 1986.       3ecause of this request, I
               returned to the ground w i t h the Principal Officer and showed him
               the areas of concern.     M r . Reed was in agreement with my
               findings.    I took some more detailed measurements of the area and
               we left the site.

               Upon return to the department I contacted the H.S.E. to see if
               they could offer me any assistance.  It was explained to me that
               they did not feel they could help and did not wish to take part
               in a site visit.  I confirmed my telephone conversation with a
               letter that day.

20. 8.86       I was invited to attend a "pre-panel meeting" with the Council's
               solicitor, and Licensing Officer, David Bownes, and the rest of
               the certificating team.      I voiced my objections to the
               development.  Again there was a conflict wi th the Building
               Surveyors and I w o u l d not agree with their assessment of
               "reasonably safe".      Amidst some conflict the meeting ended with
               the Surveyors questioning my attendance.      I returned to my
               department and proposed a brief for the next day.
               (Ref. EPU1 : Football).

2 1 . 8. 8 6   Wh en I arrived at wo rk the next day there was a memo written,
               about my involvement from the Surveyors to my department.     I gave
               my brief to the Prin cip al Officer and a copy to the Acting
               Assistant Director, David Bird, and some discussion ensued and I
               was obliged to re-visit the site wi th the Principal Officer and
               Acting .Assistant Director.

               While showing Mr. Bird the areas of concern, Dr. Eastwood arrived
               and again some conflict was generated.  Mr. Eastwood threatened
               to sue the Council for £2 million if we successfully objected
               against the opening of the new development.

               At lunchtime we returned to the department to discuss my intended
               objections at length.    It was decided that the Principal Officer
               and I would attend the meeting.    We attended and my Principal
               Officer spoke on behalf of the department.     No objection was
               raised to the points about which I was concerned.     We returned to
               the office and I raised the issue w i t h both levels of management.
               I was told that I was politically naive and unable to attain
               their level of profe ssi onal compromise.   A discussion followed.

28.8.86        Letter received from Eastwood and Partners detailing remedial
               works that were agreed.

29.8.86        Memo from Administration and Legal thanking m y department for its
               assistance and proposing to discuss future roles regarding sports
               ground safety.

18.9.86        Re-visit to spion kop.        Remedial works still outstanding.   Memo
               sent to David B o w n e s .

               sent to Admi nist rat ion and Legal.

18.11.86     A number of small works of construction were undertaken and plans

             Working Party.   Meeting w i t h Eastwood and Ian Mackerall (Club
             Secretary) following tour - points explained.      It was discussed
             that the club do not have an appointed safety officer / first aid

             Memo sent to A dmi nis trat ion and Legal.  Proposed that Safety

             the spion kop.    Continued argument about the formalisation of
             first aid also noted.    Me mo again sent to Administration and

Dear Mr Webster

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 - HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM

Thank you for sending me so promptly a copy of the safety
certificate for Hillsborough Stadium and for quickly following
this up with copies of the stadium plans.

In his statement to the House of Commons on 17 April about the
Hillsborough Stadium disaster the Home Secretary said that he had
asked for factual reports from the police and other services, the
local authority and Football Association.  A copy of the page
from Hansard which records the Home Secretary's statement is
attached.

I have been in touch with you by telephone requesting factual
information but I thought I should follow up the telephone
conversations to confirm in writing the request for a factual
report.

I am most grateful to you for your help in providing all the
factual details so far in the form of the safety certificate and
plans.  I would now welcome any additional information on the
action taken by your authority.  I stress that we are not seeking
judgments about the issues arising from the tragedy.  These are
for Inquiry led by Lord Justice Taylor.  But if there is any
further factual information which you can provide it will be most
appreciated.

                                                              Yours sincerely

At the S p ec ial Police A u t h o rit y meet ing on 21 April 1989 you asked wheth er
or not I was able to release to the Sheffield City Council, as licensing
au t h ori ty u n d e r the S afe ty of Sports Ground legislation, a copy of the
Police O p e r a t i o n a l O r d e r for the ill fated semi-final at Hillsborough,
to g eth er w i t h a b r e a k dow n of police resources deployed bot h inside and
outsi de the football ground.               At the mee tin g I informed you that I w oul d
n e e d to consult the legal officers for the Public Inquiry in respect of
the evi dent ial status of that information.

I have n ow been advi sed by the Tr easury Solicitor that it w ould be
i n a ppro pri ate to release that info rmat ion p rior to it being introduced
into the pu blic domain during the course of the Public Inquiry.         I regret
t he ref ore that I am unable to assist.

             re: JUDICIAL INQUIRY - FRIDAY 28 APRIL and MONDAY 15 MAY

             I thought it important that I write and pass on the compliments
             received, primarily from the Treasury Solicitor but also from others
             involved in the initial day of the Inquiry the 28th April, regarding
             the administrative arrangements made for that day as can        be seen
             from the attached copy letter from Mr Whalley of the Home Office.

             In particular, I would like to     express my thanks to all those who
             worked so hard to ensure that the arrangements went off smoothly
             and efficiently and to thank them for their initial effort and their
             continued help in the future.

             Clearly, in a communication of      this sort, it is perhaps wrong to
             single out individuals in view    of the team effort that went on but
             nevertheless I feel that the work of the Administration Group and
             the Building Survey Group in the Estates Division of Land and Planning
             deserve attention, as do the efforts of the Licensing Section within
             the Administration and Legal Department, Mr Creasey of        the same
             Department, Ms Sainty and Tony Flannagan of Cleansing and of course
             the efforts of Pat O'Neill and Hazel Smith in terms of overall co­
             ordination and liaison.

             Whilst quite obviously we would all have hoped that the arrangements
             would have been required for a happier purpose, I nevertheless repeat
             my thanks and appreciation and those of the Leader for the efforts
             put in so far and in the future.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER INQUIRY


I write in confirmation of our telephone conversation on 19 April
and my visit to Sheffield on 20 April to discuss with your staff
arrangements for the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Inquiry.

Lord Justice Taylor is extremely grateful to the City Council for
making the facilities of the Town Hall available to him fox his
Inquiry, and has asked me to write to you to express his
gratitude.  He was particularly grateful for all the excellent
arrangements made for the preliminary hearing on 28 April.

May I add my personal thanks for the assistance of Mr Pat
O'Neill, Mrs Hazel Smith and their colleagues, who have been
quite outstanding in the help and support they have already given
to me and my staff.                          »

                    Mr. D. J. Mould,
                    The Home Office,
                    Queen Anns Gate,
                    London,
                    SW1H 9AT.

                    Dear Mr. Mould,

                    Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 -
                    The Hillsborough Stadium____________

                    Thank you for your letter of 2nd May.  I must say I had not realised that
                    the Home Secretary had in fact requested a factual report from the Council
                    on the tragic events at Hillsborough.  I am, of course, aware that you spoke
                    to my Chief Licensing Officer, Mr. Bownes, on a number of occasions but he
                    tells me that the conversations involved the supply of copies of the Safety
                    Certificate and relevant plans to you.  Obviously I am willing to attempt to
                    provide you with such information as you may require but I ask you to bear
                    in mind that Council Officers are currently very heavily engaged in
                    preparing the Council's submission to the Inquiry.

                     I should say that the Council's submission to the Inquiry will, obviously,
                     go into considerable detail about the situation at Hillsborough and I would
                     hope that in itself it would meet the Home Secretary's requirements for a
                     report.  In the belief that this is true I will let you have a copy of the
                     submission as soon as it is available.  If in the meantime you require aijy
                     more factual information please specify exactly what it is you require and I
                     will attempt to supply it.

                     Moving on to the question of the Council's submission to the Inquiry it
                     would assist me greatly if you would let me have your views on the role of
                     the Home Office and.a description of your responsibilities as you see them
                     in relation to the Safety of Sports Grounds Legislation.  It would also be
                     of assistance if you could let me have your views on the subject of
                     perimeter fencing at football stadia.




                                                                                                                                            734690 - Mr. Bownes

Obviously these two issues will be relevant to the Inquiry and your
Assistance in commenting on them will be most appreciated. If the need
arises please do not hesitate to contact me again.

Yours sincerely,

H I L L S B O R O U G H INQUIRY - SHEFFIELD CITY COUNCIL


You will recall that at the pre-inquiry meeting on 28th April Lord Justice Taylor
indicated that any body against whom any allegations was to be made would be
informed of it and the substance of the evidence supporting it

You will appreciate that the task of assembling the evidence for the Inquiry is a
formidable one and statements are still being taken. However, it seemed right to let
you have what must be a preliminary indication of criticisms which may be levelled at
the City Council, as the locai authority responsible for the safety certificates under
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975, as soon as possible before the commencement
of the Inquiry.

The following are the main criticisms which so far appear from the evidence availabie:-

1.    The pens on the terraces at the Leppings Lane end of the ground constituted c
      potential danger i£ crowdcJ. Tiie merits u£ tigress onto tHe OiZCTl were
      inadequate and you should have insisted that there were more gates, that they
      were properly signed, that there were means of access laterally between the"
      pens, again properly marked, and that ail gangways were properly marked.

2.     The directional signs were inadequate, so that those entering were necessarily
      channelled to the tunnel leading to the central two pens.

3.     The crush barriers within the pens were not properly positioned and one at least
       was of insufficient strength.

4.     The tunnel giving access to the terrace was not ox a constant gradient but
       sloped steeply at the terrace end: this was potentially hazardous if a large
       crowd came down the tunnel.
5.    The wail at the turnstiles was not adequate to prevent persons climbing into the
      ground.
6     Access by ambulances or fire engines to the playing area and the surround was
      not adequately provided for. Furthermore, the provision of first-aid equipment
      was insufficient.

Should any further matters deserving of criticism come to our attention, we will of
course let you know of them.                               .    .   .    .

             HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - UPDATE

             With regard to the above matter I attach, for your information and
             attention, copies of various communications received from Mr Whalley
             at the Home Office on behalf of Lord Justice Taylor confirming first
             of all that the Home Office will meet the Council's costs in terms
             of the Inquiry and secondly thanking staff for the arrangements so
             far made and finally thanking the Members for moving the Annual Council
             Meeting.

             In addition on a different tack, I also enclose a copy of a note
             of the opening day of the Inquiry prepared by Liz Bashforth which
             I believe gives a flavour of the events on that morning.

             In addition, I also enclose copies of correspondence passing between
             the Police, Sheffield Wednesday and South Yorkshire County Council
             regarding the semi-final incident in April 1981 which apparently
             resulted from large numbers of fans entering the ground at the last
             moment.

             Finally, I also enclose a copy of a letter from the Treasury Solicitors
             setting out what they suggest will be the main criticisms so far
             as this Authority is concerned, most if not all of which it is felt,
             at this moment in time, can be answered.    Obviously one of the first
             steps in response to the letter would be to go back to the Treasury
             Solicitors and ask them for details of the evidence they are using
             to base their criticisms upon.

             An outstanding issue is the matter of a formal report into the
             Committee Structure concerning Hillsborough and in this regard I
             have asked David Purchon to draft a factual document which I think
             is the only report which is appropriate at this stage but there does
             then remain the issue of how the Authority is going to deal with
             the payment of overtime, etc, to staff who were involved in dealing
             with the aftermath of Hillsborough and I would welcome the opportunity
             of discussing this with you as my own opinion, expressed to the other
             members of the Hillsborough Working Group is that probably it would
             be better to deal with this administratively, if at all possible,
             rather than include it as part of such a document, although clearly
             the individuals concerned do need to be paid without delay.

Thank you for your fax of 4 May, received this morning, about
which I spoke to Mr Webster's secretary when I received it. I
think'that your fax has crossed with mine of the same date, which
I hope gives you the answer you were seeking about the Home
Office meeting the costs of the Inquiry in principle.  The next
stage is, I think, for us to start to look at the details. You
very reasonably make the point that you cannot enter into
commitments for not inconsiderable sums on the strength of verbal
assurances alone.  I hope that that position is now clarified.

In your letter of 4 May you also say that the members have agreed
to move the Annual General Meeting of the Council (scheduled for
17 May) from the Town Hall into other premises.     I mentioned this
to Lord Justice Taylor today. He has asked me to express his
gratitude to the members for their generous understanding in this
respect.  He realises that this will involve disruption and
disappointment to some, but is glad that the momentum of the
Inquiry can be maintained in its first week.   I would therefore
be grateful if you could pass on to the members Lord Justice
Taylor's appreciation of their decision about the Annual General-
Meeting.                                      \f

                                    HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY


        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR
              On 15th April there was an horrendous disaster at Hillsborough.
        95 people died, many were injured.   I have been appointed by the Home
        Secretary to conduct an Inquiry into the disaster.

              May I convey my deepest sympathy to the bereaved and injured and
        the same from the Inquiry Staff.

              The terms of reference of the Inquiry are to investigate the events
        at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground on 15th April and make
        recommendations in relation to crowd control and safety of sports grounds

              I am solely responsible for the Inquiry, representation and
        recommendations.

              I am assisted by two assessors; Brian Johnson, Chief Constable of
        Leicestershire and Professor Maunder, a professor in Mechanical
        Engineering at Newcastle University.

              This is a preliminary hearing to set out the nature of the Inquiry,
        procedures and to hear applications from parties wishing to be
        represented.

              This is not a law suit where it is a case of winning or losing,    it
        is not akin to a criminal trial.  No one is on trial.

               The Inquiry will look at:-

               (1)   What happened
               (2)   Why it happened
               (3)   The lessons to be learned and recommenations.

              If allegations are made I will consider them and if appropriate mak
        a finding.

               The object is to find the facts with all speed.  I do not want    this
         constructive purpose spoilt by accusation and counter-accusation .

               Regarding the scope and length of the Inquiry, because the people
         involved  as witnesses run into the 1,000's, West Midlands Police are
         carrying out the exercise of gathering evidence.  I welcome letters.  A.1.1
         relevant evidence should be available but I want the Inquiry to be quick
         and thorough.

               I want to keep oral evidence within bounds.  I will not allow oral
         evidence which does not add to that already given but written statements
         will be considered.

               The Inquiry will have three Counsels, Andrew Collins Q . C . , Alan •
         Goldsack and Bernard Phillips.  All witnesses who give oral evidence are
         called on my behalf.

               That witness may also be called by their advisors.




HB3AAB/PGT/1
                Before any witness is called they have to have first given a written
          statement.  The witness may be cross-examined but I will limit
          cross-examinations as I think fit.

                If an allegation is made against a body or an individual, that body
          or individual must be informed and can call evidence in answer to the
          allegation.

              ■ The oral hearing will commence on the 15th May at 10.30 a.m., and
          will concentrate on the events of the 15th April and why it happened.   The
          Inquiry will be public.

                The second part of the Inquiry - relating to the future- I will give
          directions later on how this will be conducted.

                I would like to receive written submissions on recommendations for
          crowd control and safety at sports grounds as soon as possible.

                The press- will be given proper assistance and save in exceptional
          circumstances copies of statements made by a witness will be available to
          the press shortly before that winess is called.

                There will be no photography or filming or sound recording during
          the Inquiry.  I can and will enforce that rule.

                I request the press not to interview any witness before they have
          completed their evidence to the Inquiry.  I believe that will only impede
          a difficult task.

                I expect parties to be represented by lawyers.  Any person or body
          wishing to be represented must show good cause.  They must have a direct
          interest and it must be fair to be represented.

                If there are several parties covered by the same interest they
          should join together.

                    Any decision today on representation is not final.

                If a party does not wish to be represented they can offer to make
          evidence available through a statement as soon as possible.

                 In relation to costs, there are no statutory provisions.  The
           Secretary of State is able to meet costs and I make recommendations     to the
           Secretary of State.

                    I will consider that at the end.   Costs would be on a common fund
           basis.

                 I intend to make recommendations to pay the reasonable costs of
           anyone who ought to be represented who may not know if they can afford it.
           Certainly the families of the injured and deceased.

                 I will be sympathetic to football supporters, in particular
           Liverpool supporters.  I will be recommending that Liverpool supporters
           costs are paid.

                  Lord Justice Taylor - will agree 1 team to represent families.

          Mr.   Makin                 - represents 7 deceased, 50 injured - not entirely
                                        happy with what took place at consortium meeting.
                                        Counsel very busy.   I represent so many interests
                                         already there may be difficulties in only one

                  Lord Justice Taylor - I don't see any difficulty.  If for good
                  reason, separate representation is needed, I will consider it, but
                  it will have to be quite extraordinary.

)                  Dear Sir,

                   SEMI-FINAL - 11TH APRIL 1981                  '        ......

                   On the occasion of the above match, there was an incident
                   at the Leppings Lane end of the ground, in the standing
                   enclosure, which resulted in injuries to spectators
                   because of crushing. .......

                  From our enquiries it appears t h e .crushing was caused
                  through Tottenham supporters arriving late, due to
                  problems on the Motorway, and rushing to their places
                  after the game had commenced, thereby causing problems
                  to spectators at the front of the terracing who had
                  been in the ground a considerable length of time.

                  According to our turnstile readings there were 335 in
                  excess of the stipulated capacity for that particular
                  area; this was the result of Tottenham fans having
                  purchased tickets from Wolverhampton and on arrival
                  st Turnstile *N’, Penistone Road, which was the
                  Wolverhampton standing area, were directed by the
                  police to the other end of the ground where the
                  Tottenham fans were standing.

                  I give below details of injuries reported to me:-
                           30 spectators treated by St. John«s Ambulance
                                        Brigade for minor ailments, etc.
                           Treated at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital

Dear Sir

FA CUP SEMI-FINAL                       -   11 APRIL 1981                       '       '




I would refer to the FA Cup Semi-Final match between Wolverhampton
Wanderers Football Club’and Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, held at
Hillsborough Stadium, the home of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, on
Saturday 11 April 1981.

As you will no doubt be aware many similar Semi-Final matches have been
held at this ground without previous problems. The stadium is issued with
a certificate under the provisions of the Safety in Sports Grounds Act 1975.
This limits the total capacity of the ground to 50,174. The area of the
Leppings Lane enclosure has a capacity of 10,100.

Prior to the match itself, difficulties were envisaged because both sets
of supporters were obliged to use the Ml Motorway. This problem was added
to when a major road accident occurred on the Ml near to its junction with
the A38. The problem was exacerbated by a coach breaking down further along
the motorway, and by extensive road works. This set of circumstances
caused a large number of spectators, predominantly Tottenham Hotspur fans,
to be held up on the motorway for some 90 minutes. As you will appreciate
traffic jams built up and resulted in a sudden influx of large numbers of
football supporters to the area of the ground at around the time for the
start of the match when a fairly steady build up of support throughout the
afternoon could have been anticipated.

I now wish to outline an aspect of the problem which could have been avoided
and which should be anticipated for future similar occasions.

Cn the day before the Wolverhampton ticket allocation was put on sale to
the public, Tottenham Hotspur played Coventry City Football Club at Coventry
in a league match. Many Tottenham Hotspur supporters stayed overnight in
Coventry and travelled the short distance to Wolverhampton to obtain tickets
which were at a premium in London. Others also made the journey from London
to Wolverhampton on the Sunday. This completely defeated the spectator
policy which is put into effect at these matches and which places the largest
groups of standing supporters at, opposite ends of the ground. Neither of
the two participating Semi-Final clubs saw fit to inform the South
Yorkshire Police, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club or the Football
Association about this situation and in that event the mixing of supporters
was not^roperiy"catered for.' The result of this was that some 400
Tottenham fans had to be removed from the Spion Kop, in the interests
of general safety and public order, and were accommodated in the Leppings
Lane end of the ground,-, which had been designated for use by Spurs
supporters.

The capacity at the Leppings Lane end is 10,100 and this obviously contains
a safety factor. At a previous match some 400 holders of forged tickets
gained entry into this part of the ground and were absorbed without any
apparent difficulty. However, on this date turnstile readings showed
that 10,435 people were admitted to this part of the ground.

A policy of packing spectators occurs at most football grounds where
large crowds are in attendance so that all the available space is utilised.
On this occasion the Tottenham Hotspur fans, who had arrived early in the
day and taken up advantageous viewing points, refused to move into the
centre of this enclosure,1thereby creating a jamming effect at the
extremeties of it. The late arrivals caused an immediate problem upon
gaining access to the Leppings Lane area because of rushing forward
immediately upon entering after Tottenham Hotspur had scored a goal soon
after kick off. This resulted in a number of crushing injuries on this
terrace including broken arms, legs and crushed ribs. In all, some 38
fans received treatment either at hospital or from the St John. Ambulance
representatives present at the game.

As a result ox tliis xne safety gates at uhe xrcnt ox trie ijeppxngs Ajaiis
enclosure were opened and spectators at the front were allowed to go
onto the playing area perimeter track to relieve the pressure within the
terrace. Due to the problems being created by crushing, my officers also
refused access to the Leppings Lane enclosure to spectators waiting to
get in. In my view no other course of action could have been adopted in
the interest of public safety.

During the half time interval my officers attempted to move the spectators
who were standing or seated within the tracks around onto the normal
spectator areas. During this manoeuvre some rather foolish youngsters
did run onto the pitch but the situation was quickly brought under control
by officers within the ground.

In conclusion I would add that there were no other incidents either
inside or outside the ground other than those caused by the circumstances
I have described. The circumstances I have outlined have been discussed
at length and will be borne in mind in the planning of future similar
events. Discussions are to take place with my officers and officials
of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club regarding suggestions for obviating
the problems caused within the Leppings Lane terrace on this occasion.

Yours faithfully

HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - SHEFFIELD CITY COUNCIL


You will recall that at the pre-inquiry meeting on 28th April Lord Justice Taylor
indicated that any body against whom any allegations was to be made would be
informed of it and the substance of the evidence supporting it
                     —                                                   )    ^
You will appreciate that the task of assembling the evidence for the Inquiry is a
formidable one and statements are still being taken. However, it seemed right to let
you have what must be a preliminary indication of criticisms which may be levelled at
the City Council, as the local authority responsible for the safety certificates under
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975, as soon as possible before the commencement
of the Inquiry.

The following are the main criticisms which so far appear from the evidence available:-

1.     The pens on the terraces at the Leppings Lane end of the ground constituted a
      potential danger if ciowdcj. The mediis of egress onto m e pitch were
      inadequate and you should have insisted that there were more gates, that they
      were properly signed, that there were means of access laterally between the
      pens, again properly marked, and that all gangways were properly marked.

2.      The directional signs were inadequate, so that those entering were necessarily
       channelled to the tunnel leading to the central two pens.

3.      The crush barriers within the pens were not properly positioned and one at least
       was of insufficient strength.

       The tunnel giving access to the terrace was not of a constant gradient but
       sloped steeply at the terrace end: this was potentially hazardous if a large
       crowd came down the tunnel.

                                                            1.

     5.    The wail at the turnstiles was not adequate to prevent persons climbing into the
           ground.

     6.    Access by ambulances or fire engines to the playing area and the surround was
           not adequately provided for. Furthermore, the provision of first-aid equipment
           was insufficient.

     Should any further matters deserving of criticism come to our attention, we will of
     course let you know of them.

                                                                Hi?,
            HILLSBOR OUGH INQUIRY

            Having read the letter from the T reasury Solicitor dated 9 M a y 89 re the
            above I would wish to make the following comments.

       1.   Stadium capacity and means of escape are specific areas on which South
            Yorkshire Fire Service were asked to comment under the existing
            administrative system for the c ertification process, similarly crowd
            control and evacuation procedures are within the remit of South Yorkshire
            Police.   On a general note however the central pens at the west end would
            appear to be too small to warrant separate access/egress gangways.    The
            area immediately surrounding the exit to the tunnel is yellow cross
            hatched to identify this as a gangway area.

       2.   The provision of directional flow exit and emergency exit signs are a
             specific function of the grounds safety officer and also an integral part
             of a comprehensive safety management plan.   You will recall that as a
             result of advice from this department the Club have been encouraged to
             appoint the Club Secretary as Safety Officer with effect from October
             1987.  However with the exception of this appointment no significant
             progress has been made in drawing up a comprehensive safety management
             plan.   M y officers are of the opinion that the sign provision is both
             inadequate and ineffective.

       3.   The location and strength of crush barriers should have been adequately
             covered by the Building Surveyor's report and the annual report of the
             Club's Consulting Engineer.  However the enclosed plan of the west end
             drawn up after the events of the 15th April indicate that the barriers do
             not fully comply with the Green Guide in terms of height and spacing.

       4.   The statement that the access tunnel is not of a constant gradient is
            correct.  The enclosed drawing shows the relevant changes in gradient
            from 1:23 to 1:6.  Whether or not this constitutes a potential hazard is a
            subjective assessment which of course is much aided by hindsight.

       5.   I am not in a position to comment on the references to the height of the
             turnstile wall.

       6.   Access to emergency vehicles is once again a central element of the safety
            management plan which the Club has, until very recently i.e.  post
            distaster, been reluctant to progress save for, as recently mentioned, the
            appointment of the Club Secretary as Safety Officer.

            W i t h regard to the provision of First Aid facilities and equipment; this
            has been the subject of extended correspondence between this department
            and yourselves between August 1987 and February 1988 (copies can be made
            available).     The essence of the correspondence has been an attempt to
            secure an adequately constructed and equipped First Aid Room and a
             formalisation of the arrangement for attendance of First Aiders.

                                    I am aware that as a result of the Hillsborough tragedy the
                             conditions attached to the Safety Certificates at the two football
                             grounds in Sheffield are to be reviewed.   The Courts Committees
                             in South Yorkshire have recently met to discuss the implications of
                             the Hillsborough events, and in particular, the possibility that the
                             removal of fencing within grounds may lead to an increase in hooliganism
                             and offending inside football grounds.    Clearly an increase in
                             offending has implications as far as the court is concerned and
                             contingency plans with regard to sentencing policy and planning of
                             courts need to be put in hand.

                                    In view of this I would  be grateful if I could be given an
                             early indication of any policy changes that you intend to introduce
                             in respect of the Safety Certificates in question.


                                                                   Yours sincerely,

           HOME OFFICE REVIEW OF PEACETIME DISASTERS

           Introduction

           This paper expands on a recent resolution by Merseyside FCDA a n d
           is designer! for submission to the Home Office as a last-ditch
           endeavour ro influence the Home Office review.   This is believed
           to be imminent, perhaps rimed around the Home Secretary’s addrei
           to the ACIEPO conference in Coventry 27-28 June.

          Following the civil emergencies seminar at the Civil Defence
          College in November 1988, the outcooe of the review was expecter
          in February 1989 but Lockerbie, Clapham, Kegworth and
          Hillsborough have delayed its release. A Parliamentary Answer
          2 May stated "We hope to stake an announcement on the result of
          the review as a whole shortly.*’ •

          This report is substantially based on the AMA review ^Local
          Author!ties and peacetime emergency planning - a Review of
          current axrangesents and proposals for improvement."

          Peacetime Baerqency Planning

r     -      The need to improve peacetime emergency planning and arrangement'
             to mitigate the effects, of disasters — whether natural,
w^'sV i , technological or social -- stands o n its own. Public expectation
"            are at a high level and are reinforced by each disaster as it
             occurs.    There ista general public perception of a very real
          r threat frbi peacetime disasters and of the need to give greater
             priority to emergency planning and disaster management. In
           ;icontrast,/ and /Irrespective of .political policies on civil defence
             and .local authority war planning,; the nev climate of East/West
    v„-: ^..relations has made the prospects of war more remote and hence har
      u ^^.“ade possible consideration of a change in priorities for
          ~ planning needs.is. This latter point: Is Indirectly supported ,by

          Home Office Circular ESI/89 which gives less priority to civil
          defence activity overall than its predecessor in 1986.

          In addition to improving international'relations, and increased
          public awareness, EEC initiatives on industrial and environmental
          regulations and the HSE*s proposal for civil nuclear
          installations to be brought within the CIMAH regime are further
          examples of the way the wind-;is blowing. The Local Government
          and Bousing Bill's proposal to-codify the provision-of -financial
          aid to local authorities in post-disaster clean up operations
          points in the saae direction.

          The Association urges the Home Office t o take account of these
          new realities and, even at this late stage in formulating the
          results of the review, not to miss the opportunities they afford.

          Major disasters in recent years, including King’s Cross,

          2 June 1989                             .   ,-   _             ; _ ...

      developed-   Three broad categories of specific plan are
      proposed:

            fixed location
            unpredictable location
            area-wide

      The following are proposed for inclusion in legislation:-

      i)   statutory general peacetime plan,  including provision
            for comprehensive local authority emergency response
            procedures.

     ii)   statutory hazard appraisal.

 iii)      statutory requirement to address three categories of
           specific emergency plan

     iv)   specification of the organisations on; whom t“he duty to
           plan or assist in plan staking falls.
                          .   - .v ;;
i.    Improving the Practice of Local Authorities^?

      There is a/need to review /the roles of District and
      County-level authorities in the preparation of peacetime
      emergency plans and the co-ordination of disaster response.

  .Districts,^particularly in metropolitan areas(and the
   Boroughs in London), will noraally be in the <frontline when
   it: comes to operational response in an emergency. Districts
 . should prepare the general.and specific peacetime emergency
   plans outlined above, with, assistance from county-level
   authorities. It is argued that: all metropolitan districts
   and London Boroughs ..should have at least one full-time
   peacetime emergency planning officer, who would complement
   those at county level.             ••. ; &

      County level authorities should:—   J     - tmX-

 _ i)       liaise with and assist: districts in preparation of
            appropriate general district and departmental plans

     ii)   conduct the statutory hazard appraisal

.iii)      .consider.with the.Inspectorate the.need,for specific
            emergency plans

     iv)   prepare county-level peacetime plans as necessary

     v)    ensure that the emergency plans of different districts
           dovetail w'ith each other and the emergency services

. vi) _ on the basis .of lpcal.risk, appraisal, advise the
        Inspectorate on the need for regional or national
                                   3
   Zeebrugge and Bradford, have highlighted the need for a
   coordinated response to disasters, and drawn attention to t.
   weaknesses in existing emergency planning arrangements. Whi.*.
   both Europe and UK legislation require emergency plans for
   certain industrial major hazard sites, sports grounds and
   transport systems, there is no single piece of legislation to
   cover the emergency planning arrangements for major disasters in
   the United Kingdom.       * "•

   Emergency planning for major accidents and disasters should be
   given Increased emphasis and financed accordingly.

   The Home Office review of emergency planning and disaster
   response arrangements in the UK should incorporate

   1.   Establishment of emergency planning on a statutory basis

   2.   Improving the practice of Local Authority planning in a
        number of key ways.

  3.    Adequate resourcing of Local Authority emergency planning

  4.    Creation of a new Emergency Planning Inspectorate and
        establishment: of an Advisory Committee on Emergency Planning.

  These four topics are summarised below and more detail is in the
  AMA*s Review which was sent: to the Bone Office in' November 1988.

- 1. . Establishment of Peacetime Emergency Planning Ch" a Statutory
^ - ^ ^ Baslsw-rr^-v                          ''~--x'   .• .\. •

  — r: ;-VLegislation should be introduced imposing ’duties 'upon
    - - appropriate public and private organisations to undertake
 v        comprehensive peacetime emergency planning, whichwould be
{&■ ~ supervised by an .Inspectorate. / Local authori-ties“would be
          required to prepare two types of emergency plan; general and
TSi       specific.'
                        \:
        The general plan would establish on a statutory basis an
    ' organisation at local authority level which can. be mobilised
     , flexibly in support of the emergency services to meet a wide
       range of peacetime emergencies. The Major Disaster Plan
       would describe the main features for co-ordinating centrally
       local authority services and for liaising with the Police and
    . _jFire Service,. In addition, statutory_provision would require
       local authorities to operate adequate 24 hour call-out and
       stand-by systems to respond to small scale incidents.
       Satisfactory ’minor emergencies* schemcs are the basis Tor a
       sound response to a major disaster.

        Once the general scheme was in place, local authorities would
        be required to undertake a hazard appraisal, assessing the
        major.risks, in their area.. From the hazard appraisal,
        priorities for specific (or contingency) plans should be
            planning, including mutual aid arrangements with
            neighbouring authorities, and initiate appropriate
            arrangements

     vii)   organise and assist in the training of district staff
            and volunteers involved with peacetime emergency plans

 viii)      organise and assist in the conduct of regular exercises
            of these plans

      ix)   co-ordinate emergency response on behalf of a district
            whose resources are inadequate, or where an emergency
            involves a number of districts.

       It is recognised that where appropriate organisational
       arrangements can be agreed between District and County level
       authorities, the planning and otsfcef functions described above
       can be mutually accommodated.

3.     Proper resourcing of Local Authorities

       People expect their local authorities to act quickly and
       responsibly once disaster strikes. The financing of local
       authority emergency planning should be given a firmer basis.
       Among the options, the provision of specific grant or
       penalty-free revenue support grant could with advantage be
     - adopted. The Government’s decision on clean-up operations
       should be applied to planning, particularly where it can be
       shown that pre-planning, training and exercising have enabled
       more expeditious and more effective disaster response.

4.     Creation of Emergency Planning Inspectorate and Establishment
       of an Advisory Committee

   An Emergency Planning Inspectorate and Advisory Committee on
   Emergency Planning should be established to ensure adequate
   development of a new statutory emergency planning system, to
   investigate disasters and publish a report of the findings,
   and to provide training packages and models. These latrter
 - aspects are supported by the Fennell Report into the Kings *s
   Cross disaster, which recommends that "consideration should
   be given to a national disaster planning desk where
   experience gained from disasters and their investigation, and
   civil emergencies can be retained."    The CIMAH Regulations
   specify the Health and Safety Executive-as such an
   inspectorate which is independent from Local Government and
   able to exercise its powers effectively in accordance with
   the law and central government policy.

Dear Sirs

RE: SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS - THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

We  refer to your letter of    9 May.   Unfortunately we cannot help
as  we have   only acted for   Sheffield Wednesday over the last 2
or 3 years.     In any event, it is not our practice to keep    files
which are more than 6 years old.

       Scheme for Major Peacetime Emergencies

       I refer to my memorandum of 18th January, 1989, and the arrangements which
       were made to update the Council’s Scheme for Major Peacetime Emergencies. As
       you may be aware, the circulation of the revised Scheme has now been deferred
       for a few weeks in order to take into account and incorporate in the Scheme
       any issues and implications arising from the recent disaster at the
       Hillsborough Stadium.

       If there are any issues or aspects of the plan which you consider should be
       revised as a result of the disaster I should be pleased to hear from you as
       soon as possible.

       Dear



       HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY



       In response to your letter dated 23 May, inviting the Association to

       submit evidence to Lord Justice Taylor' Inquiry into the Hillsborough

    ... disaster, I attach a Memorandum of Evidence on the Association's

       behalf with an appendix, "Football Violence:   The Metropolitan

       Viewpoint".



       I have been asked to add that the Association has been giving

       consideration to the wider issues of peacetime emergency planning for

       some time now;   and to let the Inquiry have a copy of AMA document

       "Local Authorities and peacetime Emergency Planning:   A Review of

       Current Arrangements and Proposals for Improvement".   This document
             aj
       was adapted by the Association following wide consultation within the

       AMA and with concerned outside bodies.   It sets out the results of a

       review which detected serious gaps in the present arrangements, and

       contains proposals which are designed to place peacetime emergency

       planning by local authorities on an aceptable footing. Unfortunately,

       its relevance has been highlighted by a number of peacetime disasters,

       and most recently by Hillsborough.




\
The Association would also like to submit a paper prepared by the Emergency

Planning Unit of Merseyside Fire and Civil Defence Authority which builcs

on the document referred to above.   The Paper emphasises the need for

legislation t: establish a statutory general peacetime plan ;-;hich would

require local authorities to draw up comprehensive emergency response

procedures. Tnese would involve co-ordination of local authority service -

including liaison with police and fire services - adequate 24 hour call-out

and stand-by systems for minor emergencies, and hazard appraisals -.;hich

would list all major risks in the area.   The AMA believes that

metropolitan districts and London boroughs - normally in the frontline when

it comes to coping with emergencies - should each have at least one

full-time peacetime emergency planning officer to complement those at

county level.   Their work would be backed up by the creation of an

Emergency Planning Inspectorate and an Advisory Committee on Emergency

Planning, whose role would be to investigate disasters, publish their

findings and provide training packages and models.



The Association is very willing to provide Lord Justice Taylor with

any further information that might be required during the course of

the Inquiry.

Specific Carrroents


Para 4     - it should be stressed that each ground is different.

Para 5     - should the reference in the first line to Hillsborough in fact
             be a reference to Bradford?

              although the pitch can constitute a designated place of safety,
              for the purposes of the West Terrace this was not the escape
              route envisaged by the Fire Service. The exit route in an
              emergency for this particular terrace (pens 3 and 4) was
              through the tunnel and the gates at the back of the radial
              fencing. Alternative means of escape must be shown to a crcvri
              by effective policing/stewarding on the spot. Any sign posting
              would by its very existence turn a temporary or alternative
              escape route into one which would be used by seme if not all
              the people in the crowd as a primary means of escape.

Para 5(b) - "each exit should wherever possible have direct access to open
             air

              To suggest otherwise would be totally impractical in existing
              sports grounds.

Para 5(e) -   The Inquiry has heard very detailed evidence with regard to the
              siting of emergency gates and the use of radios within grounds.
              Caution should be exercised in making specific recommendations
              without reference to the expert evidence available on each of
              these points. However, it should be noted

               (1)    There are other quick release devices to be considered
                      other than panic bolts or electronic switches.

               (2)    Provision of canmunication systems must be sensible and
                      supported by adequate training.

               (3)    The risk to stewards in "foreign" territory has been
                      brought to the attention of the Inquiry.

Para 6(a) - The issue of ticket games needs careful consideration. Where
            are the outlets to be for the sale of tickets? What happens to
            segregation? Is it really necessary for ordinary league
            matches?

              For "big" games which are expected to be a sell-out, all
              tickets might be a good idea. Should there then be Police
              checking tickets a distance frcm the ground and turning those
              away without tickets? (This Police role may be a politically
              sensitive issue). There nay then be the need for a
              "sterilisation" area for fans.
                                  2.



Para 6(b)   Responsibility for spectator safety should remain with the
            Club. The Local Authority would have grave reservations about
            a Council Official being present on the day to enforce safety
            provisions. [This seems to encourage the occupier to leave to
            the Council, responsibility for something which really should
            be done by the occupier.

            cf theatre licences and liquor licences etc.

Para 7(b)   Obviously, several authorities have additional expenses
            including Kncwsley and the Police.

Para 7(d)   (1)   Seme officers, in some building control sections may, by
                  virtue of their particular experiences, be able to assist
                  in aesessiiig crowd movement and dynamics, but it is
                  primarily the Police and the Fire Brigade who have
                  expertise in these areas.

            (2)   Match day "spot checks" by all members of the advisory
                  group are a good idea. Anything more comprehensive than
                  this would be difficult to achieve in practice.

            (3)   A vital issue is the need to drastically review the
                  recommendations of the method of calculating the safe
                  ground capacities for terraced areas and viewing slopes
                  as outlined in the Hone Office Guide to Safety of Sports
                  Grounds. The term "peak viewing" area should be further
                  defined and given a maximum size and arrangements made
                  for a maximum number of persons based on 54 per lOm^ to
                  occupy that part of the facilities. All other areas
                  should be classified as requiring a substantially lower
                  density factor (possibly 40. per lOra^) yet maintaining the
                  need for 6kn/m tests to be achieved on all crush
                  barriers. (This maximum calculation should be reduced,
                  as in the current guide, depending on the state of the
                  terrace or viewing slope.)

                  The figure of 54 per lOm^ is used throughout the terrace
                  and therefore must be an average figure. This average is
                  exceeded in peak viewing areas and therefore any safety
                  factors are reduced proportionately.

                  It is also important in the light of Hillsborough, not
                  just to calculate terrace capacities but also to ensure
                  that there is on the spot monitoring that the capacities
                  are not exceeded or at least to keep a close eye on the
                  crowd to ensure that they are not too tightly packed.

                  In self-contained terraces it might be possible to
                  monitor capacities by means of a turnstile. Where the
                  terrace is not self-contained and there is the
                  possibility of movement by fans in and out of the terrace
                  or to other parts of the terrace the only control
                  possible would seem to be effective supervision by Police
                  or stewards whose task is to ensure proper "packing" of
                  terraces.


                                                                                J!
             (4)   The playing area is not always designated as a place of
                   safety. Adequate provision of exits and exit routes
                   should ensure that evacuation is achieved without
                   crushing.

General points which the AMA may wish to consider

1.   Annual certificates.

2.   Recovery of reasonable fees.

3.   Improvement/prohibition notice system.

4.   Clarification as to the status of the Guide - whether parts should be
     regulatory or in an Approved Code of Practice.

5.   Model conditions - N.B. Popplewell suggested at para 3.81 that the AMA
     draw up model conditions.

6.   Simplification and codification of legislation.

7.   National first aid guidelines.

8.   Pooling of information nationally - available to relevant authorities -
     for discussion etc.

9.   Role of the Health and Safety Executive.

10. Safety management as a central aspect to the occupiers business.

11. Safety planning by the occupier.

12. More clarity regarding the relationship between the occupier and the
     relevant authorities and their respective roles and responsibilities.

13. The Nimes fences need to be looked at very carefully. They can create
    different problems, e.g. dll the fans on the pitch, fans falling
     forward, fence to act as a crush barrier, strength of gate catches,
    problems of using electronic catches.

14. I.D. cards - patterns of attendance
                - two turnstile systan - not room at most grounds
                - additional policing required.

15. There is a danger of the very specific problems at Hillsborough being
     used as a format for the future - the wider issues must be considered.

Recommendat i ons to the Hillsborough Inquiry -
As you  probably   know the Inquiry has asked tor recoramendatlons to be made to i t
 in writing in the   .fairly near future* I believe that t tee Council w ill probably,
 have some reco&oendati   ons to raake and 1 wonder therefore if you would consider
.your Department’s    position in relation to recommendations as soon aa possible*
1 anticipate that the recommendatJons which the Inquiry w ill fee interested In
w ill relate to general matters In relation, to the Statutory framework within
which safety of sports grounds operate and also, sp e c ific comments in relation to
fo r example crowd control, pens,             etc*.
As far as the Council's internal administrative system i s concerned that w ill be
'reviewed' in due coarse'and' you w ill have a f u l l opportunity to put your views in
conneetloti with i t .
"Would ■ you please le t me have a response, to t h i s . memorandum as ..soon' as possible*; '

                                             OUT OF HOURS SERVICE


                  The plans to move the Service to Liverpool E.D.T. have not worked
            well, A combination of the problems with telephone lines and the perceptlonR-
            £>f the volunteers have resulted in a refusal by the majority of the Team
            to accommodate the service beyond the weekend of 7th July, 1989. In the     '
            interests of the service and the volunteers a decision was made not
            to puraue this further.

                  Several options have been explored.

                  (i)      switch to another location - nr-nht«m w i n   f a W ft_fl
                           to achieve.

                (ii)       resume the service at Johnson Street - unlikely given
                           staff resources, energy and holidays to be able to achieve
                           other implications security within building.

               (i i i )   Ansaphone Service with in tercep t to g*?itch c a ll automatically
'w'                       to another number „

                (iv)      AiuMHiiuiic Set »iuc whichwould give message ana     oiler advice
                          for where to get help.

                 Discussions have taken place with the Helpline Coordinators which
            largely revolved around options (iii) and (iv) other two options immediately
            ruled out an too problematic.

                 The feelings coming from the Co-ordinators indicates a lack of
            energy and resources to attempt to staff a service out of hours. They
            did not feel able personally to provide a back-up service and thought
            the practicalities of trying to set up such a rota too complex and
            time-consuming.

                  Their preference somewhat reluctantly was for option (iv).

                 The Inter-Agency Group has had a commitment to a 24 hour telephone
            service with a personal response.  Option (iv) is a move away from this
            stance.  Tt if? regrettable.

                 The volume of calls has reduced dramatically.  On the basis of
            the information recorded on weekday evenings there are frequently no
            calls or just one. At weekends the number of calls ranges between
            1-4 calls, over the 2 days. Not all of these are counselling calls
            or from people requiring help as opposed to information. However,
            the ansaphone approach will mean that some callers in distress will



                  The Inter-Agency group is asked to consider the two options
            (iii) and (iv). Option (iii) is feasible if one or two of the
            agencies are willing to assist in running the service either through
            their E.D.T. Service or by helping to set up teams to he on col! from
            hOfoe or a particular base. The intercept works by     8-10 second
            delay, following call in on 3414/3413, call would automatically switch
            to new number without caller having to re-dial.

                 Pending decisions of Inter-Agency Group, I will attempt to*negotiate
            a further weekend of cover-with E.D.T. though I am not optimistic.  I will
            also further investigate ansaphone cover of some kind from 7th July.

             On a more postxve note, I have begun negotiations with Ed Murphy
       regarding permanent relocation of the Helpline within Voluntary Sector.
       I am due to meet with Ed Murphy and his Co-ordinating Group on
       Thursday 6th July to plan this. Target is to achieve this in 6-8 weeks.
       Perhaps you could inform your staff so that thay can see demands upon
       "Chem will shortly cease* In the meantime, your continued help and
       co-operation in staffing a Monday-Frlday day time service would be
       <cuoh appreciated.

Dear Sir,
                              TRAINING


Hillsborough Disaster.

We acknowledge receipt of the various letters enclosing details of claims
made against you arising out of this incident.

We enclose an updated alphabetical list of all claimants but we anticipate
that, if the Liverpool Steering Committee is to be believed, there will be
at least another 400 claims yet to come.

You may well be aware from the media that proceedings have been launched for
a First Test Action to enable liability to be decided and these proceedings
will commence in the name of Jean Chapman Administrator of the Estate of
her husband Raymond Chapman.  The proceedings are brought by Brian Thompson
& Partners of Liverpool and Sheffield Wednesday Football Club are First
Defendants and the Chief Constable South Yorkshire Police the Second
Defendant.

However, we are given to understand that the solicitors propose to join as
Third Defendant the Sheffield City Council and possibly the Fourth Defendant
Eastwood & Partners.

It may be that in the near future proceedings will be served upon you and
no doubt you will pass these to us for our attention whereupon we shall
instruct KeebjLe Hawsons of Sheffield to enter a Defence.

Yours faithfully,

1   I was born on 7th March 1962

2   I joined SYMAS approximately 5 years ago.              I am now a

    qualified ambulanceman with my base at Middlewood.         When I

    joined SYMAS     I was   initially an ambulance cleaner     for a

    period of 6 months.      I then became a part time ambulance man
    working 30 hours per week.        This lasted for a period of

    approximately 6 months and I was based at Hoyland.         I then

    returned to Barnsley Station as a full time ambulance man.
    I undertook a 2 week basic training course at Fairfield in
    Rotherham and thereafter I attended a 6 week residential

    course at Markfield, Leicester with a further 2 week driving

    course for ambulances, also at Markfield.      After 2 years on

    the road I became a qualified ambulance man.       It should be
    noted   that   the   main   difference   between   a    qualified

    ambulanceman and a normal ambulanceman is the fact that one
    is allowed to undertake emergency cases when qualified.          I

    was based at Hoyland when I became qualified,          and when a
    shift vacancy became available approximately 6 weeks ago, I

    transferred to Middlewood.

3   On Saturday 15th April 1989 my duty was 0600 to 1400 hours.

    I finished my shift at 1415 hours and drove home, actually

    passing Leppings Lane at approximately 1425 hours.       I recall

    driving along Leppings Lane at this time fairly easily, and
    as   I proceeded on to Penistone Road,      I noticed    that   at

    Wadsley Bridge    (a railway station only used     for football
    matches and approximately 400 yards from the ground) a train

to myself that^there would probably be a delay at the semi­
final.

I arrived home at approximately 1500 hours, had some lunch,

got changed and generally got ready to go into Barnsley with
my wife to do some shopping.                            I turned the radio on when we

got into the car at approximately 1530 hours.                                     I intended to

listen      to    Radio        Sheffield            to       find    out    the    up   to    date

football scores.               I heard over the radio that there was an

incident at Hillsborough and that six people had died.                                           I

then noticed a WYMAS ambulance driving by, and presumed that
the vehicle was going directly Hillsborough.                                      I immediately

turned      the   car around              and      telephoned         control       from home.

When I eventually made contact I spoke to a young lady at
control and asked her if my assistance was required.                                         I was

requested to report to my own base, and I immediately got

back       into     uniform            and       set         off    for     Middle woo d       at
approximately 1555 hours.                        I arrived at Middlewood some 15

minutes later.           As I arrived, I noticed that ambulance woman

                  was already present,                       along with                       and
                        who were just getting ready to go out in a
vehicle.                           said that                              and I were to team
up and stand by at Middlewood.                                We sat in the station on
standby for some 30/40 mins.

A   call    was     then      received          from control,              at approximately

1630 hours and we were requested to attend a collapse on




                                                  if I   ■
             Road,       Hillsborough.                       and    I     took    a

vehicle with code sign 'Sierra 104', a n d d r o v e                    directly
to   Hillsborough         along    Middlewood     Road    and     then    on     to

            Road.         We arrived at                   Road some 2 or 3

minutes     after     leaving     Middlewood,     and     were    immediately

beckoned by two police officers to attend the casualty who

was laid on his side.             The casualty was also accompanied by

two of his friends.           I asked the friends for details of the

casualties name and they replied by saying that they played
football with the casualty, and after seeing him in trouble

inside the ground had been able to pull him out.                           After

walking for a short distance, the casualty had collapsed on

          IRoad.

The casualty was conscious but appeared to be in shock.                          I

brought the carrying chair out of the ambulance and put him
into the chair and then loaded him onto the ambulance, at

which point                   and I transferred the casualty onto a
stretcher.         The   casualty's     two    friends    accompanied       him.

                 drove straight to the Northern General Hospital
and I remained in the back of the vehicle attending the

casualty.         On the way to the Hospital the casualty lost

consciousness but carried on breathing.                  He did not respond
to verbal        requests   for details of his name,              nor did he

respond     to    painful    stimuli,    ie:    nipping     his    ear.          I

inserted an airway and turned him onto his side.                    An airway
holds the tongue in place.            After a couple of minutes, the
casualty   rejected     the   airway,    regained        consciousness   and
began to answer some questions.               I recollect that his name
was                  and he told me that he was from Birkenhead.
 He knew very        little about what        had happened inside the

ground and when I asked whether he had been drinking,                     he
replied 'no'.

We reached the Hospital within a few minutes and pulled up

outside the casualty department.               When I opened the rear

doors, I initially noticed a number of photographers and TV

cameras within a small crowd.           I helped offload the patient
and took him into the casualty department,                   when we were

requested by a doctor to take him into the resuscitation

room   where   the    patient   was   transferred        onto   a   Hospital
trolley.

               and   I then     returned      to   our   vehicle,    radioed
control and were advised to return to base.                We arrived back
at Middlewood at approximately 1710 hours, and waited at the

station for some 30-40 mins.          It was only at this point that
I began to realise the enormity of the incident.                     Whilst

waiting at Middlewood the 1000 hours to 1800 hours crew came

into the station ie:                    and                     , although

they very quickly went out to attend a collapse.

       and I then received a call from control to attend an

Old Peoples' Home for the purposes of transferring a patient

from this Home to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital.                     After
carrying out this transfer, we were requested by control to
     return to base, arriving back at approximately 1830 hours.

     Some 15 minutes later,         control informed us to go to the

     intensive care unit at Northern General Hospital so as to

     transfer a patient to the Royal Hallamshire           for a scan.

     This particular patient was a casualty from the football

     match at Hillsborough,     and I would say that the time was
     approximately 2025 hours when the patient was off-loaded at

     the Royal Hallamshire.          On our return to the vehicle, we

     radioed control and were requested to return to base.            On
     our journey back to Middlewood,         I asked control whether I

     could go home because I was on duty at 0600 hours the next

     morning   and   my   request    was   granted.   Therefore,   after
     arriving back at Middlewood, I helped tidy up the ambulance

     vehicle and then signed off.


Dated the            day of                1989.

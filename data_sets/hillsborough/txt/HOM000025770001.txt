Dear Mr Jones

Thank you for your letter of 21 December to Lord Justice Taylor
who has asked me to reply on his behalf.  I am sorry that you
have not received an earlier response.

Lord Justice Taylor is grateful to you for forwarding your
revised proposals and has noted the suggested establishment of a
Working Party to deal specifically with communications systems in
public places.  Ultimately, as you appreciate, it will be for him
to make whatever recommendations he sees fit regarding the Green
Guide in general and communications in particular, but I hope you
will be reassured that he has taken careful note of the points
you have made.

                                        Yours sincerely

                        Inquiry into the Hillsborough Disaster

 Your Lordship,

 Thank you for your letters of 4th December and 8th December in
 response to our efforts to assist on the subject of Safety at
 Sports Grounds (Sound S y s t e m s ) .

 During our most recent meeting the Working Group revised its
 previous proposals and has pleasure in enclosing them herewith.

 The Working Group has assembled a considerable body of evidence
 towards the production of a Guide to Communications Systems for
 Safety at Sports Grounds but feels that it would be
 inappropriate to pre-empt the deliberation of a Working Party,
 the establishment of which this a Working Group sincerely hopes
 will be recommended by your Inquiry.

 You may agree that the concept of such a Working Party may be
 better applied to the overall subject of Safety in Public Places
 which would specifically include Sports Grounds.

 The prospect of your final report has certainly caused a
 positive reaction from many venues which are not all sports
 grounds. It is certainly hoped that your report will be the
 catalyst for a greater emphasis to be placed upon safety in
 public places.

 We look forward to your favourable response and if we can be of
 any further assistance either now or in the future, please do
 not hesitate to contact us. With best wishes and seasonal
 greetings, we remain,

 yours sincerely




 S t e p h e n .P .Jones

                     Safety at Sports Grounds

                          (Sound Systems)



Working Group Objectives:

The long term objective of the Working Group is to seek the
augmentation of the existing Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds.
The Working Group considers that much greater guidance is
necessary on the subject of Communications within public places
such as sports grounds.

The Working Group believes that the best w ay forward to achieve
this objective would be to establish a Working Party appointed
by the Home Secretary to consider these matters in detail.

The Working Group has been constituted with representation of
all the interested professional Institutes and therefore
believes that in itself it provides an appropriate base for
such an official Working Party and is willing to take such an
active role upon request.


Composition of the Group:

Institute of Sound & Communication Engineers - Stephen Jones
                                               (Chairman)

Noise Council (Institute of Environmental Health Officers
Appointee) - Jim Sanderson

                    Safety at Sports Grounds

                         (Sound Systems)



The working group proposes that a Working Party be commissioned
by the Home Secretary.

The Working Party shall consider:-

 A) That Section 12: Communications of the Guide to Safety at
    Sports Grounds be replaced with a new Guide to
    Communications Systems for Safety at Sports Grounds.


  B) A research programme be commissioned in line w it h the
     previous proposal sent on 24th October 1989 (copy
     attached).


  C) To consider amendments to the present licensing procedures
     to ensure that communications systems are properly
     incorporated.

Expansion of the points raised in the foregoing proposals



   The Existing Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds


1) The Working Group has concluded that Section 12 of the
   existing Guide to Safety at Sports Ground is totally
   inadequate as it gives no standards to assess the
   performance of a system for licensing purposes. Consequently
   it is not possible to use the Guide for the purposes of the
   design, specification and instructions for use of the
   Communications System.



   Research of Noise Levels


2) As previously submitted, not enough is known about the
   effects of crowd packing in the open, under a canopy, or in
   a corridor to be able to specify objective design parameters
   for evacuation systems. Similarly, the psychoacoustic effect
   of warning tones and message systems is unclear as to
   whether these help or hinder.



   Licensing Procedure


3) No licensing procedure will be effective unless there is an
   adequate assessment procedure.

     WORKING GROUP ON SAFETY IN SPORTS GROUNDS                                            (Sound Systems)

Outline of research required to inform a new "Guide to the design
and specification of sound systems for safety at sports grounds
(and other places of public assembly)"


Introduction

The only practicable method of communieating with any large mass
of p e o p l e in an e me r g e n c y s i t u a t i o n is v i a an e f f e c t i v e s o u n d
system.           In o r d e r to be e f f e c t i v e ,       the s o u n d s y s t e m m u s t
p r o v i d e c o m p r e h e n s i v e c o v e r a g e of all p u b l i c a r e a s , w i t h
negligible distortion, and at high enough sound levels to overcome
any c o m p e t i n g b a c k g r o u n d noises, e i t h e r d ue to the crowd, or
arising elsewhere. Given these basic requirements, the system must
then be operated by competent personnel to give the right messages
at the right times to control the situation and encourage public
egress           without           panic  or     creating        further     emergencies.
Unfortunately, there are a number of conflicting requirements.
First, o v e r s p e c i f i c a t i o n of the m a x i m u m s o u n d level o u t p u t
capability can dramatically increase the cost, and will therefore
delay the provision of such systems on a nationwide basis. Second,
o v e r s p e c i f i c a t i o n could lead to u n n e c e s s a r y p u b l i c n u i s a n c e
outside the confines of the sports ground                             under non-emergency
c irc um st a nc es , w i t ho ut c o n s i d e r a b l e c a r e in the s e l e c t i o n a n d
siting of loudspeakers, and the specification of ambient noise
sensing and signal processing for the control of output level.
Third, the r e l a y i n g of e m e r g e n c y m e s s a g e s at too h i g h a s o u n d
level could be counterproductive in controlling panic situations.
U n d e r s p e c i f i c a t i o n will, of c o u r se , r e s u l t in an i n e f f e c t i v e
system.

T h e r e is a l s o the p r o b l e m of the s e l e c t i o n of a p p r o p r i a t e
messages. In many cases different messages may be appropriate for
different 2ones of the public areas. There is a case here for
digitally pre-recorded messages, with alternative high quality
m i c r o p h o n e inputs to the s y s t e m to deal w i t h the u n e x p e c t e d .
There are a number of problems associated with special non-speech
warning sounds and sequences.              Such signals can be misinterpreted,
or have unexpected effects, unless the public have been trained in
their use in advance. Standardisation and pre-event demonstration
could be of considerable benefit in this respect. Warning tones
have been used to alert staff without alerting the public, who are
l i k e l y to i n t e r p r e t t h e m as a f a u l t r a t h e r t h a n b e i n g of
importance, if they notice them at all. Effective systems will
ensure that messages can be heard correctly by the majority of the
public present, but this does not mean that they will necessarily
react in the way intended.

The guidelines for the design and specification of sound systems
must include some means of being able to determine the sound level
output and coverage requirements of the system, and should also
p r o v i d e g ui d a n c e for the s e l e c t i o n a n d z o n i n g of a p p r o p r i a t e
m es s a g e s to deal w i t h as m a n y as p o s s i b l e of the p o t e n t i a l
e m e r g e n c y s i t u a ti on s that mig ht a r is e. S i n c e the p r o v i s i o n of
effective systems could be                  a matter of life or death at some
futu r e emergency, it is c o n s i d e r e d v i t a l l y i m p o r t a n t that the
guidelines should be based on the results of a carefully planned
programme of field research and experimentation, rather than being
based solely on theoretical considerations, as would have to be
applied if the research was not carried out.

Research objectives

The objectives of being able to specify the technical requirements
of the sound system, and to specify appropriate messages can be
c l e a r l y s e p a r a t e d in t e r m s of t h e n e c e s s a r y t i m e s c a l e s .
Theoretical estimates of the                 technical requirements of the system
could be investigated by a limited study of crowd noise levels at
a representative selection of sports grounds and similar places in
the U n i t e d Kingdom. This wor k c o u l d lead to an e m p i r i c a l l y
verified crowd noise prediction method within a relatively short
period, p r o v i d e d that the p r o j e c t w a s r e s o u r c e d to a l l o w for
measurements at a number of sites simultaneously at each venue.
The parameters which would need to studied would include crowd
d e n s i t y a n d l ev e l of e x c i t e m e n t , t h e e f f e c t s of d i f f e r e n t
structures (such as grandstand roofs) and seating arrangements,
and the typical variability of noise levels from one meeting to
the next in different public areas. This prediction method would
allow precise specification of system technical requirements to
avoid dangerous underprovision or costly overprovision. A number
of final checks should be made by operating existing or temporary
systems in accordance with a provisional specification to ensure
that s ys t em i n t e l l i g i b i l i t y r e q u i r e m e n t s (as e v a l u a t e d b o t h
subjectively and objectively) can be met within the guidelines as
proposed at that time. There is little doubt that such a programme
could be carried out successfully within a few months, depending
only on the level of resourcing to allow work to be carried out
either serially, or in parallel.

The objective of being able to specify appropriate messages can
only be met by a m u c h longer term r e s e a r c h p r o j e c t . E f f e c t i v e
coverage must be the first priority, since there is little point
in being able to select from a range of specific messages to suit
different situations if only a proportion of them will be heard.
There are also a number of research difficulties, as the objective
is to investigate the effects of different types of message on
large numbers of the public under emergency situations. It will
c l e a r l y be n e c e s s a r y to d e v i s e s om e f o r m of c o m p l e t e l y non-
h a z a r d o u s yet c o n v i n c i n g e m e r g e n c y s i m u l a t i o n u s i n g c a r e f u l l y
selected and instructed volunteers for any experiments, and to
overcome any doubts as to the validity of such data to real-life
emergencies. There is little prospect of significant progress in
this area w i t h i n any short t im e s c a l e . T h e b e s t w a y to p r o c e e d
would be to conduct a comprehensive literature review in the first
instance, leading to a prioritised list of recommendations as to
possible experimental techniques to overcome these problems.                                          The
review should take account of all available reports and evidence
relating to human behaviour under emergency situations and the
extent to which it can be modified by the provision of different
types of message, b e a r i n g in m i n d the e f f e c t s of t r a i n i n g an d
prior experience and the extent to which these factors influence
the comprehensibility of particular messages.
Recommendat ions

A purely theoretical assessment of the technical requirements for
effective sound systems for safety at sports grounds could lead to
d an g e r o u s u n d e r s p e c i f i c a t i o n , or e x p e n s i v e a n d p o t e n t i a l l y
objectionable overspecification of system hardware. We strongly
r e c o m m e n d that a short term s t u d y to d e v e l o p an e m p i r i c a l l y
validated method of predicting crowd noise levels be put in hand
as a matter of immediate priority, on the lines outlined above.
The results of this study will allow the output level and coverage
requirements to be precisely determined for all likely situations.
The working group can provide detailed proposals and costings for
such a study on request.

The matter of the selection of appropriate messages, and therefore
the specification of how such systems should optimally be used
m u s t be lef t to the o p e r a t o r ' s d i s c r e t i o n o n th e b a s i s of
experience for the time being as there is little justification for
delaying the publication of new guidelines while the necessary
long-term research is carried out. Nevertheless, we recommend that
a comprehensive literature review be carried out as a first step,
with the o b j e c t i v e of id e n t i f y i n g e x p e r i m e n t a l t e c h n i q u e s for
future application that may overcome the difficulties referred to
above. Any new knowledge gained as a result of that research would
then be i n c or po r at ed into u p d a t e d v e r s i o n s of the g u i d e l i n e s
whenever possible.

Depending on the availability of resources, the crowd noise level
prediction study should take first priority, with the literature
r e v i e w on m e s s a g e s e l e c t i o n a n d e f f e c t i v e n e s s as a s e c o n d
priority, purely because any work resulting from recommendations
made on the basis of the literature review would be likely to
require a timescale measured in years rather than months.

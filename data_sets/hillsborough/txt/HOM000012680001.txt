    HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S FINAL REPORT

    Many of the recommendations of the above mentioned report impact
    dxrectly upon local authorities and were brought to their
    attention by Home Office Circular 11/1990.

    Those aspects concerning the Police Service were the subject of a
    letter from Mr Boys Smith to Mr Anderton dated 16 February. The
    letter requested Mr Anderton to formally bring the report's
    recommendations and the Government's response to them to the
    attention of ACPO.
■


    Copies of the report were circulated to you on 29 January and I
    now attach a schedule showing the Government•s response to the
    recommendations set out in Chapters 3, 4 and 5.

    Sir Richard feels that it would be appropriate at the next monthly
    meeting to consider the role of the Inspectorate in respect of
    implementation of the recommendations.

    1 suggest that the following recommendations are perhaps the most
    relevant to the Inspectorate:

              Recommendation 11 - Statement of intent between the club
                                  and the police.
         2-   Recommendation 16 - Briefing and training of officers,
                                  in respect of crowd dynamics,
                                  recognition of crowd densities,
                                  distress signs etc.
         3•   Recommendation 27 - Immediate review of safety
                                  certificates.

                                  in the interpretation and use of the

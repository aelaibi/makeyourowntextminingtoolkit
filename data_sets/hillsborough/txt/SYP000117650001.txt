attention           to    Licensed          Premises.

On    three     occasions             between        11.00 am           and    2.00    pm       I attended           at      the

At     approximately                       S. 30       pm    I went          to H e r r i e s         Road    following             reports

that        private              coaches           containing                Nottingham Forest                    supporters                were

officer              was        released           to       undertake             that     task.

1 remained                  in H e r r i e s           Road and            subsequently                heard a         number          of    r a dio

transmissions                     (perhaps              two       or     t h r e e ) concerning                problems           with       f a ns     in

I made           my    way        towards              the       ground along              Herries           Road      and    Herries             Road

R oad North.

At     approximately                       3.03        pm    I was        in H e r r i e s       Rod South             near       to    the

The     transmissions                       were        badly          distorted,              but     I heard         mention          of

Leppings              Lane        and       background                 noises       which        suggested             that       there       were

possible              problems              of     disorder             at    the        Leppings        Lane         end    of    the       g r o un d .

From        *0*   Gate        I went           to    th e a c c e s s       area      between           the N o r t h        S t an d and

the     Spion       Kop and              then       onto       the    perimeter            tr a c k .       I looked            towards

th e    Leppings             Lane        end a n d        saw a h e a v y          contingent              of P o l i c e       Officers

containing              what a p p e a r e d           to be         s o m e f o r m of         pitchinvasion                and

I observed              the    Nottingham                 Forest        supporters              on    the       Spion      Kop and           it

was     immediately                 apparent          that       their       m o o d was         hostile          with       supporters

chanting,           clapping              and making             violent           gestures           d i r e c t e d -toward the

Leppings          Lane        end.         There          was    only a          handful         of     officers           at    the       far

end     of    the       perimeter              track       (South S t a n d           end)       and       I concluded             t ha t     it

was     necessary             to     retain a             contingent             of' o f f i c e r s       at    the       Spion Kop          end

to     defuse       the       situation              and       prevent       any      possibility                of    a    pitch

invasion.               I signalled                 officers          on    to     the     perimeter             track       and      formed

a    line     in f r o n t          of    the       Kop    facing          the     fans     in o r d e r         to     contain        the

intermittent                 and     distorted             transmissions.

Two    or     three          spectators              (presumably             Liverpool)               made       their       way      from

the L e p p i n g s          Lane        end    toward          the    Spion        Kop     gesticulating                  and

provoking           a    similar           and       very       hostile          response            from       supporters            on     the

Kop.         I detailed              officers             to    usher      them       back       towards          the      Leppings

I was        joined          by a        peson who             identified           himself           as    the       ’C o m m e r c i a l

Agent*        for       Nottingham              Forest          and    together            we    walked          up a n d       down       the

perimeter           track           signalling             to    spectators              in the         Kop      in a n a t t e m p t         to

between        the        No r t h S t a n d            and Spion           K o p.         I went        to       that      loc at io n and

stretcher            carriers             were          making     their             way    towards           the       same         location          and

attempts            were          made    to       channel        them       o ut      of       the    ground           toward         the

gymnasium            behind             the    N o r t h Stand.               I also            r e ca l l    an a m b u l a n c e           making

Whilst         these          activities                were     ongoing             fans       in the        Spion         Ko p were                „

The    Liverpool                  supporters             were     gradually                ushered           b a ck     toward          the

joined         in t h a t          task       to    prevent        any        further            movement             of    fans        and

reduce         the       potential             for       disorder.

I conferred                  with       Chief       Superintendent                    N E S B I T , advised                him       about       the

reinforcements,                      called         for    dog     handlers                to     come       on to         the       p i t c h at

cordon and               I was          becoming          more     arid m o r e            aware       of     the       scale         of     the

equally         c lear            that    the       majority           of     people            in the        lower         e nd s      of    the

little         true          perception             of w h a t     had        happened.

It w a s       either       at     this     stage       or    shortly        after,          following       consultation

The     scene      at      the     Leppings        Lane       end    was     one    of       confusion       with       hundreds

officers          were      assisting            and     resuscitating             injured          persons.           Groups         of

Liverpool           supporters             were    milling          around        amongst       the       casualties          many

approaching              the      cordon        obviously          in t r a u m a a n d       displaying          a mixture

of     grief      and anger.               I approached             several        groups       attempting             to    c al m

the        situation and             requesting           that      they move           to    the    outer       perimeter

tracks.           Most      were        receptive,           but    certain        individuals             proved

vociferous           and       made       abusive        comments          about    the P o l i c e ,       Sheffield

group         of f o u r    young         men,    one     of w h o m       repeatedly          directed abuse                at me

shouting          " I t ’s y o u        bastards,        you       caused      this."          He w a s     physically

restraind           by     tw o    of     his    friends       who     indicated             that    he    was    ’t a l k i n g      in

disorder             I returned          to     the     ground      and       sought          further         instructions

from Gro u n d             Control.           I was      requested^to               ’s t a n d     by*       at    the        rear     of

the N o r t h         Stand.

I visited             th e      gymnasium         where      I. s a w     rows      of    bodies         l a id      out       on    the

floor,          each       supervised           by a P o l i c e        Officer.              This      was       th e    first        t i me

I fully             realised       the     extent        and magnitude                of w h a t        had       happened.              A

number          of    officers          who     were     with      the     bodies         were         clearly           distressed

( some         of    them my       one     F2     officers         — P C ’s 2 9 6 3 S i n g h ,              2902 Roberts                and

1 1 24 P r a t t )         and    I spent         time      counselling             them and            enquiring              about

their          welfare.           I then went            into      the     North         Stand         where       in     conjunction

with Superintendent                      GREENWOOD and              Inspector             SYKES         I spoke           with many

other          officers          who    were      clearly         in a s t a t e         of     shock,        again

counselling                the    officers         and      ensuring          their       needs         were       met.

At    a    later          stage    in     response          to a    radio        message           I met          other        Senior

Officers             at    Ground Control.                  Chief       Superintendent                  HOLE       (B!        was

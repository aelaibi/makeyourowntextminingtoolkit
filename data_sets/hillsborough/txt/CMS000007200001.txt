    ALL SEATING REQUIREMENT AT FOOTBALL LEAGUE GROUNDS

    Norman Lamont has asked me to reply to your letter of 29 May to
    Kenneth Clarke in which you seek comments on your proposed
    announcement to review the requirement for all-seating at Third
    and Fourth Division football grounds in England and Wales. You
    leave open the possibility of a joint initiative with Scotland.

    2.   The idea of a review is sensible. Hooliganism seems to be on
    the decline, some standing-room terraces at Third and Fourth
    Division clubs appear to be safe and rapid-exit areas,    and the
    major crowd problems were in the First Division.

    3.   I note that      you also intend to review the August 1994
    deadline for Second Division clubs. I agree that this  should not
    be announced at      this ’ stage, so as to keep up thepressure on
    clubs to get ahead  with planning for their own contribution to
    implementing the Taylor recommendations.

    4.   I am copying this letter to the Prime Minister, Tony Newton t
    Kenneth Clarke, Ian Lang, David Hunt and Sir Robin Butler.

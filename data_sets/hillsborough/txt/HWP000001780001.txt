Dea r S i r /Madam

The Chair of the H i l l s borough Disas t e r Work i n g Party of Liverpool
C ity Council (Councillor Jack Spriggs) has asked me to invite you
to the meet i n g of the Working Party w hich is to be held at
Li verpool Town Hall at 12.30 p m on Friday, 27th February, 1998.
Deta i l s of the m e e t i n g are attached.

C o u n c i l l o r Spriggs is of the v i e w that this part i c u l a r meet i n g of
the W o r k i n g Party, w hich will be attended by Members of the Family
Suppor t Group, should be an open forum at which MP's and
r e p r e s e n t a t i v e s of other Councils in the area as well as City
Councillors, should have the o p p o r tunity to discuss all matters
r e l a t i n g to and arising from the announcement by the Home
S e c r e t a r y last wee k that there w o u l d be no further investigation
of or action related to the Hill s b o r o u g h Disaster.

I apologise for the short notice of the meeting but this has been
due to the circumstances involved and the need to consider the
n a t u r e of any responses w hich m a y be made to the a n n o u n c e m e n t , as
soon as possible. I w ould hope y o u will be able to attend what the
M e m b e r s of the W o r k i n g Party consider to be a ver y important
meeting. Howe v e r if you, for w h a t e v e r reason, are not able to be
there, perhaps you w ould be able to contact me on 0151 225 2431 if
y o u have any comments or views w h i c h you would w ish to be
su b m i t t e d to the meeting.


Yours    faithfully

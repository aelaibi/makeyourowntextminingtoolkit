          AN EVALUATION OF DECEASED AND INJURED IN PENS 3 AND A - INTERIM REPORT

          DECEASED

          We have been analysing the statements so far received from persons who
          can give evidence about persons who enter the Hillsborough ground and
          subsequently found to be dead.

          Of the ninety five who died we can now say that at least twenty entered
          after gate 'C' was opened at 1452 hours. This can be confirmed by
          reference to supporting statements. Attached at Annex 'A' is a list of
          the twenty deceased with the statement numbers referring. An indication
          is also given, where known, as to the pen number and whether the
          individual was in possession of a ticket. I can supply copies of the
          statements if required.

          The majority of the twenty seem to be in the first part of the crowd
          entering the gate, as distinct from themiddle or rear. The figures err
          on the side of caution and there are a number of other deceased who can
          quite clearly be identified in the crush outside the turnstiles in
          Leppings Lane, at or about, 1445 hours.   They became split up from their
          friends, who did enter by gate 'C', but there is no person able to
          identify the deceased entering through gate 'C '.

          In other cases, there are one or more persons who died, who went to the
          ground unaccompanied. In consequence, it is not possible to identify
          their point of entry or the timing.

          It is suggested that 20 deceased in relation to the totalnumber        of 95,
          is not insignificant.

         Examination of video/photographic evidence reveals only one positive
         identification at this stage, that of body 76, Anderson, who is being
         passed over the heads of spectators in pen 4 towards the front of the
         ground at 1512 hours, obviously, having been seriously injured.
         Another possible identification, body 19> Cox, is questionable and does
         not merit further comment.

  PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT
The 20 deceased entering the pens at the front of the crowd, could be
allied to the surge which can be seen on video MAP/1, at 1455.49 hours,
coming from the tunnel into pen 3 along the dividing fence and pen 4,
along the lefthand side.

In eight of the twenty deceased alcohol was detected.   The levels were
as follows

Body 23 Burkett - 99       Body 42 Hewittson   - 88     Body 45 Joynes   - 72
Body 59 Horn    - 55       Body 62 Glover      - 138    Body 71 Copoc    - 49
Body 76 Anderson - 76      Body 79 Roberts     - 79

INJURED

The Nominal Records of the persons, registered as injured were researched
together with their respective questionnaires.

The grid positions were recorded and plotted on Master Grids as shown in
Annex 'B' and are as follows

Single position indicated or a specific position indicated where the
injuries occurred - MAP/1.

No specific grid reference indicated as the position where injuries
occurred, then Position 1 is marked on MAP/2, Position 2 is marked on
MAP/3.

MAP/2 shows the first position occupied by the injured person immediately
on entering the pen. The high numbers in grid positions H1 and J1 tend
to suggest that those persons had just entered their respective pens via
the tunnel. The higher concentrations in individual grid positions are
towards the middle and rear.

MAP/3 shows the second position occupied by the injured person. This
indicates a marked redistribution of the injured towards the middle and
front of both pens 3 and 4. This may be considered consistent with a
large number of people entering the two pens from the rear and causing a
forward movement/pressure, ie the surge from the tunnel at 1455. Further
research has also been undertaken to correlate the injured with entry at
gate 'C' (see below).

To some extent MAP/1, in pen 3 confirms this.

A factor which should not be discounted is the possibility of some
injuries being caused to people at the front by the perimeter fence in
climbing, or being dragged over the fence and to others at the rear of
the pens in being pulled up into the west stand.

NB:   We have read many other statements of persons entering the ground
      through gate 'C' at or after 1452, who describe how, after entering
      the pens, they were propelled forward by sheer weight of numbers of
      the crowd behind to within feet of the perimeter fence.
TYPES AND FREQUENCIES OF INJURIES

We have also surveyed the injuries received in two classifications, those
received outside the ground (Leppings Lane turnstiles) and those received
inside the ground in pens 3 and 4.

The injured population for outside the ground totalled 20 cases, the
population for inside the ground totalled 549 cases. Annex 'C' lists
the distribution.

INJURED PERSONS ENTERING THROUGH GATE 'C1

The statements and questionnaires which relate to injured persons inside
the ground, were researched in an attempt to identify the point of entry
into the ground.

In most cases it is possible to identify entry through gate 'C' with some
certainty. In other cases, it is probable that the author of the
reviewed document is referring to the gate 'C'. The entry via gate 'C'
has, wherever possible, been confined to the third occasion when it was
opened and previous openings for the purpose of ejection etc, have been
disregarded. A set of classifications have been used as follows

Gate *C ' Definite             (GCD)
Gate 'C' Probable              (GCP)
Other Gate                     (OG)
Turnstile - Legal access       (TL)
Turnstile - Illegal access     (TI)

           38%     (41.5%)    (This figure includes definite and probable)

SIGNIFICANCE OF GRID POSITIONS H1 AND J1

As an exercise the specific correlation with these two grid positions
was undertaken and the results are of interest. In addition the second
position taken up by persons indicating their first position as H1 or J1
has been plotted on a Master Grid - - MAP/4 (see Annex 'D').

                                    A


MAP/A

Deals specifically with Grid Positions H1 and J1. A number of the
injured persons indicating these positions may well have just entered
the pens via the tunnel. The Map shows the distribution of these
persons at their second grid location. Pen 3 is clustered towards the
front from D6 to H8. The dispersal in pen A is more widespread, but
again is towards the middle to front of the pen.

I do hope that this information is of some help. If I can be of any
further assistance please do not hesitate to contact me.

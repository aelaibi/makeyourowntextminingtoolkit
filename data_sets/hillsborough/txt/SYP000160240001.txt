POLICE COMPLAINT 5/89

This was an allegation recorded as Theft/Corruption by South Yorkshire Police and was
investigated by West Midlands Police.

It was alleged by a Liverpool supporter that whilst waiting outside the turnstiles before kick
off, they saw a group of people knock on the spy hole of an exit Gate, the spy hole was
opened by a police officer. The officer was passed what was thought to be a £5 note through
the spy hole and then the gate opened allowing the group of people entry to the ground.

West Midlands police secured witness statements from the complainant and two associates,
one of which denied witnessing the alleged incident.

It was ascertained that the spy hole in the exit gate was made of sealed glass and had no
opening system. The gate was not under the supervision of the police but under the control
of two stewards who were interviewed and did not support the complainant’s account.

However, the investigation did ascertain that a group of persons had reported theft
(pickpocket) of their wallet and tickets to a police officer outside the turnstiles. That officer
took them into the stadium, via the exit gate, in order that a crime report could be completed
inside the gymnasium. Evidential statements, questionnaires, video footage and the original
crime report supported these findings.


OUTCOME

The West Midlands Investigating officer concluded that the allegation of theft/corruption was
unsustainable according to the evidence and clearly the complainant mistakenly interpreted
what took place at the exit gate.

The complainant was advised of these conclusions both personally and in writing.

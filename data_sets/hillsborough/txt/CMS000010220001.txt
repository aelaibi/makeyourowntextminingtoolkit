NOTE OF THE SECOND MEETING OF THE LIAISON GROUP

I have today received minutes of the second meeting of the joint
liaison group which was held in Marsham Street earlier this week.
I am, to say the least, surprised that it was seen fit to
circulate to all concerned, including the Football League, a note
of a meeting which I chaired, without consulting me on the draft
or even letting this Department know.       It was particularly
unfortunate because of the sensitivity of the main issue7 of all
seating.                               " '. .

In the cause of good working relationships, which I am sure we
both want, I hope you can assure me that it will not happen
again. Gan we please establish that whichever Department chairs
the meeting will provide a note and consult the other.
Yours sincerely

 N umber       of P ages       1

 Dated                     230689                                                                      J F E RG U SO N Si g n e d


                T od a y F r i d a y 23 June        1989   (230689)       I was     shown by                                of the

                Idlest M i d l a n ds Pol ic e Force a copy of a s tatement                       I made

                to the S ou t h Y o r k s h ir e Po lice          on 7th June        1989     (070689)„         I have       read

                this     s t a tement and .it is correct.                 I do    not wis h to add or amend

                anything           in this    statement.

                However        I would       like   to   point out that          on page 4 o f my            copy statement

                that     the       c o n v e r sa t io n wit h the 2 L iv erpool       m e n , the words used are

                what     I recall and not the actual words spoken.

               At     no time when           I spoke     to those two men did             I get       the    impression          that

                these men           intended      to enter    the gr ou nd by any other means                   than by

                lawful     entry        into the     ground.       These     two men were mature               persons and

                not     football        hooligans.

                I have     signed a n d d ated the            copy s tatement          I have        read t o d a y .

                 I had a r r a n g e d      to meet       a friend             called                        at the       puDxic

                 house.                                         and- he         is s ometimes         e mp loyed       by my    company

                 on a s u b -c o n tr a/ t        basis as and w he n work                    of that     nature        is required,,

                Ujhen I a r r i v e # at          the    public      house         I saw the          landlord;

                                        tnding at        the    entrance          and       he was    obv i ous .1y ve11 i ng        peo p 1 e

                 before    he a ll o we d         them ac cess            to the       premises.

                 I was aware            that a semi         final         football          m atch was    being        played    later
                                                                                                                       P AGE     S.
                                                                                                                       t<3U 14 A

    that day at          the H i l l s b o r o u g h S t ad i u m and the White Hart                      public house

    is p o s i t i o n e d on the m ai n         road      leading        from S h e f f i el d over            the

    P e n n i n e s , to M a n c he s t e r   and the N or th West                of the         country.        This

    public       house    is re gu la rl y frequented,                   on m atch days,            by football

    supporters.

    L went       outside      the     public, house an/' I w ou l d                estimate         that about SO

    persons were w i t h i n the bar arei,                      a m ix t ur e      of football            s upporters and

    local      people.

         easily a s c e r t a i n e d    that    the football             suppo rt er s          were    from Liverpool

    as    I could tell            by their a c c e n t s .

    T hese     people were          b eh aving      in an orde rl y manner                and there was               no

    trouble.

    The     premises w e r e / v e r y        full a nd      I was       s u b s e q u en t ly    joined    by my friend

                             we    had a couple j y f ' drinks and due to the                            premises          being

    busy we deci d e d            to visit             P he as a nt      public       house w hi ch        is situated
                           ------
    on S t a t i o n Road at O u g h t i b r i d g e and             is a short          distance away from the

    W hite Hart         public      house.       The      reason we         chose      that       public    house          is due

    to    it being       located on a quiet                side      road off         the main highway and wa

    as s u m e d that     football        s upporters m a y not               have     found       it

    used fay Liverpool              football        supporters.             The    premises         consist       o-

    rooms,       the    lounge      bar w h i c h    is    coraf o r tab ly furnished and the                     public

    bar w hich         is used for        games      etc.       O u tside       the    premises          there    is a

    t e r r a c e d / p a v e d area where       benches and seats are                    used by customers

    wishing       to   remain outside.               The     terraced area was                   busy and       I quickly

    a s c e r t a i n e d that a large          number       of the       people       outside were Liverpool

    football        supporters.

    We entered         the    premises        via the        front       door and turned                right    into the

    lounge       bar w hi c h was       very busy and             contained a large                 number       of people

                                                                                                              S 3G14A

wh ic h      included         the    regular       customers and Liverpool             football        supporters

The s up po r te rs were              in the mai n well            behaved a l t h ou g h several            were

rather         noisy but        nothing       unpleasant.            I believe     that    I o ve r he a rd the

landlord                        say that          several     of the supporters           had booked a table

at the         premises        for a meal         and that       this was a regular           occurrence

w he ne v er L iv erpool             were    playing at Sheffield.

             and myself were               enjoying a drink -amd we struck                 up a co nv er sa t i o n

             and my se lf were wea r in g              our w o r k i n g    clothes and     it w oul d        be

obvious         that we        had    been w o rk in g      on a building         site as we were             covered

in cement          dust an d         other    debris.         The y a sked us what         our    occupa ti on s

were and          it soon       became       a pp ar en t   that     they were also        e m p l oy e d    in the

building          industry.           The m en are d e s c r i be d as f ol lows:-

    I cannot      describe          them further         other     than they both spake with

Liverpool          accents.

One       of them stated             that    he was a                    and t he ■K he r be i nq


                                                                      ^107

We       con t i n u e d to         talk    to the 2 L i verpool s upporters a bout the                     building

At about 2 .30           pm     (1430)       I a sk ed the men           if it was about         time they were

leaving as           it was a         considerable          distance        between O u gh t ib r id g e and the

football          ground a nd         I w ou ld estimate           the distance       at about       two and a

               We    told the men            that    they w ou ld have          to    park     their   car   in the vicinity

               of thi^ Texaco F il l in g Station,                     near    to M i d d l e w o o d Hospital,        a.nd walk

               to / h e      ground from          there.        One of the men said words                 to tjne      effect

               1 ji -at they were           co nf ident       of getting       into the        ground beoause          the gate

               ^ouId      be open or opened.                   I am not       sure w h ic h word wa/f u s e d .          (Open or
c o ^ i e A C T opened).          1 he 2 men did not appear                   to me     to be    potential       trouble

               ma ke rs and           they a p p e a r e d    to be decent        people.        I didn't       hear    them say

               that     they had tick et s             for     the match,       nor did        I see a ny    tickets.

               The manner             in w h i c h one       of them said that           the    gate w ou ld     be open or

               o pe n ed did not            imply to me         that they were           going    to atte mp t        to force

               entry      into the          ground.

               The 2 men with w ho m we                  had    been speaking           left the       public    house    at

               about 2.4 0            pm   (1440)    and at      that time        the    public house was almost

               v a ca t ed       by all     the Liv er po ol      s up po rt er s     leaving only the           locals

                inside.          As    far as     1 can       recall    there was        no trouble at          the    premises.

             Further to my note of 27 April and our conversations today about
             outcome of the Heysel trial, you requested a note for the Home
             Secretary's weekend box.                            This sets out our understanding of the
             position and is based on information provided by the Embassy in
             Brussels.


             2,         Of the 24 Liverpool supporters dealt with today, 10 were
             acquitted .as the                case against them was not proven.                      Fourteen were
             convicte^ and given three year custodial sentences.                                         However, half
             of the sentence has been suspended for five years.                                      Ten of the
f cbuy>      fourteen convicted were in court, but were not arrested.                                        It
-~ * iruJL   appears that the public                        pfdsssufeor exercised         his    discretion net    to
             seek their immediate arrest.                            However, after the period for appeals
             has elapsed, the Belgian authorities can issue a notice requiring
             the convicted to serve their sentences.                                 We cannot predict whether
             the Belgians will adopt this course of action but having regard to
             all the circumstances, including time already spent in custody,
             they may not want to press the matter.


             3.        The 14 were also fined abdUfe                       £1,000    fiaoft    (60,000   Belgian
             francs) which has to be paid into the National Victims Fund, which
             we understand is not exclusively concerned with the Heysel
             tragedy.            Failure        to    pay could       attract    a further custodial sentence
             of three months.                   Heavy civil damages were also awarded against the

HEYSEL TRIAL OF LIVERPOOL FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS

1.   we spoke this morning about the judgements in the Heysel trial
which, as recorded.in my note of 21 March to Mr Storr, are to be
announced tomorrow* You mentioned that during his meeting with the
Home Secretary yesterday, M Eyskens (the Belgian Foreign Minister
designate) said that unsuccessful efforts had been made to postpone
the judgements for a week because of the proximity to the
Hillsborough memorial service, M Eyskens had also confirmed the
earlier indications that some of the supporters would probably be
acquitted and that, although others might be convicted and receive
custodial sentences, it was likely that these would be offset by
time already spent in custody. This would be a satisfactory
outcome so far as we are concerned.

2.    I mentioned that we were preparing some briefing for Press
Office. This is now attached * , It has been agreed with Press
Office and will be used by them in responding to any enquiries
which they receive after the judgements have been delivered
tomorrow. The PCO and our Embassy in Brussels are being sent a
copy.

3.   watever the outcome of the trial, there is considerable media
interest in the case. We can only hope that if the verdicts are as
expected, coverage will be sensitive having regard to Hillsborough,

4S   I understand that the Home Secretary will be out of the office
when the Belgian Court delivers the judgements. We shall, of
course, let you know the outcome as soon as we have heard from the
Embassy. The Court starts sitting at 8.45 am (7.45 olir time),

5#   in the meantime, I should be grateful if you. could let me know
as S66h as £6&6ibl6 i£ ther6 are any comments on the briefing*

PRESS BRIEFING FOR USE FOLLOWING BELGIAN COURT'S JUDGEMENT OH
FRIDAY 28 APRIL 1989


General
The process of law has taken its course*


If defendants are acquitted
1,   Q.    What are your views on the judgement?
     A.    This is a matte? £sif the Belgian edtitfc which has had ah
            opportunity to consider all the evidence,
     [If   pressed:   Hope the judgement will have reassured those who
     had   doubts about Belgium standards of justice.]


2=   Q.    Doesn't the judgement show that the Horne Secretary should
           not have agreed to extradition?
     A.    Not at all.   The cases were carefully considered by the
           Bov/ Street Magistrates* Court who concluded that there
           was a prima facie case to answer.     The casts were further
           reviewed by the High Court and the House of Lords, who
           decided that the Bov; Street Magistrate had been   right to
           issue warrants of committal. Against this background
           there was no basis for the Home Secretary to refuse their
           surrender and prevent the Belgian court to consider the
           cases.
     (If not already used:      The verdict bears out our view that
     fears about Belgian justice were unfounded.]


If defendants are given a suspended sentence or a sentence offset
by time already spent in custody
3.   Q.    What are your views on the judgement?
     A.    As answer to Q 1 .


If defendants are given a custodial sentence not suspended or
offset
4.   Q.    What are your views on the judgement?
     A*    This is a matter for the.Belgian Court, Belgian justice
           may be different from ours but that does notnecessarily
           mean it is worse.. Those convicted may now appeal to a
           higher court if they so wish.
 5.   Q.    Could they serve their sentences in the     UK?
       A,   This would depend on the results of any     appeals and on
             the timetable for Belgian ratification of the Council of
             Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons
             [expected to be around the end of 1989].


 6.   Q.    what will the OK Government do about those who have been
             convicted and have not returned today for the judgement?
       A.   we must wait and see if they do return,     We hope they
             will do so voluntarily as most did for the trial,    if
             not, it will, in the first instance, be for the Belgian
             authorities to consider what action they wish to take.


?■    Q*    But if the Belgian authorities did want; them to return
            and they refused?
      A,    We shall have to consider that eventuality further in
            consultation with the Belgian authorities.


HoQan_J_ex^gdition ordered but not surrendered)
8*    Q.    What will happen about Hogan who is currently serving a
            sentence in prison in the UK?
      A,    We shall be considering his case in consultation with the
            Belgian authorities in the light of today *s judgement.


Haynes (extradited but not t we understand , tried in his absence)
9*    Q.    What will happen to Haynes, who was in custody in the UK
            when the trial began but has since been released?
      A,    His position will heed to be considered in the light of
            the judgements and the views df tha Belgian authorities.

Defendants* Expenses
10.   Q.    Will the UK Government reimburse expenses of defendants?
      A.    The defendants have been represented free of charge by
            Belgian lawyers.    No funds are available to assist with
            expenses of trials overseas.

BACKGROUND NOTE


The Heysel Stadium £ g g t N l I   riot took piac§ on   29   May 1985 *
Hundreds were injured and 39 people died, mainly Italians,                Belgium
requested extradition of 26 Liverpool football supporters in
July 1986.      The Home Secretary put the matter to the courts and the
case went as far as the House of Lords, who said that extradition
could go ahead.      The Home Secretary considered representations on -
behalf of the accused, but decided that the extradition should
proceed.


2,       Twenty-five of the 26 were extradited on 9 September 1987 and
were ch a f ed with iftVdlunfe&ry manelaughfedi?'.   The one remaining
person (|        ) had already been sentenced to four years*
imprisonment and was not therefore available for extradition.               All
of those extradited were subsequently bailed by the Belgian courts,
because the defence lawyers successfully argued that they needed
more time to prepare their clients ' cases.


3.       The trial started on 17 October 1988 and 24^. of the 25
defendants appeared in court.        The 25th defendant£fras been remanded
in custody in the UK on charges of aggravated burglary and wounding
and the court was not prepared to grant him bail to attend the
trial in Belgium,      The proceedings in Brussels began in some
confusion with defence lawyers walking out after a good deal of
procedural wrangling,      The defendants were subsequently allowed to
return to the UK but most of them have returned to Ft.lgium as and
when required for cross-examination.        Hearing was completed on 20
March when the Court announced that judgements would be delivered
on Friday 28 'April.


4,            Iis due for release from prison in the UK in June.           The
Belgian authorities will need to consider whether they still want
us fcd   execute the surrender VAtst&nt   and w§ shall foe edftfiultiftf
about this after the other judgements have been delivered.
has not been tried in Belgium.        He was released from custody in the
UK in February and     it will be for the Belgian authorities to decide
whether they wish to proceed against       him.

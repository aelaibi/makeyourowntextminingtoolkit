                I am         a   Detective        Inspector         in   the      South         Yorkshire       Police      presently

                As       a   consequence          of    the    disaster         at       the    Hillsborough        Football      Ground

                oh       Saturday        15    April     1989       <150489)         1    was     deputed      to   take    charge   of

                Police           operations        at    the    Medico        Legal        Centre,        Watery     Street,

                Sheffield.               This     is    the    official         mortuary           arid    coroners    office     for     the

                Sheffield           area.

                My       duties     commenced           on    the   evening o f            the     i nc   ident and the f i r s t        task

                related to the receiving and accounting for 9 4 deceased persons.

                Working with the mortuary staff, my officers,                                              (one Detective Sergeant

                and. six Detective Constables)                           began to receive bodies at 10.05pm

                (2205)           that evening.               The deceased arrived in batches of three having

                been transported by ambulance from the temporary mortuary at the

                Ground.
On their arrival,               each body was stripped, ^weighed, weaittrtd Anti given                                                "f

an individual number.                       On each occasion the body was accompanied by a

police officer who                   identified it either to myself or to Detective

Constable 638 Weigold.                       All       clothing artd personal possessions were

documented ar>d detailed in the                           ’Other than F o u n d ’ property register.

Throughout ihe night the bodies were                                     received at the Medico Legal

Centre and the 94th victim arriving soon after 7am <0700)                                                           the next

morning Sunday 16 April                      1989       (160489).             The bodies were                put in shrouds

and placed in the mortuary duly numbered as stated previously.                                                                On

the completion of the                      removal       operation and reception at the Medico

Legal Centre,             some 20 bodies                remained unidentified.                           In each of these

cases    I received a Polaroid photograph of facial features of the

deceased.

Throughout the whole of that day Sunday 16 April                                                  1989 (160489) we

were inundated with friends and relatives of the deceased who

attended       at       the   mortuary           to    identify          or    view     the       victims          of t h e

disaster-.

During    the       course      of     the       day   ail     of    the-      unidentified              victims        were

identified          by    persons          who    attended          at    the    Cent re,,           Trie    procedure         in

each    case    was       for    individuals             to    examine          the     Polaroid            photographs

which    were       on    a   display        stand      and     identify             trie    deceased          in    that     way,,

Thereafter          a    formal       identification                took       place        by    individuals

physically          viewing          the    body.       In    every           case    the        identifications

proved    positive            arsd    no    problems          were       experienced              w i t hi t h e    method

adopted.

The ensuing days                involved myself and four other officers                                            dealing with

the friends and relatives attending at the mortuary to view bodies

and/or make enquiries about funeral arrangements.

Post mortem examinations of the 94 victims took                                                  place over a two day

period Sunday 16 and Monday                            17 April          1989 (16/170489).                     A team of

         five     Pathologists           lead by Professor Alan Usher were responsible for

         carrying out the autopsies.                   The results of those examinations are
                                                                                                                   4

               With reference to my previous statement dated 27th April,           1989,

               relating to the Hillsborough Disaster.

               Elaborating on the events as I saw them, in       the thetemporary

               mortuary which was set up in the gymnasium behind       the    North Stand

               within the confines of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground,              I

               would like to add that probably without exception nobody present had

               ever   encountered the situation that was to follow.          From the

               direction given by Chief Inspector Beal that the gymnasium was to be

               cleared to make provisions for a temporary mortuary and to receive an
m
               unknown number of deceased persons from the Leppings Lane end of the

               ground,   did everybody present - in my estimation - behave c o m m e nd ab ly .

               Faced with a completely unpredictable set of circumstances,              Police

               Officers including members of the Special Constabulary,           Doctors,

               members of Religious Orders - and many others who volunteered

               their expertise,    assistance and compassion,    conducted themselves

               admirably.

               Initially,   I recall   the body of a young boy being brought       into the

               mortuary and he was accompanied by a uniformed Police Officer I
LILLEY                   STEPHEN                                       PAGE


believe was from the Rotherham Division.         The body was carefully

carried and laid     (as all subsequent bodies were that I saw brought

into the gymnasium)    and positioned in the far left hand corner of

the designated area.      The same Police Officer who was obviously

totally overcome and crying,       clearly was simply showing his

emotions and deep sorrow.      I briefly related myself to this

situation,   being a father of 2 young daughters,      and I fully

appreciated and accepted the Officers reaction.         I remember seeing

him still very tearful and distressed a few hours later and in

spite of being approached by a senior Police Officer and advised

to both leave the confines of the gymnasium and go home,          he

declined to do so and remained with the young pitiful victim.

Within a short space of time, more and more bodies were received

having been brought to the temporary mortuary by all manner of

means and persons.     For a time,   the situation was naturally

confusing and in slight disarray because,        again not only were

totally unpredicted circumstances suddenly forced on those

present,   but   in a number of cases those present i.e. civilians,

supporters accompanying injured and deceased, who had never ever

witnessed or experienced such a distressing and distraught scene.

With other Police Officers, mainly those from Hammerton Road

CID,    I assisted in receiving and laying out bodies being brought

in,    these being lined 10 to a line with sufficient space around

each to be able to attend and view when it became necessary.

Though initially some bodies were being left in situe

unaccompanied,    I believe that it was Mr. M c k a y , CID Superintendent,

who called above a general     level of noise,    for Police Officers to

remain with any deceased they brought       into the gymnasium.

Some of those conveyed from the immediate location of the
LILLEY                     STEPHEN                                         PAGE


tragedy were obviously suffering from some sort of injuries and

whilst they were initially carried to the site of the temporary

mortuary,    they were then transferred to an area at the far end

of the gymnasium proper where they received immediate medical

attention from those persons available and capable to render it.

One person brought      in still alive but looking very pallor and

grey in his face,      and appeared to be seriously injured, was

laid on the gymnasium floor in a semiconcious position.           I went

to attend to him and comfort him and after about half an hour

or so,    the man who gave his details as

                , of                      Liverpool 9.    T/N

had sufficiently recovered to make his own way out of the building.

During the course of that same afternoon and evening through to the

early hours of Sunday,      16th April,   1989,   I assisted in receiving the

bodies of those victims of the disaster.          These bodies were laid in

rows of twelve from the back to the front of the gymnasium and I

recall some of them being covered by white paper clothes.

Subsequently,    body bags were made available by the South Yorkshire

Ambulance who were present in small numbers initially but increased

in manpower,    being commanded by Mr. Hopkins.

If possible,    the body identified and the property from it itemised

and logged,    though in the first place the property was bagged and

remained with the body.

All dealings and procedures concerning the dead bodies,          apart from

some early confusion which arose when they were first brought          into

the gymnasium, were carried out in as proficient and collected manner

as they could be in the given circumstances.

Later    in the evening,   a procedure was introduced whereby relatives of

the deceased - having first viewed polaroid photographs which had
/ LILLEY                 STEPHEN                                             PAGE


 been taken earlier of the dead by SOCO's and displayed on the board

 in a corridor outside the gymnasium - were shown and asked to

 identify a body which was presented to them on a wheeled stretcher

 and taken to an area away from the temporary mortuary which was

 partitioned off from other on-going activities.          Needless to say,

 there was overwhelming distress and heartbreak by both relatives and

 friends of the deceased,     and Police Officers and the like,        as this

 was in progress.     Certainly,    those affected were further comforted

 by police and social workers,       etc., who were also present.

 Once identified,    the bodies were taken through a rear door of the

 building to a waiting ambulance before being conveyed to the

 mortuary until eventually approximately 20 remained laid out on the

 gymnasium floor.

When both dead and injured persons were first brought             into the

 temporary mortuary area,     they were attended to by 4 or 5 doctors who

were present at the Ground and offered their professional assistance

 in the best way they c o u l d .   They were able to pronounce death in

 some cases but at the same time, provide artificial respiration to

 others as did all sorts of unknown people.

 The efforts put into the running of the temporary mortuary in the

 gymnasium by whoever,    adapted themselves quickly and professionally,

 I thought were tremendous and they conducted themselves accordingly

 giving the consulation and consideration to those who needed it.

 I went off duty at 5.0 am on Sunday,       16th April,   1989,   and returned

at 8.20am that same date.

    DATED:   130690                                                           (SIGNED)



              Further to my previous statement regarding the events at Hillsborough

             on the 15th April,       1989.

              I have been asked to describe in more detail my observations and

             duties in the temporary mortuary in the gymnasium.

             As I have stated the first time I became aware that there had been a

             problem in the ground was at about 3.10pm when Chief Inspector Beal

              came into the gym and told us to clear all the tables away as the area

             was to be used as a m o r t u a r y .   The only other times I can r e c a l 1 with

              any accuracy are 8 . 30pm that night when I had a ten minute break and

             went outside and 5.30am the following morning when I went off d u t y .

             Almost immediately after the instruction had been given by Mr.                Beal
                                                                                                   a.
             bodies began a r r i v i n g .   They were being carried by police officers

              and civilians a l i k e , some being carried bodily,      others on stretchers

             and others on noticeboards which had been converted.

              Initially the scene was one of great confusion with people bringing

              in bodies who were obviously dead and wanting to leave them and get

              back as quickly as possible to help those who were still            in the crowd

             and i nj ur ed .
MCSLOY                  KEITH     TAYLOR                               PAGE


It was quickly realised that it would be necessary to prove

continuity in relation to the bodies and to this end I went to each

group who brought in a body and instructed        that at least one officer

must remain with the body.        It struck me as odd   at the time that

there were not a great number of relatives or friends with the bodies

that were being brought    in.

The relatives that were with the bodies were obviously deeply

distressed and wherever possible were given every assistance by the

police officers present.        They were initially allowed to remain with

the deceased.    I do however recall two instances where people became

so upset that they ^ e r e sjkouting and becoming a danger to the people
                    I ■
there.   There wa,#^n(K-ad'ternative but to forcibly remove them from the

area until   they calmed down.      In both cases the people calmed down

apologised for their understandable reactions and thanked us for

understanding.

As I was going to each body that arrived I        soon became aware that at

the rate the bodies were arriving it would        soon be impossible to

accommodate any more.     I expressed my fears to Det.     Superintendent

McKay and we decided that the bodies should be arranged in rows of 12.

There were a number of doctors who seemed to arrive with the

casualties and they were quickly establishing whether a casualty was

dead or otherwise.    There were eventually I believe five doctors,

some of who m had attended the match as spectators and after the first

check for obvious signs of life they went through all the bodies            in

the mortuary and formally certified life extinct.

As soon as possible a supply of Gen 18, Sudden Death Reports,         was

obtained and these were handed to the officers who were accompanying

the bodies with instructions that they should be completed as fully

as possible.
MCSLOY                  KEITH   TAYLOR                                  PAGE


At first as bodies arrived there was naturally some considerable

noise as people were asking directions,       expressing anger and other

emotions.    The scene was one of confusion with police officers openly

crying,    some younger officers so stunned by what they saw they could

not even express their emotion.      Det.   Superintendent McKay quickly

took command of the situation and directed members of the CID, many

dressed in casual clothing to carry out tasks which quickly brought

some form of order to the situation.

At a very early stage it was realised that the scene inside the gym,

in particular the area where the dead were being dealt with, was one

that only those whom it was necessary to expose to should see it and

a control was put on the door.     With the exception of the relatively

few relatives who initially came in the only other persons allowed in

that area were members of the emergency services, many of the police

officers as I have described were casually dressed,         as they had been

for other duties earlier in the day.

Another operation that had to be carried out in relation to the dead

was to search the bodies and list and secure any property that may be

in their possession.    This task was undertaken in most cases by the

CID officers.    It should be said that many officers who were

accompanying the bodies were suffering,      some openly,    some inwardly and

for this reason the CID officers were used.                                    ,

The bodies as I have said were laid in rows of twelve with sufficient

space and room around them for the tasks to be carried out without                 ,

any liklihood of post mortem injury being caused.        In the first

instance bodies were covered with white paper tablecloths and a

little later a number of body bags were supplied by the ambulance

service.    There were a limited number of these and they were       later

reused as they became available after some bodies were removed to the
MCSLOY                  KEITH   TAYLOR                                   PAGE


Medico Legal Centre.     Where body bags could not be supplied then

blankets were used to cover the bodies.

D e t . Chief Superintendent Addis arrived at the scene later that

afternoon and took command of the question of identification of the

bodies.     It should be said that soon after the bodies had arrived

there was obviously friends and parents arriving at the gym.          They

were directed to the rear of the North Stand and I understand from

there taken by coach to Hammerton Road Police Station.

By what I would estimate to be around tea time of that day all the

bodies had been searched etc. and we were left with the task of

identification.    Mr. Addis briefed all the officers who were to be

Involved in the task,    in the main still     the CID officers.   He briefed

them fully and clearly explaining that the process which had been

agreed between himself and Mr.     Popper,    the Coroner, was that polaroid

photographs would be taken of the head and shoulders of the

deceased.    These would be displayed on screens in a passageway which

ran alongside the gym coming out in the gym at the other end of the

building.    Screens were sent for and a viewing area was constructed

which allowed relatives the privacy required for the identification

and kept from them the scene in the mortuary.
                                                                         t ■
Once the identification had been carried out then the officer

accompanying the body,    together with a CID officer from other

divisions and supportive workers such as social workers and

churchmen,   took down what details were required.

The gym became sectioned into three.         One end holding the dead,    the

middle section holding the officers who had brought        in the bodies and

the other end holding the relatives after the identification.

Once an identification by photograph had been made the photograph

bearing the body number was brought through to me and a team of
MCSLOY                      KEITH     TAYLOR                                PAGE


officers working under me.            The body was checked against the

photograph,     cleaned and made presentable before being wheeled on a

trolley into the identification area.            Once identified the body was

then tallen to an outer door where it was transported to the Medico

Legal Centre by a m b u l a n c e .

The officers who were carrying out this harrowing task were without

exception well seasoned officers with considerable e x p e r i e n c e .      They

acted with total      reverence and respect for both the dead and the

relatives who attended for identification.

I have twenty one years service in the police force and have had to

deal with death in many forms during this time.            I cannot recall an

incident which could be compared to what took place on that day and

the problems that we as an organisation were presented with.              We had

people dead with friends and relatives already there wanting to know

what had happened and if their worst fears had been realised.                 In the

months that have passed since that date I have thought on many

occasions of what was done and how it was d o n e .        In the cold light of

day and with the advantage of h i n d s i g h t , I can think of perhaps one

or two things that could have been improved in relation to the

handling and disposal of relatives and the deceased.             These would

only have assisted in the administration side of the incident and I

can say that I was there in that gymnasium possibly longer             than

anyone e l s e .   I saw nothing which I could describe as ir re v e r e n c e ,

coldheartedness or disrespectful and had this been the case I would

have taken steps to ensure that this was corrected.

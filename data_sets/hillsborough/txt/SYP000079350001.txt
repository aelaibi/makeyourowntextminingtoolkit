fans    in W a d s 1 ey            Ln     drinking             from          cans    but       I did     not     witness            any

drunkenness              or     disorder            at       any        of    the     pubs.

Having       finished              work       at    1.15pm              1315       I returned           home then             set    off          on

foot    down        to       the       ground       to       try        and    buy a        ticket.            Iw a s    aware       that          it

was    an    all        ticket          match       but        it       has    been       my     experience             at big       games

to    sell     tickets.                 I purchased                 a   ticket         for       the    Semi     Final         the       year

before        in    the       same        way,      off        a man          I came        across       at    t he      bottom          of       my

road,

I walked           down       to       the    ground           and      started           to     walk    around          the    ground,

Park    Side        Rd,       Middlewood                Rd ,    Leppings             Ln     and    Penistone             Rd    North.

I    recall        on    my     first         trip       about          the        ground        three       Liverpool          supporters

It    was    my     impression                from       conversation                  I heard          that     they         were       going          t(

             I saw       were       well       behaved          and       I witnessed                      no    consumption                of       alcohol             in

             the    vicinity             of    the    ground.

             I    recall       as       I neared          the       Penistone                Rd       North          entrances             to    the          South

             with       people          and    I heard          a    number             of       people          politely             asking          for          tickets.

             I itad c o m p l e t e d          nearly          two       circuits                of    the       ground          when       I saw             a    smartly

             dressed          mart e v i d e n t l y       selling             a       ticket          to       a Liverpool                f an .         This          man

             was    stood          outside          Olivers          Butchers                on       the       Penistone             Rd    North.                 He    was

             a    white       m a l e 7 aged         60    yrs,          5'6-5*7,                slight          build,          I think             he       wore

             a    trilby       or       some    kind       of       hat.           I    could          only          say    he       was    smartly                dressed.

             I witnessed                him    selling          a    ticket             to       a Liverpool                fan       and       approached                him

             myself.           He       was    probably             the       fourth             fan       I had       approached.                    1 asked             if

             he    had     two      tickets          as    it       was       originally                   my    intention             to       buy       a       ticket

             for    a    friends.             The    man       said       he       could          only          give       me    one       as    it       was       his

             approached             the       solid       mass       I headed                to       the       left       of    the       crowd          knowing

             where       my    entrance             gate       was       being          familiar                with       the       ground.

             I did       think          there       was    an       evident             lack          of    control             at    the       entrances                and

noticed                  a    number              of       seats              nearby              that           were            empty            and    c^Mnented                 to    a

                     Prior         to       the       game          starting           I saw        a       few       people             climbing                from       the

                     terracing               into          the          West     Stand       seating.                  I recalled                   that          happening                the

                     year      before             and          the       Police        catching                 on    rapidly.                 This          time          there       did

                     not     appear           to       be       a       response.                           \

                     speak         to    the          Liverpool                 Goalkeeper,                 he       was    moved             off       by       Police          and       then

                     shortly            after          a       senior           police       officer                 ran    on       and       the          game       was       stopped.

                     There         was       what          1 can          only      describe                as       chaos       in          the    Leppings                Ln       end    of

                     the     ground           and          I initially                 interpretted                    the       matter             as       a    public             order
 m                   problem.

                     I witnessed                  later             people        coming        out             obviously                struggling                   to    breathe.

                     I saw         a man          being             escorted           along        the          track          by       a    person             in    uniform.

                     The     mans        arm          was       like        a    dog    leg     -       evidently                broken.

                     I remember               specifically                       about       3.10pm              1510       two          Liverpool                fans          going       to

                     the     Nottingham                    Forest           end.        One     fan             was    evidently                   drunk          as       he

                     staggered               to       the       end.            They    remonstrated                       at    the         Nottingham                    Forest          fans

                       I went      to      the     Semi       Final    between Liverpool                       and Nottin gha m            Forest       at

      d\   pitch.        I saw       one m i d d l e     aged man            going    to a P o l i c e          cordon     t h at    w as

           spread across             the    pitch and            started       pleading           with      them.        This    m a n was

           obviously       distraught             and    tried         on a n u m b e r      of    occasions           to d r a w    the

           Police    Officers          attention            to    his      pleading        with        them.       This    man was

           being    pushed away             by    the P o l i c e       aAd    he    got     even more           upset     and was

            ventually          thrown       to    the    ground. \            fol yAd l/-

           I could       not    identify any             of      the    officers        but       it    involved         three      of     the

           officers       in the        c o rdon.        The      t im e     been    shown        on the         compilation         video

           was    1538    hours       (1538)         when     the      cordon was           put a c r o s s      the     pitch

           following       a    crowd       r u sh    towards          the    Spion Hop           end

           My main       concern        is t h a t      the P o l i c e       should       have        realised        th e m a n    needed

           assistance          and    not    to      treat       people       with    such        hostility.

           They    seem    to    be m o r e       concerned with               crowd        co n t r o l    than    their       role       of
      <y
           helping       the    general          public.

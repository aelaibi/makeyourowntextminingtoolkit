           HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY - PART II
           MEETING AT HONE OFFICE (ROOM 662) QUEEN ANNE'S GATS
           MONDAY 11 SEPTEMBER 12.15pm
           AIDE-MEMOIRE ON POINTS FOR DISCUSSION ON STRUCTURE OF PART II


           Many thanks for arranging at such short notice to come to London
           on 11 September to discuss with Sir Peter and Brian the timetable
           and scope for Part II.

           We are aiming   to start here about 12.15 and finish by          4,30,
           Buffet lunch here.

           I attach, as promised, an aide-memoire on points for discussion
           on the structure of Part I I . This is intended as a summary of
           the issues to   be covered inPart II rather than as an agenda for
           our meeting, so that we can plan our strategy.    Sir Peter
           suggests that we concentrate on items 2 to 5 to decide who will
           be able to visit what;   form a view on which groups under item 6
           we might want to see, and look at the options for dealing with
           the Green Guide (item 7 ) and whether anything under item 8 need
           be followed up.   Items 9 to 14 are really summaries of the issues
           to be tackled in due course.

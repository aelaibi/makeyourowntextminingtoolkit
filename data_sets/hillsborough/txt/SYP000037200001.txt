 2-5th July 1989

Dear Sir

We act for the parents of John McBrien who received fatal injuries at the
Hillsborough Stadium on the 15th April 1989.

Our clients are particulary anxious to try and retrieve their late son’s
ticket for the game which they understand was in his possession when he was
in the gymnasium but which was later moved possibly to assist in Police
investigations.

 Is it possible to locate the ticket at this stage and if so might we please
 have it so that we may pass it our clients.

Yours efforts in assisting Mr and Mrs McBrien in their request would be
greatly appreciated.

We look forward to hearing from you.

INFO      »    I WAS AT THE GROUND AT APPROX 1445 HRS AND THERE WAS A HUGE
             CRUSH OUTSIDE THE    GROUND IN LEPPINGS LANE AND THERE WERE NO
             POLICE OFFICERS THERE TO CONTROL THE CROWDS ONCE THROUGH THE
             TURNSTYLES THERE WAS ONE WPC AND SHE WAS JUST CRUSHED    AGAINST
             THE WALL AND SHE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING. IT WAS ALL JUST OUT OF
             CONTROL. OUTSIDE THE GROUND IT WAS SO BADLY ORGANISED.

 AT THE GAME WITH HIS BROTHER
             [CAN BE CONTACTED ON THE SAME ADDRESS]
  INSIDE THE GROUND BY THE CONCERTINA GATES THERE WERE ABOUT 8 POLICE
OFFICERS AND THEY WERE JUST STANDING THERE WE WERE ALL JUST SCREAMING AT THEM
TO GO AND HELP THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE BUT THEY DIDN'T APPEAR TO BE BOTHERED.
ONE THING THAT STRUCK ME IS THE LACK OF SUPERVISION AND ORGANISATION OUTSIDE
THE GROUNDS BECAUSE THAT WHERE IT ALL SEEMED TO HAVE STARTED.

PRESSURE FROM BEHIND AND A RUSH OF PEOPLE WHICH FORCED ME FORWARD AND PINNED
ME AGAINST A WALL. THERE WAS NO HOLIGANISM. I SAW FANS CLIMBING OVER A SIDE
WALL INTO THE GROUND AND BEING HELPED BY THE POLICE. I THEN HEARD SOMEONE SAY
THEY ARE OPENING THE GATES AND CONSERTINA GATES TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT OF ME
WERE OPENED AND PEOPLE RUSHED IN RELIEVING THE PRESSURE. I MADE MY WAY INTO
THE NORTH STAND AND AT 3.04PM SAW THE TRAGEDY HAPPENING. THERE WAS NO
RESPONSE FROM THE POLICE EXCEPT FROM ONE WPC WHO WAS LITERALLY THROWING HER
   ,E COLLEGUES OUT THE WAY SO SHE COULD HELP. WHILST THE TRAGEDY WAS
hU 'PENING
    i      I WOULD SAY THAT OF ALL THE POLICE AT THE GROUND, ONLY 10% WERE
HELPING WITH THE INJURED. THE REST WERE WAITING AROUND.

TURNOFF THERE WERE NO SIGNS SEGRATING TRAFFIC INTO LIVERPOOL OR NOTTS FOREST
AND WE ENDED UP PARKING ROUND BEHIND THE SPION KOP, WE WALKED ROUND TO THE
TURNSTILES AT THE LEPINS LANE END AND ARRIVED AT ABOUT 1PM.
2, AT THE TURNSTILES WE WERE SEARCHED, IT WAS VERY THROUGH THE POLICE MAN
EVEN TOOK THE TOP OFF MY BALL POINT PEN TO MAKE SURE IT WAS A PEN, IN MY
OPINON HE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD TIME TO DO THAT AT 2.30 (NOT A CRITISM THE
SEARCH WAS FAIR ENOUGH) .ALSO BY THE TIME THE MATCH STARTED THERE WERE AN
AJgULL LOT OF PEOPLE SITTING 3 OR 4 DEEP IN THE AILSES OF THE NORTH STAND,
tSI y COULD NOT HAVE HAD TICKETS.
I ALSO NOTICED THAT PEOPLE WERE CLIMBING OUT OF THE PENS AT 20 TO 3 WHRE THE
TRAGETY HAPPENED.
BEFORE THEY KNEW THE POLICE WERE THROWING PEOPLE BACK INTO THE CROWD BUT ONCE
THEY RELISED THE ENORMITY OF THE PROBLEM THAT STOPPED.

CHECKED AGAIN .WE TOOK OUR STEATS AT 1505 AND WE SAW THE PLAYERS LEAVE THE
PITCH.WE SAW PEOPLE SPILLING ONTO THE PITCH WE THOUGHT AT THE TIME IT WAS
BECAUSE OF THE GREAT NUMBERS IN THE PEN.
WE COULD SEE PEOPLE BEING ESCORTED ACROSS THE PITCH ONE MAN IN PARTICULAR HAD
A A R Y BADLY BROKEN ARM.
wrtHEN SAW THE DEAD BODIES BEING CARRIED ACROSS THE PITCH.
THERE APPEARED TO BE A LACK OF LEADERSHIP AMONG THE POLICE BOTH INSIDE AND
OUTSIDE THE GROUND.THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THE CROWDS.
IT SEEMED THAT THE FANS THEMSELVES WERE ORGANISING THE RESCUE ATTEMPTS
I SAW A POLICEMAN HELPING SOME PEOPLE TO CLIMB A WALL OUTSIDE BY THE
TURNSTILES TO STOP THEM BEING CRUSHED.

THE POLICE WERE JUST STANDING ABOUT. WE WENT TO THE NORTH STAND. THERE WERE
NO STEWARDS TO TELL US WERE TO GO.THE POLICE DID NOT SEARCH US OR CHECK OUR
TICKETS.WE GOT TO OUT SEAT ABOUT 1502HRS THE GAME HAD STARTED. I SAW THAT
THERE WERE FANS ON THE PITCH I COULD SEE THAT THE WEST STAND WAS OVER
CROWDED.THE GAME WAS STOPPED.
WE COULD SEE PEOPLE BEING CARRIED OUT ON THE STRECHERS AND THE ADVERT BOARDS.
THE POLICE MADE A LINE IN FRONT OF THE NORTH STAND INSTEAD OF GOING TO HELP.
A SENIOR OFFICER CAME AND THEY STOOD ACROSS THE PITCH.
I COULD NOT SEE WHY THEY HAD STOOD IN FRONT OF US.THE FOREST FANS HAD STOPPED
SHOUTING BECAUSE THEY HAD SEEN THE BODIES.
T H THE ANNOUNCEMENTS WERE MADE TO US. WE LEFT THE GROUND ABOUT 1600 HRS.
I^AS AT LAST YEARS GAME THERE SEEMED TO BE LESS PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILE
AND WALKING TO THE GROUND. THERE WERE A LOT THIS YEAR WITHOUT TICKETS.
OUTSIDE THE GROUND THERE WAS ONLY ONE POLICE MAN ON A HORSE BY US.
THERE WAS NO ONE TO TELL US WHERE TO GO TO OUR SEATS.
I TRAVELLED DOWN WITH 14 IN THE MINI BUS AND 2 CARS.

AND PLENTY OF POLICE OFFICERS TO CHECK AND COLLECT TICKET. THIS YEAR NO
ORGANISATION AT ALL.
ALSO I HEARD THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE FEDERATION CHAIRMAN SAYING ON THE
LOCAL RADIO THAT THE CAUSE OF THE TRAGEDY WAS DUE TO THE DRUNKEN BEHAVIOUR OF
THE LIVERPOOL FANS. THIS IS NOT RIGHT I SAW NO EVIDENCE OF THIS.

NUMBER OF POLICE OFFICERS INSIDE . THEY WERE JUST STANDING AROUND DOING
NOTHING. A NUMBER OF FANS WENT OVER TO TELL THE OFFICERS ABOUT THE CRUSH

STANDS. WHILE IN THE NORTH STANDI COULD CLEARLY SEE IN THE WEST STAND. I SAW
PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER THE FENCE ON TO THE RUNNING TRACK COLLASPING ON TO THE
GROUND. THE POLICE WAS TELLING THE FANS TO GET BACK IN TO ,THE STAND.

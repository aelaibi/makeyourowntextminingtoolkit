all    left       there at       12.30     pm.        (1230)        I followed               s car w h i c h

near       the    ground       in a side        street       by the     park.      About     10 m i n u t e s

walking          distance       from the        ground.        We    parked     the vehicles          at about

J-.30 pm.          (1330)        During        the    journey       from                    to S h e f f i e l d   I saw

a few other             cars w h i c h    obviously          co n t a i n e d L i verpool    s upporters.              I

also       saw a much          larger     number       of    cars w h i c h    contained N o t t i n g h a m

supporters.              1 would       say about 6 or 7.                I did not see any              coaches

until       we got       by the ground.               I didn't       see an y signs         for    the    ground           nor

did    I receive any Po l i c e                directions        to the       ground.       I sim p l y f o l l o w e d

           s car.        Whilst     walking          through the        park    to the gr o u n d        I saw     two

Liv e r p o o l    s u p p o r t e r s sitt i n g     on a bench.           T h e y were    each d r i n k i n g       out

of/a       can of beer.           The y had one             can of beer        each but      I didn't         see any

o/her       cans.        In P e n i s t o n e Rd      I saw about          10 N o t t i n g h a m Forest

Supporters             who were     sitting          on a grass       verge,      they were all           drink i n g

from       cans of beer and they a p p e a r e d                 drunk.        The y were       chanting and

being       abusive       towards        passing       Liverpool        fans    but did not           provoke      any

We a r r i v e d at the L e p p i n g s        Ln entrance           at about       1.40 pm ( 1 3 4 0 ) there

were    quite a few s u p p o r t e r s         in the      ground a r e a and a small                trickle         of

suppo r t e r s were         passing      t h r o u g h the turnstiles,                                 did not at

this    stage      have a m at c h ticket            but as         he had heard that            there w o u l d be

numerous       tickets a v a i l a b l e       from touts           he had deci d e d to travel               w i t h us

a n d attempt        to get a ticket.                       himself         had tr a v e l l e d to     the

equiv a l e n t m a t c h     last year and said that                  last year        tickets were

readily available.

All    of us then went             on a walk a r o u n d the           ground together w i t h                        in

an atte m p t     to get         him a ticket and at the                   bottom-"''end of L e p p i n g s       Ln by

 he    coach we       found a ticket            t o u t , who       I wtiuld describe as about                 5" 6

tall,     he was about 24 y ears                gT age ^arnd was wear i n g a white                   shirt and

blue    jeans.        He had a s <za u                   n t.               pa i d him £25 for a West

Stand     (standing area)              w h i c h has a face          value     of £6.      We    checked this

ticket against             our    own and      it a p p e a r e d    genuine.

We then had a stroll                around      the area,           went    into a shop and           had     some

non-alcoholic             ref r e s h m e n t s and made      our way        back    towards      the    entrance

in L e p p i n g s Ln.        As we made        our way       up L e p p i n g s Ln we stop p e d and

chatted to a Senior Po l i c e                 Officer.         I believe         he was an       Inspector.

It was     just a f r i e n d l y       chat    but whilst we wer e               talking       I overheard a

radio mess a g e w h i c h said,            " T h e r e ’s trouble          at L e p pings Ln outs i d e           the

g r o und."     At this          point we      left the       officer        and w a l k e d    up towards

the    entrance,          this w ou l d have       been at a b o u t ,2 . 3 0        pm.   (1430)        W h e n we

a r r i v e d at the t u r n s t i l e are a        it was      packed w i t h s u p p o r t e r s and

there were        no a p p a r e n t    q u e u e s , it was        just a mass       of   people.          A ga i n we

s t o p p e d and spoke w ith a lone Police C o n s t a b l e and a sked him where                                    the

turnstiles        to the N o r t h S t a n d were           s i t u a t e d as                              had

a ticket       for   that        stand.     The Po l i c e Offi c e r          directed                     towards

the    turn s t i l e s    on the      left at the L e p p i n g s Ln            entrance       and

made    his way       in that       direction.          The     rest       of us then joined            the masi

of    people trying               to get       thro u g h the turnstiles.                  There were           no queues

at all and whe n we                 joined the mass                of    people we tried to stay together

as a group.               At this       stage        the    crowd was        d i s o r g a n i s e d and    it was

uncomfortable.                   However,       a small        number       of    people were          obviously

getting           through the         turnstiles.              The      only Po l i c e O f f i c e r s that         I saw

were        two    on h o rseback a nd they seemed                         to be he r di ng mo re and mo re

people        into the e n c l o s e d area.                 I believe           that    these two          o f f icers were

actually           from L i verpool            as    I heard one           of them say        in a scouse

accent,           "Come    on get y o u r s e l v e s        organised,           we do L i verpool           a nd E v e r t o n

matc h e s        every week,        we     never       have      this     problem."        (I believe            this

officer was a Sergeant.)
        y
At aroout 2.4 0             pm    (1440)       the    crowd was          getting        extremely       compact and as

Tore     and more a r r i v e d we kept                    getting       pushed forw a r d        on mass.           We kept

shouting at              the m o u n t e d Police O f f i c e r s           to    close    the gates          of the

entrance area so that                     the s u p p o r t e r s       inside this are a          could get

t hro u g h the          turnstiles.            This       done    they     could then have             r e - o p e n e d the

gates and           let a n o t h e r     lot thro u g h          in gradual        stages.        However,          the

officers           took    no notice           of us and          it was     obvious       that    the      sit u a t i o n

was     now beyond           their      control,           there     just weren't          enough o f f icers            there

and     those       that were         there se e m e d         p r e o c c u p i e d wit h keeping          supporters

off     the       road    in L e p p i n g s    Ln to keep a free                 traffic     flow.

P e o p l e at      the front         of the         crowd were            now having        extreme d i f f i c u l t y in

entering          the t u r n s t i l e s      and e v e n t u a l l y at about 2 .5 0            pm    (1450)       no-one

was able           to get t h r o u g h the t u r n s t i l e s .            It was at        this      time      that       I

c o nsidered          going      back     out       into L e p p i n g s Ln and          entering      the      ground

w hen    the       crowd had        cleared.           However,          it was     now    i m possible         to do so

as more and more                 supporters           joined the          back     of the     crowd.          At this

stage also            I saw people at the front                         of the     crowd by the            tur n s t i l e

wall     climbing          up onto        the tu r n s t i l e       ro/ff to a v o i d the        crush.          The

atmosphere           was     now very tense and                   frightening.            It was       obvious       that
                                                                                                                 PA G E         :
                                                                                                                 SI 052

 the    people at the back               of the      crowd were       unaware          that    those at          the

 front were            unable     to enter     the    t u r n s t i l e s and as       it was     now about            five

 to three         (1455)      the    people    in the       crowd,    and e sp e c i a l l y those           at the

 back,       were      anxious      in case they might miss                the start          of the g a m e .

 Pe o p l e at the        front were        shouting at        people       behind them to move                   back

 but    they took         no notice.

 S ome o n e     in the       crowd said,      "It's all       right       the    game's       been d e layed,"

 and at that            the    crush eased m o m e n t a r i l y     only to become more                   intense

 whe n someone           else said that            it hadn't     been delayed.                It was at this

 point       that a m o u n t e d Police Officer              shou t e d at       us to go        round      to the

 r ight of the turn s t i l e s            where a gate        had     been o p e n e d .        The officer

 shouted,         "Get    round this        side,     get    round     this side."             This im m e d i a t e l y

 eased the            pressure as       everyone made         their way          round to the right and

 by the        time     I went      through    I was able       to     walk t h r o u g h easily w i t h o u t

 any    pressure         from other        bodies.

,-Four of us w a lk e d          through this         gate    together       but we had           lost

             somewhere        outside      in the     crush.        Once    t h r o u g h the     gate and          into

 the    compound area            I found      that area to be quite                 empty and was able                 to

 stroll        up to the        toilets w h i c h are        situated       to    the    left of the             tunnel

 entrance.                    and    I in fact went          to the toilet and the others w a i t e d

 for us by the tunnel                 entrance.        At    this    stage       the    game     had not         kicked

 off and        I w o u l d say      it was about 2 . 5 6       pm.        (1456)                 an d     I returned

 to the tunnel            e n t rance and all         four    of us w a l k e d        thro u g h the       tunnel

 entrance w i t h another               group of supporters.               We were all able                 to    f r e e 1.y

 walk    thro u g h the         tunnel.       At   this     stage    I was       fol l o w i n g J ohn and

Ma r t i n     (deceased 77)         was    just     behind me.        Ha v i n g      got    thro u g h    the

 tunnel        we turned        right    into Pe n 3, as we did so                  I looked over my

 shoulder and saw                          about 3 persons           behind me.              I waited       for

               an d   let him get        in front      of me and       I began to follow                   him acr

 the    terrace.          As we made        our wa y acr o s s       the   terrace           it became more and.

        more        packed wit h bodies              until       we had to come to a stand                   still.     Martin

            (deceased 77)         was    in front          of me a n d to the           right about 4 ft a way from

        me.         I ’d lost sight           of the       others.        I looked up an d saw the two                   teams

        kick        off,    this was         greeted w ith a loud               roar    from the       crowd.        I watched

        the game           for what      I cons i d e r e d to be about 2 or 3 minutes                         during w h i c h

        time        it was     very     crowded an d u n c o m f o r t a b l e         on the     terrace      but    I could

        still        f reely breath and had                 limited movement.                However,        after 2 or 3

        minutes         of w a t c h i n g    the    game    there was s u d d e n l y a t r emendous                surge

        from the           rear.      I cannot        remember          if this    c o i ncided w ith any a c t i o n                 on

        the       pitch but the          last       thing    I saw was Steve S t a u n t o n             (Liverpool)

        tackling a Forest                player an d         conc e e d i n g    either      a corner        or a t hrow          in.

        The       surge was       so great          that    it    carried me f o r w a r d about 6 or                10 feet

        until        I found myself            pinned agai n s t          hundreds        of other      bodies.        I was

        totally         unable      to move a l t h o u g h        I was    still       standing.         I d o n ’t know

        what       h a p p e n e d to M a r t i n    because as         soon as the          crowd surged f o r w a r d               I

        lost       sight      of him and did not see him a g a i n .                       I found      it almost

        impossible            to breathe           and was       trying    to s t r e t c h myself        as high as          I

        could for w h a t e v e r            air    there was a v ailable.                Luckily      I had one arm              in

        front        of me     that was        protecting my              chest.        E v e r y o n e a r o u n d me was

        shout i n g and         screaming           for     help and some          people were          climbing over             the

        top of us to try to get                      out.        After about       ten m i n u t e s    in the       crush        I

        looked down            to try and           move my arm and work                 it free,       as   I did so        I saw

        a m a n ’s head w h i c h was               pushed       into     the    left     side    of my      chest. I could

        see his         face and        saw that          it had tur n e d a dark            blue almost        black

        colour,         his    eyes were           open and staring             blankly.         There was      no s ound or

        movement           from him,         unlike    e v e ryone      else a r o u n d me.          I presumed       that           he

        was       dead.

to the     side        of his      head      in the    crush.

I was     pinned        in the      crush for about 2 0 - 2 5 minu t e s                and by this         time       I

was    finding         it e x t r e m e l y dif f i c u l t   to breathe and felt               very dr o w s y and

was    going      to    pass     out.        It/was    then that       there was a second surge
                                        v.
forward.          I think a barrier              collapsed        in front         of us and         I found

m yself    pushed forw a r d on top of                  people and        people were           on top of me.

However,,      there       now a p p e a r e d to be a little more                  space at the           back and

b r eathing       in the       crush became           easier.

I looked up and              could see the            gate    in t_he^tferirneter fence,               it was

about     10 ft away from me and s l i g h t l y                  to my right.               I saw    people      being

pulled thro u g h this              gate     by Pol i c e O f f i c e r s a nd other           fans who      had got

out    of the stand.               I also     saw Police O f f i c e r s         dragging       people      over       the

top of the         fence and         others      d e s p e r a t e l y t rying     to   rip an o peni ng          in

the    fence.          Although      I was     quite      near   to the gate            it was       impossible

to move     towards          it.

At this     point         I fell     into a s e mi-cons c i ous           state and           I cannot      remember

how    I got      out of the         crush but         the    next   thing       that    I remember         is being

at the back            of the      terraces      and    I remember        helping a young              12 year         old

boy to the tunnel               area.        He was     very d i s t r e s s e d    but a p p e a r e d   not     to be

physi c a l l y    injured.          I c a n ’t really         remember what            he    looked      like.

When    I reached the tunnel                  I collapsed and was                carried outside            to the

compound area betw e e n the                  stand and the          turnstiles          by two Po l i c e

officers       w ho     laid me down on the ground                   to   recover.            I was    carried

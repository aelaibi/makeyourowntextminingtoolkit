Dear Mr Daines

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

I am writing further to your four letters o f 23 July to Chris Bone.

As requested, I can acknowledge receipt o f both the report on the disaster by David Phillips,
then Deputy Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall Constabulary, and of the copies of
correspondence to the Chief Constable.

With regard to the approach you have received from Ms Ann Adlington, I can confirm that
we are content for you to agree to any requests you receive for copies of statements from
those who made them. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has indicated in letters to interested parties
that documents can be made available in such circumstances.

Your offer o f assistance in considering the various video tapes, photographs and
documentation in your premises at Heeley is much appreciated, and we shall be in contact in
due course to discuss arrangements further.

Yours sincerely




Mike Ward

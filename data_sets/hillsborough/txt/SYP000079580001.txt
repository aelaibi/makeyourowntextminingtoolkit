                     last    10 years being          in the Police Dog Section.                       I have      e x p e r ie nc ed

ground.        F rom this      time   I was   engaged on mobile            patrol,    I o bs er ve d a

st e ad y flow of supporters making               their way       to the ground and apart

from an odd few drunken youths,                  the m a j o r i t y of    people were well

be ha ve d and       in good spirit.

At approxi/ffiately 1440 hours, the same date, we ware detailed by
            'jo
Insi^cjfc'or PHENIX to patrol the area along P ennistone Rd North, near to

the ground.

At this       time    it became quite apparent            from    radio messages        that a     large

build up of people were               forming    in the L ep pings Ln area and             it a p p e a r d

from    c on ve rs ation on the        radio,    a large     public       order   incident was

likely to occur.

We the re fo re a t t e n d e d at the junction of Penni st on e Rd and Leppings

Ln.     The    road into L ep pings Ln had been              closed to vehicles and the

w ho le area was a mass of             people moving       towards        the West S t a n d of the

ground.        Due    to the    density of the       crowd    it would have          been very

dif fi cu lt    to drive       the van along      the    road.

I obs er ve d the       people    in Leppings Ln and the vast m aj or it y were                  drunk

and    rowdy and the w hole m o o d had           changed     completely from high spirits

to a scene       of potential         disorder.

I c ontinued         patrol along Penni st on e Rd and            I had numerous        requests        for

the    'gates'       to be open,      due to the     large    build up of Late arrivals.

At aprok
    1-   imatly   1505 hours,
            ■ > _----------               same   date,    I was    instructed   to .
                                                                          .A . Q_^A enter        the

g ro un d and assist wit h Public Order                 on the    p i t ^ . / I e ntered the g round

a nd dealt w ith        public    order    in front      of the East Stand w h ic h         contained

the N o t t i n g h a m Forest Supporters.

When    the s ituation had calmed down               I was    instructed to go to the

leppii ysjjr Ln entrance         to the W es t ^ J ^ t a n d and assist with          public   order

in that area.

I was    later debriefed at the N i a ga ra Police Complex and                        returned     to

West Y o rk sh ire area.

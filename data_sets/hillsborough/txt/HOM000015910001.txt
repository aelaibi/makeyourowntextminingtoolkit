   CHARGES FOR POLICING FOOTBALL MATCHES IN LONDON


   This submission seeks Ministers'                  agreement to the revision of the
   charges for policing football matches in London.                          It suggests that
   DOE Ministers should be alerted to the changes, given the financial
   implications       for    football       clubs,     the    sensitivity       of   the    issue
  following the Hillsborough disaster, and the probable enactment of
  the Football Spectators Bill.


  Background
  2.       The   view       of     successive     governments          has    been   that,     in
  principle,      the       full    costs    of   each       officer    deployed      inside    a
   football ground should be charged for.                      In practice, however, the
  recovery of full costs is not always possible.                             Officers on duty
  outside the ground, for the purposes of crowd and traffic control,
  are regarded as performing proper police duties,                           and the cost is
  met from police funds.


  3.    Although        these      principles        seem    to   be    generally        observed
  throughout the country, the amount charged is at the discretion of
  the police authority, as laid down by the Police Act 1964.


  Metropolitan Police Arrangements
  4.    The present agreement for charging at London football matches,
  approved by Ministers, was reached between the Metropolitan Police
  and the London football clubs in 1984 and introduced at the start
E.R.
   of the             1984/85   season.    Under the arrangement,      the Metropolitan
   Police and each club agree on the number of officers to be deployed
   inside the ground at a "normal” match, and the increased number to
   be provided at "problem" matches.                 The charge is then calculated on
   the basis that each officer is employed for 3 hours at the standard
   rate, with an additional charge levied for overheads.                    No charge is
   made for travelling time,                or for the fact that many officers are
   employed on overtime.


   Review of the Present Arrangements
   5.          The Metropolitan Police have reviewed their charging policy,
   and concluded that the clubs are being undercharged.                         The primary
   causes of this undercharging are:


                        in practice, more officers are having to be deployed
                        inside the grounds than the agreements with clubs
                       stipulate;


          l i ,        in practice, officers are working more than the standard
                       3 hours inside the ground;


         i n      ,    travelling time, for which officers are paid, is not
                       included in the charge;


          VI,          officers at football matches are often employed on over­
                       time.


   6.          The Metropolitan Police have estimated that these factors lead
   to a shortfall in revenue of about £l.lm.                    This is almost exactly
   the sum charged to London clubs at the moment, so full recovery of
   costs would double the charges to clubs.


   New Charging Proposals
   7.          The Metropolitan Police propose that from the 1989/90 season,
   the         force     should    base   its   charges   for   policing   of    individual
   football matches on:
               a.      the actual number of officers deployed on duties inside
                       the ground (to be agreed in advance with club officials);
                       and
E.R.
           b.     an estimate of the actual number of hours required for
                  those duties (the estimate for each type of game to be
                  agreed    in    advance       with    club    officials), subject           to    a
                  minimum of 3 hours;


   In addition, but not to be introduced until the 1990/91 season:


           c.     the charge for each officer to be increased by a further
                  one hour in order to achieve at least partial recovery
                  of the cost of travelling time.


   8.      The changes in charges proposed for the 1989/90 season simply
   represent an adjustment to reflect changes in practice: they do not
   amend    the    practice       agreed    in    1984.        The proposal      to    include      a
   charge for travelling time from next year is, however, a departure
   from agreed practice,            since      a decision was taken in 1984 not to
   charge for travelling time.


   9.      The Metropolitan Police have rejected the notion of trying to
   charge clubs         for overtime.           Since it could be argued that,                 with
   drastic alterations to police rotas, it would be possible to police
  most football matches without any overtime being incurred, the Met.
   have concluded that it is not worth taking the clubs on on this
   issue.


   10.   Annex A gives details                 of the   actual charges         levied on each
   London club for the 1987/88 season and, for comparison, an estimate
   of    what     the      charges       would     have        been    under     the       proposed
   arrangements.         It will be seen that almost every club would suffer
   a substantial         increase       in charges,       ranging      from    15%    to   247%    in
   1989/90, and between 32% and 334% in 1990/91.


   11.   We     understand       that    the    football       clubs   are    aware    that very
   substantial      increases are in the pipeline.                     The Met.      argue, with
  some justice,         that the clubs suffering the largest increases are
  not being penalised,            but rather have been very favourably treated
   in the past.         For example, Millwall, whose fans have a particularly
  bad    reputation,       have    enjoyed far greater police presence                      in the
E.R.
   ground       than     they    have     paid for.       Increasing       the     charge
   substantially         willgive    them    an   added      incentive      to    improve the
   behaviour of their fans,             since the proposed contract will enable
   the police to scale down their presence,                     and hence charges,      if a
   club's crowd behaviour improves.


   Conclusion
   12.    The Metropolitan Police proposals are in line with government
   policy.      They will,      however, undoubtably create protests from the
   clubs, who may claim that the policing levels required to promote
   crowd safety - especially following the Hillsborough disaster - are
   being put out of their reach.             On the other hand, now that we have
   a clearer view of the true costs, the Home Office and the Met would
 ^^be    open   to     criticism    for    requiring      the    rate    and     taxpayer   to
 ^Fsubsidise the clubs in a way contrary to Government policy.


   13.    We have no reason to suppose that any club would really be
   unable to afford the new charges, but if it really appeared that a
   club was likely to be faced with bankruptcy, it might be necessary
   to ask the Met. not to charge the full cost.                       This would, however,
   be very much a last resort.


   14.    It    would    be     sensible     to clear           the    proposals     with the
   Department ofEnvironment before                the Met.      approach the clubs.         A
   draft letter for Lord Ferrers to send to the Minister for Sport is
   attached.


   15.   Ministers are invited to:


          a.    approve the proposals to increase Metropolitan Police
                charges for football matches;


         b.     write to the Minister for Sport seeking his agreement.

        METROPOLITAN POLICE CHARGES FOR FOOTBALL MATCHES

        You may be aware that the Metropolitan Police have been undertaking a
          review of the charges they levy for football matches.                             As a result of
          that review,        they have asked for Home Office approval for increased
        charges for policing London football matches.


        The        review     has   concluded   that   London    clubs     have           been            seriously
        undercharged for their policing, for four main reasons:


              i.      the Metropolitan Police often have to supply more
                      officers than are stipulated in the contract with each
                      club;


                ii. the clubs are charged on the basis that each officer does
                      3 hours' duty, whereas in practice they usually do
                      considerably more;


              -111. no charge is made for the travelling time of officers,
                      despite the fact that this is often considerable, and
                      they are paid for it;


                iv. officers' time is charged at standard rates (plus a


             H.O. EST. 112
                                                                                                          35688 9.85 XNW
     S 536
           charge for overheads), despite the fact that many of them
           police football matches on overtime.


The Metropolitan Police propose to remedy points i. and ii. in their
contracts    for the       1989/90       season,    and point     iii.     in the subsequent
season, thus phasing the increases.                 They do not propose to charge for
overtime,    since       the    clubs    may    claim   that    it would be possible          to
arrange police rostas to avoid it (though in practice, this would be
very difficult).


The new arrangements will lead to considerable increases in charges.
In 1989/90 the rises will range from 15% to 247%; and in 1990/91, by
between 32% and 334%.             The clubs suffering the highest increases will
^2    those which, like Millwall, have enjoyed but not paid for very high
p R i c e presence to control their troublesome fans.


The Met's proposals are in line with Government policy,                           agreed with
DOE    Ministers    in    1984,    to     recover    the   full    costs    of policing
inside football grounds.                The clubs know that considerable rises are
imminent, though I have no doubt that there will be protests when they
are    announced.        The     clubs    may   also    claim     that    the   Government    is
Pricing adequate policing out of clubs' pockets,                         at the same time as
they are urging improved safety in football grounds.


If there are genuine cases in which clubs are unable to                          meet the full
costs,    I shall ask the Commissioner to look at them sympathetically;
but    in general,       I fully support the Met's              attempts to recoup        full
costs.      I believe the Home Secretary and the Commissioner could be
exposed to well founded criticism if, now the charges were analysed,
it were known the rate and taxpayers were in effect subsidising the
clubs,    despite    the       Government's general policy on charging.                  Apart
from this and the public expenditure considerations, there is also a
strong     argument       for     encouraging       football      clubs    toimprove         the
behaviour of their fans.                This may be a good means of doing              it. The
contract allows the police to scale down their presence at matches,
and hence their charges, if fans' behaviour improves.


The Met. are anxious to get new contracts in place before the start of
the new season, so there is very little time.                     I should be grateful if
you could let me know whether you are content for me to tell the Met
to go ahead.

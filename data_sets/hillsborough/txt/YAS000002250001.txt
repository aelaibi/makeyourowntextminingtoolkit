Lawrence Yoxall states



1.   I am employed as a qualified ambulance man with SYMAS.



2.   My date of birth is 20th May 1952.



3.   I have been with SYMAS since 1976, and became a qualified
     ambulance man in 1977.



4.   I was off duty on Saturday 15th April and wanted to attend

     the Liverpool and Nottingham Forrest FA Cup semi-final at

     Hillsborough.          I attend football matches quite regularly

     and try to see Liverpool play fairly often because my             12

     year old son is a Liverpool supporter.        On this occasion my

     son was not going to accompany me to the match.



5.   I did not have a ticket for the match but I knew that some

     Liverpool fans were going to a pub in Barnsley for lunch and

     so my friend,                    and I went there to see if we

     could obtain any spare tickets.          We arrived at the pub at

     1130 and we bought two tickets for the Leppings Lane stand

     at        j/tojrdsi.



6.   We went   to Hillsborough,     parking   at Parsons   Cross   Estate

     which is about a mile from the ground and walking down to

     Leppings Lane from the North.      We arrived outside the ground

     at about 1440.
  Before approaching the turnstiles,     fans have to go through

  some large blue wrought iron gates.       As we walked through

  these gates a policeman closed one side of the gates and I

  turned and closed the other side behind me.



  There^wora largo crowds of people outside the turnstiles/^ aftd-

  I stood on a stanchion ^which^upports aAwall dividing

 - <rf^n*Wnir» turnstiles^in order see over the heads of the people

  in front of me.     I could see that it might be possible to

  walk around the crowd and get in through the far right hand

  turnstile/' I told        to follow me and we went around the

  back of the crowd,    passing to the extreme right where the

  crush was were not too bad.     As we approached the far right

  hand turnstile a concertina exit gate (gate C) which is to

  the right of the turnstiles was open and I walked straight

r? into the g r o u n d T h e doors were slammed shut behind me and

  my friend was unable to get in.      I do not know who opened

  that gate,   nor do I know who closed it.      I would estimate

  that about 100 other people walked in with me.      As a result

  of going into the ground that way my ticket was not checked

  and I still have my complete ticket.



  I was now in the area behind the Leppings Lane stand.      There

  were several people there but the crowds were not nearly as

  bad as they had been outside.      I waited there for about 5

  minutes   in an attempt   to meet up with                  and   I
               bought a programme whilst I waited. 7?^l                                                               ^

        10 .           did not appear and as it was approaching kick-off time

               I walked to the right of the Leppings Lane stand and took up

               a   spot on the corner of                            the ground                underneath   the    score

               board.           I did not go down the tunnel in the middle of the

               stand because I had been there on previous occasions and I

               knew it would be very crowded.                                   Whilst I was waiting in the

               yard there were not any crowds in the tunnel but I could see

               the crowd at the very front (i.e. at the ground end) of the

               tunnel, although I was not taking any particular notice.



        11.    A couple of. minutes after I had taken my position the game
I              kicked off' but like a lot of the people around me                                                I was

I              watching the crowd behind the goal and not the game.                                              People

               were already climbing the fence to get onto the field.



        12.    During          those    first         five minutes                  of     the game    I heard      two

               messages come over the PA system.                                           One was    for Liverpool
    #
               supporters to stop pushing in the Leppings Lane end of the

               ground and the other was                             for people to clear the playing

               area as people were already spilling onto the pitch.



        13.    At abetrt 150E a policeman ran onto the field and grabbed the

               referee.           The game was                  stopped and                 the players    left    the

               field.          By now there were quite a number of people on the

               field and I could see some people on the pitch trying to




                                                                     l# C
      resuscitate a youngster.                          People around me stood staring in
      silence. /                                    <        s        _     -   '     w     -   x

14 . I decided to try to get onto the pitch.                                          I could not move

      forwards and I realised I would have to leave the area where

      I was standing and try another entrance with the help of the

      police.



15.   As I came round the corner of the Leppings Lane stand near

      the entrance to the tunnel there were people lying on the

      ground.       A policeman and a supporter were resuscitating a

      man in his late 30's near the tunnel entrance.                                            As I bent

      down they asked if I could help.                                    I tried to resuscitate him

      but I realised it was too late.                                      He had no pulse and his

      eyes were dilated. Ate. wevo C                                                                   —

                o*Uh~~ (£ cw & J   L Z e L c J ju ~ < y 's s s *c ,

16.   Nearby a man of about 30 was lying on the ground and he was

      being turned on his side.                              I checked him but he too was

      dead.



17.   I went to another casualty.                                He was being attended to by

      people who seemed to know what they were doing.                                            They had

      him on his side and he was breathing.                                         As I looked around

      people     were      being      left           on       the         ground     with   their   faces

      already covered over.                      I went over to a man of about                         16

      whose face had been covered and a youth was standing near

      him in tears.           I asked if he knew him and he replied "no".

18 . Pg^new an ambulance had arrived outside C gate.                     I went down

      to the gate to speak to the crew.                          -not know who lahoy

                were a Sheffield crew of two merf 'with a front line

      ambulance.      Q      — -cr    -ewrew       was   already    resuscitating   a

      casualty in the gateway.          I spoke to IjtKXcjBifchor mriftw—mamfcier

      as he was loading casualties into the ambulance.                    I tried to

      impress upon him the seriousness of the situation inside the

      ground and I asked him if he knew how many ambulances were

      coming.   He told me that 20 ambulances would be coming.

                                                       IbaW^-e.. o-v \~Y*.iJror
19.   As the ambulance left I spoke to a police officer/'and I told

      him that we had to get casualties down to the gate ready for

      the ambulances and that the other supporters had to be kept

      out of the way.



20.   As I returned through C gate into the crowd a policeman and

      policewoman were attending a youngster Z' I asked how he was

      and they told me he was all right at present.                   I checked his

      pulse which was strong and I told them I would try to get

      him a stretcher when one became available.



21 . I helped a number of casualties down to C gate.                        Most of

      these   casualties    were     able   to      walk   but     complained   about

      chest pains.        I helped to carry one man with a group of

      other people^                            v
22.      We placed the casualties against the wall outside C gate.

         There is a plan attached to this statement.                              The casualties

         were placed in the area marked with a yellow line.                                             Other

         people also took casualties down to the same area.

         recognised Leading Ambulance man                              %    I informed              himof

         the        situation          and   I    helped    load   a       casualty          onto            his

         ambulance.                 This casualty was a man of about 40 with crush

         injuries            and      breathing    difficulties.            I    also         loaded             a

         youngster onto                             ambulance and I travelled in the

         back        of      this      ambulance     with    LA                     and          the         two

         casualties            to Northern General.            As we        left      the        scene           I

         could see that another ambulance had arrived.                                        We drove

         along the service road to Peni stone Road and from there to

         the Northern General                Hospital.       During the journey                      I was

         trying to keep an oxygen mask on the 40 year old patient.

         We arrived at the casualty area where the hospital seemed to

         be prepared for a large number of casualties.                              We lifted the

         patient with the help of a porter because the patient was

         struggling so much.                 We put him onto a heavy .duty trolley.
                                                                                         u k— l. »...                       ■.
                                                                                             A      l-w! <j^,»       ^~*1   y

         straight back to the ground, to the Leppings Lane end.



24.     When we arrived at the Leppings Lane end of the ground we

        loaded up two stretcher cases.                       Both were men of about 20

        who were fully conscious and had crush injuries.                                         We also
        loaded up two walking casualties.     One of these was holding

        his chest and both appeared to be suffering from shock.       A

        nurse also got into the ambulance.      We left LA           at

        the ground and went to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital where

        we arrived at the fracture entrance.       I explained to the

        doctor briefly what the apparent injuries were and he put

        the patients into categories.    We simply unloaded them and

        returned to the ground.



25.     We arrived back at the Leppings Lane end of the ground from

        the south and again pulled into the service road.     There was

        an ambulance present already full of sitting cases and there

        did not seem any further need for my assistance.        Leading

        Ambulance man         was in the area and he returned to the

        ambulance.   As there was   nothing   further   for me to do I

        started to look for my friend                   He did not seem

        to be in the area of the Leppings Lane entrance and so I

        returned to the car where he was waiting.       I had left the

        ground at 1625.

    Dear Mr Pyne

    Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 1989

    I refer to your letter of 1 September 1998 and to my acknowledgement dated 9 September.

    Municipal Mutual Insurance are content for Peter Metcalfs letters to be released, so is Mr
    Metcalf and so am I.

    In relation to the statements of police officers, I do see a difficulty. As indicated in my letter
    of 9 September, I have taken legal advice and my reply is based upon that advice.

    Immediately prior to the publication of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny report, the Chief
    Constable agreed to place in the House of Commons Library those statements of police
    officers which had been amended. That process was continuing when, on 26 June 1998,
    Ms Ann Adlington, solicitor to the Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG), initiated
    private prosecutions against two former police officers.

    The Director of Public Prosecutions is reviewing the case to determine whether she will
    take over the prosecutions. The advice of the Crown Prosecution Service is that the Chief
    Constable may wish to make no voluntary disclosure of material while that review is in
    progress.

   Accepting that advice, I have declined requests for material from:

    a)     various people representing the HFSG

    b)     solicitors representing each of the two former police officers

    c)     the Football Association

    d)     numerous requests from individuals.

A parallel case may be of interest.         When the Home Secretary announced the
establishment of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny, I suspended the release of material
from the South Yorkshire Police Hillsborough archive until I had asked Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith’s permission. He told me that he was content for me to continue to release material
so I did so. This is analogous to the present position.

When the DPP has made public her decision on the Hillsborough prosecutions, I will return
to the question of releasing the officers statements. I hope this reply will meet the
requirements of the Home Secretary. If it causes any difficulty, please do not hesitate to
contact me.

Yours sincerely




Ian Daines
Assistant Chief Constable

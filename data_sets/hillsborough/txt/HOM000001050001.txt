                I am      a Police           Officer             in   the     south       Yorkshire          Police          at     present

                stationed          at    Deepcar.

                During       the       last       four       years       I have       worked           all     football            matches        at

                Hillsborough             Football                Ground.

                My    duties       consist             of    working          in    the    video        room       in    company          with        Chief

                In    this       room     there         are       two    t.v.       monitors           which       are       covered       by     cameras

                which       are    strategically                      placed       around       t he    ground          to    cover       all     95

                turnstiles,              There          is       also    a    t.v.    monitor           which       can       be    operated           by a

                switch       which       will          operate          and    show       any    view        by    the       cameras       from        t he

                There       is    also       a    computer             which       shows    all        95    turnstiles             and    ca n       tell

                at    any    time       during          a    match       how       many    persons           have       passed       through           each

                turnstile          at     any      given          point.           Each    section           of    the       ground       f or    example

                people       in    that          area       of    the    ground.           These        figures          for       that    section            of

                the       ground       are       than       added       up    to    give    a    grand         total         at    the    en d.        The

                computer          scans          all    the       turnstiles          and       takes        approximately                two     and     a

Liverpool             and    Nottingham            Forest,              and    commenced                 my     duties           at

•10 a . m »      that       date.        At    about          12.45       p.m.          after          the      turnstiles                 were        open

I switched             all       video       recorders             on    to    record             a ll     the      fans         as    they        as

were       entering          the       ground       via       the       turnstiles.

During          the    afternoon             leading          up    to    kick-off                time        at    about         2.15        p.m.         1

noticed          that       the       crowd    appeared             to    be       slow          in a r r i v i n g         at    t he

turnstiles.                 I am       not    sure       of    the       si:se         of       the     crowd        b ut    believe              it    to

be    25,000          and    30,000.

At    2.40       p.m.       that       same    date       I checked                with          the      camera          which        covers

the    Penistona             Road       area       and    noticed             that          there        were        very        few       people

in    the       streets,          and    on    checking             the       computer,                 it w a s      showing              19,000

pl u s ,       and    when       each    area       of    the       ground             gets       near        to     capacity              the

totals          start       to    pulsate,          the       total       capacity                for        that     area        of       t he

ground          being       21,000,          which       told       me    that          nearly            all       the     Nottingham

supporters             were       in    the    ground          and       it    was          near         to     full        capacity.

I then          switched          to    the    camera          that       was          covering              the     Leppings               Lane end            y

of    t he      ground       and       noticed          that       there       was          a    large        gathering               of     fans          in

that       area.           I could       see       that       the       fans       were          spread            from     the       turnstile                 u,

entrance             right       back    into       Leppings             Lane,          fully           blocking            the       road.            I

would          estimate          that    there          would       be    between                3,000        and     5,000           fans.            I

made       a    check       of    the    computer             and       saw    that             t he    figures           fo r    the        West

Stand          were    pulsating             and    showing             near       to       capacity,               and     the       Leppings

Lane       figures          were       showing          in e x c e s s        of       7,000,            which would                  be    n e a r to

capacity             and    the       computer          would       be    at       a    point            r e a d y to       start

pulsatingThe                      figures          on    the       computer             start           to     pulsate           when        the

capacities             get       to    within       15/i of         the       total.               It     was       obvious            that

looking          at    the       crowd       from       outside          trying             to     g et       in    that     there           would

not    be       sufficient             room    for       all       to    be    accommodated.                         As     I looked              at

the        scene      I could          see    the       crowd       getting             larger            and       many     at        the        back

of    the       crowd       were       surging          forward           pushing               violently            towards               t he

turnstiles.               From          that       point        I could         also        see        Police         Officers              trying

to    get     the       crowd          into       some     sort       of    order          but       they     were         being         pushed

to    one     side       out       of    the       way.         I saw       several             missiles            being            thrown

towards        the       Police.              A    large        contingent             of       t he    fans        were        climbing

onto    the        backs       of       others        and       climbing          the       walls           over      t h e t o p of           the

turnstiles;              they          were       landing        onto       the       asbestos              roofs        on the i n s i d e

of    the     ground          and       jumping           onto    people          who       were        on    the        inside          of    the

ground        to    break          their          fall     as    they       landed.

On    the     South          Stand       of       this     area       I saw       a    mounted               Policeman               being

pushed        on    his       horse          dawn     towards          a    large          double         door        which           leads        into

the    r ear       of    the       West       Stand.

During        all       this       I    could        hear       several          officers              including

Superintendent                 Marshall,               requesting               further          assistance                in        that     area,

for    th e    double          doors          to     be    opened          in    order          to     let     fans        into        the

ground        to    save       a       major       incident           outside,             also        f or    t he      match         to     be

delayed        fo r      a    further             15 m i n u t e s .

At    this     point          I noticed              that       the    large          door       situated             on    the        South

side    of     Leppings                Lane       open,     and       there       was       a    surge         of     about           1,000        fans

run    into        the       ground.              Within        a minute          of       this        happening            I noticed

that    t he       large       doors          of     the    North          side       of    Leppings               Lane     open         and

again       about        1,000          fans       run     into       the       ground,              I could          tell           from     the

noises        on    the       radios          from        the    officers             in    that        area        that        the

Liverpool           fans       were          very      boisterous               and    excited            andappeared                    to be

heavily        intoxicated                   with      drink.

                 ferry       the    injured              to   hospital.

                 I    can    say    that        during          the    time       prior       to    the       major           incident            the    Police

                 personal          radios           were      working        very       well;       but       during           t he    day        there

                 appeared          to     be    some          distortion          and       some    messages              could        n ot       be    read

                 clearly.

                 I would          only     like          to    add    that    in m y         opinion,             th e    main        cause        of    this

»                major       incident           was       caused       by    the    Liverpool                fans        arriving           at     the       match

                 too     late      and     being          under       the    influence             of    drink           and     trying           to    enter

                 the     ground          without          tickets.           It    was       obvious          that        looking           as, t h e        crowd

                 outside          t he    ground          prior       to    kick-off          there          were        several            thousands             that

                 were       attempting              to    enter       without       tickets             at    a ll       cost     to        the    safety          of

                 other       Liverpool              supporters             inside       the    ground.

                 During       the        incident             I was    trying       to       concentrate                 on    messages            being

                  received         on     the       Police       radio       network?           but      did       n ot       listen         to    what       was

                 being       transmitted                 on    the    back    to    back        radio         system           owned         by    the       club/oi

                 as     I knew       Mr    Lock          would       deal    with       any     situation                that         had    developed.

                  I tried         several           times       to    pass    messages             about          t he    situation               a.t

                 Leppings          Lane        but       each    time       I tried          I was       blocking               transmission                 so    I

                  kept      off    the     radio.

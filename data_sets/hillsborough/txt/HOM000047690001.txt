I attach as promised the body files for Lee Nicol and Steven Robinson, o f which you told me
     Support Group had asked you for copies. Please return them via the Chief Constableâ€™s
driver next week.

I have kept the secondary files on Lee Nicol and Steven Robinson, which I take it you do not
need, to make it easier for the courier.

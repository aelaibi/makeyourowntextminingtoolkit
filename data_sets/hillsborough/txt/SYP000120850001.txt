            At    3    pm     <1500)       our    detail          began walking                 to    the       g r o u n d as      we    were       due

            to    be     on s t a n d b y in a c o a c h u n t i l h a lf time.                             However,           whilst        making

            our       way     to    the    ground       we       heard       over       the     r a d io    fo     trouble          at    the

            Leppings           Lane       end    of    the       ground          and    we     were     picked          up    by    a van       a nd

            taken        straight          to    the    ground.              We    waited        inside          the m a i n        gates       at     the

            si de      of     the    Kop    and were             then       given       an     order       to    go     onto       the    pitch.

            This       wa s    after       the    players          ha d      been       taken        off    the       field        I was     one       of

            upset        at    what       was    going       on at          the    Leppings           Lane       en d    and were

            obviously              annoyed       that       we    were       standing           looking          at     them       instead       of

            helping           at    the    Leppings          Lane          end,        I s a w a c o in of s o me d e s c r i p t i o n

                 After       about      five      minutes      a number          of     supporters        began       breaking          down

                 the    advertising            hoardings          in f r o n t     of    the    main    stand and          took     t h e m to

                 the    Leppings          Lane     end.       Together        with       other     officers         I asked        if     I

                 could       go    to   the    Leppings        Lane     end      to     offer    as i s t a n c e   which       I did.           I

                 assisted          in     carrying      a male       from     the       pitch who was          alive       at     this

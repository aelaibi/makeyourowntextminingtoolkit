Dear Mr Gale


You wrote to Mr Moynihan on 15 May 1989
enclosing one from Mr           about the
Hillsborough Stadium Disaster. Miss Bannister,
in her letter of 18 May 1989, mentioned that
your letter and your constituent's had been
forwarded to me as the Secretary to the
Inquiry.

I have shown the correspondence to Lord Justice
Taylbr who has noted it.

                                Yours sincerely

Dear

SAFETY AT FOOTBALL GROUNDS

Thank you very much indeed for your letter of the 27th April -
it was good to hear from you again.

I have read your proposals with interest and have taken the liberty
of copying these directly to Colin Moynihan for his information.
I know that he will find your suggestions of particular interest
at this time.

With my very best wishes.

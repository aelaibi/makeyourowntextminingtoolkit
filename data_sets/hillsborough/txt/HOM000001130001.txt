        On Saturday 15th April    1989 it was my intention to travel      to watch

        the football match at Hillsborough,      Sheffield.    I am a full time

        student at Leeds Polytechnic which is where I live at term time and I

        in fact travelled from Leeds on the Friday night        (14/4) back to my

        parents address as above.     I had purchased a ticket to see the match

        on the previous Friday (7/4)      from Anfield.   At about 1015 am on

        Saturday 15th April,    a friend of mine

                                                          came in his car to

        collect me from my parents house.       Also in the car was




                                                We all are Liverpool supporters

        and we set off at this time for Sheffield.        We travelled via

        Manchester and we approached Sheffield from the motorway.          As we came

        off the East Lancashire dual      carriageway our car broke down and this

        delayed us for about    1 hour.    We then drove straight into Sheffield

        following the signs for Hillsborough.       We w a s n ’t sure how far away

        from the ground we were but we saw a lot of people parking there cars

up -and walking so we parked in a side street, and started to walk.                   At

this time it was about        1425 pm.   We asked someone how far we were

from the ground and were told it was a good 15 minutes walk so we

speeded up and walked through a park and we could then see the ground

and we approached the ground at the leppings              lane end and by this

time    it was about   1445   pm.   As we came up towards      the gates   I saw

that there was still a         very large number of people waiting to get          into

the ground.     As   I approached this     crowd it started to get dense and

there was a bit of a push to get through the outer gates               into the

courtyard.     When I get into the courtyard area I could see there were

two police men on horses and I also saw 2 other               policemen standing

by the turnstiles.       The policemen on the horses were shouting at the

crowd to stop pushing.         I heard one of the policemen on the horse

shouting to the crowd to stop pushing,              that the match would be

delayed until everyone got          in and to try and push back as by this time

it was beginning to feel        tight for me and I was still only a few

yards    inside the courtyard from the first gates.             I would think that

it was about 1452 pm at this time.           We were all trying to keep

together at this time and the crowd was              in a good humour but we were                   ^

being jostled about a lot.           Very shortly after this      I became aware

the pressure of the crowd was easing and the crowd in front of me

veered to the right.          I started to follow it and by this time I was

still with I                        but I had been separated from my other

friends.     I realised that the big gates           in front of us had been

opened and the crowd was walking through.               As I walked through this                    '

gate there was no crushing at all but everyone was walking fairly

quickly.     I could see a tunnel        immediately in front of me which all

of the crowd seemed to be walking           into.     I did notice any police or

stewards at this       point directing the crowd but there was no crush and

I just walked into the tunnel          still with                       My other

friends were ahead of us somewhere.              As we were walking through the

tunnel                said to me,    "Dose this mean we dont need our

tickets," and I said "yes" and I then reached into my back pocket and

put my ticket away.        It, was   intact and the stubb had not been

removed.      I looked at my watch whilst walking through the tunnel            and

saw that     it was almost 3 o clock.          I could see the players on the

pitch and we reached the end of the tunnel,             there had been no pushing

through the tunnel       but as soon as       I reached the terraces   I moved to

the right and all of a sudden I became aware of being pushed from

behind.    Almost     immeidately I lost sight of my mate                     I do

not remember the game starting or any of the play,             I can remember

starting to be crushed right at the top of the terrace as I came in

but the next thing I can really remember was my elbows being jammed

into my ribs and my hands         by my face and being right by the very front

of the terrace.        I can't    remember any of the journey down the

terrace.      I was    aware of people in front of me and everyone crushed

all around me.I was still standing but               at an angle bent forward

from my waist.        I can't    remember anyone screaming talking around me.

I just knew I had to get one of my arms up and forced out of the

crowd some-how.         My memory is very hazy but I seem to remember being

aware that there was a gate          in the    fence in front of me, a policeman

standing by it and this          policeman grabbed my left arm which I had

managed to force up out of the crowd and he was             pulling at it and I

can remember saying,       I'm going but then I must have       passed out.

        All of the blood vessells       in my face and eyes had burst because of

        the pressure and n'iy face was very red and my eyes       compiletley red.       I

        had lost my red jumper and my anorak was torn to shreds.             A ring on

        my finger was     crushed onto my hand there were foot        prints accross the

        front of my tee shirt but       I do not recall   being walked on at all.        I



        Looking at the grid shown to me by the Police         I was    in pen 3 entering

        by reference 1H which is the       last part   I can remember being in until

        I was at the bottom and being pulled out.         On route to the match I

        consumed 2 cans of cider as did my other mates apart from


 *                 who was driving and had nothing to drink.

        I paid £6.00 for my ticket and it was for the standing area in the

        Leppings     lane stand.   There was still a very large crowd of people

        behind me as I went through the gates from the courtyard after they

        had been opened.

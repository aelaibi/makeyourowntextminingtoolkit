                             Hallamshire Hospital. The mean age was 19.6 years.
                                      Some    patients        were     unconscious        on     arrival,           some

                                   Unlike         other    hypoxic cerebral insults some                   patients

                             developed       a progressive worsening of signs long after                             the

                              initial trauma.         This late onset was very                 misleading.           One

                             young     man        initially     appeared to be           slightly      dazed         but

                             otherwise       conscious         suddenly      started to scream             an       hour

                              after admission.            The screaming lasted for several                    minutes

                              followed by status epilepticus and coma .                         This pattern was
                              observed       in     another     patient      1    hour     30    minutes        after
                              admission.      One      other patient became confused and lost his

                              vision     2   hours 30         minutes     after     admission.         Subsequent

                              examination confirmed the diagnosis as cortical blindness.
                                       14    of the patients had convulsions.                     These took the

                              form of status epilepticus and although the fits were

                              partly controlled by intravenous diazepam all of these
                              patients required intubation and ventilation. The patients

                              also received high doses of               dexamethasone soon after

                              arrival.                         ,                                 ,    a /),

      Two       patients     did not have fits but the     degree   of
agitation prompted early treatment and ventilation.
      Three       patients     were transferred from the   receiving

wards to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital . The sudden
deterioration described above raised the possibility of an
intra-cranial bleed and urgent CT (Computerised Tomography)

scans were requested. All of the CT scans were negative.
Four patients were transferred from the intensive care

units to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital for the same

reason.
      T^o patients developed cortical blindness.
      Over       the next few days the patients were treated        in

the intensive care units.

The Intensive Care Units.
          The Northern General Hospital has two intensive care

units, the General Intensive Care Unit and the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit. Fortunately there was

only one patient who could not be moved out of intensive
care. Thus the units were cleared to make way for the
influx of casualties.
          The    first     patient was received at 16.30     and    by

17.30 ten patients had been admitted to the General

Intensive Care Unit. Th^se patients were already intubated

and B«£q«k*ed ventilation. The General Intensive Care Unit
was then full and a further five patients were admitted to

the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit,the lastone arriving about

18.30. One further patient was admitted to the Cardiac


                                    9
    Intensive Care Unit with a pneumothorax and severe chest

    pain but he did not require ventilation.
            The    major   problem    was the     treatment        of    hypoxic

    cerebral damage caused by traumatic asphyxia. The treatment
     of the hypoxic cerebral damage          started in the Accident

    and Emergency department         and the receiving ward was

    continued. This consisted of ventilation to maintain                    good

    oxygenation and an arterial pCC>2 of between 3.5 and 4 kPa.

    Fluids were closely restricted and mannitol and frusemide
    were used if necessary. Each patient was given

^■lexamethasone in a dose of 1 mg/Kg. Fits were controlled

    with anticonvulsants.
|           Four    of the most seriously injured were transferred

\ to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital for CT scans to rule out

)   intracranial bleeding.
I           The     majority   of     the   patients      showed        signs   of

    inhalation      of     stomach     contents     and     were          treated

    aggressively with antibiotics. One patient developed a mild
    chest    infection.     No patient developed adult             respiratory

    distress syndrome.                 i    ?
            Five patients had pneumothoraces and one patient had

    a corneal abrasion. One patient became hypotensive with a

    rigid abdomen and had a laparotomy. This proved to be

    negative.
            This incident was a severe test of the ability of the

    intensive care units to cope with large numbers of patients
    arriving with a very short timespan. There was a rapid



                                       10
response from all intensive care staff. 25 anaesthetists
attended along with large numbers of intensive care nursing

staff and operating department assistants . Most of these

staff came into hospital on hearing of the incident through
the media. The large numbers of staff allowed each patient
to be attended to by one doctor and any patient requiring
transfer were accompanied by an anaesthetist and an

operating department assistant.

    The Royal Hallamshire Hospital has a 10 bedded General

Intensive Care Unit and a four bedded Neurosurgical High

Dependency Unit.
    At   the     time     of     the major incident    there   were     six

patients on the General Intensive Care Unit and three of

these were moved to the general ward. Their subsequent

progress was without mishap.
    Seven      patients        were admitted   from   the   Hillsborough

incident, six transferred from the Northern General
Hospital and one direct from the Royal Hallamshire Accident

and Emergency department. After CT scanning six were

admitted to the General Intensive Care Unit and one to the
Neurosurgical High Dependency Unit. All admissions occurred

between 17.30 and 21.30.

    The cerebral injuries            were treated in a similar manner

to those in intensive care           at the Northern General
Hospital. One patient required continuous thiopentone

infusion to control fitting.

    All patients showed signs of gastric dilatation                   which

was probably      due to mouth       to mouth resuscitation at the


                                      11
            stadium.       This     settled   over    24   hours    with    nasogastic

            intubation.
                    Surprisingly no patients had a bony injury but one did

            have a brachial plexus injury.                   /       <■              *   ,    a   \

            Theadmitting wards.
    r   P           At     the Northern General Hospital those patients with

             significant injuries on initial triage were taken to the

            designated major accident receiving ward which is adjacent

            to the Accident and Emergency department.               For the first 30
            minutes of the incident all experienced staff were required

            in the resuscitation rooms. A senior registrar briefly

            checked that each patient was conscious with no major

            respiratory or cardiovascular compromise.
                    As     the    situation in the Accident and Emergency

             department stabilised the emphasis changed to the accurate

            assessment of the patients on the ward.                The mechanism of

            injury was not clear in the initial stages of the
            assessment.      The patients histories suggested crush injury
            and for that reason repeated examinations were made to rule

            out visceral and limb injuries.
                       A   senior    member of staff was given charge of              each

            bay   of 6 patients and directed the efforts of other staff.
            The   most     urgent     of   the early problems        was    the     sudden

            neurological         deterioration in some patients.           A number      of
            patients required rapid sequence induction and ventilation.

            These      patients were then transferred to the intensive care

            units or to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital for CT scans.


                                                 12
         Many      patients had chest pain and pain on breathing.

Most of the chest x-rays were normal. One patient                   had an
arch aortogram since a widened mediastinum was seen on                   the

chest    x-ray. This was normal.
      There   was     anxiety    that some patients       might     develop

delayed respiratory complications but the anaesthetic staff

performed     ward     rounds using the combination          of     clinical

examination and pulse oximetry to monitor patient progress.

        Many patients had abdominal pain but a combination of
clinical      examination,      ultrasound      and    peritoneal     lavage

enabled the conservative management of these patients.

      The General, Orthopaedic and Cardiothoracic                 Surgeons and
Anaesthetic staff made repeated ward rounds                over the next 24
hours to ensure that no significant injuries were overlooked.

Many had severe bruising often involving the genitalia. This
appeared to be a result of being crushed against barriers.

Similar       bruising    involving       the   back   musculature       was

encountered.         One patient had severe pain from traction on
the     brachial     plexus.    He   had been trampled      while      lying

against a barrier.
          In the Royal Hallamshire Hospital the designated

 receiving ward was cleared by a senior surgeon and

physician who were in the hospital at the time of the

incident. 11 patients were complaining of abdominal pain

after having been        crushed against the barriers. Six

patients had minor neurological symptoms and the others had
significant soft tissue injuries with only one patient                           %

requiring operative treatment, reduction of a fracture of

the radius and ulna. There were two other fractures a
fractured ulna and a minor ankle fracture. These did not

require operative treatment.
       The    majority of the patients not requiring          intensive

care    were discharged home within 48 hours .         Four patients

from    the Northern General Hospital required         further

convalescence in hospital and they were transferred to

hospitals nearer to their homes.

X-Ray.
         The     x-ray   department of the Northern General

Hospital faced very heavy demands during the early stages

of the incident. Well over 200 examinations were performed

in the first six hours. Five rooms were used as well as
mobile apparatus in the Accident and Emergency department,

on the wards and in the Intensive Care Units. As the films

emerged from the processor they were            inspected by two

 radiologists and hand written reports attached to each

         Ultrasound       was   used   in the   evaluation     of   some

 abdominal injuries.
          There werefew abnormal findings. Only four           patients

 had     visible     rib fractures.     7 patients   showed      changes

 compatible      with aspiration into the lungs.       There was     one

 skull fracture. There were no long bone fractures.
             At the Royal Hallamshire Hospital 97 investigations

 were performed on the day of the incident. Apart from two

 forearm fractures and one minor ankle fracture there were

 that the neurological problems might be due to
intracranial bleeding. All the initial scans were within

normal limits with serial scans showing slight brain
swelling which lasted for up to five days.

•Mae Relatives.

        The nature of the tragedy and the proximity of the

football stadium to the hospital meant that very quickly large
numbers of people arrived seeking information about their

friends and relatives. The hospital staff canteen was used to

accommodate these people and soon a crowd of 250 to 300 people
had gathered , all desperate for information.          In the early
stages there were real problems in identification of the

victims. The dead and unconscious were on three sites, most of

the injured arrived in hospital wearing only t- shirts,jeans

and gym shoes. A senior manager took charge of this situation

and as information became available he had the onerous task of

trying to distribute this to the crowd. Large numbers of
nursing staff, chaplains and social workers also helped in

this task. Many of the relatives had to be transported back to

the stadium to identify the dead.

        There     were a huge number of telephone enquiries         to
both   hospitals     during the first few hours.   A    number      of

staff were needed to cope with the volume of these calls.
The press.
             The     event attracted large numbers of the press               and

by     and     large they acted with great            responsibility.        They

were         given     facilities      and     information   as    it      became
available. Once the clinical situations were under control the

some patients consented to be interviewed and the appropriate

arrangements were made.

Summary.

             Table 1 shows the numbers of patients injured and
killed. Three patients with minor injuries were taken to

Barnsley District General Hospital for treatment.
         The       major    injury was traumatic asphyxia           leading     a

hypoxic cerebral insult.

       Two     of the      ventilated patients had been           resuscitated
from     cardiac arrest.        One died shortly after admission and
the      other       was    declared    brain     dead   some     days      after
admission.

         We are beginning a more detailed study of the results

of severe traumatic asphyxia                  and the longer term outcome. The

early results in these patients are as follows: ten

patients       made excellent early recoveries and two                   patients
good recoveries. One month after the incident three

patients had significant neurological deficit and three

patients had severe neurological damage.

        There were 5 patients with pneumothoraces.
        Three patients had brachial plexus injuries, one with

a     severe       deficit.   There were number of other            peripheral



                                         16
 nerve     neuropraxias            including      the    femoral   nerve,lateral

 cutaneous nerve of thigh and the median nerve.
          There       were     a    large    number of      soft   tissue       crush

  injuries of varying severity. There were three long bone

  fractures,          two forearm fractures and one minor ankle

  fracture.
          Formal injury scoring was not carried out since there

,^is no Abbreviated Injury Score for traumatic asphyxia.

  Thr problems and lessons-.
           This incident is the subject of a Public Enquiry and
  many of the major lessons of this disaster will be examined

  in great detail by this Enquiry.                   We would not like to pre­
  empt this process but there are a number of other important

  points need discussion.
           As          in     almost        every       other   major        incident

  communications were a major problem.
           There        was    a delay       in     recognising the gravity           of

  the situation.            There was no definite beginning             such as        a
  plane     or    train       crash.     In such disasters         it   is     fairly

  obvious from the outset that there was a high likelihood of

  large numbers of injuries.
          The     first       real indication that something was                wrong

  at Hillsborough was of people spilling onto the pitch. Even
  at this point the severity of the event was not clear. Some

  doctors        in    other parts of the ground left at                this        point

  since     it appeared that the game had been abandoned due                           to
  crowd     trouble.          There    appeared       to be little use         of     the

  public address system.


                                             17
          There        was no clear notification of a major incident
to the hospitals due to the wrong words being used.

          At     one     of    the     hospitals staff had     no    time   to

organise for the reception of large numbers of injured.

    Fortunately because of                the media coverage of the event
large numbers of staff arrived with great speed by-passing the
call out system.

          The        first    doctors     on the scene had     virtually    no

equipment        to help with the resuscitation of             the    injured.

This led to great frustration and they could only apply basic

first aid to the critically injured. However they did try to
organise        transport priorities and confirm death.

      A large number of relatives and friends began to make
their way to the hospitals by car. This did cause some

problems of access for hospital staff and even those staff
in uniform had difficulty in by-passing the traffic.

          Large numbers of volunteer medical staff also
arrived         in    both    hospitals.       Their    help   was    greatly

appreciated.          However        they reported     to the patient triage
area inspite of there being a prearranged volunteer

reporting point. Directing these doctors to the areas where

they were needed was difficult. Many major incidents receive
early media coverage and will bring many volunteer medical

staff to the hospital. Many of these staff may not know of the
hospital and some thought should be given to setting up a

"medical volunteer post" in a very obvious position near the

entry point to the Accident and Emergency department.



                                         18
  The      incident         was       very      different       from    many      recent

disasters       in        the    nature      of     the     injuries.     Most     major

disasters       involve surgical problems.                      Most major accident

plans give the consultant physicians some role but most                                  of
the     detailed           instructions           are     for   the    surgical         and

anaesthetic          staff.       The main onus of the treatment of                     the

most     seriously          injured       in       this     incident      fell    to the
intensive           care    department            and     the   physicians.       Major

accident plans should include definite roles for the

consultant physician and his team in the acute care of the
victims.

          The       unusual nature of the injury was also a problem
in     the early management of the incident since many of                               the

staff had a "mental set" that                      the injured patients all had

"head     injuries".            It    took some time for senior                staff     to
explain       the     nature         of   the       problem.           Fortunately the

principles           of     treatment        were       appropriate       for          both

problems.

         As     mentioned large numbers of staff arrived to deal
with the acute dramatic incident.                       One important management

point is that definite plans should be made to arrange extra

staffing over the               next few days to those departments worst

affected. The anaesthetic department was highly organised in
this issue and once the clinical situation was under control

rotas were drawn up to utilise the large numbers of staff

volunteering. This process should be included in major

incident plans.

          In this incident one of the most difficult tasks was


                                             19
the    identification of patients and the            dead.   One    recent

innovation is      the use of polaroid photography.This did not
take place in the hospital but some thought should be given
of using this method in other mass casualty situations.

         It   would appear that some large stadia do not give

much   thought     to   the    provision   of   adequate       first     aid

facilities even for the routine care of illness or accident

occurring     in the large numbers of people paying to use

the facility. Some large football grounds do employ health
care professionals to provide cover for large events (1)

but this is costly. Many years ago it was reported that the
provision of advanced life support equipment and trained

personnel could save lives at a football stadium by
providing prompt treatment to those spectators suffering

cardiac arrest in the crowd (2). How many stadia in this

country have addressed this issue and made such provisions?

         It    would    have   been     impossible     to    have    enough
equipment     on   the ground to cope with a          disaster      of   the

magnitude of Hillsborough. However if life support

equipment is provided and staff are trained to deal with
small scale emergencies         then there is much more chance

that the response to large incidents will be more

organised.
       The     best way of saving lives in a major accident is

to prevent it occurring. It is unfortunate but probably
inevitable that accidents will occur. Obviously thought,

resources     and even legislation will be required to reduce

the possibility of a repetition of this tragic incident.

doctors     closely      involved with the incident.          However    the

management       of    the injured and dead required the         work     of
hundreds     of people.       Doctors of all grades from all            over
the country,          local general practitioners, medical students

junior     doctors and consultants helped in the care              of     the

victims of this tradgedy.
     In     this task they were supported by an army of                 other
workers;     ambulance       personnel,    police,    firemen,     nurses,
porters, radiographers, managers, medical records personel,

clerks, physiotherapists, operating theatre assistants,

technicians , chaplains, social workers , psychologists and

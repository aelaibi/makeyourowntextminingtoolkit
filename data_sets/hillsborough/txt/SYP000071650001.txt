          walked       down' the         tunnel.        I had free access at                   this time.       I entered

          time had quite              free movement.



          I s tood         for about       ten m in u te s and by about                  2 . 4 0 pm    (1440)     the    centre

            was    quite tubby.        I remember        he was      thinning         on top.           The man was

            s t a nding    to my left and next to him was                  his    friend.           His      friend was

looked dazed.                I went       up to them and they told me they were                               looking

for    one of their               friends.        I then sat down an d                    buried my head          in my

arms.        L o ok i ng     up I saw       people          being    covered over with blankets and

then     being        placed       in ambu la nc es .          I was       still         in a state of shock             but

by 3 . 4 5      pm    (1545)       I d e ci d ed to walk            back    to the            coach.    I w an te d to be

on my own.             I w al ke d     up through            the tunnel            and out       of the stadium.              I

walked      back     to my      coach and w a it e d for e ve ryone               else to    return.           We

left S h e f f i e l d at about 4 .4 5            (1645)     and headed       back home.           We stopped

at a M o t o r w a y Serv ic e S t a t i o n on the way and                 I phoned home          to    let my

p a r e n t s know that         I was alright.



I was      d r op pe d off at the G o ld e n V a l l ey at a bout 9.30                 pm    (2130)       and got

a   lift    home     from




I beli ev e        that    people      that   the    people who         tried to get        into    the

gr ou nd w i th ou t       tickets       sho ul d have      been tur ne d away.         I feel

p a r t i c u l a r l y a n g r y that    press     photo gr ap he rs      were    taking    pictures          of

people       dying      in the stands,         it    is almost          inhumane.     I would       like to

see a l l — seater,         purpose       built     stadiums an d a l t h ou g h      it is a       'Catch-22’

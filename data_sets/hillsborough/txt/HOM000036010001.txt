HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - COMPENSATION PAYMENTS

Thank you for your letter of 28 February. As Mr Addison's letter
of 6 November 1989 indicated, the current special payment
arrangements do not apply to compensation payments. The normal
grant arrangements apply, as explained in my letter, to costs not
met from your insurance.

Any request for a special payment to meet compensation payments
would have to be made separately, with supporting information as
to the amounts involved and the reasons why the authority was not
able to meet these from within its resources. Also we would need
to know how far the amounts claimed fell to be met by your
insurers.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - COMPENSATION PAYMENTS

Thank you for your letter of 25 January about the possibility of
the South Yorkshire Police Authority making compensation payments
above the statutory bereavement provision of £3,500. You asked
whether such payments would qualify for police specific grant.

We understand that the Lord Chancellor is to review the statutory
provision for compensation and that there have been some recent
cases where payments have been made above the amount specified.
Ultimately it is for the parties involved to negotiate the level
of settlement in each case.     As far as the grant position is
concerned, if on legal advice, your Authority proposes to settle
at a higher level than the statutory figure the Home Office would
be prepared to pay grant on that element of compensation not
covered by your Authority's insurance, provided the total
compensation figure paid did not exceed £10,000 per person.

If your Authority proposes to settle at a figure in excess of
£10,000 per case we would need to be consulted beforehand because
of the implication for grant expenditure.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER : COMPENSATION CLAIMS

Thank you for your letter of 27 October asking under what
circumstjances and to what extent the Home Office will consider
giving further special assistance to South Yorkshire Police
Authority in connection with uninsured compensation liabilities
which might arise from impending civil actions against the Chief
Constable.

I am afraid that it is not possible for me to give any very helpful
guidance at this stage. We would of course consider a request for
special payment in addition to the normal police grant at any time.
But since the level of grant was raised to 51% only one such
payment - that already agreed for South Yorkshire following
Hillsborough - has been made.   I can therefore give no indication
whether a further application would be successful or not.

The two criteria which loom largest when we consider requests for
special payment are (a) whether the size of the expenditure is such
that to meet it would involve the police authority in such huge
costs that the viability of the police force would be put at risk
and (b) whether the commitment could have been foreseen (and so
budgeted for).

The problem with compensation liability following Hillsborough is
of course that, although the size and timing of the commitment are
uncertain, the likelihood of the commitment arising is foreseeable.
We would therefore expect the police authority to make provision
for it in its precept and budget, and if the timescale were
extended the impact of this might well be spread over more than one
year.  I appreciate that there are difficult and complex issues to
be taken into account here but they cannot be avoided and, apart
from their being the police authority's responsibility, the
authority are in a better position than we are here to answer them.

While, therefore, I do not wish to close the door in advance on any
future application from your authority, I have     to say that our
expectation would^ be that it would have taken steps to cover this
contingency from its own resources (including the grant it receives
from the Government).

I have taken your references to the precept and to the budget for
the coming year as meaning that the authority do not foresee any
payments arising in this financial year.    If, however, there were
any question of costs arising during this financial year on a scale
which seemed to the authority to call forfurther central
government help, we would require an estimate of the costs involved
and of how much would be recoverable from your insurers in order to
consider any application for a special payment.         However, no
guarantee can be given as to the outcome of such an application.
I am sorry that I cannot be more helpful at this stage.

HILLSBOROUGH:   COST OF INVESTIGATION BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE


I said that I would write to you following our recent meeting on
this subject. I much enjoyed meeting you and the other members of
your Police Authority and I am only so sorry that it should have
been the distressing events at Hillsborough which occasioned the
meeting. May I again express my sympathy for all of you at this
difficult time.

I was very grateful for the clear and courteous way in which you
explained your Authority’s position.

You agreed that the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire initially
decided that another force should be called in to investigate the
events at Hillsborough/ because it was desirable that the
investigation should be seen to be independent of South Yorkshire
police.

You also take the view that# when it was subsequently decided to
establish the enquiry under Lord Justice Taylor and to place the
results of the investigation at the service of that enquiry, this
so changed the character of the investigation, and its scope, that
as a matter of principle the South Yorkshire Police Authority
should no longer be expected to bear the costs.

You also made the point that the expected scale of costs could be
such as seriously to threaten the efficiency of the South Yorkshire
police force and could not be absorbed within the Authority's own
resources.



                                              /I explained that



Sir John Layden JP
I explained that the Home Secretary accepts that, because of the
scale of the investigation and its unexpected nature, the likely
costs could not be absorbed by South Yorkshire within the usual
police funding arrangements without serious detriment to the
efficiency of the force.

He also recognises that# as a result of the decision to make the
results of the investigation directly'available to Lord Justice
Taylor, it has been widened to cover national aspects which go
wider than the concerns of South Yorkshire, or even South Yorkshire
policing.

Nevertheless, it remains the case that much of the investigation
w^. ke concerned with the policing of events on the day, a matter
which is inescapably the concern of the South Yorkshire police. We
have looked, therefore, for a solution which reflects the statutory
responsibility, which is shared between police authorities and the
Home Secretary, for meeting the costs of police operations in
England and Wales.

Taking all these considerations into account, the Government is
prepared to offer South Yorkshire Police Authority a special
payment towards the costs of the investigation. This would apply
to costs, which are incurred by South Yorkshire Police Authority in
reimbursing additional costs incurred by West Midlands Police as a
result of the investigation.  (By additional costs we mean costs
such as overtime, travel, subsistence and accommodation of
personnel directly involved in the investigation, together with
consequential overtime costs incurred as a result of the need to
provide cover for the officers assigned to the investigation - but
not basic pay.)

The level of assistance, which we are prepared to officer, would be
for the Government to meet 90% of all costs above the product of a
lp rate (which we understand would be around £1.3 million). Up to
the £1.3 million mark the normal police grant of 51% would apply.

A limit would be placed on the total amount which South Yorkshire
Police Authority would have to contribute. Whatever the total
costs of the investigation, South Yorkshire would have to
contribute no more than the product of a 3/4p rate, which we
calculate would be about £975,000. Beyond that point the
Government would meet 100% of the cost.

Special payments have previously been made in only a small number
of cases. The Government already contributes substantially to
police expenditure through police grant and block grant. In South
Yorkshire’s case the contribution amounts to some 75% of the Police
Authority’s budget.




                                          /This would be
 This would be the first special payment provided since the increase
 in police^grant from 50% to 51%, which was intended in part to
  eave police authorities in a better position to meet unexpected
 expenditure.

There is no pre-determined formula for special payments. In
deciding to adopt the formula, which was used in the miners'
strike, we are taking into account the particular circumstances of
this case.

I have considered very carefully the points which you made to me at
the meeting.  I have reflected in particular on what you told me
about South Yorkshire Police Authority's operational contingency
fund and its balances. I appreciate that the position here is
tight.

Nevertheless I think that the terms of the offer recognise South
Yorkshire s position and the fact that the investigation is
contributing to the enquiry by Lord Justice Taylor as well as beinq
of relevance to South Yorkshire Police. No more than £975,000
would need to be contributed by the Authority whatever the costs.
On present estimates, the costs may reach £4 to £5 million. At
            ?£ costs the authority would be contributing between 20%
    23-s of the total costs, and the Government between 77% to 80%.
I do not think that South Yorkshire can reasonably be excused
meeting any of the costs. For all its awfulness and subsequent
fnr  IhLI*  was.essentially a policing matter, and the arrangements
         financing of police authorities are designed to allow for
             unexPected. We have endeavoured to recognise the
        rdinary circumstances of this case by making a proposal
     4-1S m°re ?®nerous than normal, and I hope that you will be
able to agree that we have done so.

^on?UAu4-hnr?^atefUL i£ y0U would be kind enough to let me know that
your Authority would be content to proceed on these terms.

tn              £he meeting, it is important that we move quickly
            reiniburse the West Midlands Police Authority for the
additional costs which it has incurred.

My officials would be happy to discuss with yours any queries which
they may have about the details of what would qualify for payment.

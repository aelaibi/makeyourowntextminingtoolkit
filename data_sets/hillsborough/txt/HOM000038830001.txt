Questions arising from Summary - Reference Number 79



1.    In paragraph 16 of the Summary it is stated that Police Constable

1715 Best helped to carry Mr Roberts into Leppings Lane arid at that

time believed Mr Roberto to be breathing.       Despite this, he left Mr

Roberts to assist others. Why was no basic first aid carrxea out Dy

the Officer, and why was Mr Roberts left without attention ?

Did the    lack of provision by the Officer of essential first aid such

as placing Mr Roberts in a recovery position, loosening his clothing

and providing mouth to mouth resuscitation, contribute to Mr Roberts'

death.

2-.   Police Constable 620 Yates in paragraph 15 c.f the Sumrary is stated

to have formed the view that when he saw Mr Roberts at the rear of

the West Stand, he had formed the opinion that Mr Roberts was dead,.

and therefore left him where he had found him.          However, Police Constable

1715 Best has stated that when he found Mr Roberts at the rear of the

West Stand. \ri believed hirr         brv*a-tM»y'r-   •Ess*:-'- J3t£teK«3 ts

question   to ensure   that    they had   reached the correct assumption as

to Mr Roberts' state at that time ?

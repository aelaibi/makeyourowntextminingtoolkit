DATE OF BIRTH 3.4.1952



1.   I am in my 15th year of ambulance service all with SYMAS and

     am presently a Leading Ambulance man stationed at Maltby.



2.   Before joining the service I had served in the forces in

     Northern Ireland.       I was a driver engaged in the movement of

     troops to and from trouble areas.



3.   On joining the ambulance service I was with Barnsley Borough

     Council Service the forerunner to SYMAS.              In the first year

     of   service I attended the six week ambulance                      training

     course   at the ambulance        training        centre   in Markfield,

     Leicester.    With that qualification I was able to enter the

     emergency rota of the service.             I have also attended two

     week   refresher       courses     which    up    date    us   on   the   new

     facilities and equipment in the service.              These courses run

     approximately every three years.



4.   I was stationed at Hoyland in Barnsley for approximately

     three years.         I then transferred to Longley a m b u l a n c e

     station in Sheffield in about 1975 and remained there for

     about 4 years.        I then gained promotion to the rank of

     Leading Ambulance man at Batemoor ambulance station in the

     Sheffield    area.     I remained there for about four years.               I

     then transferred to my present station of Maltby.



                                  3So
Since becoming Leading Ambulance man I have attended courses

for that rank.     These are usually held at the training

centre at SYMAS H.Q.        These are to up date us in line with

the extended skills, equipment and procedures that are being

implemented within the service.



As regards major incidents there is a specific manual,       and

in addition SYMAS holds dry-runs.        Only senior staff are

aware of planned dry runs and the crews have to respond as

normal.   As far as I am aware the last dry-run was at an

airport near Doncaster.



At Maltby   station there are five Leading Ambulance men

working a twenty four hour emergency rota seven days a week.

In   addition to the    Leading Ambulance men there      are 44

ambulance personnel which includes one station officer and

eight part time-offioegs who provide cover for the full time
                 S TP >€P
staff.



My duties as Leading Ambulance man concern actual ambulance

duties only on the emergency side, and not for outpatients.

In addition to this I have to maintain the station including

manning, supplies and statistics including hours worked and

sickness monitoring.



Essentially I have to be aware of anything which could
      affect the emergency side of operations including changes to

      the roads,weather etc.        I also ensure that all ambulances

      are operational and fully equipped,              and as a designated

      supervisor I am able to delegate many of there tasks.



10.   I cannot recall the exact rota for the week prior to the

      Hillsborough incident. However,          on Saturday the 15th and

      Sunday the 16th I was on 1400 to 2200 emergency rota at the

      Maltby station.



11.   On Saturday the 15th there was to be a two man crew of

      myself and                   |.    I arrived at about 1350 at Maltby

      Station     and   checked    the     station   logs   for    information

      relevant to my shift.



12.   I saw                       and said words to the effect that he

      should not be in.      He informed me that he was working his

      day off to cover for                           who had taken a days

      leave to which he was entitled.



13.   Having logged in at about 1400 we proceeded to make the

      usual checks to the equipment on the emergency vehicle which

      was allocated to us.          This was Vehicle 405.          For control

      purposes this has a call sign of Romeo 608.                 We made our

      checks   on all the equipment required for the emergency

      vehicles.    This included checking that the gas was on in the

      vehicle, together with all medical equipment.               Tyre pressure

                                    and fluid levels are also checked.



                         14.        On completing our checks we returned to the mess room to

                                    await calls from control.         I was in the office when the

                                    telephone rang from Control.         I answered the phone and spoke

                                    to Control Superintendent Ray Clarke.             He said "proceed to

                                    Hillsborough,    Sheffield,   query major"       I replied "we are on

                                    our way" and put the phone down.          I can not recall the exact

                                    time,   but   would   estimate       we   left    at about    1510.   We

                                    proceeded to Hillsborough g r o u n d        at    s peed    with

                                             driving.



                         15.        Whilst on route we continued to receive calls from Control

                                    who requested that we attend the Leppings Lane end.                   We

                                    proceeded along ^Ml^^ ^ wygd ^Road tjp^ the ground.           On arrival

                                    at Leppings Lane^entrance we were directed in front of a

                                    number of police officers, by a senior police officer, into

                                    the Leppings Lane end of the ground.                There were three

                                    ambulances already in attendance.          The vehicles infront were

                                    loading casualties in order of priority.



                         16.                        There were in excess of 30 casualties lined up ag

                                    wall on the left of our vehicle as we faced into the ground.

                                    On the right side there appeared to be approximately 18

                                    bodies with a line of police officers in front of them./1 I

17.   I had my portable resuscitating unilf and hand radio.                       I was

      about to get out of the vehicle when a police officer ran up

      s tay ing with the vehicle                     and running with the     flow of

      traffic.      I accompanied the police officer to the young man

      laid on the ground.                A police officer told me they had tried

      to revive him but to no avail.                     I administered resuscitation

      and he breathed irregularly.                       I told the police officer to

      return to my vehicle and collect                                      together

      with a stretcher.He returned and we loaded the young man on

      to the ambulance which by then was alongside                          irT-^rnir rrrr




18.   I recognised a colleague Mr Yoxall from Barnsley ambulance
                 (jZ o c rr& flC U
      station who was a cwipejvlaor at the event, but off duty.                      He

      pointed out a second casualty who was next to our vehicle.

      He assisted                    in getting him onto the vehicle and we

      gave oxygen to both the patients.                     I told __    to leave, the

      ground for the Northern General Hospit al ( \                     Upon arrival      )

      doctors and staff were awaiting casualties.                       We off loaded

      both casualties who by then were breathing for themselves

      without oxygen.



19.   I then drove the vehicle and told                            and Yoxall to get


                                                  3>%.

         next casualties.               I was given a police motorcycle escort

20   .   On returning towards the Leppings Lane entrance we were

         coming down Leppings Lane and turning left when I noticed

         there were hundreds of supporters walking around some of

         them     shocked        and         some     of         them     holding               their        chests

         indicating crush injuries.                          We gradually proceeded through

         the crowd into the ground.                      I instructed Q t a n d                        Yoxall to

         remain in the vehicle as the two man crew.



21.      I walked to another Leading Ambulance man whom I recognised

         as Jack Flack from Parkway ambulance station      -**n jrniFlit

         me I decided ^to become the incident officer for that area of

         the ground until relived bv a senior officer.                                           I returned to

         my vehicle and told                        'and Yoxall to continue as a crew

         without me.           I said I was going up ahead to sort out the

         scene.    There were in excess of 30 casualties lined up, but



                                                    3S£
all were conscious.           They were being loaded six or seven at

a time into vehicles mainly as sitting cases.



             _______^ was parked^with the rear doors open and I

noticed a young         girl     wh o    appeared      to    be   an    official

ambulance observer (medical student).                 I asked her where the

crew were and she said they had gone into the ground.                             I

noticed that the resucitating unit and portable radio were

still with the vehicle.             I told the observer to stay with

the vehicle as I would be using it for casualties who did

not require immediate hospital treatment.                         HfrrtKejtaiCkiinga

As vehicles were loaded up I directed them alternately to

R o yal   Hallamshire         and   Northern       General        to    even   the

distribution of patients to each casualty unit.                        I then went

back down the road towards Leppings Lane to see if any

further     assistance        was    required       because       most     of the

casualties had, by then, been taken to hospital.



I met the Assistant Chief               David Jones.        He asked me if my

portable      r a dio   was    in w o r k i n g   order     as    his    was   not

functioning correctly.           I said yes and we exchanged radios.

I told him what I had been doing at that position and he

said to continue in charge of that area while he was going

to re-direct ambulances round to the gymnasium.
I went back down toAarea     fc /G   -which by now was a lot clearer.

There were only walking casualties that were being comforted

by Red Cross and St Johns personnel.                  I went back to the

Derbyshire vehicle to supervise the care of casualties.                    The

attendant of the Derbyshire vehicle then returned explaining

to me that he had been using his extended skills training/on

casualties within the ground.            I explained that I had used

his vehicle for walking casualties and pointed out              the only

casualty that he should keep an eye on, namely a patient who

was holding his chesty   A *i£   mas   g e f & j (O


                                                                 ( jlir d tk
I looked around and noticed my vehicle coming up behind.                       I

went over to it and asked Yoxall if he would go into the

Derbyshire vehicle as attendant and told the Derbyshire crew

member to drive the ambulance to the Hallamshire.



I went back to my vehicle and took up the roll of ambulance

attendant.                           informed me that he had been

informed to go round to the gymnasium and to report to the

officer in charge.   We drove on to Penistone Road             where we

were asked by Assistant Chief Jones to off load all blankets

and body bags.



Mr Jones then told us to report to the bus depot on Herries

Road and liaise with the incident officer present.                    I've

attended the bus depot and reported to the incident officer.

Nottinghamshire,   Derbyshire and other vehicles were sent
      home leaving only Symas vehicles.    We waited in position for

      about an hour to relieve any further casualties in the

      Hillsborough area.     We were then requested to report to the

      gymnasium for briefing.



29.   At the gymnasium Mr Jones ascertained from each crew what

      shift they were on.     Having established that we were on

      emergency we were requested to return to duty and switch

      from channel one to normal emergency channel number two and

      report to   control.    We were told by control   to return to

      the Maltby area.

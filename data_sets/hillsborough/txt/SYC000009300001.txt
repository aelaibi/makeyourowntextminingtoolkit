    forms be adopted:
     C.D. died from natural causes.
                                                                           Re

       Dear Sirs,

       Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


       If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
       of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
       on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
       due course.

       I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
       evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
       coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
       inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

       Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
       under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the

o
       witnesses who wish to give evidence. I am at present engaged in considering
       this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

       Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
       to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
       appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
       consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

       May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
       attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

       I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
       names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
       to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

       I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
       heard from you by the end of SeptenjJ^er I will assume you have no names to
       submit.

       Yours faithfully,

             Sirs,

aes       PAUL G M R K (deceased) Ho,53»
As you axe aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided aot~to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

 I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
 is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
 fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,

    \

Dear Sir

RE:   HILLSBOROUGH

Many thanks for your letter of the 27th July enclosing copies of the Post-Mortem
Reports.

I will certainly make clear to my clients the conditions under which these
Reports have been released.

A cheque for £26.95 to cover your copying charges is attached, might I trouble
you for a receipt for accounting purposes.

Since I gave you my list of deceased a further one has been added, he is
John McBrien The Old Vicarage, Well Street, Holywell, Clwyd, might I please
have a copy of his Report to complete the set.

Yours faithfully

 Eear Sirs,

 fou will be aware that i. do not normally release Dost mortem
 reports until the resumption of the Inquest, when they are
 in fact put in as evidence.                                                         ‘

 However, in view of the numerous requests which I have received,
 and the obvious distress which delay is causing to your clients,
 I have decided that subject to certain conditions set out below,
 x am prepared to release to you upon reauest, the post mortem
 report of your client(s).

 The release of these post mortem reports are on the basis that:-

       a.      They have to be treated as provisional, and therefore
               subject to amendment or alteration until such time as
               they are given or produced in evidence at the Inquest.

       b.      They are to be used only for the purpose of bereavement
               consailing of the deceased's relatives or for proper
               legitimate purposes in connection with any legal proceedings
               in which solicitors may be engaged*

       c.      subject to ~nS.';aQOve? they are to be kept confidential until
               they come into the public domain at the resumed Inquests.

x nave your requesx for the post mortem renort to hand in respect
of each^of the persons listed on the attached sheet, and on the
assumption that you will confirm that the report in resrect of
each of your respective clients is accepted on the terms set out
above, and in order to save further delay and upset to your client,
I enclose a copy of the relevant post mortem report. If for any
reason you cannot agree to the contents of this letter, please return
the post mortem report to me, without of course making any use of it.

I refer to your recent conversation with Superintendent
Sleath concerning the release of the deceased persons from
the Hillsborough incident to their respective next of kin,
following the adjournment of the inquest.

After consultation with Professor Usher, I have no objection
to this course of action.

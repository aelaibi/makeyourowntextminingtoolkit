 THE POLICE SEEMED FRIGHTENED TO LET PEOPLE ONTO THE PITCH.     THEY

 APPEARED TO BE WAITING FOR ORDERS BEFORE THEY DID ANYTHING.



 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL

 TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I THINK THAT THE FACT THAT OUR COACH DROPPED   US OFF AT THE   NOTTS FOREST

 END PROVES THAT WE COULD HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED   THAT END.

 THE POLICE SEEMED INTENT ON STOPPING PEOPLE DRINKING AND RINGING    RATHER
                                                    JU JC L    V

THEY HAVE CLOSE CIRCUIT TV, ETC.            WHY DID POLICE ALLOW SO MANY PEOPLE INTO

SUCH A CONFINED SPACE.

EVEN BY WALKING ALONG THE         FRONT THE POLICE SHOULD HAVE REALISED ITWAS FULL

BY 1423.

 IN MY OPINION I WOULD NOT        CRITICIZE THE MAN WHO OPENED THE             GATE OUTSIDE BY

THE TURNSTILES,       HE ACTED FOR PURELY        SAFETY REASONS.

 I SAT DOWN UNDER THE BARRIER TO WAIT FOR THE CRUSH TO EASE.               IT WAS VERY HOT

 AND I HAD SOME DIFFICULTY             IN BREATHING,   BUT I THOUGHT I WOULD BE SAFER THERE

 HIS 20'S, WITH LONG DARK HAIR.      I C A N ’T REMEMBER WHAT HE WAS WEARING.   THERE WAS

 A LAD WITH HIM WITH HIS HAND ON HIS NECK. THIS MAN TOLD ME TO GET OUT THROUGH

 INJURED.

 Thank you for your letter of 24 November about the correspondence you have had from the
 Hillsborough Family Support Group and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire. I have as
 you say seen copies of their letters,

 I said soon after my appointment in the summer that I expected to be able to let you have my
 report by the end of this year. My work on the scrutiny is well advanced and I believe that I
 will be able to keep to this timetable. I am writing to the Family Support Group and other
 interested parties to tell them this and to say that it would help me if they could let me have
 any farther material which they wish to present to me by Friday 5 December.

 I have not experienced any difficulty with access to the information held by South Yorkshire
 police. They have co-operated with my scrutiny throughout. I have as you say decided to
 let this material remain in police custody in Sheffield rather than transport it to London.
 Bringing it here would have created formidable logistical difficulties. It would also have
 meant that it was the scrutiny, rather than South Yorkshire police, who would have had to
 respond to requests from the families and others for information from the archive. That
 would have seriously hampered me and my staff in the task which you have given us to do.

 Nevertheless if I thought there was any question as to the continuing integrity of this material
 I would have ensured that it was removed from South Yorkshire police custody. But I do not
 think that.

 Although this is not strictly speaking a matter for me I have also formed the view that the
 police are doing all they can to ensure that the families and their support group receive the
 information which they ask for. These requests are onerous but I have seen no sign that the
 police are obstructing them.

 When I was in Liverpool from 6 to 8 October a number of the families whom I met told me
 that they did not have a copy of their relatives’ ‘body file’ from the police. I recommended
that they should ask the police for it straight away. Other people told me that they suspected
that the ‘body file’ material which the police had sent them was incomplete. I asked them to
let me know what they had so that I could check, but in most cases they have not done so. In
the two cases where I have been able to check the material which a family has against the
actual body file I have found nothing of significance missing.

Mr Hicks’s letter mentions the medical records o f the people who died at Hillsborough.
These detail the treatment they received in hospital. Most of those who died did not go to
hospital and have no such medical record, but for those who did their medical record is held
by the hospital, not by the police. It is not part of the ‘body file’ (unlike the post-mortem or
autopsy report, which is part of the body file and which families who asked for this will have
seen).

Hospitals will release copies of the medical records of a person who has died to a properly
authorised personal representative, including of course a solicitor such as the solicitor who
acts for the Family Support Group. I have to say that I am slightly surprised that the Group
now say that they are denied access to them. I have as Mr Hicks says looked at the hospital
medical record of Philip Hammond, who died in the disaster. It is a one-page document
which contains no useful information at all.

Finally, I agree that it would be helpful for us to meet to discuss the publication of the
material which has been put to me during my scrutiny and I look forward to that.

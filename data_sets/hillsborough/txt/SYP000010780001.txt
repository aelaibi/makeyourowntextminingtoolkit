Dear Sir
This afternoon I spoke with an officer from West Midlands Police and gave an oral summary of the
statement which I now attach. Although I would submit this as a statement I would seek further
guidance as to ensure that I have covered all the salient features. I would welcome further
discussion with your officers.

1       Football Clubs and Football Governing Bodies

        Areas which must be questioned and investigated
        (i)      Why, when statistical evidence is well known and well recorded, did the ruling and
                 governing bodies in football make the ticket allocation in the way they did?

        (ii)     How much were these governing bodies influenced by police pressure?

        (iii)    Why wasn't the protest which the Liverpool Football Club, and also the Liverpool
                 supporters club not listened to - and acted upon?

2       Police and Other Emergency Services
        My witness and experience of the events at Hillsborough - Saturday 15 April

        (i)      Being "dropped o ff' directly outside the ground on the main road running parallel
                 with the Northside Stand (where my seat was) at between 2.25 and 2.30 pm - it was
                 not until 2.55 pm that I actually got into the ground.
        (ii)     I did see some prospective spectators who had had a considerable amount of alcohol -
                 and I would not wish to condone this - but, it must be given some perspective, and
                 the number of people falling into this category was so small that I believe that it
                 would be considered to be too small to be statistically significant

        (iii)    In trying to gain access to the ground I noted that all of the side streets - which are
                  important for both entrance and exit - had police barriers which blocked the routes.
                  The net effect of this was to cause a "funnel" effect whereby pressure was building
                  up in only one way - at the turnstiles. Following the road barriers, these turnstiles
                  were the first and only form of crowd organisation at the Leppings Lane end of the
                  ground. I would also note that in the ensuing crush very few police were in evidence
                  on the approaches to Hillsborough.
        (iv)     When I eventually did manage to get through the turnstiles, I saw - and spoke to - a
                 group of at least twenty policemen who were, apparently, oblivious of what was
                 occurring outside. It was already becoming self-evident to spectators who have
                 experience of events such as this that a very serious crowd problem was developing,
                 and that the police authorities had not, at that stage, been able to identify or quantify
                 the magnitude of the developing situation.
        (v)      Having found my seat, two thoughts were uppermost in my mind. Firstly the gross
                 overcrowding in the enclosure to my right - the Leppings Lane End, and secondly,
                 the number of forged tickets which were being exchanged and discussed.

        (vi)     Shortly after the game started I witnessed spectators being physically hauled up from
                 the central standing area in that enclosure to the upper stand ( I am aware that all of
                 this is recorded on film) and also people in that enclosed area both being 'spewed' out
                 from the gate which was then opened and also some somersaulting over the
                 perimeter fencing.


        (vii)    It was apparent from the reaction of the police, and perhaps understandable due to
                 obvious lack of communication, that these actions constituted a pitch invasion.
                 Accordingly, some officers then physically tried to push back the spectators into the
                 same enclosure.

        (viii)   As events unfolded more and more police did come on to the pitch but by this time
                 people who were injured were not in any way being cared for by the emergency
                 services. Indeed many police constables still apparently considered it to be a pitch
                 invasion. This was evidenced by police forming a human barrier across the centre
                                                                                                             4
             line of the ground in order to restrain Liverpool spectators from moving towards the
             "kop" end of the stadium. It was not until some considerable time later that some
             rescue and recovery services did in fact take a small number of stretchers to the
             injured. Fortunately some makeshift stretchers made from the advertising hoardings
             around the ground were used to carry the injured and dying people out - these
             stretchers were in the main carried by spectators.
     (ix)    Another significant fact is that the crowd remaining on the terraces were not informed
             as to what was happening. This in itself caused some confusion and would not have
             assisted emergency services operations outside of the ground when people started
             drifting away.
Points which I consider should be drawn to the attention of the Police
Investigation

1    In discussion with friends and family in and around Liverpool it would appear that the
     Liverpool police were not fully consulted by the South Yorkshire police. I find this
      somewhat surprising in that they have greater experience of crowd control of this kind. I am
     further led to believe that they (ie the Liverpool Police)would not have had as many
      constables from as many different forces as was the case on that day.
2    Because of large number of constables on duty there must necessarily arise questions relating
     to where those constables were drawn from, what specific training they had for this occasion
     and indeed what experience they had, and what was their training - including coordination of
     the event prior to the start of, during and after the game.
3    Concerning the Senior Officers - it would appear that at least one of the most senior officers
     on duty had only recently been appointed to the post and indeed had spent most of his career
     in the Policy Academy and had very little experience of crowd control. Another officer was
     investigated during the Toxteth riots for decisions which he took then, which had similar
     characteristics to the events of 15 April.
4    The police I believe did have some sway with the initial ticket allocation and also the part of
     the ground which would be occupied by the different sets of spectators. I believe that this
     area needs thorough examination in light of the statements made earlier and relating to
     statistical evidence available with regards to crowds and the large attendances at matches in
     Liverpool and Nottingham and also the specific complaint which was lodged by Liverpool
     Football Club regarding the allocation of tickets.

5   Questions must certainly be asked as to why the side streets were blocked and why there
    were so few police outside the ground.
6   Although the fact that forgeries were in evidence is known, the extent of the sale of the
    forged tickets is another factor which must be investigated, as I believe that this was a
    contributory factor on the numbers attending the match.

7   With regards to the information on the outside of the ground and the information on the
    inside of the ground, I would have thought that at this level before an order was given to
    open the gates other factors should have been taken into account in addition to the evidence
    from the computer.

8   Some of the gates at the Leppings Lane end were apparently not opened at the time which
     they should have been opened for a game of this kind ie 11.30 am . They did not open until
     shortly before 2.00 pm.
9   It has been widely reported that requests were made to senior management (ie of the Police)
     to postpone the start of the game. This also needs investigation as to why the order was not
     given to delay the start.
10   In previous matches of this kind there has been similar, although less catastrophic, events at
     the Hillsborough ground which the police and the club were aware of. It was also known on
     the "grapevine" that under certain circumstances police had taken to the habit of allowing
     spectators in without tickets. This had happened very recently at another game in Yorkshire
     this year.
11   There appeared to be little coordination of the emergency services as the tragedy was
     unfolding. I would question what training and coordination for the combined emergency
     services was given beforehand and what emergency procedures were rehearsed. It seems
     quite alarming that in the first instance the Fire Brigade wily sent two tenders when the call
     was made to them and also that the club itself did not have a defibrillator (a standard piece of
     equipment at a match of this kind) and also that the single oxygen cylinder was found to be
                                 one of the emergency doctors.

                                         group of at least twenty policemen who were, apparently, oblivious of what was
                                         occurring outside. It was already becoming self-evident to spectators who have              *
                                         experience of events such as this that a very serious crowd problem was developing,
c i.
                                         and that the police authorities had not, at that stage, been able to identify or quantify
                                         the magnitude of the developing situation,                                     h »i       .
             tttk e J h     (v)         Having found my seat, two thoughts were uppermost in my mind. Firstly the gross
                                        overcrowding in the enclosure to my right - the Leppings Lane End, and secondly,
                                        the number of forged tickets which were being exchanged and discussed. : [ p . \
                            (Vi)        Shortly after the game started I witnessed spectators being physically hauled up from
                                        the central standing area in that enclosure to the upper stand ( I am aware that all of
                                        this is recorded on film) and also people in that enclosed area both being ’spewed1out
                                        from the gate which was then opened and also some somersaulting over the
                                        perimeter fencing.


                            (vii)       It was apparent from the reaction of the police, and perhaps understandable due to
                                         obvious lack of communication, that these actions constituted a pitch invasion.
                                         Accordingly, some officers then physically tried to push back the spectators into the
                                         same enclosure.

                            (viii)      As events unfolded more and more police did come on to the pitch but by this time                       ’
                                        people who were injured were not in any way being cared for by the emergency
                                        services. Indeed many police constables still apparently considered it to be a pitch \«jc
                                        invasion. This was evidenced by police forming a human barrier across the centre
                                                                                                                       8
                                                line of the ground in order to restrain Liverpool spectators from moving towards the
                                                "kop" end of the stadium. It was not until some considerable time latex that some
                                                rescue and recovery services did in fact take a small number of stretchers to the
                                                injured. Fortunately some makeshift stretchers made from the advertising hoardings
                                                around the ground were used to carry the injured and dying people out - these
                                                stretchers were in the main carried by spectators.

                                        (ix)    Another significant fact is that the crowd remaining on the terraces were not informed
                                                as to what was happening. This in itself caused some confusion and would not have
                                                assisted emergency services operations outside of the ground when people sta
                                                drifting away.
                              Points which I consider should be drawn to the attention of the                          g 't'C T r o       O&0 M N

                                   <>   Because of large number of constables on duty there must necessarily arise questions relating
                                        to where those constables were drawn from, what specific training they had for this occasion
                                        and indeed what experience they had, and what was their training - including coordination of
                                        the event prior to the start of, during and after the game.

                               Concerning the Senior Officers - it would appear that at least one of the most senior officers
                               on duty had only recently been appointed to the post and indeed had spent most of his career
                               in the Policy Academy and had very little experience of crowd control. Another officer was
   -          -T      O /aK "Toinvestigated during the Toxteth riots for decisions which he took then, which had similar
              M      c *      characteristics to the events of 15 April.

  ^ ^ & >                  c£4          The police I believe did have some sway with the initial ticket allocation and also the part of
  zp               c £ ,                the ground which would be occupied by the different sets of spectators. I believe that this
                                         area needs thorough examination in light of the statements made earlier and relating to
                                         statistical evidence available with regards to crowds and the large attendances at matches in
                                         Liverpool and Nottingham and also the specific complaint which was lodged by Liverpool
                                         Football Club regarding the allocation of tickets.

                              5         Questions must certainly be asked as to why the side streets were blocked and why there
                                        were so few police outside the ground.
                              6         Although the fact that forgeries were in evidence is known, the extent of the sale of the
                                        forged tickets is another factor which must be investigated, as I believe that this was a
                                        contributory factor on the numbers attending the match.                      p u j& A -


                             7          With regards to the information on the outside of the grouncMtnd the information on the
                                        inside of the ground, I would have thought that at this leveibefore an order was given to
                                        open the gates other factors should have been taken into account in addition to the evidence
                                        from the computer.

                             8          Some of the gates at the Leppings Lane end were apparently not opened at the time which
                                        they should have been opened for a game of this kind ie 11.30 am . They did not open until
                                        shortiv before 2 00 Dm.                 r                                        /w a r u n /0



                             9          It has been widely reported that requests were made to senior management (ie of the Police)
                                         to postpone tne start of the game. This also needs investigation as to why the order was not
                                         given to delay the start, n o t

10   In previous matches of this kind there has been similar, although less catastrophic, events at
     the Hillsborough ground which the police and the club were aware of. It was also known on
     the "grapevine" that under certain circumstances police had taken to the habit of allowing
     spectators in without tickets. This had happened very recently at another game in Yorkshire n
     this year.                                             q > o g % >~ r   /  #    *     £j  £ A & P

11   There appeared to be litde coordination of the emergency services as the tragedy was
     unfolding. I would question what training and coordination for the combined emergency
     services was given beforehand and what emergency procedures were rehearsed. It seems
     quite alarming that in the first instance the Fire Brigade only sent two tenders when the call
     was made to them and also that the club itself did not have a defibrillator (a standard piece of
     equipment at a match of this k in d ^ n d also that the single oxygen cylinder was found to be
     empty when asked for by one of the emergency doctors.^

Dear Sir
This afternoon I spoke with an officer from West Midlands Police and gave an oral summary of the
statement which I now attach. Although I would submit this as a statement I would seek further
guidance as to ensure that I have covered all the salient features. I would welcome further
discussion with your officers.

Yours faithfully

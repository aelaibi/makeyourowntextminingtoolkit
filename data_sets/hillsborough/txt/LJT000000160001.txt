7.          The announcement r e a d :




     The     Press Council has announced today that it is conducting a

general      inquiry   into photographic coverage by newspapers of            the
Hillsborough disaster.



     Its chairman, Mr Louis Blom-Cooper, said this morning that the

Council     had   already    received a number of   complaints    from    the
public.




     The inquiry would be directed to the responsibility of editors

for the     publication     of   photographs of such an    explicit   nature

relating     to death that they may cause distress,       not merely to the

families of the victims but also to the reading public generally.




           The next day, Tuesday, the Council received more than 30
           written complaints, including a number of petitions,  and
           by  the end of the week had received     207 complaints
           comprising some 500 signatories.


           Within two weeks    this     total had become 305 written
           complaints, comprising nearly 3000 signatories - including
           two signed by nearly 1 0 0 0 people each.

          The final count, at 19 May, was 349 written complaints, of
          which  56 were against media behaviour generally and did
          not name newspapers, while 59 were against more than one
          newspaper.  A  total of 35 newspapers were specifically
          named by complainants, attracting a total of 422 mentions.
          The total number of      signatories  involved was 3651.
 MEMORANDUM AA17193/D7232 —   PAGE 3




         National  Sunday  and daily    newspapers,  and   selected
         regional newspapers, were advised of the inquiry by letter
         on Tuesday 18 April. The letter read:



    On Monday   17 April   the   Press    Council  announced  it   is
conducting  a general   inquiry   into    photographic  coverage   by
newspapers of the Hillsborough tragedy.

    A copy of the press release is enclosed.

    That  day the Council received more than 100 telephone     calls
complaining at picture coverage of the disaster.

    In anticipation of    a number of written complaints,   either
against  coverage generally, or specifically   against  particular
newspapers,  the Council is asking for editors' views on their own
papers'  approach to picture coverage of the event, and for  their
general views on the subject.

    In particular editors who used colour pictures are asked what
consideration   they gave    to the    impact of   colour in   their
newspapers  as opposed     to using the same pictures in black   and
white.  The   Council asks this, since a significant proportion of
the telephone   complaints   received were specifically about    the
photographs being in colour.

    The Council has previously addressed this problem, in the case
of the  Hungerford killings in August 1987, and for reference     a
copy of the Council's adjudication, from the 1987 annual   report,
The Press and The People, is enclosed.


    Individual  complainants  are being advised by the Council  of
this inquiry, but such complaints will be forwarded to editors for
handling on an individual basis if they so wish.

       12.  A copy of the press release (para 7) was
       together with a copy of the Hungerford ruling;                                       enclosed.

              complained thatthenewspaperpublisheda frontpagecolour photograph
              ofone ofthe victims ofthe Hungerford massacre, unnecessarily adding
              to the distress already caused.

                He said the picturewas a callous intrusionon theprivacy ofthedead
              man, Mr Jack Gibbs, and of his wife who then lay dying in hospital (
              The newspaper had published an editorial explaining that the decision
              touse thepicturewas taken aftermuch thought, but Mr          saidthat
              did not justify itsuse.                             1


                A laterleadingarticlesaid more than 100 readers had telephoned the
             paper in an unprecedented barrage of complaints. It regretted that its
             coverage had offended some readers, but said thatnot to have used the
             picture in colour when it had the technology to do so would have
             deliberately diluted and diminished what took place.

              f      ec**tor;                toJd Mr          the decision was not made
              for commercial reasons but was an editorial judgement for newsworthiness
              and public interest.

               The complainant said he thought the Council should pronounce upon
             the important ethical issue raised by the case.

               M    r ^ responding formally to the complaint, said the colour picture
             complained of had been used in the television news the previous evening
             The Guardian Daily Mail, Daily Express, The Star, The Sun, Daily
             Mirror and Today all used the same picture, he said.

               It was difficult, he said, to see how any newspaper could properly reflect

             that would shock or offend. It was a proper and appropriate editorial

            of its readers, many of whom telephoned or wrote. A fall selection of
            critical letters was published.

                       Adjudication: The Press Council has recognised thedifficulttask
                     ofeditors indeciding whether topublishnewsworthy pictureswhich
                     readers may find horrific or offensive or which may cause further
                     distress to people who are injured or bereaved. In this case there
                     was an additional factor. The Express and Star because of its
                     production process was able to publish the picture as ithad been
                     received from an international news agency -incolour, and theeditor
                     had to decide whether to do so.

                       Reproduction in colour gready intensified the horror of the
                     photograph of the covered body of a victim of the Hungerford
                     massacre lying amid bloodstains in the kitchen where he had been
                     shot.

                       The caption said the picture captured the horror ofthe carnage.
                     It and similar pictures were used by many newspapers and on
                     television.


                     The Press Council appreciates thatthe editor and his staffgave
                   careful thought to whether itshould be used. The paper latergave
                   substantial space to letters from readers protesting about it, and
                   published a leading article explaining the decision to use it.

                      The decision which the editor had totake was a hard one, but in
                    thePressCouncil’sview thiscolourpictureinthiscontextfellbeyond
                    the borderline of what should have been published.

                      The complaint against the Express and Star istherefore upheld.
                    (Y14913).




13.       Once  the written complaints were received it soon became
          clear  that public concern was greater than merely picture
          coverage of   the tragedy, and the terms of the Council's
          inquiry were widened to take account of all news coverage
          of the incident. Editors were advised accordingly.

14.       All  complainants were notified within a day of  receiving
          their complaints   of the Council's general inquiry,  that
          copies of   their complaints    were being forwarded to
          specific  editors, and that they would be notified of the
          outcome of the inquiry.

15.       Editors were invited to write directly to complainants,
          and/or to comment on the complaints to the Council.
16.      A large number of Members of Parliament complained, either
         on their own behalf, or on behalf of constituents. Each MP
         was  advised of the Council receiving his or her complaint
         and constituents were treated as specific complainants.
17.      Complaints  were  received from The Football Association,
         Liverpool   City Council    Hillsborough Working    Party,
         Sheffield Methodist District Synod and the Clergy Disaster
         Team of the Oldham Division of Greater Manchester Police.

     Dear Sir,

     I am writing on behalf of my children, family, friends and colleagues
     to express our dismay and anger at the          Bs?published in the
     newspapers after the Hillsborough football match disaster.

     My family reads the Oaily Mirror and the picture spread across the centre
     pages on Monday 17th April is appalling and beyond belief that any
     editor could.allow a photograph to be enlarged to such an extent to
     s h o w a p e r s o n s suffering - it is in fact immoral.

     We understand that articles and pictures have to report and show
     the news, but where was the thought for the immediate family, relatives and

Dear Sir,



I felt that I had to write to you to express my utter horror at the press
coverage of the disaster which occurred at Hillsborough on Saturday 15th
April 1989.



As a lifelong football fan, I was naturally horrified at what took place and
my deepest sympathies go out to all the bereaved families on Merseyside and
indeed throughout the country.     What a pity that the tabloid press do not
seem to share my view.     The                          the tragedy, as seen
in The Daily Mirror in particular, was utterly offensive.     Families who
lost loved ones may well have seen their sons or daughters spread across
the front pages of a newspaper only minutes before they died.     How can this
be allowed to pass without these papers being made to pay for this act of
inhumanity ?



It is beyond me how anyone can stand and photograph such things when there
are obviously people suffering greatly before their eyes.     The newspapers
concerned have attempted to justify their actions, using the excuse that
photographs are their only weapon in order to make people see the true extent
of the tragedy.    I personally find this an insult to the families of those who
so tragically losttheir lives.    Surely the figure of 94 dead is evidence
enough   .



I urge you to do all in your power to extract a public apology from the
newspapers concerned and to make sure that this sort of callousness is never
allowed to happen again.


Your Faithfully,

I have no connection with any of the victims, but I feel moved to
write     to you concerning the appalling insensitivity shown by               the
P ress                 s_p i c t u r e .coverage of the Hillsborough disaster.
The    lfa:gd-x:JLose.rjip^:Ph6 tographs jof suffocating people were        enough
to give       me nightmares.            I shudder to think of      the effect   on
bereaved      families of seeing their loved ones pitilessly displayed
in their       agonising d e a t h - t h r o e s . Such horrific photographs were
not on l y shown in the sensation-seeking tabloids, to whom no shred
of   hu m a n  decency appears to cling, but even in                 'responsible'
journals such as 'The I n d e p e n d e n t ' and 'The Times'.

S omething must be done about such grotesque intrusions into human
grief    and misery which follow every disaster of    this sort.   I
apologise for the somewhat untidy format of this letter, but it is
written as the expression of an anger which has been welling up in
me   since   the day of the disaster. Not the least of m y questions
concerns    the role of the photographers themselves — why were they
not   -trying to help the victims instead of calmly recordinq  their
deaths on film?

I am writing to complain and object to the tasteless and      totally
horrific   photographs in the Sun and Mirror dated 17/4/89,   of  the
d isaster at Hillsborough.

As  if  the television coverage    wasn't   enough,  we  were  then
subjected to graphic, COLOUR still-lifes.«.I agree there was a need
for  reporting the incident, but I suggest that more thought    and
selective editing should have been priority.

The   Mirror's centre and front pages were absolutely appalling.    It
is   hard enough to comprehend that you have lost a loved one       in
such   traumatic  circumstances, without having the possibility     of
seeing them splashed across the papers in such utter torment.

As  a ward sister of a local hospital, I chose,    along with my
superior to with-hold the above two newspapers, to save m y elderly
clients  from anymore unnecessary pain and horror.   They weren't
even subjected to this type of mindless reporting during two World
Wars.

Those  faces  belonged to a family who loved them, who won't   and
can't forget them, all you did was to show the ultimate nightmare;
their death.

 I o n l y hope that this type of disaster and journalism is the last
 the public is ever to see.

Although I have long felt that the standards of British journalism
leave much   to be desired with regard to insensitivity, bias  and
plain misinformation,   I refer particularly to    the so called
tabloid  "gutter"  press, this is the first time that I have ever
felt sufficiently outraged as to write to yourselves.

The  coverage   of the   tragic events  at Hillsborough was    both
distasteful   and disgraceful   to say the  least.  Almost without
exception   the newspapers   of this   country contained r.close-up
photographs of    the crushed, dead and dying, with absolutely no
regard to the families and friends of these poor innocent victims.
The most    sickening of all was an unbelievably insensitive front
and back page spread in glorious ^^fchnirr.colour^ published in
Monday 17th April's edition of the Daily Mirror, although coverage
of  the   events by Today and the Sun came close behind in the
distasteful stakes.

Whilst    accepting fully that the press has a duty to report all
national news events, be they happy, sad, delightful or sickening,
there     can still surely be      absolutely no excuse    for   the
unbelievable    insensitivity shown. The photographs displayed seem
to  represent little more than a calculated effort to arouse mans
fascination for the macabre in order to boost newspaper sales, and
the   way   in which the reports themselves glorified the horror of
the events seems only to add weight to my theory.

However,  if the coverage in Mondays newspapers was tasteless then
Wednesday  19th April's edition of the Sun touched new depths. The
claim that those involved were "Yobs" just sickened me.

Many  friends  of mine were present at the match.    They saw no
yobbishness.  Some of them played an active part in trying to save
the  lives of others, and all, I can assure you,   were  extremely
distressed by the newspapers coverage of events. These people are
heroes not yobs and they deserve the accolades of a nation and not
smears from their national press.

I sincerely hope that in any future national disaster of any kind
the  families  and  friends of the victims will  not  have  their
already enormous burden added to by crass, insensitive, tasteless
and puerile newspaper reporting of the kind witnessed after the
Hillsborough tragedy.

X am writing to complain about the photographs in yesterdavs (17 th
April) Daily Mirror-

Before I began this letter I phoned the Daily Mirror, I don't want
to complain 'behind their backs' as it were, but 'to their faces'
I am actually shaking with anger after I asked to make an official
complaint  and the man on the switchboard said "yeah, yeah,   I've
got your complaint" in a dismissive, bored voice.

I don't know about the photographs in others papers which I'm sure
were      equally  as disgusting as the Mirror- The colour picture *on
the front and back pages showing people clearly dead, one woman at
•the front her face distorted and blue- Also the one in colour |on
■the centre pages so close you could see the hairs in the        persons
nose-      I have never felt angry enough to complain about     anythinq
before now, is this news?       Is this what the public 'has a right to
see        which  I heard someone connected with a newspaper say on
breakfast      television this morning defending       the photoghraphs
printed. Is that really what I have a right to see and know?        They
ha v e     upset me so much, I am not from Liverpool nor was I anywhere
n e a r the match but if I feel I     can't get over it, h o w must  the
bereaved and injured people feel?

I    am     looking at the picture on the front page of the  Mirror to
remind myself        why I am writing this, why I will never  buy that
pa p e r  again, and why I am appalled and horrified at the    coverage
of     the disaster by the gutter press, and what a gutter it is thev
crawl in-                                                             *

H o w would the     photographers and editors (and who ever  else  is
responsible)     feel if it was their husband, wife, parent (or much
worse) children, young or grown-up, pressed against the fence the
b l u e paint flaking on their faces, in the dying and dead throes of
their lives, bloated and undignified.

W h e n I cried after the disaster it wasn't just for all those
people, it was also for my children because I have then to imagine
wha t happened to your dead or injured loved ones is one thing, to
       it is another, how must they feel, God only knows.

Please do some t h i n g .

I wis h  to protest   in the strongest possible  terms  about the
pictorial content of the tabloid papers of yesterday followinq the
awful tragedy at Hillsborough Stadium-

The  particular publication I bought was the Daily Mirror but I
could clearly see that almost all the tabloid papers were carryinq
the same pictures.

Many   of the clearly identifiable people in these tio$oufif pictures'
were   either dead or dying and I could not help reflecting on the
agony of the bereaved who would see these harrowing last scenes of
        friends or relatives who never returned from that    football
match.   Their minds m a y never be free of     those images,     the
distorted faces, the flesh pressed so hard against the fences that
paint from the wire was smeared on the skin-

Goodness knows what effect these images had on adults and children
who knew or    loved those who died- To use these pictures was
profoundly sick, prurient and unnecessary.

*         n°t   accept that it was in any way part of the    press's
obligation    to bring us the full horror of that day- The graphic
verbal descriptions of commentators, the accounts of survivors and
the   written accounts of the army of journalists meant that no-one
wit h  eyes   to see or ears to hear could have been in any doubt
about   the horrors of this awful event- To reduce this disaster to
an    incredibly    sick  "photo opportunity"   was  in   my    view
         able, and reduces yet again our popular press to the level
of the gutter.

    Dear Sirs

    Re:   Coverage of Hillsborough Tragedy

    It is not often that I am incensed by what is written and
    shown in the press-  However, this week I have bee n moved to
    tears over the pictures in the daily n e w s p a p e r s .

    I generally take the Daily Mirror but read at work the
    Guardian and the Times-        Today, I did not buy the Daily
    Mirror and will not be doing so again.               How this newspaper
    could have printed ^ j S u l t ^ f c ^ a r S ^ o f those poor people,
    particularly the children, I fail to understand.               I just hope
    that those responsible never, ever, have members of their own
    families facing this sort of grief-

    There must be something the Press Council can do to avoid
    these sort of pictures in the future.  I know some people
    would not have seen the harrowing pictures on the television
    and some press coverage was necessary but these pictures,
    particularly in the Daily Mirror have gone beyond normal
    reporting and human decency.  Please, please, stop this sort
    of coverage in the future.

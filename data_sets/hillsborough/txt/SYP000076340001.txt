Immediately              I knew there            was a serious             problem.        I have        been    in

                and myself              began to work              our way       to our    left    in an attempt               to

c o m f o r t e d him.           1 undid       his    shirt and told              him not to move,               He was

incoherent            and was        trying       to stand up,             but was       unable    to do so because

of some        injury that              I c o u l d n ’t     see,       possibly     in his      legs.       The

           at about          4,50        pm       (1620 h r s ) .        I had    left     the G r o u n d of my own ac c o r d

           via Pens 5 and                 6   .     At    no stage did           I see an y o n e        pilfering       or

                   I am currently working as a Senior House Officer in Anaesthetics. I qualified in Medicine in 1986,

                   and since August of 1988, I have been on the Trent Regional Health Authority anaesthetics

                   rotation.



                   At the time of the incident in question I was employed as an Anaesthetist at Rotherham District

                   General Hospital.



                   On the afternoon of Saturday April 15th. I was off duty. I returned home from walking the dog at

                   around 3.00 pm        I turned on the television to see crowd disturbance at the Hillsborough Football

                   Ground. The match appeared to have been abandoned, and the television coverage ceased. I

                   listened briefly to a local radio station, who were also reporting a disturbance at the ground



                   As l am familiar with the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield, I decided to make my way there

                   in case I could be of assistance in the event of casualties being received.



                   Due to the location of my house, I almost immediately encountered an ambulance, which I

                   assume was on its way to the ground.                                 It had its lights & siren on, and I followed immediately

                   behind it, with my headlights on.

              As it passed the Herries Rd. entrance, I turned off into the Northern General Hospital.



                  I entered the Accident & Emergency Department to be told that a Paediatric "cardiac arrest" was

                  expected (via Ambulance Control), and that there was an incident of some kind at the

                  Hillsborough stadium. No-one in the department was aware that these two pieces of information

                  were related.



                  The first casualty arrived within two or three minutes. I believe this patient to be a boy l know

                  only as "Lee", who I believe was declared "Brain dead" on the Intensive Care Unit (ITU) the

                  following Monday.



                  He was in Cardiopulmonary arrest, with fixed, dilated pupils. I intubated him, established venous

                  access, and instigated routine resuscitative measures.                 His heart had stopped beating, but we

                  managed to re-establish him in normal rhythm.



                  Whilst I and another doctor were treating Lee, the second victim arrived. He was of similar age

                  (around 1 2 - 1 4 years), with blond hair. He was also in Cardiopulmonary arrest. I intubated him.

                  and noticed evidence of gross inhalation of stomach contents.                  He also had marked gaseous

                  abdominal distension, possibly indicating that he had had ”mouth-to-mouth" resuscitation at some

                  time.



                  I also established venous access, and gave appropriate drugs. This boy was also established in

                   a normal sinus heart rtiythm, but his pupils were fixed and dilated throughout, and I believe he

                   has since died.



                   These two boys had taken up the space immediately available in the resuscitation area, and the

                   next patient I dealt with was in the A & E Department Theatre.

            This patient was aged around twenty, with fair hair, of slim build. He was cerebrally irritable, but

            not actually fitting.   I was able to intubate him without any drugs, and left him in the care of

            another doctor.



             I next saw another unconscious, cerebrally irritable patient, with shoulder-length brown hair, and

            aged around twenty.        I judged his airway to be adequate, and left him in the care of a non­

            medical member of staff.



             The next patient I dealt with was in Cardio-Pulmonary arrest.             He was aged around twenty, of

             stocky build, with ginger hair. I intubated him, and gave appropriate drugs down the endotracheal

             tube, as he did not have any venous access. I was assisted by a doctor of around my own age

            from the football ground     I never discovered his name.



             I resorted to a central venous line via the Right subclavian route in this patient. W e got his heart

             beating in a normal rhythm, and he was ventilated adequately.



             However, he re-arrested on two distinct occaisions. and developed bi2zare E.C.G. complexes,

             with a very poor output. At this stage I took the decision to abandon resuscitative measures on

             this patient.



             I next saw a patient of around forty, with thinning hair and of heavy buiid                    He was having

             Cardiopulmonary resuscitation from another doctor. 1 intubated the patient to help with this.



             1then was asked to see a boy of around fifteen with black hair, who had already had resuscitative

             treatment.      He was however fitting, and had a poor airway.                 I gave this boy appropriate

             anaesthetic drugs to sedate and paralyse him, intubated him, and transferred him to the I.T U                         I

             believe he has since made a good recovery

                    I then performed a virtually identical procedure on a boy of similar age with light brown hair.

                    I transferred him to the I.T.U. also. I do not know what has happened to this boy.



                    I was then briefly involved with a male of around thirty in the resuscitation room. He had already

                    had considerable effort put into his resuscitation, but was still asystolic (ie his heart was not

                    beating). I placed a central venous line on this patient. I believe resuscitative measures on this

                    patient were abandoned



                     . then went to Ward 60, and performed rapid sequence inductions and intubations on two

                     patients who had deteriorated neurologically. I transferred these patients to the Cardiac Intensive

                    Therapy Unit.



                     I later dealt with a female patient who came into the A & E department having "arrested". She

                     was not from the Hillsborough ground. She was transferred to the I.T.U.



                     This, I believe, covers the bulk of the work I did on the day of the disaster.



                     I left the Northern General hospital at around 9.00 p.m.



                                                                              E C Walker

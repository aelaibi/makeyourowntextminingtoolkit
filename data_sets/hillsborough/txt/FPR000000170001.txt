            Dear Colleague,

            Please find enclosed a further draft of the proposed paper on the Hillsborough
            Tragedy.

            The draft has been amended to include the Accident and Emergency response
            from the Hallamshire but also to remove the contribution from the Doctors
            on the ground, since the contributors felt that they did not wish it to
            appear that they were part of a co-ordinated response.

            I hope to see you all in the Accident and Emergency Department, Northern
            General Hospital at 12.30p.m. Friday 26th May.   Specifically, could I ask
            you to try and think of an appropriate ending to the article and also
            consider the draft letter of consent for publication, which I also enclose.

             Yours sincerely,

    Dear Frank,


    Thanks for the latest draft of the Hillsborough Paper.

    Please find enclosed the full diagram for the Accident and Emergency
    Department.    I have tried to simplify it as much as possible.   I
    also enclose the reference section.

    The final draft appears fine, apart from Page 9 in the paragraph
    regarding the Hallamshire.   The numbers don't tally with the
    diagram.   It should read'between 16.00 hours and 17.00 hours the
    department received 69 patients."

    Thanks once again for all your help.

    Yours sincerey,




    J. WARDROPE

    Dear Frank,

    Many thanks for the paper.

    I congratulate you on a very good final draft.    There is only one
    minor modification and that is on Page 20, regarding communication
    difficulties.     The Government has now published its recommendations
    and so I would re-word the last half of the paragraph from "We strongly"
    as follows -

    We strongly recommend that the standed coded phrase recommended in
    recent government guidelines preference) "Major Incident Plan Declared -
    Activate Plan" should be used to alert hospitals.      This task should
    be undertaken by the Ambulance Service and other emergency service
    communications to hospitals should, be relayed via the Ambulance Service.

    The reference is^Emergency Planning in the N.H.S:   Health services
    arrangements for dealing with Major Incidents   N.H.S. Management Executive
    1990.''

    Otherwise, I have no other comments to make, apart from, thank you
    once again for all your hard work.

    Yours sincerely,

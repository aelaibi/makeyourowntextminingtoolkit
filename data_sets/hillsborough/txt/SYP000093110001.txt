           of a problem at the gates



           We walked to the Leppings Lane stand via the perimeter track of the

           claying field adjacent to the cantilever stand.          As we approached the

      c^O.o*».
            stand at appro:-; 3.00 pm <1500)      I saw fans climbing over the perimeter

      fnO^'fence and onto the field.



           On closer inspection I saw that the fans inside the enclosure were

           being crushed against the fence




           when viewed from the pi ay i x y jf field.   1 also assisted fans   in climbing

           over the fence behind the goal.



           Access to the terrace was eventually gained by other officers

           managing to pull       part of the fence away and I went onto the terrace

           with other officers and he 1ped c a r r y    injured persons onto the playing
i n   J
           field to the waiting ambulances.          When the immediate emergency had

           passed,       1 assisted in clearing the terrace of remaining fans and

           debr i s .



           At 6 . 0 0 pm (1800)   the same date   I returned to West Bar Police Station

           and after de--briefing and counselling        1 went off duty at 8.00pm

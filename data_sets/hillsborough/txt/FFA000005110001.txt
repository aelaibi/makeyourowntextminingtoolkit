      FA Hillsborough

      I attach extracts of pages from the European conference on
      football violence.

      JGW is focusing on material that John Dyson could use to
      cross-examine witnesses in relation to the choice of Old Trafford
      as the semi-final venue and its effect on Liverpool.  There is
      some press speculation that Clough and Dagleish may be called and
      JGW feels there is always the chance that Robinson or Smith of
      Liverpool would be called.

   Please could you obtain copies of the two reports marked at the
   bottom of page 57 as soon as possible.  Could you also try and
   find out about the February 1986 aerosol attack on the Manchester
   United players at infield mentioned at page 53.   I do not recall
   seeing a disciplinary enquiry on this incident.

   With regard to the full set of statements I sent to you would it
   be possible for you now to arrange for those witnesses who have
   not signed them to sign the originals, take a copy for yourself,
   and send them back to me,

   Regards

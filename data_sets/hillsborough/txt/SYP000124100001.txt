 IF THE CROWD HAD NOT BEEN ALLOWED TO BUILD UP OUTSIDE,   IT WOULD NOT HAVE

 BEEN NECESSARY TO OPEN THE GATE, ALTHOUGH I DO NOT BLAME WHO OPENED THE

 GATE BECAUSE AS THE TIME IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO, BUT AS PENS 3   &   4 WERE

 ALREADY PACKED TO CAPACITY SOME ACTION SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE TO STOP THE FANS

 SWARMING INTO THE TUNNEL EITHER BY A LINE OF POLICE OR PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT.

     Dear Sir

     EVERTON F.C. -v- NORWICH CITY F.C.
     FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION COP S B C FINAL


     The above match as you know was played at Aston Villa Football Stadium on
     Saturday 15 April 1989, and I am writing to thank you for assisting with the
     distribution of literature and other information to the local media, in order
     that supporters could be made aware of the match day arrangements.

     Without cc-operation of this nature, I an; aware that the influx of visiting
     supporters together with the volume of coaches and cars into this area would
     cause even greater problems for the police to tackle. It was, therefore
     particularly helpful to have the support of the local police in this respect
     and I am most grateful to you for your assistance.


      Yours faithfully

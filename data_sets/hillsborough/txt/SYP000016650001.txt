Dear Sir,


     I enclose   for your information an anonymous letter recently received
at this Police   Station. The letter is clearly written by an elderly
person who wishes to express support to your Force and Division following
the unfortunate events at Hillsborough Football Stadium last weekend.
Although the letter is anonymous I thought it would assist you to know
that even as far away as Weston-super-Mare there are people who are very
supportive of you during these times of great difficulties.

     In writing may I say on behalf of my colleagues here at Weston-super-
Mare that we have everysympathy with the difficulties    facing your area
at the present   time and express our sincere support to you and all your
Officers during, what must be, a time of tremendous stress.    Unfortunately
the stress has been greatly increased by what can only be described as
'trial by media' and, hopefully, in due course you will be afforded every
opportunity for accurate accounts to be given at the Public Inquiry.


                              Yours faithfully




                            Chief Superintendent

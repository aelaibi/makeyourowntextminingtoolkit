ware     received            for    our    detail     to attend at the             ground to assist wit h a

serious         incident w hich was                taking      place.     We t r a velled         immediately

ar r i v 1nq at t he g r o und                at 3.35 p m .



On arrival            our     detail       was     instructed to         remain outside the            ground,

h owever        I was a l l o w e d        into    the ground as one of my sons                     had gone     to

the    game,      and        1 was       given    p ermission to try and find out                    if he was

alright.         I entered the              playing area           from the hjo 11 i n g h a m Fore s t end of

the    ground,         and saw           people    dead and        injured being          taken from the

g ro u n d .



Pe o p l e were a t t e m p t i n g              to leave    the   t e r r a c e s and enter the       playing

area,      via a gate w hich was                  not manned at this              time.



Due    to the         number        of    people alre a d y        involved        in the    rescue    ope r a t i o n

at this         time,        the    panic arid confusion w hich                   prevai led,      I felt   it

better         that    no more           people     should     be a l l o w e d    into    that    parti cular

are a of the           ground at           that     time,    and     I therefore          positioned m yself at

the    g a t e , allowing            only     people who were           nurses and a doctor              into the

area.        A number          of    bodies were           being     laid on the grass             in front      of

the N o t t i n g h a m Forest             e n d , and     I s u b s e q u e n 1 1y assis t e d with their

rem o v a l .



W hilst at this               location a number              of Liverpool           supporters       came   to that

area and         began argu i n g w ith N o t t i n g h a m Supporters,                     still    on the

terrace.         With other              of ifcers    1 spoke        to these       people and ushe red           them

away.



I. s u b s e q u e n t l y    had to       leave     the    ground as       our     detail    had been ordered.

back     to the Woodhall                  Serv i c e Area,      to    continue       our duties       t h ere.

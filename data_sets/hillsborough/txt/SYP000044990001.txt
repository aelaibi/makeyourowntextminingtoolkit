  Dear

  I enclose a card with the name and address of two persons who wish to give
  evidence in connection with events leading up to the tragedy at Hillsborough on
  15 April 1989.

  Both Mr and M r s ) p f e r e travelling from Manchester Airport on the M62 to
  their home, and wish to relate how they saw Liverpool supporters conducting
  themselves during the journey.

  I would be most grateful if you would kindly pursue this matter, please.

  Yours     //

 I enclose a card with the name and address of two persons who wish to give
 evidence in connection with events leading up to the tragedy at Hillsborough on
 15    April 1989.

 Both Mr and Mrs         were travelling from Manchester Airport on the M62 to
 their home, and wish to relate how they saw Liverpool supporters conducting
 themselves during the journey.

 I would be most grateful if you would kindly pursue this matter, please.

 Yours

 DRAWINGS OF SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB DRAWN BY GOODHALL

 Some time ago I mentioned to David Brummell that the Health and Safety
 Executive drawings prepared by Brades showed there were some anomalies on
 the police drawings prepared by Miss Dawn Goodhall of the West Midlands
 Police.  In view of the higher quality of Brades' drawings I suggested to
 him, and we agreed, that we would withdraw the police drawings totally.
 The benefits being that we did not want to get into a debate between Brades
 and Miss Goodhall as to who was right.  Whilst I understand the anomalies
 are not significant I still feel that we ought to be fully professional in
 this matter.

It was with some alarm today that I saw Andrew Collins, Q.C., Bernard
Phillips and Lord Justice Taylor, produce the original police drawings.
How are we going to get round this?  Should we withdraw the police drawings
completely?  Should we substitute or what?

I look forward to your early advice in this matter.

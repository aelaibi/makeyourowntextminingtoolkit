            mortuary,      this    task was       co fa n ® te«T in aborrtT^ID minutes.

            At ap pr ox i m a t e l y 3.4 3    pm the same                 day together with four              officers       from

            my unit     I went     in to the West St and                      itself where         it had been reported

            to me that a dis tur ban ce was                   taking          place.

            Once at that        location       I had a serious a l t er ca ti on with a drunke n man

            of about 28 years,            who was      thr eatening               violence        to myself & other

            spectators aro un d himself.               However              in view      of the    present

             circumstances        he was      not arrested,                 but was      ev ent ual ly dr agg ed from the

            stand by three         of his friends.

             I remained     in the West St and until                        the ma tch had been off ic ia ll y

            abandoned,      after wh ich my unit                  formed a mobile               public    order      patrol

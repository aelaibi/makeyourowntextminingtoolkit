We    left C o ve n tr y e n- ro ut e       to S h e f f ie l d at    1030 hours,         picking     up

various       supporters          at d if ferent       locations      t hroughout        the M id la nd s and

t r a v e l l e d N orth on the M1 m o t o r w a y to Sheffield.

T here were        no delays w ha ts o ev e r          until we got       near to S h e f f ie l d and            the

roads       then became          quite    c on gested wit h football           traffic.          We did not

s top on the           journey a rr iv i ng        in S h e f f i el d at about     1415 hours.             This

to tnbxj30lice re-routing                  the football         traffic a r ou n d S h e f f i e l d and

sea rc h i n g           jcoach,     we a r ri v ed at the       football      ground       later    than

usual.

The    coach parked a short                distance        from the    stadiuurri near          to a large

b re w e r y and       police     office rs       d i rected us w h i ch way to go.              On the      short

walk    to the         ground     I saw various         people     people     sitting a r ou n d      drinking

from    eajQS, but there was               no unruly b e ha vi ou r or d r u n k e n e s s .         It was a

very    good atntasphere.

ye a r ri v e d at       the l a p p i n g s Lane      t urnstiles at about             1425 h o u r s „     T hie r e

were    no queues,            there wSstj a        lot of people m i l l i ng a r ou n d out s id e              but

we    had no d if fi c ul t y gett in g            into the     ground.       We went       straight

t h ro ug h the        turnstiles        handing     in our tickets.           I can remember          two

never w i t n e s s ed a n y gates          being      opened    or saw any open gates.                Neither

did    I see any         illegal      e ntry      into the ground.

Once    inside         the gr ou nd      I recall     seeing     stewards      by the turnstiles.

T h e y were     just hanging around.                  I cartnqt     recall    seeing an y        police

officers.          I checked my ticket               in order      toXjnd      w hi ch entrance            to go

of the        stand almost            opposite       the    18 yard     line at the Spion Hop end of

the ground,              along with my son                    and several            others    from our       coach

party.         There was          no e xc essive        crowd    in my area,           but on looking

t owards       the L ep pi ng s Lane           standing a re a        1 saw that            it was    very full.

You     could see the             centre    pens swaying           in one motion.              Not    long after

we    took     up our seating             position the teams             came out           for a war m up as

they     n o r mally do.           I never       took much       notice        of the       crowd for       some    time

as    I was w a tc hi ng         the    teams.         S h or tl y a fter      kick    off one of the

L i v er p o o l    players      struck     the      crossbar and at was about                     this    time    that

my a t t e n t i o n was a g a in d rawn to the L e p pi n gs Lan e                     end.        I saw that

fans     were       climbing       over    the    front      perimeter         fence and were

c o ng r e g a t i n g    on the      pitch.      I initially thought                 the    fans were       out of

order and that                I was w i t ne s si n g a pitch         invasion.             I saw a       lot of

police        officers         line    up behind the goal are a as                    if to control          the

i nvas i o n .       I then saw fans             be i ng pulled up          into      the West S t a nd by

other      s u pporters and            I still       did not     realise        that a major          t r ag ed y was

u nf o l d i n g    in front       of me.        The    first    I knew that           serious       trouble       had

o c cu r e d was         seeing an a m b u l a n c e       drive along         the    touchline and          park

b ehind the goal               posts.      I then w i t n e s se d a young L iv erpool                    s upporter

w alk i n g    past me wit h what              was     o b vi ou sl y a b ro ke n arm.             I then saw a

y oung L i v erpool            s upporter      run towards         the N o t t i n g h a m end,

g e s t i c u l a t i n g with his        fist.        The Notts      fans were         chanting a buse at

him an d this             led to a lot of            police     o ff ic er s    being       d ep lo ye d along      the

half way           line to stop any more                crowd trouble.

At this        point         I saw more Liv er po ol          fans who had gone               past    the    line of

police        officers.          The y went       to the S p io n H o p fencing and began                     ripping

the a d v e r t i s i n g      h oardings      down and took          them to the opposite                  end to be

used as m a k es h if t          stretchers.            A few minu te s         after       this    I saw

supporters           carrying         injured fans and several                  fans    on s t re tc he rs who

              were     obv i ou sl y dead as their             faces were       covered by coats.        T hese

              bodies     were     taken and         placed near       to the     corner    of the S p i on Hop and

              N o r t h Stand.         The   injured fans were          placed on the        pitch d i r e ct l y    in

              front     of us and fans             together wit h St.       Johns Amb ul an ce      wo rk ed

              any deaths         nor    did    I assist with any of the              injured,     I cannot       say

              what     the     cause    of the deaths           or   injuries was.        I left the football

              g r o u n d at    1630    hours having heard a loud speaker a n n o u n c em e nt                stating

              the m a t c h was abandoned.

              I did     not witness a ny th i ng w hich              I w ould    consider    to be a criminal

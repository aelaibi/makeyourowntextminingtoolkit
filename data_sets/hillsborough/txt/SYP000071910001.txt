my    car w h i c h was             parked        two     streets            down          on the       r i g ht    off L e p p i n g s

Lane,       I don't           know    the       na m e    of     the        road.

There      were        barriers           across         the     t op       of    the            r o ad in w h i c h m y car          was

parked with a                 policeman           guarding             it,       t h is     r oa d w a s      approximately                200-

300      yards      away       from       the     Leppings             Lane       entrance.

The      policeman asked                  me w h a t          all      the       c o m m o t i o n w as       about       at    the

football         grounds            and     I said        that         I had          just       seen dead          bodies.           The

p o l i c e m a n wa s        really        shocked           because            he    d i d n ’t h a ve        any     idea.         He       then

moved      the      barrier          so     t ha t      I could move                  my    car a n d      I came         home.

I ■r e g u l a r l y     go    to    the       British Railway                    Staff          Association Club which                          is

in F a r m R o a d , S h e f f i e l d .

Since       the H i l l s b o r o u g h         disaster            there         has         b e e n a lot of t a l k a b o u t

what      happened            in the        grounds           on t h at          day.

One      thing      that       I have          heard      is     that        the       train        bringing          the      Liverpool

supporters,              at    some       stage         between Liverpool                        and Sheffield               there        wa s    a

d e r a i 1 in f r o n t        of    it a n d          from what            I can          gather        was      probaly       delayed

for      about      thirty minutes,                     meaning         that          the    Liverpool             fans      were     late

arriving         at      the W a d s 1 ey B r i d g e            Train Station.                        Also     I ’ve     heard       that

the      fans    were         further          delayed         by the            police          when     they a rrived              at    the

train       station.

I ’ve     also      heard       and       I'm     not     able         to    g iv e        any/fiames         as    I d o n ’t k n o w

any      nam e s,      but     some       of    the      turnstile               operators             were     frightened            to

death       by    the     volume          of     people        and      t h e y / j ust          put    their       f oo t     down       on

the      pedal      to    open       the       t u r n s t i 1 e s - a m r just             let     the    fans       r u s h t h ro u gh ,

I heard          that     they       di d      t h is    to    try a n d          stop       supporters             being       injured

             o u t s i d e r I also   heard   t h at   they were   jumping   the   turnstiles   anyway.

    Dear Mr Moneypenny,


                                               HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

                 Thank you for your letter of 12th December.

           Those at The Football Association to whom I have spoken
     found the "Hillsborough" programme powerful and moving, as I
     did.

           My own strong feelings of sympathy for those affected by
     the disaster are shared by everyone at The Football
     Association.

           Your letter and attached minutes refer to "new and unused
     evidence about the disaster which has emerged as a result of
     the research undertaken for the programme". The Football
     Association has not been privy to any of this information.

           I am sure you will appreciate that, in the absence of
     details of the information and of the wider campaign for
     justice for the families to be launched on the basis of that
     information, I could not formally commit the support of The
     Football Association.


                                                    Yours sincerely

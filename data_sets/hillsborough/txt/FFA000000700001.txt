TO:    FOOTBALL LEAGUE CLUBS


Dear Sirs
                                           Crowd Disorder
     Our records show that in the past five Seasons reports
received concerning incidents of crowd disorder within
Football Grounds have shown a welcome decrease, and this
trend is in no small way due to the efforts made by the
Clubs themselves.
     Sadly, however, serious cases continue to occur from
time to time, and it is noticeable that in some of the worst
instances visiting supporters have tended to be very much
involved. Bearing this in mind, we would, therefore, take
this opportunity to remind Clubs of the provisions of F.A.
Rule 31(a)(i), which states:-

      "Every Association and Club is responsible to the
       Council for the conduct of its Players, Officials,
       Spectators and Supporters. The visiting Club shall
       be responsible to the Council for the conduct of
       its Supporters."

     Whether your Club is involved in a Batch played at
"home" or "away" we trust we can continue to rely on your
co-operation in efforts to overcone this particular problem.
                                                                  Yours faithfully




                                                                  E.A. Croker

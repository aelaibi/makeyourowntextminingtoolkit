   On 7 June 1990, Belinda Norcliffe of Hamnond Suddards Solicitors
   requested copies of written Police orders and other Police documents used
   in the training of Probationer Constables in so far as relates to sudden
   deaths.

   The following copy documents have been    selected;

   1.   Standing Order 17a - relating to Police action in respect of sudden
        deaths, together with a forward to those orders.

   2.   Section 11 frcrn the Major IncidentManual - relating to fatalities.

   3.   Section 21 frcro the Major IncidentManual - relating to fatalities.

   4.   Section 22 frcm the Major IncidentManual - relating to mortuary
        liaison officers.

   5.   Student lesson notes (prior to June 1989) - relating to sudden
        deaths.

   6.   Student lesson notes (after June 1989) - relating to sudden deaths.

   7.   Chapter 3 fran the 'Manual of Guidance' - relating to coroners.

   I have ascertained there are no general written instructions within our
   Force Training Department which outlines how the subject of 'Sudden
   Death' is to be introduced. It is normally brought out in general group
   discussion and in practical exercises.

  I request these copy documents be forwarded to Belinda Norcliffe and in

Dear Mrs Norcliffe
I refer to your telephone conversation with our Detective Inspector Cleverley
on the subject of the South Yorkshire Police guidelines on instructing
Probationer Constables the subject of 'sudden death.'

Hie following copy documents have been obtained;

1.   Standing Order 17a - relating to Police action in respect of sudden
     deaths, together with a forward to those orders.

2.   Section11 from the Major Incident Manual —    relating to fatalities.

3.   Section 21 from the Major Incident Manual -   relating to fatalities.

4.    Section22 from the Major Incident Manual —   relating to Mortuary
     Liaison Officers.

5.   Student lesson notes (prior to June 1989) -   relating to sudden deaths.

6.   Student lesson notes (after June 1989) - relating to sudden deaths.

7.   Chapter 3 from the ’Manual of Guidance' - relating to coroners.

The Major Incident Manual is for the reference of supervisory officers and
will not normally be viewed by Probationer Constables.

There are no general written instructions within our Force Training
Department which outlines how the subject of 'Sudden Death| is to be
introduced. It is normally brought cut in general group discussion and in
practical exercises covering a variety of subjects.

 Student lesson notes are issued to Probationer Constables and are used during
 their training.




                               Chief Superintendent Wain
The Manual of Guidance is an extensive volume which assembles all aspects of
law and procedure and is primarily used by officers to prepare for Police
qualifying examinations for the rank of Sergeant and Inspector. There are no
requirements for Probationer Constables to possess this manual which is
purchased at the officers own expense.

Yours sincerely

          Dear Mrs Norcliffe

          I refer to your telephone conversation with our Detective Inspector Cleverley
          on the subject of the South Yorkshire Police guidelines on instructing
          Probationer Constables the subject of 'sudden death.'

          The following copy documents have been obtained;

          1.    Standing Order 17a - relating to Police action in respect of sudden
                deaths, together with a forward to those orders.

          2.    Section 11 from the Major Incident Manual -                 relating to fatalities.

          3.    Section 21 fran the Major Incident Manual -                 relating to fatalities.

          4.   Section 22 fran the Major Incident Manual -                  relating to Mortuary
               Liaison Officers.

          5.    Student lesson notes (prior to June 1989) -                 relating to sudden deaths.

          6.    Student lesson notes (after June 1989) - relating to sudden deaths.

          7.   Chapter 3 fran the 'Manual of Guidance' - relating to coroners.

         The Major Incident Manual is for the reference of supervisory officers and
         will not normally be viewed by Probationer Constables.

         There are no general written instructions within our Force Training
         Department which outlines how the subject of 'Sudden Death' is to be
         introduced. It is normally brought out in general group discussion and in
         practical exercises covering a variety of subjects.

         Student lesson notes are issued to Probationer Constables and are used during
         their training.




 The officer dealing with this correspondence is   .Chief. .Superintendent .Wain....    Extension

 ADM/3
The Manual of Guidance is an extensive volume which assembles all aspects of
law and ^procedure and is primarily used by officers to prepare for Police
qualifying examinations for the rank of Sergeant and Inspector. There are no
requirements for Probationer Constables to possess this manual which is
purchased at the officers own expense.

Yours sincerely

INSTRUCTION CARD - FATALITIES

The officer in charge of duties relating to the dead should consult the section of the Major           XR287
Incident Scheme Manual 'Fatalities'. He should ensure that a reconnaissance is made of the site to
obtain information as to how many dead bodies are involved, their whereabouts and whether any
special problems arise because of dismemberment, contamination, etc. If necessary, this officer
will get Force Operations Room to send Police Surgeons to the scene. When an accurate overall
assessment of the problems has been made details should be given to the Site Commander.

The Site Commander will consult with the Coroner and Force Operations Room as to what
arrangements should be made with regard to bodies and parts of bodies at the site. Circumstances
will indicate whether they should be left in situ pending necessary viewing by a pathologist as
part of the investigation. When it is decided that the bodies should be removed whether from the
site or to a central point prior to being moved elsewhere, they will first be labelled, photographed
and their position, condition and location recorded in accordance with the procedure set out
below.

The 'body book' contained in the major incident box will be used in connection with this task.         XR 288

A plan of the site should be prepared.

Sufficient stocks of books, labels, string, bags, stretchers, markers, hammers, stakes, etc. should
be obtained.

Selected officers will be formed into one or more teams equipped with protective clothing. A
photographer should accompany each team.

One senior officer in charge will alone be responsible for allocating a number for each body or
part found at the site and recording its position on the site plan. The team will label the body and
related property and mark the location before taking the necessary action to remove it to await
transportation from the site.

A senior officer will be responsible to the Site Commander for transport arrangements and will         XR 283
obtain confirmation from Force Operations Room that the proposed destination is suitable
before authorising removal of each body from the site. Transport will be arranged via Operations
Room and where practicable a police officer will accompany any such vehicle from the site to the
mortuary accommodation.

                                               FATALITIES

 GENERAL PRINCIPLES

 Dealing with fatalities is a second priority to be considered after the protection and preservation            XR 333
 of the living. If it is practicable, it is in the interests of proper investigation and identification that
 dead bodies and parts should be disturbed as little as possible in the first stage of attending to the
 incident. This is especially important when the incident is an air crash. Whatever the incident
 much time and trouble ean be saved if all matters relating to the dead are dealt with methodically
 and carefully. HM Coroner and his staff are responsible for dealing with the dead and everything
 possible should be done to enable them to carry out their tasks as normally as possible, in accor­
 dance with the usual procedures. They have been asked to contact Operations Room should they
 require any type of assistance.

 HM CORONER

Where a major incident occurs involving a large number of victims the Coroner for the area and                  XR 334
his staff will be informed by Operations Room as soon as possible. A list of personnel to be called
is maintained at Operations Room.

The Coroner will inform Operations Room as to what premises he intends to use and if necessary
will send a representative to liaise with the police commander at the site of the incident.

TEMPORARY MORTUARY ARRANGEMENTS

There is no need for the police to obtain the approval of the Coroner regarding arrangements for
the temporary accommodation of bodies at the site. Should it be necessary to set up temporary
mortuary accommodation of a more permanent nature consultation will take place with the
Coroner for the necessary arrangements to be made.

It is essential that premises used as temporary mortuaries should have good access from the road               XR 335
and ideally should be such as to enable a vehicle to be driven into the building and away from
public view. A telephone is essential but if necessary a telephone can be quickly installed by
arrangement through Operation Room. Emergency lighting can be arranged if required.

It is important that a 'waiting area' should exist, with telephone, toilet facilities, etc., separate,
but not too distant from the mortuary. It is to this area that relatives will be directed! Members
of the public will not be directed to, nor permitted to attend at temporary mortuaries.

As far as possible, temporary mortuaries and premises used for post mortems, etc., will be staffed
by members of HM Coroners' Departments, supported by additional personnel as necessary.
Arrangements for personnel to staff mortuaries will be done through Operations Room. Mortuary
personnel will be responsible for searching and preparing bodies, documentation, etc. Stocks of
identification forms, casualty record forms, etc., are kept at HM Coroners' offices.

Supplies of clothing and equipment suitable for use in connection with temporary mortuaries are                XR336
held at all Coroners' offices in the area. Supplies of rubber gloves, sheeting, coffins, etc., can be
obtained when required via Operations Room.

Separate instructions for personnel working at mortuaries have been prepared and copies are
available at all Coroners' offices in South Yorkshire.
                                                                                           SECTION 21

                                                                                                  Pags2

   UNDERTAKERS

  It will be the responsibility of Operations Room to arrange for undertakers to assist in the trans­      XR 336
  port of bodies from the site to mortuary accommodation, should such service be appropriate. It
  is desirable that bodies should be accompanied by a police officer, but circumstances may make
  this impossible.

  The Coroner may request Operations Room to arrange for th e assistance of undertakers to
  provide accommodation, personnel or transport.

  J H Kenyon Ltd are a firm of international undertakers able to attend the scene of a major              XR 337
  incident in less than four hours. Further information concerning this firm is given at Appendix
   A . In consultation with HM Coroners and the police, the firm will deal with all matters relating
  to the dead, including the removal of bodies, identification, the return of property to relatives
  funeral arrangements, etc. The firm is retained by all the large civil aviation companies and will
  deal with all air disasters involving those companies. Clearly the firm's expertise would be
  invaluable in dealing with any type of incident where there are particular difficulties or the
  number of fatalities is large.

  HM Coroners for South Yorkshire have agreed that the police should call upon the services of this       XR 338
 firm if the circumstances of the incident justify this course. In the event of such a major incident
 occurring the officer in charge of Operations Room, after consulting with the Site Commander
 will be responsible for asking the firm to attend. It must be stressed that HM Coroner or his rep!
 resentative must be consulted before this action is taken unless undue delay is likely to be
 occasioned In cases of doubt, however, J H Kenyon Ltd should be called even without prior con­
 sent from HM Coroner, since the firm have stated that they will attend a major incident even
 though their services may ultimately not be used and that having arrived they will consult with
 the Coroner prior to taking any action.

 LABELLING OF BODIES AT SITE

 Bodies and parts of bodies should not be removed without first being labelled and the position in        XR339

  PERSONAL ITEMS FOUND WITH BODY AT THE SITE

  Bodies should not be searched. It may be feasible to enwrap the body completely in plastic
                                                                                                          XR 340
  sheeting or in a plastic bag or place it in a coffin before removal and thus keep all personal items
  and effects together with the body to which they belong.

  An item of personal property (eg a handbag) found lying near a body, should not be assumed to
  belong to that body. Such property should be secured in a bag labelled 'Found near body
  ,abeMed......................... '• This property will go with the body.

  Larger items of property such as luggage will not go with the body but after labelling will be dealt
  with as detained property (see instruction card 'Lost and Found Property Office'.)

  DOCUMENTATION OF BODIES FOUND AT THE SITE

  All bodies and parte of bodies should be labelled as set out above. All bodies should be made the
                                                                                                         XR341
  subject of a casualty record form', books of which are contained in the major incident boxes
  This applies to bodies which are incomplete but does not apply to parts. In cases of doubt a
   casualty record form should be completed. As far as possible a 'casualty record form' should be
  completed at the mortuary accommodation as the body is being dealt with there. Property and
  effects may give valuable information as to identity.

 Where circumstances indicate that it is desirable to complete a 'casualty record form’ before a
 _                 to mor,uarv accomm°dation this should be done but the body should not be
 searched. All 'casualty record forms' should include the body label number and any oth.™
 reference to the body, and details forwarded to the Casualty Enquiry Bureau.

 REMOVAL OF BODIES FROM SITE TO MORTUARY ACCOMMODATION

 When it is necessary to move bodies from the site, they will be taken to the local mortuary or to       XR342
 a temporary mortuary. Where possible bodies should be accompanied by a police officer but
 circumstances may make this impossible.                                                         1


 At the request of the Site Commander, Operations Room will make the necessary arrangements

    SPECIAL MORTUARY ARRANGEMENTS

    Where large numbers of bodies are involved, or where investigation or identification is likely to be   XR343
    difficult or protracted, it may be that the refrigerated accommodation which is normally
    available at mortuaries, hospitals or undertakers' establishments is insufficient. The Coroner will
    make whatever arrangements are necessary regarding such accommodation and preservation.

                                            FATALITIES

 J H KENYON LIMITED, FUNERAL DIRECTORS

 This Company, who act on behalf of all major British Airlines and several foreign Airlines, have       XR347
 proved to be invaluable at the scene of major air disasters. They work closely with the path­
 ological team, and their wide experience dating from the R38 airship disaster has enabled them to
 perfect their procedures.

 The Company is based at 83 Westbourne Grove, London W2 4UI. Telephone 01-229—3810.
 Telex number 265846.

 They will arrive quickly at the scene with a field team, having been informed by the airline
 involved, and should have with them a written authority to act on behalf of the airline to deal
 with funeral arrangements and with any property handed over to them. The field team normally
 consists of five members, but where the total number of casualties exceeds fifty an additional
 tw o members are attached.

 Amongst the major problems facing Police at the scene of an air disaster are those related to          XR 348
 property, identification, and the disposal of the bodies. Kenyon's procedure is divided into five
 main operations:

      1      recovery of the remains;
      2      identification;
      3      arrangements for disposal;
      4      removal to the place of disposal, and finallydisposal by burial or cremation;
      5      recovery, renovation, cleaning and identification of personal and other effects.

So far as the recovery of the remains is concerned, Kenyon's are well aware that this will
normally be carried out by the local Police and Ambulance Services who will remove bodies to a
mortuary, but they stress that every effort should be made to prevent personal effects and
clothing being moved from the bodies prior to the arrival of the investigation team. Kenyon's
staff are aware that permission must be obtained from the local Coroner and the Police before
any examination can be carried out.

IDENTIFICATION OF THE REMAINS

Much distress can be caused to relatives by delay in the identificaiton of the bodies of the
victims, particularly where bodies are badly mutilated, and in nearly all cases even in relatives are
available to view the remains, it is undesirable. However, relatives and friends who do travel to
the site will be dealt with very tactfully by Kenyon's field team, who base their identification on
tne following:

     (a)    dental;
     (b)    documents;
     (c)    clothing;
     (d)    jewellery;
     (e)    physical;
     (f)    photographs;
     (g)    fingerprints.
                                                                                      SECTION 21

                                                                                    APPENDIX 'A'

                                                                                             Page 2


ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE DISPOSAL OF THE REMAINS

Although Kenyon's are primarily Funeral Directors, they will make arrangements with relatives         XR3S0
who wish to use their own Funeral Directors, but as a first step 150 metallic lined coffins are
always held in readiness by Kenyon's in London and Birmingham for immediate despatch to the
scene of the accident.

 REMOVAL TO THE PLACE OF DISPOSAL

This is dealt with entirely by Kenyon's after a meeting with the local Coroner.

RECOVERY, RENOVATION. CLEANING AND IDENTIFICATION OF PERSONAL AND
OTHER EFFECTS

Before leaving the scene of operations, Kenyon's obtain possession of all personal effects            XR 351
removed from the bodies, or salvaged from the wreckage, where this is property of a non-
contentious nature. (Non-contentious in the sense that matters related to HM Customs or
suspected crimes do not arise.) This relieves the Police of the task of retaining and disposing of
property, and dealing with the heavy bolume of correspondence in connection with the same.

In the matter of identification, Kenyon's field team quite often know the pathologists concerned,
and the field team are equipped with forms which assist in obtaining medical or dental evidence.
It is advisable at an early stage to have a meeting between the Police Officer in charge of the
incident, a member of Kenyon's field team, the pathologist, and HM Coroner, in order that
arrangements for the disposal of the remains can be made.

From the foregoing it will be seen that the arrival of the Company at the scene of an air disaster,   XR3S2
to act on behalf of the affected Airline, can result in the relieving of the Police from many
otherwise burdensome tasks. However, it must be stressed that this does not remove from the
Police the task of making initial arrangements relating to the safeguarding, labelling and preser­
vation of bodies and property, providing temporary mortuaries, and having available property
lists for HM Customs and Excise.

It Is advisable to have a Police Officer of supervisory rank available to liaise with Kenyon's
representative throughout the incident. Kenyon's are well aware of the need to maintain a close
and friendly relationship with the local Medical/Legal and Police Authorities and naturally they
will require advice in localities where they have not previously worked.

                                    MORTUARY LIAISON OFFICERS

    In the event of a Major Incident occurring which justifies the establishment of the Casualty            XR354
    Enquiry Bureau and which involves many dead persons, arrangements have been made with the
    coroners for the areas of South Yorkshire that a police sergeant will go to each mortuary
    receiving bodies and there report to the coroner's officer. (Separate arrangements have been made
    with regard to hospital mortuaries, which will be the responsibility of the Hospital Liaison
    Officer).

    Kept at each coroner's office is a reserve of necessary equipment which includes a wallet con­
    taining casualty record forms, deceased person's property forms and a copy of this Section of the
    manual.

    The Mortuary Liaison Officer will consult with the Coroner and Coroner's Officer to establish the
    number of additional police personnel necessary to attend to carry out the police tasks at the
    mortuary. He will inform Force Operations Room, who will make the necessary arrangements for
    staff to attend. He should also indicate to Operations Room any items of equipment needed and
    they will make the necessary arrangements.

     It is intended that the Coroner's staff and the police staff should work together dealing with each   XR 355
    body in turn. The Coroner's staff will strip, search and otherwise deal with the body A police
    officer will complete a casualty record form in respect of all bodies. This applies to bodies which
    are incomplete, but does not apply to parts. However, in cases of doubt a casualty record form
    should be completed. The mortuary staff will be completing their own records which will
    necessarily contain specialist details of medical or forensic importance. The casualty record form
    should not include such details but should contain information which may enable identification
    to be established.

    Depending on the circumstances, it has been found of great benefit in previous major incidents to
    assisgn an individual police officer to each body. In this case the teams would attend at the
    mortuary and an officer would be allocated a body to try and establish its identity.

The officer would familiarise himself with the body and any property on or with it He would                XR356
accompany the body through the post mortem stage, gathering further information. That officer
would then liaise closely with the Casualty Enquiry Bureau in an effort to complete identific-
at ion.

It is appreciated that it Is not always practicable to follow this procedure and the decision to do
so will lie with the Mortuary Liaison Officer is to transmit the details from the comoleted

  Sudden Death


  Sudden Death -PoliceAction

  1 When dealing with a sudden death a police officer should always consider the
  possibilitythatthe person may be stillalive. Ifthere isany doubt he should:
  (a) Render firstaid.
  (b) Call adoctor.
  (c) Call an ambulance.

 2 Ifthe person isapparently dead a doctor must confirm thatdeath has occurred.

 3 At the same time that the doctor confirms death, itmay be possible, because of
 the immediate past medical history of the deceased; that the doctor isprepared to
 issue a certificateon which he will state the medical cause of the death. When the
 doctor isunable to issue a certificate as to the cause ofdeath, a policeofficershould
 take the following action:
  (a) Inform radio control so that the Coroner’s Officer and supervising officercan

INTRODUCTION

“Sudden death* is a police term for any death which involves the necessity for
some form of police action. It may not be 'sudden' at all, in that the deceased
may have been ill for some time, but because of circumstances, e.g. an elderly
person living alone, who has not been seen by a doctor for months, some enquiry
is necessary.

More seriously, there are some occasions where the circumstances suggest that
perhaps the death was not as ‘natural’ or ‘accidental* as it first appears.

It follows that you, as police officers, have an exacting job to do when confronted
with a 'sudden death".

In dealing with emotional matters you will need to use a whole range of skills and
abilities, always remember that carrying out your duty in a caring, sympathetic
and professional manner will help those who are distressed.

The best way to consider how people will expect you to act is to imagine yourself
as being in their situation.
 Sudden Death                                                                   F4/2




 How would you feel?

 How would you expect a police officer to behave?

 How would you want to be treated?

 Task    Before you continue to read you should now write down on a separate
         piece of paper your answers to these questions. We will return to them
         later.

 Ifyou can understand things from the other’s point of view and can act accordingly,
 ypu will be well on the way to being able to communicate with them.

 In most traumatic situations people will look to you to take the lead. This does
 not mean that you have to be aggressive or authoritarian, in fact it means rather
 the reverse. You will be expected to advise, understand and deal with matters
 which will call upon all your knowledge and skill, but always in a considerate and
 caring manner.

Investigating skills are most important when dealing with sudden death. For
 instance, a person may be found dead in the kitchen of his or her home and on
first examination it may appear that head injuries have been sustained. Obviously
in such circumstances the death needs to be treated as suspicious. All evidence
needs to be examined closely and you will need the advice of your supervisors
and probably specialist advice from C.I.D. and Scenes of Crime Officers. It may,
however, transpire that the deceased died from a heart attack and sustained the
head injuries on falling after death. However, only detailed and systematic
investigation will determine this.



POLICE ACTION

When dealing with sudden death as with many other aspects of police work:-

You should be able to act correctly whether the death be suspicious or non
suspicious.

You should be sympathetic, professional and display a degree of leadership
which will be a source of inspiration to others.

You should be extremely careful when dealing with property.

You should endeavour to ensure that you are aware of all the facts so that you
can be in a position to help those empowered to decide on the cause of death.
 Sudden Death                                                                 F4/3




 You should be able to recognise and collect evidence and produce a report which
 will be a clear and concise record of what has occurred.

 We will now look at the main areas to be covered in sudden death.

 You have all seen T.V. dramas where the ‘cop’, after the briefest examination
 confidently states, 'H e’s dead!'

 Now one of your 'primary objectives’ is the protection of life. That means doing
 all you can to keep a person alive when there is the faintest chance, and NOT
 EVEN ASSUMING DEATH if there is no response to resuscitation.

THE ONLY PERSON QUALIFIED TO STATE ‘HE IS DEAD’ IS A DOCTOR.

Perhaps your first sudden death may be a collapse in the street, or a busy store
or at the scene of a road traffic accident.

After giving such First Aid as you can, you must have the person seen by a doctor
as a matter of great urgency.

If in a public place, it may be quicker to have the person removed to hospital by
ambulance for emergency treatment, especially in accident cases.



IS THE DEATH SUSPICIOUS?

It may be contradictory to tell you on the one hand not to assume death, and on
the other to decide whether the death is suspicious.

The point is that in some cases the person may have been dead for a long time
and in others he may be badly mutilated.

Even then you cannot officially' assume death, but it will make your action more
clear-cut.

Once a doctor has confirmed death, he will indicate whether or not he is prepared
to issue a death certificate on which he will state the cause of death.

In many cases, particularly those which occur in a persons home, the doctor may
have been treating the deceased for some time. In such cases the doctor will,
most probably, be prepared to issue a death certificate based on his knowledge
of the deceased’s recent medical history.
 Sudden Death                                                                  F4/4




 In cases when a doctor issues a death certificate, the police involvement with the
 death has officially ended.

 You should, however, remember that the death will have caused much upset and
 distress to relatives, friends and people closely connected. Such people will look
 to you for advice on what to do next. You should tell them that they may now
 make arrangements with a funeral director for removal of the body and eventual
 funeral, and offer some assistance in doing this, if they require it.

 Don’t forget that in their distress, you may be their only means of advice and
 support.

 PUTYOURSELF IN THEIR POSITION. WHAT WOULD YOU WANT ATTHIS TIME?

 Obviously, in some cases the doctor may never have treated the deceased or he
 may not be able to tell the cause of death with any degree of certainty. In such
 cases you will need to take the following course of action:-

First inform your control of the situation, so that supervisory officers and or the
Coroners Officer can be informed and be aware of what you are dealing with.

In many cases, relatives or friends of the deceased may be present and in such
cases you should find the process of identification relatively easy. Remember,
be considerate and sympathetic in your questioning since your questions are
most likely to cause emotional reactions.

There is nothing more embarrassing to you, nor more upsetting to relatives/friends
than to have to keep re-visiting to ask questions which should and could have
been covered at an initial stage.

To help you ask the correct questions and make observations for your report, the
more essential details are shown below:-

(a) Name, address and date of birth of the deceased.

(b) Time, day, date and place of death of the deceased.

(c) Identity of person who found the deceased, together with information as to
    how, when and where the body was found.

(d) Identity of person who identified the deceased, together with life and medical
    history of the deceased, (if known), and the name of the deceased person’s
    doctor.
 Sudden Death                                                                  F4/5




 (e) Identity of the person who last saw the deceased alive, and information as to
     when and where deceased was last seen, together with observations as to
     medical condition, complaint of feeling unwell etc.

(0 Evidence of neglect, particularly in the case of children.

(g) Marks on the body.

(h) Identity of the doctor confirming death.

(i) Identity of others who can give useful information.

(j) Place where body now lies.

Obviously, once the details have been obtained and the body examined in situ it
will, at some stage, have to be removed to a mortuary. Whilst you will receive
advice from force supervisors on when and how this should be done, you should
be aware that evidence of continuity should take place in regard to the body.

By continuity, we simply mean the process which links together and forms a chain
of identification, so that the body which is identified to you is in turn identified
eventually to the pathologist who will carry out a post mortem examination.
Remember, the body you are concerned with will not be the only one in the
mortuary, so the pathologist needs to know the identity of each one with absolute
certainty.

In some cases, identification of the deceased may not be so simple. In cases
where a person has collapsed and died in the street or a body has been removed
from water, difficulty may be experienced in establishing identity. Whilst every
assistance will be given to you by supervisors, you should remember that an
accurate description will be of utmost importance.

Whenever you deal with a sudden death, it is most important that you safeguard
the deceased’s property. This will involve taking possession of property when
the death occurs away from home, as well as taking care of property when the
person dies in their own home and no relatives are present. Obviously, if relations
are present when you arrive, then you can hand over responsibility for the property
to them, but in cases where they are not present, it is advisable to have an
independent person or other police officer present to check any property you
handle. Always be aware that some relatives believe that there is a hoard of
money or valuables in the house. When they are not found it would be easy to
blame persons who have been in the house after death, this includes you.

Personal items of property, such as cash, jewellery, etc. should be seized and
listed in your pocket note book with the list countersigned by the person who
checked them with you. These items should be recorded in the property register
at your police station and stored pending their eventual return to relatives.
Sudden Death                                                                   F4/6




SUICIDE

Suicide is not a criminal offence. At the same time, such deaths have serious
implications.

There is always the possibility of a disguised homicide - murder or manslaughter,
and there is also an offence of aiding and abetting another to commit suicide.



Police Action

Whilst your ‘initial’ action is the sam e as for a sudden death, bear in mind the
following:

(a) Ensure your own safety where electrical, mechanical or other potentially
    dangerous agents have been used to commit suicide.

    THEN

(b) Look for and, if possible, take possession of the means employed.

(c) When death has occurred by hanging, take care to preserve the knot in the
    noose when the victim is removed.

Take possession of any letter left by the deceased - if sealed, it should not be
opened.

You will hand all articles and letters to your supervising officer, as they may be
required as evidence in a Coroners’ Court.

As we have already seen, sudden deaths require you to exercise tact, considera­
tion and a sympathetic approach. Cases of suicide may call for the utmost use
of these skills, since in many cases there has been no indication that the deceased
intended to take his or her own life.

REMEMBER, TRY TO UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE FEEL AND TRY TO TREAT
THEM IN THE SAME WAYTHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE TREATED.
Sudden Death                                                                       F4/7




THE CORONER AND THE CORONERS COURT

When police officers investigate sudden death, they are in fact collecting evidence
on behalf of Her Majesty’s Coroner.

The Coroner is a person with legal qualifications and sometimes a legally qualified
medical practitioner. He is empowered to order post mortem examinations on
dead bodies and, where necessary, to preside over inquests.

Whenever a doctor is unable to issue a certificate as to the cause of death, it is
the duty of the coroner of the district where the death took place to enquire into
that death, by way of a hearing called an 'inquest'. If you have been involved in
a sudden death, the cause of which is unknown, or a violent death, or unnatural
death, then you may be called upon to give evidence at a Coroner’s Court.

In cases where no death certificate has been issued, it will be necessary for the
Coroner to be informed. Whilst this function may be carried out by control room
staff on your behalf, it is essential that you are able to supply them with full details
so that the Coroner can come to a decision and issue his instructions as to what
course of action he wants taking.

In some forces, a person is designated to be a Coroners Officer, he is usually a
police officer and, most likely, a constable or sergeant, however, in some forces
civilians carry out this role. Coroners Officers assist the Coroner in the investiga­
tion of sudden deaths. In other forces, every member of the force has to act as
Coroners Officer when circumstances dictate, since no specific Coroners Officers
are designated.

The fact that your force may have a Coroners Officer does not automatically mean
that you will not have to deal with sudden death. Whilst the Coroners Officer may
give assistance to you, it should be remembered that you are likely to be the first
officer at the scene and, as such, your actions, attitude and professionalism are
of the utmost importance.

Before continuing further, look at the task set on the first page of these notes and
consider what points you noted regarding your:-

Feelings.

How you would expect a Police Officer to behave.

How you would want to be treated.
  Sudden Death                                                                   F4/8




  Whilst your feelings are essentially personal, they will no doubt link to the other
  two questions, in that you would expect to be treated in a caring, sympathetic
  manner. You would probably expect to be questioned, but in a considerate way,
  not bombarded with insensitive questions. You would no doubt look to the police
  officer for advice and help, since he is often regarded as having more experience
  in these matters.

 Possibly, you came up with other answers, if they were positive then, good. There
 is nothing to say that the answers given above are the only ones, they merely
 form a basis for the professional officer. It is, however, important to realise that
 your attitude and actions have a great effect on others, particularly when thev are
 under stress.



 INFORMING RELATIONS OR FRIENDS OF A DEATH

 The subjects discussed in the last two paragraphs are equally important in this
 aspect of police work, since it will almost certainly become your task, at some
 time, to give the sad news to the husband or wife, son or daughter, mother or
 father or perhaps a close friend, of a person who has just died.

 The first simple rule is that such news MUST be passed IN PERSON never bv
 telephone.                                                              J


 REMEMBER:- Treat others as you would wish to be treated in similar circum­
 stances.

 OBTAIN ALL THE INFORMATION YOU CAN BEFORE CALLING.

 (a) Obtain all possible details about the death, don’t go with an incomplete,
     unclear message, it will only cause more distress.

(b) Obtain as much information about the relationship and the expectancy of
    death. Clearly, in accident cases it will always be a horrible shock.

(c) Obtain information about the individual who is to be told. Are they elderly,
    infirm or living alone?; and

(d) Consider the advisability of having another officer with you, e.g. if the person
    to be informed is a woman, a W.P.C. may assist.

If you decide to speak to neighbours first, ensure that you do not allow emotional
and irresponsible people to worsen the situation.
 Sudden Death                                                                  F4/9




 Much must be left to your own tact and good judgement, and your understanding
 of each particular situation.

 At the same time, it may help if you can contact a close friend or relation to pass
 on the news, even though you must be present to ensure that correct information
 is given.

 Consider things like getting the person to sit down, making them a cup of tea or
 coffee etc. Be prepared to send medical aid, especially with the elderly.

 Such commonsense and consideration is a vital part of your police duty.

When informing people of serious injury or death, or dealing with a report of
sudden death, police officers often find themselves having to deal, not only with
the emotions of those involved, but with their own emotions as well.

We must never forget that a police officer is also a human being and that dealing
with trauma can cause stress. Whilst some stress is an inevitable part of our life
and can promote change and personal growth, too much stress can be devas­
tating both physically and emotionally.

The important thing is to learn how to recognise stress and devise some means
to cope.

(a) Learning to relax is the most important thing.

(b) Seek support, share your stress with others, gain support from knowing that
    someone is on your side.

(c) Don’t suffer in silence, talk about it to others, be prepared to express your
    feelings to others who are prepared to listen and understand your situation,
    don’t just talk about events, try to express your innermost feelings.

(d) Having identified your problems, it may be necessary to seek expert advice,
    don’t hesitate to do so.

The most important lesson to learn is, don’t bottle things up. Stress needs to be
released, it only gets worse if you keep it to yourself.

If you are aware of the feelings of others you will recognise that most people
involved in traumatic events are looking for help. Remember, these people will
base their opinions of the police force as a whole on how you deal with them in
their time of need.

                                                                                    para.
(S) 1.    Duties of Coroner                                                         ref.

    1.1   Where a coroner is informed that the body of a person is lying within
          his jurisdiction and there is reasonable cause to suspect that such a
          person has died:
          (a) a violent or unnatural death; or
          (b) a sudden death the cause of which is unknown; or
          (c) in prison; or
          (d) in such a place or under such circumstances as to require an
              inquest under any Act (for example in the case o f certain
              industrial diseases)
          the coroner, whether the cause o f death arose within his jurisdiction
          or not, shall summon a jury as soon as possible to inquire into the
          death.
          However, where a person has died a sudden death the cause of which
          is unknown, the coroner may dispense with an inquest if a post
          mortem examination shows the death to have been from natural
          causes.

    1.2   A coroner is also required to hold an inquest on treasure trove.
          Treasure trove means gold or silver that has been hidden in the soil
          or buildings and of which the owner cannot be traced. In the absence
          of the owner being known, such concealed items become the
          property of the Crown. Any person finding any treasure has a duty
          to make it known to the coroner, and failure to do so may amount
          to a criminal offence.


(S) 2.    Jurisdiction
          Generally, the coroner has jurisdiction to hold an inquest relating to
          bodies lying within his area regardless of where the cause of death
          took place. However, if a coroner considers that it would be
          expedient for the inquest on a body lying within his area to be held
          by some other coroner he may request another coroner to assume
          jurisdiction. For example, if in a fatal road accident, a man is killed
          instantly the coroner for that area would have jurisdiction. If the
          m an’s wife was taken to hospital which was within another coroner’s
          area and later died there, the coroner for that other area could
          request that the inquest on both bodies be held by the same coroner.

                                                                    PART I    CHAPTER 3
                                                                             [841
                                                                                             para.
                                                                                             ref.
          2.2     The jurisdiction o f a coroner of a coastal area extends to low tide
                   level, and a ship in harbour lies within the jurisdiction regardless of
                   low water mark. Deaths abroad, at sea, in aircraft or on oil rigs may
                   all be investigated by the coroner within whose district the bodv
                   comes to lie.                                                         3
         2.3      There are other immunities from the jurisdiction of the coroner in
                  relation to visiting heads o f state, monarchs or presidents, and
                  members o f visiting forces.
  (S) 3           Inquests
         3.1      A coroner (or his deputy or assistant deputy) must at all times hold
                  himself ready to undertake duties in connection with inquests and
                  post-mortem examinations. It is the duty of any person to inform the
                  coroner o f a body found in circumstances which may require an
                  inquest, but in practice reports usually come from doctors, police
                  registrars or governors of prisons.
         3.2      At the inquest, the coroner must examine on oath all persons who
                  tender evidence regarding the facts of the death and all persons
                  having knowledge o f those facts whom he thinks it expedient to
                  examine. After hearing the evidence, the jury shall give their verdict
                  setting forth who the deceased was; how, when and where he came
                  by his death.
         3.3      A coroner must summon a jury if the death:
                 (a) occurred in prison; or
                 (b) occurred in such place or circumstances as to require an inauest
                     under any other Act; or
                 (c) resulted from accident, poisoning or disease which must be
                     reported to a government department; or
                 (d) occurred in circumstances the continuance or possible recurrence
                     o f which is prejudicial to public safety; or
                 (e) occurred while the deceased was in police custody, or resulted
                     from an injury caused by a police officer in the purported
                     execution of his duty.
                 Otherwise, a coroner may hold an inquest into the death o f a person
                 without a jury.                                               y
     3.4         Inquests must be held in public (except for reasons o f national
                 security). They must not be held on Christmas Day, Good Friday or
                 a hank holiday (unless on grounds of urgency) and never on a
                 bunday. The coroner must notify the date, hour and place o f the
                 inquest to relatives of the deceased and other persons such as
                 insurers, trade union officers and chief officers of police who have
                asked to be notified. Such persons are permitted to examine
                witnesses either in person or through a lawyer, provided that the
                chief officer of police may only examine through a lawyer and the
                coroner may disallow any question which he considers irrelevant or
                improper. Witnesses are generally examined first by the coroner and
                lastly by their lawyer (if one is present). No witness is obliged to
                answer self incriminating questions.
    3.5         Any inquest may be adjourned for a number of reasons, including
                on the request of the chief officer of police. The coroner must notify
                witnesses, jurors and other persons of the resumed date.
    3.6         In practice, a verbal or telephone warning of the time and place of
                an inquest serves to ensure the appearance of witnesses, but if it is
                 nought that a witness may fail to attend a summons can be issued
                It a witness does not appear the coroner can impose a fine on him.’

                                                                                     ref.
    3.7    Where a jury is required for an inquest, the coroner may issue a
           warrant to the coroner’s officer or constables in his area requiring
           them to summon a jury. The jury must consist of not less than seven
           nor more than eleven persons. The coroner’s officer or constable, in
           summoning the jury, must have regard to the persons’s convenience,
           place of residence and travelling distance. In practice, coroner’s
           juries are usually assembled informally, but failure to answer a
           summons could lead to a fine.
    3.8    Whilst some inquests are of short duration and can be completed in
           one session, others require longer investigation and may be opened
           and adjourned. In either case, the coroner may then authorise
           disposal of the body.
    3.9    After all witnesses have been heard, no person is allowed to address
           the coroner or jury as to the facts. The coroner, if he has sat with
           a jury, must sum up the evidence to the jury and direct them as to
           the law before they consider their verdict.
    3.10   No verdict can be framed in such a way as to appear to determine
           any question of criminal liability on the part of a named person, or
           civil liability.
    3.11   A coroner who believes that action may be taken to prevent
           recurrence of similar fatalities may announce that he is reporting the
           matter in writing to the appropriate authority.

                                        HILLSBOROUGH ENQUIRY




                  On 7 June 1990, Belinda Norcliffe of Hammond Suddards Solicitors
                  requested copies of written Police orders and other Police documents used
                  in the training of Probationer Constables in so far as relates to sudden
                  deaths.

                  The following copy documents have been selected;

                   1.   Standing Order 17a - relating to Police action in respect of sudden
                        deaths,

                   6.   Student

                   7.   Chapter

                  I have ascertained there are no general written instructions within our
                  Force Training Department which outlines how the subject of 'Sudden
                  Death' is to be introduced. It is normally brought out in general group
                  discussion and in practical exercises.

                  I request these copy documents be forwarded to Belinda Norcliffe and in
                  anticipation I have prepared a draft letter addressed to Hammond Suddards
                  for your signature.

 I am a Detective Inspector                                                                  in the South Yorkshire Police,

 c u rren tly                  stationed at Main Street Police Station,                                                                                             Rotherham.

On Saturday 15th April 1989,                                                                         I was temporarily engaged

 on u n i f o r m duties to assist w ith the policing of the F .A .

 Cup semi-final football m a t c h at the Hillsborough Football

 ground,               Sheffield, b e t we en Liverpool and N ot tingham Forest.

 Prior to the kick off at                                                             3.00 p.m. on that date                                                 I was

 responsible for supervising a number of officers policing

 the temporary coach par k for Nottingham Forest supporters

 w h ic h was located at the H e r r i e s Road Bus Depot.

 Shortly after 3.00 p.m.                                                          on that date together with other

 officers                   I was directed to enter the West Stand at the ground

 via the Leppings Lane e n t r a n c e and clear it of supporters.

 Having entered the stand                                                             I assisted with the removal                                                       of

        playing area.           Following this on two separate occasions

        I assisted with the removal of an injured pers o n to the

        grounds gymnasium w h i c h is located behind the North Stand,

        part of which was b e i n g used as a First Aid Post.

        On the second occasion I was directed by D etective

        Superintendent McKay to take charge of the si tuation in

        the first section of the gymnasium where a large number
                 ©
        of dead bodies had bee n deposited. The m aj o r i t y of these

        bodies had been c arried there by members of the crowd who

        having deposited a body there,                then left it unattended,

        returning to the pitch to assist with the other dead and

        injured still there.              Approximately six of these bodies had

        been escorted to the gymn as iu m by a Police Officer who had

        then remained with the body whilst several other bodies were

        accompanied by a friend or relative.                    It was immediately

        apparent to me that co nt inuity of the various bodies was

        going to pose problems.

        In order to bring this             somewhat chaotic situation under

        control, together with a number of other Officers,                         I cleared the

        gymnasium of all persons who had no practical                      reason for being

        there.       Two Officers were then placed on the door to regulate

        access and egress to the building.

        Following this the bodies were laid out in rows of twelve

        in the first section of the gymnasium starting at the top

        left hand corner of the first section going crossways to

        the outer wall.             It was fortunate that the floor of "this section

        was already covered wi t h protective heavy plastic sheeting

as prior to this                incident, it was being used as a rest/

feeding area for officers on duty inside the ground.

A number of b o dies wh ic h had been deposited outside between

the gymnasium and the North Stand were also brought into

the gymnasium and laid out together with e l ev en cJthers which

were brought            f r o m the rear of the West Stand.

Initially a total of 82 bodies were laid out in the temporary

mortuary,         all of wh ic h were examined and certified dead by one

of a number of d o c to rs who had volunteered their

assistance at the scene.

Each body was a l l oc a te d a unique sequential                  number     following

which each body was allocated to an officer who was thereafter

responsible for the searching, documentation and continuity

of it, until such time as it was deposited at the Medico-

Legal centre at Water y Street, Sheffield.

About 5.00 p.m.,                 the same day I was informed by Detective

Chief Superintendent Addis that the Coroner Dr.                          Popper

had authorised the use of Kenyons the firm of Funeral

Directors who s p ec ialise in dealing with the bodies of

victims of ma jo r incidents.                    I was told that Kenyons would

be responsible               for the preparation of the bodies            for

identification and their removal to the Medico-Legal Centre

mortuary at W a te ry Street, Sheffield.

In view of this,                once the respective body officers had

completed s earching and documenting their body and had placed

it into a body bag,                     they were stood down to the mi ddle section

of the g y m na s iu m wh ic h by then had been cleared of casualties

        and fitted out with chairs.

        The continuity and listing of pr o p e r t y found on the

        individual bodies and in and a round the West Stand was

        co-ordinated by a team of o f f i c e r s supervised by Inspector

        Tingle.

        About 6 . 4 5 p . m . ,    the same day the Coroner Dr. Popper,

        Home Office Pathologist,             Professor Usher and Dr. Jones

        attended at the temporary m o r t u a r y and following discussions

        with Detective Chief Superintendent Addis,                     it was decided

        that the services of Kenyons would not be utilised.                             It was

        also decided that in order to facilitate identification of .

        individual bodies a Scenes of Crime T e a m would take a

        Polaroid photograph of the facial                 features of each body.

        The photographs would then be m a r k e d with the unique number of

        the body to which they referred.

        These would then be displayed on a board to be examined by

        the relatives or friends of a suspe ct ed victim, in the event

        that such persons then made an initial                     identification of

        a photograph,         they would then be p ermitted to view that

        particular body in order to make a formal                     identification.

        It was felt that this system would alleviate the need for

        relatives or friends to undergo the traumatic experience

        of examining each and every body in order to make an

        identification.

        The respective          'body officer'      a ss i st ed   by a two man t eam

        of Detectives then cleaned u p and pr ep ar e d the facial

        features of his body which was then photographed.

 Continuation of statement of    JOHN JAMES CHARLES

 About 8.50 p.m. the same day a further twelve bodies

 were received at the tempo ra r y m or t u a r y from the Northern

 General Hospital and these were processed in the same way

 as described previously.            These were the bodies of persons

 taken from the ground to the hospital by ambulance who

 had either been found dead on arrival there or w ho had

 subsequently died shortly after their arrival.

 By 9.15 p.m.,       that evening all of the bodies had been

 photographed and the photos displayed in an area inside

 the main entrance to the g y mn a si um which is at the oppos it e

 end to that being used as the temporary mortuary.

 A' number of screens had been erected inside this entrance

 so as to form a viewing area for the individual bodies to

 be viewed by respective relatives or friends.                     The bottom

 section of the g ymnasium was fitted out with tables and

 chairs for use as an interview area for relatives/friends

and members of the caring agencies that were counselling

them, together with facilities for them to obtain light

refreshment.

The procedure adopted as far as the identification process

was concerned was as follows

Relatives or friends as appropriate,                viewed the photo gr ap h s

and having made an initial identification were then

taken to the viewing area where that particular body was

shown to them.         If a positive      identification was made they

were then taken to the adjoining area of the g y mn as iu m w h e r e

they were interviewed and all the information required by

the    'body Officer'              to complete the Sudden Death Report

(Form Gen/18) was obtained from them.

That Officer then returned to the body whilst a Dete ct iv e

obtained a statement regarding formal                   identification.

Each body was conveyed ^ r o m the temporary mortu ar y area

of the gymnasium to viewing area by means of hweeled

stretcher trolleys which had been provided for the purpose

by the South Yorkshireerjsfcul ance Service.                   Once the body

had been formally identified and the relatives taken to

the interviewing area, the body was returned to the

temporary mortuary to await the re turn of the                      'body officer'.

On    that officers return to the body,                 he then supervised

it's loading onto an awaiting am b u l a n c e and then a ccompanied

the body to the Medico-Legal Centre mortuary at W a te ry

Street where it was handed over to a team of officers

headed by Detective                 Inspector Timms who were responsible ►

for continuity thereafter.                  The bodies were conveyed in

threes to Watery Street in order to maximise the use of

the ambulances and prevent u nn ec e ss ar y delays.

Initially it had been intended to hand over to identifying

relatives the property found on the respective body but in

the event it was found that this procedure was slowing down

the identification process and in vie w of the large number

of    people seeking to make identification this procedure

was discontinued and the property taken with the body

to the Medico-Legal Centre where                 it was lodged.

Further to ey statement of        15 May 1989 concerning ey duties and actions

on Saturday 15 April 1989 at Hillsborough Football Grounds


I estimate     that ey first attendance          in the gynnasiue was       at '5.*36pe.

The     situation   there was     disorganised       because     the   efforts     of    all

concerned, policeeen      and civilian,         was to try     to save lives     and deal

with     the injured.      It    was clear      to ee   that where       victies of      the

disaster were obviously dead, the attentions of everyone up to that tiee

had moved on to casualties where there was a chance of resucitation.


On     receiving directions     froe   Detective Superintendent          McKay to       take

charge     of the situation      in the    first    section of     the    gye ey      first

priority was to clear the bodies froe the area near                to the doorway, so

that     unrestricted - access        could       be    given to         persons     bringing    in

casualties, and      for nedical        staff to attend the              Injured.        Secondly,

there were nany people, both policemen and civilians, who by then had no

reason to     be in the       gyn.      I had then cleared fron              that area because

they were     Impeding rescue efforts.                 Access and        egress was controlled

fron that tine,      which would be about 3.40pm                  This was essential Action

because of the sheer nunbers of people who were already Involved.


Hy concerns     fron that point         were to inpose proper              organisation on the

necessary     duty    of ensuring       continuity        as     regards     evidence for       the

Coroner, protection        of property, and            fornal identification procedures.

I assuned       these     responsibilities         on     the      authority        of   Detective

Superintendent       HcKay,     confirned at       about        4.05pm     by Detective       Chief

Superintendent Addis.            Part of       this control was to           allocate bodies a

personal     identification          number; to    ensure        that     fron     that point    an

individual police officer was nade responsible for each body; and that a

search of the body was          carried out by those officers to attempt to nake

a tentative identification.


Circumstances were        such that a         very snail nunber of          the deceased were

attended by friends or relatives, and the information they gave was part

of the tentative identification process.                  However fornal identification

procedures were carried out later               that evening, in the organised nanner

which I described in ny previous statement.


There were a      large     nunber of         people in    the     gyn nost        of the    tine,

particularly in the        early stages.          Many were       police officers, a large

duties and many were casually                dressed, so to an outsider would not have

been Immediately Identifiable as policemen.


As well as         police officers assigned to each                 body, others were deployed
on dealing with          p e p m n ^ l property of the deceased, cleaning the bodies
                                     dUKtr d^cJSk

relativesA          It was      not the case that relatives or friends were allowed

to wander       freely about the           temporary mortuary, even in               the very early

stages.


The      acoustics of        the gymnasium        building were        such that        sound echoed

arround      the     hall,      and there     was    a    background       of sound         which       was

unavoidable.             However apart from the confusion of the very early stages

everyone worked quietly and so                far as possible with due respect for the

deaif,      This         particularly applied In         the evening when           relatives were

attending to Identify the deceased.                      It was so quiet that the distress

of the     relatives^ could be             heard by any        of the policemen          present and

caused considerable distress to them also.

         people are being brought apparently for treatment."

         Views return to the temporary mortuary. Again Police Officers
         in casual clothing can be seen in the area performing tasks.


3.57     Commentary :-
stated   "The flow of apparently lifeless bodies seems to have
time      slowed down considerably if not ceased. We're now taking
          just general scenes of the temporary mortuary inside the
          gym."

         Body appears to be medically examined. A male person out
         of view of the camera can be heard to raise his voice in an
         angry manner.

4.34     Corrmentary
stated   "The bodies have now been bagged by South Yorkshire Ambulance
time      and Police Officers laid in rows of 12. Sane assemblance of
          order. Going by radio messages received, which are a little
          broken, it would seem there's 45 dead bodies which are now
          going to be transferred to the mortuary and hospitals."

         Views stop and recommence. Most bodies appear to be in
         Ambulance body bags. The body bags are in lines or being
         arranged.   Police Officers still performing tasks.

         Detectives in attendance.

          throughout iny duties at the mortuary, I called on unifor*** officers

          to assist in several duties in the mortuary.                                        These involved Movement

          of the deceased persons into and out of the viewing area.

          There                is only one single viewing area in the building and there were

          occasions when people were kept waiting,                                       but 1 was able to placate

          them and there were no complaints about this difficulty.

          Throughout that week my officers shared in the grief of the friends

          and relatives of the deceased,                                  but were compassionate* understanding

          and very professional                             in their handling of a quite unique situation.

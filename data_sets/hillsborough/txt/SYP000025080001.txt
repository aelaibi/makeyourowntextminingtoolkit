                          EMERGENCY EVACUATION PROCEDURE


    The following notes of guidance are prepared and issued to assist all
    official stewards and others in a position of responsibility at the
    Hillsborough Stadium on the action to be taken and procedures to be followed
    in the event of the possibility of evacuation of the stadiuia during the
    playing of a game when spectators are present. The notes are not intended to
    be a comprehensive list of all the action necessary, but are for personal
    issue to each steward and for retention by the steward for immediate ref­
    erence all the time he/she is on duty at the stadium.

    It is appreciated that, the reasons evacuation may become necessary are many
    and varied, but the most obvious are fires or information that explosive/
    incendiary devices have been placed somewhere within the stadium/ground.
    That information may be received or discovered either by members of the staff
    at the stadium, or by telephone to the stadium- police,- local or national
    newspapers.

    IT IS STRESSED THAT WHENEVER SUCH INFORMATION IS RECEIVED THE RESPONSIBILITY
    FOR THE DECISION TO EVACUATE ALL OR PART OF THE GROUND RESTS WITH THE SENIOR
    MANAGEMENT OF THE CLUB. (The senior police officer on duty will be in a
    position to adviae as to whether the ’bomb call’ is likely to be genuine or
    not).
    Whenever such information becomes known, a message will be relayed to the
    police officer on duty in the ,!P. A. Commentary Box" at the ground, who, on
    instructions from the senior police officer, and irrespective of whether
    the match is in progress or not, will cause the record                         to
    be played over the loudspeaker system.                r/>L-i.V TVr Th£ VCeTTLS

    The playing of that record will indicate to everyone present at the ground,
    other them spectators, that a possible emergency situation exists.

    N.B.   As part of the regular pre-match brief of referees and linesmen and
           both teams, this information should be passed to them so that the
           game officials are also aware of the possibility of an interruption in
           play and the significance of the playing of the record.

     On hearing that record all club stewards will make their way to their des­
     ignated duty points on gangways/gates/exits, etc. Those on exit gates will
     open the gates and remain at that point. During this period senior
     officials will consider the nature of the emergency alleged and will decide
     to evacuate all/part of the stadium. Once that decision has been taken, but
     not until, the senior police officer cm duty will cause a spoken message to
     be relayed over the !'P. A. System” which will have the effect of

     (1)   Stopping the game and removing players from the field of play?

     (2)   Informing the spectators/officials of the prccise nature of the
           emergency and its location if known, and requesting all or specified
           sections of the public to leave their seats and make their way out of
           the ground by the nearest normal exit route unless specifically directed
            to do otherwise by means of the 5iP. A. System".

IT IS STRESSED THAT NO EVACUATION WILL TAKE PLACE EXCEPy^I^E K ^ E ^ E ^ Vi^-cU^
EMERGENCY AND ALTHOUGH THE PREPARATORY WARNING RECORD 'T R W ^ DliIliD Hiig
MAY BE PLAYED, THERE IS EVERY POSSIBILITY THAT INITIAL ENQUIRIES WILL
ESTABLISH THE PERPETRATION OP A HOAX, ETC., AND IN THAT CASE, INSTEAD OF
A SPOKEN MESSAGE TO EVACUATE,- THE FACT THAT THE EMERGENCY HAS
WILL BE INDICATED BY THE PLAYING OF THE RECORD -
ON HEARING THIS 'ALL CLEAR* STEWARDS ON EXIT GATES AND GANGWAYS WILL
REMAIN ON STAND-BY AT THAT POINT FOR FIVE MINUTES BEFORE CLOSING TOE GATES
AND RESUMING THEIR NORMAL DUTY POSITIONS.

In the event: of any steward/club official discovering a fire or receiving
information that an emergency situation exists within the ground, he will
immediately -

  (i)   Notify the Club Secretary by telephone?

 (ii)   Inform any police officer.

(iii)   He must also, on discovering a fire, activate the fire alarm system
        by means of a 'Break Glass’ call point.

The activation of the call point will not immediately sound any form of
audible alarm but will indicate by light signal in the police staffed
control point the location of the emergency. The police controller can
then deploy manpower to investigate the cause.

 In the event of discovery of fire by a steward, he should take additional
 action in accordance with the following points.—

 (A)    Sound the alam by breaking the nearest break glass call point?

 (B)    Tackle the fire with the appropriate extinguisher if safe to do so;

 (C)    Close doors within the immediate vicinity of the fire?

 (D)    At no time mention the words ’Fire’ or ’Bomb*.   Remember, if you
         don't panic, neither will the crowd?

 (E)    Upon completion of the evacuation of your section, report to the
        assembly area (which has been specified by the Club) and report to
        the person in overall charge, who will, in turn, report to the Fire
        Service and any other relevant emergency service which may be in
        attendance.

 ALL STEWARDS MUST FAMILIARISE THEMSELVES WITH THE LOCATION OF:-

  (a)   Fire Alarm 'Break Glass' call points;

  (b)   Location of the Fire Fighting Equipment?

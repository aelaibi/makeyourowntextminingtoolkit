I have the strongest feeling that you and your ministers should find yourself adequately
briefed on this long-running - and grievous - issue.

We are here and ready to help.

I do hope that you'll take advantage o f our extensive factual knowledge and will, in
deciding whether or not to do so, take into account our strongly even-handed
approach to the issues involved.

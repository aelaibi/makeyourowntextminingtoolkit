                  early     possibly about 9 .30 ~ 10 am                       (0930— 10UU)           1 did r v o t      take     too much

      We a rr i v e d qui pe late about           twenty five minutes           before    the m atch was

      due          start.          parked the car at the top of L e p pings Lane right
                        HO S u c h
      next     to the B ri ti sh Tele c o m f a c t o r y . All four of us then wa l k e d to

      the    ground.        This    took us about        ten or fifteen minutes.            There

      a p p e ar ed    to be a lot of walking            to the ground     considering        how    late     in

      the day         it was.      We had a real        nice walk     to the ground,       the atmo s p h e r e

      was    good and everyone was jolly.                  I did not witness any un n e c e s s a r y

      disorder at all,             and ever ything was       normal     for the type of match.


                                           r n f t f t i < bcJ& o -
      When we got to the             perimeter 'g^te it was           terrible,    the    people at this
rof
      poi nt were        u n b e 1 ievafale.   There w a x no o r g a n i s a t i o n at all,    there were

      no queues4 for the turnstiles                or anything,        just a mass       gathering      of

      people.          I just kept      saying to myself        that    this was a ridiculous

      situation.           I did not att end the similar m atch                last year    so   I was       not

      able    to      compare   the difference,          I could only go on what                      an d

      were    saying.



      In order         to get   intoN^he       crowd we kept      edging our way forward.             We

      eventual ly went          tVhraugh some wrought          i ron gates , but when we            looked up

      we    realised we had          come to the wrong         side as this was the           entrance        for

      the stands.           We then had to turn ar o u n d to           come    back and try and get

      a r o u nd   the    crowds    to get over     to the     right    to where    Lne    turnstiles

      were.           'his was absol u t e murder,        but kept     pushing and shoving           our

      w a y M h r o u q h , it took     us'Nabout ten minutes          to get through to the

      turnstiles.           Where we were rru3t4o.ng our way to there were                 two moun t e d

      police       offTc^Tssj^^^There were m o r e A ) r e s e n t     but further awa y from us,

      and also         foot officers as well.             Where we were        stood to get      into      the

      turnstiles          it was becoming        very    congested,     you were    being     hustled and
                                                                                                                    PAGE            3
                                                                                                                    S 3636

        • b u s t l ed about and         it was hard work          to get       to the turnstiles.                 We were

    i     n the G turnstile,                I think more or            less    near    the    pathway.           It was

         getting         that    bad that      I was    beginning        to think that           if someone         d o e s n st

         open the big gate              that    the wall was           going    to give way and fall                in.

         There     comes a point when either                   the gate        has to be opened or                remains

         closed,          This was a sit u a t i o n where             it had to be opened.



         I think         it took about         ten to fifteen minutes                 of att e m p i n g    to get       into

         the    ground all          told.      When    the gate was a c t u a l l y          opened    I w ould say

         we were about            ten or twelve         feet away from           it at       that time.          When we
$
&        went     through we were            some of the first            crowd to go through,                     I saw

         two u n if ormed          police    officers as        1 went        through,        I was    quite amazed

         by how empty the               concourse area was at             this    time.         1 have      never       been

         to that ground before &qd therefore was                              guided by                    and

         and o b viously f pi lowed the^»                    We rn^de our way to what                 is known as the

         tunnel.          I recoll\ct        seeing two stewards               at this       point.        There was          one

         either         side of the        tunnel.      This was        the first        time    I    had seen one

         as there were            none at tKe gate w hen               it opened.



         No-one         stopped us entering            the tusqnel so we all              fours^wa l k e d       through.

         T here w a ^ o b v i o u s l y     a crowd walking            through and        it was/ tight           but    nol

         uncomf or table rsv'ou were able                 to walk alright             until we       reached        the

         end.      The        p l a y ers\were on the        pitch when we        reached the end of the

         t u n n e 1,    it was     then    I realised how bad it was,                   there was just            nowhere

         to go,         you    c o u l d n ’t or should      I say not        in a position to make                up your

       all    happy and singing and sho^j^ing.                        G ra du a l l y we were'^b^ing moved

       for^rd      down       into the        pen,    it was\a       few minutes        before we got           split          up

       f ro m t h e\r e s t       I tended to stick wx\h                              We were      being moved

       a r ri v e d at a barrier.             At this        point my     reco l l e c t i o n   is a bit       hazy„              I

       do not know whether               or not you went aro u n d              it or under        it, all          I know

       is that     I ended up in front                 of it and                 got stuck       behind        it,      he

       was    rignt up against            it.        He tapped me on the shoulder,                  I was able                to

       turn my body a r o un d to look behind.                                  was shouting        for me to help

       him,    he was      crying and was             in terrible        panic.        I picked my arms              up and

       put them on the            people       that were       behind                 in an effart        to    push

       them back.          I s c r e a m e d and s c r eamed at          them to get        back not       realising

       that    the. pressure must have                 been great        on them as well.                           was

       doubled over           this bar,        his face was          changing        colour and he was

       screaming       for help.          My a t t empts       to    remove     the    pressure     from

       were    fruitless,          1 was o b viously           panicking myself and               crying

       f r an ti c a l l y as    I w a s n ’t able      to    relieve     the    pressure                      th e n

       star t e d to vomit,            he vomited all          over me,       all     1 remember     is him

       apologising.             I caught       hold of his head to try and                   console      him,       he

       grab b e d hold of my arm and asked me to help him.                                 I don't     know what

       happened but           I got     carried sideways away from him more                        towards          the

       left.         meant       to sav as well          there was a no trier man next               to

       w ou l d describe         him as grey haired                 receding at the front          top.         I

       remember he had quite a big nose,                            the only way to describe           the

       is the same as the                                                                 1 would say he                was

       in his     late forties.               He was wearing          like a black         sweat shirt          but       X

       can't    be sure,         it had a crew neck.                 T h a t ’s all    I can     remember       seeing

•about     him.       He was       clean shaven.                 All    I can      remember      him saying was

 “Oh God      let me        live” .          As    I say    I got       swept      sideways.          I think    the

 crowd turned me ar o u n d to face                        the    pitch but how           I really d o n ’t k n o w ,

 e verying      is very sketchy.                    I remained standing.                  Due to the fact           that

 I'm very stocky and overweight                            I was       sweating a        lot,    my spectacles

 began to slip down my face,                           I then felt a hand on my shoulder and a

 man saying        ’ I"ve got your                 glasses mate".



 It seemed then that                   the    pressure       eased o f f        and we were able             to move

 forward easier as                I became          free.        I just      slumped down and sat on the

 steps     towards         the    front of          the    pen.        The man who had my glasses also

 sat down and we had a few minutes                               to    regain some sanity and breath.

 I must     have      been sitting                for some       ten minutes         before      two    police

 officers       came and asked us to move.                             We then made        our way back up the

 pen towards          the    tuhriel.             There SSL met        ud   with                who    I noticed had

 his arm around                              We mads       our w^y out of the tunnel and tried to

was     given a glass             of water.           He stated he wasn't                 feeling       very good at

all and e ve n t u a l l y we sat him down against                              the wall        in the      concourse

 alright,       but                    was        frantic    to find him.                He went      off   on his own

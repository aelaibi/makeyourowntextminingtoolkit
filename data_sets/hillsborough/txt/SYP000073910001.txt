          I pushed his          head back avid down u n d e r n e a t h the barrier and he

          disappeared        from view.

          I then du c k e d under          the    barrier.                                 tried to follow me

          under,    but    he    c o u l d n ’t get his           chest across           the barrier.            He s c r eamed

          at me    to    push him off,           so       1 tried to push him off with my back                             towards

          the    pitch.

          I managed       to get my feet              up onto        his    chest     to    push him back.              I then

          fell    backwards, I got           back         up,     Tony was        turning    blue and he slumped

          over    the    bar.    I tried to           push him off          the     bar again, and               Tony got his

          b reath back.

          1 fell    back a gain and          lost sight              of him.       E v e r y b o d y was    pani/king

          trying    to get out,           climbing          over     peoples       heads., I m a n a g e ^ / t o     get      to the

          was    dead,    I left him where                he was and tried                to get my breath.            I could

            I am a Police Constable Dog Hajpm 1 er in the Nottingham C                       abulary

            stationed at the Dog Sectioi
                                                                         *         ^
            On Saturday 15 April         1989 I was on duty at Sheffield for the Liverpool

            v Nottingham Forest Football match.



            I attended a briefing with other Dog Handle rs at 9am whi ch was he 1d at

            the Niagara .Social Club.

            The fariefingV/was much like all other briefings held prior to football

            mat c he s .

            I was instructed to pa tro 1 in company with a Sergeant of the South

            Yorkshire Police         in the City Centre of Sheffield with attention to the

            Midland Station Sheffield.

            I left the briefing and commenced pa tr o1 of the city centre. Whilst on
                                                                          PAGE      2
                                                                          S2844

patrol   in the city centre I saw numerous groups of football

supporters both from Liverpool and Nottingham all appeared in

friendly mood and appeared to be enjoying a day out.

Dur i ng the morning    I called at the Midlands Railway Station several

times.   I saw both Liverpool and Nottingham fans leave the station and

board the service buses.

Quite a number of these fans had been drinking heavily but remained

well   behaved. Several    fans   in my view alighted from trains carrying

all types of full      cans and bottles of beer and lager all of t h e s e '

were poured down a drain at the insistance of Police Officers.             I

saw no one argue with this        instruction.

The time from leaving the train to boarding         respective buses took

anythi ng up to 20 - 25 mi nutes due enti rely      to the fact that

passengers had to pay on entering the buses         before leaving the    station.

Arrangements at the statical for separating fans and kee pi ng them apar t

could not in my opinion/have been better.

At about 3.10pm on Vne same date we we re instructed via VHF           radio to

travel   to Hi 1 lsbo/'ough footbal 1 ground and to enter the gate      ’O ’ .

Upon arrival, at/the ground 1 entered via a large folding metal           gate at

the Forest End of the ground.

Upon alighting from the vehicle        I saw a large number of Police Dog

Handlers with their dogs standing behind the stands.

During the few minutes      it took to arrive at the ground no details of

any occurrence were transmi tted either on VHF       or UHF   chann e1 25 whi ch

I had been instructed to use. Knowing that other UHF          channels were

also   in use I asked several     other officers what was happening.      None

could tell me.



Together with the Sergeant        I walked onto the pitch at the opposite end

to Leppings Lane.
                                                                             PAGE
                                                                             SZ844

I saw a large number of people on the pitch,            some were standing about,

others were kneeling down next to people Lying prone on the ground.

I walked to the nearest person lying on/the g r o u n d , this was a young

man of about 16 or 17, he was being attended to by a youth of about he

same a g e . I examined him and saw ttarat he was very distressed,         was

having trouble breathing and had/a cut to the right side of his h e a d .

He also complained of pains iryhis legs.

Having just seen an ambulanctf parked at the rear of the Forest

Supporters stand I carried / h e young man to i t .

Whi 1st there 1 was appro®j/hed by a youth asking for a stretcher and

the First Aid Room.        I did not know the location of either.

I then saw several        persons   carried off who appeared d e a d .

At this point ambulances began arriving           in numbers and I assisted in

getting        them onto the pitch.

People kept approaching me in a very distressed state either

requesting stretchers or First Aid. As a stranger             I was unable to help

and I felt totally useless.

After a few minutes        I was instructed to travel     to Leppi ngs Lane where

a disturbance was taking place between rival football             supporters.

Upon arrival and as we drove along Leppi ngs Lane.            I saw a large number

of very distraught and upset f a n s . I saw no disturbances although a

great deal of abuse was being          levelled at the police. We stopped

with view of the Leppi ngs Lane turnstiles and alighted f rom the

vehi c l e .

I was    immediately set upon ve r ba 11y by a group of Liverpool        fans who

shouted,        'Are you fuckin happy its your    lots fault* and 'We should

have had the other end the re was just too many of us."

This occurred several        times but be cause these    people were upset    I

decided not to react to it.

A number of people entered a nearby shop and came out with cans of
                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                 S2844

         beer and lager. Several were obviously drunk but none were agressive

         or disorderly.

         After a few minutes we were instructed to leave Leppi ngs Lane and

         travel    to the city centre.

         For the next hour we were engaged in breaking up small disturbances

         between rival fans.

         We were eventually released to stand down at about 7.30pm.          During thi

         time I was surprised that no information wasygiven over the radio to

         the seriousness of the situation. Only realising the gravity when

         faced with dead and injured people.



         I could find no ground staff who knew the location of stretchers.

         During my few minutes within the ground         and on the pitch    agreat

         number of Police Officers       were standing idle at the      rear of the stand

         This   I believe was due to     total    lack of information   passed out by

         control,   no one knew what had happened.

COMPLAINT 11/89

This complaint was recorded by South Yorkshire Police following a statement made by the
complainant.

The complainant alleged that prior to the match being abandoned he was stood behind the
West Stand when two Police Constables carried out the body of a deceased male. Due to
being upset, he commented to officers “I suppose you’re happy now”. He states that as a
result of this a Sergeant who was present started laughing at him.

West Midland Police officers investigated the complaint and traced two Liverpool supporters
who had witnessed the incident. They both described that the complainant as upset,
hysterical and abusive, calling the officer “a murderer” and “murdering bastard”. One of the
witnesses describes the incident as escalating and therefore dragged the complainant out of
the stadium and remained with him until he calmed down. Both witnesses did not witness the
initial interaction between the complainant and the officer.

OUTCOME

West Midland officers revisited the complainant who provided a statement withdrawing his
complaint.

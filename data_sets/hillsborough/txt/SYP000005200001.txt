                    on S a t u r d a y     8 April        1989,         Richard           bought      two    tickets           for          the   semi“

On M o n d a y              10 A p r i l           1989,       Richard             rang     to    say     that      his     girlfriend

Tracey               COX     also             wanted          to     go    to the         match        and asked         if I c o u l d         try

and        get            another            ticket          for    her.

My        father            went       to L i v e r p o o l           F'.C.        on F r i d a y      14 A p r i l      after      it h a d         been

announced                   on the            rad i o        that     tickets          were       still       available.                 This

ticket                cost       £12          and       was     for       one of       the s t a n d s .      On      th e s a m e       day,        my

mother                came       h om e      with        a ticket,              h a v i n g b o u g h t it    from       someone          at

work             \                                                                                  L i v e r p o o l ).     She         bought          it

for         its           face     value           of £ 1 4        and    it wa s         also      for      one    of     the    stands.

Although                   I don't            know which              ticket          was    for       which       stand,        I c a n say

t ha t       one           ticket         was          for    the     North Stand                and    the    other        for     the        West

Stand.

I t ook               possession                  of    both       these        tickets          and    put    them        in m y        purse,

together                   w i t h my         own       ticket.           Richard           said       that    at     some       stage         he

would                try    to     swop           one    of     the      tickets          for     a Leppings             Lane     standing

area, t i c k e t                so \t h a t           Tracey       could          be w i t h     us    and    then        probably            s ell

the         other           one at            f a ce     val u e .

Richard           had made              an     agreement              with        some      friends           to m e e t       t h e m at        a

On    the w a y             to    the     ground,           we w a l k e d          a few       streets            and    began        to

notica            a build           up of         other          fans       making         their        w a y to     the    ground.

It    took         us a b o u t         ten       minutes             to    reach         the     ground and              the    c l o s e r we

got,     the m o r e              people         there         were.           On     the w a y       ther e ,       I d i d n ’t see

any Police                  Officers           with        any      of     the      fans,       although when                   the    ground

was     in        sight,          I did        see      one      officer            directing            traffic.

We    got         to    the       ground          together            and        I think          the    g r o u n d was         on    our

right         hand          side.         We      turned            into       the    entrance           of t h e         ground and             I

was     quite           surprised               such       a   larg e         crowd       of    people          standing          at    the

front         of       the       gro u n d .       I d i d n ’t k n o w w h i c h               turnstile            we w e r e        to go             in

via,     but           because           of     the     amount           of     people         there         I c o u l d n ’t e v e n        see

the     turnstiles.                      Although              people         were        obviously moving,                     there       d i d n ’t

seem         to    be a n y         obvious           movement             forward          towards           the    entrance.               I

          became        aware        of a        lot     of      people          coming        behind             us    a n d as         the      c_row4;'\'-?r,-v”

          built       up,      we    started           to       get    pushed          forward.                   A l t h o u g h we m a n a g e d

          to    stay     on        the    ri g h t     hana       s id e     of    the     approach                way       we w e r e         being

          j o s t l e d _and p u s h e d          and       we    tried          to h o l d     onto             each    oV ri& r        but      kept

          being       separated            by     people          pushing.                                   ^

          By    this         time,       I saw        s om e     b lue      metal       gates        a n d we           were         being        pushed

          against            these       gate s .        There         was       a Policeman                 on    horseback               in     the

          middle        of     the       crowd about              8 or       10 y a r d s       from             the    gate s .           He

          appeared            to    be    trying           to    split       the       crowd and was                    shouting            to

          everyone            to    get     to    the       right.           At     this       poi nt,            I s a w the            ga t e    open

          inwards.                 Loads     of       people          outside          were     shouting                open         the    g at e      and    I

          saw m aybe           three        or    four          people       go     in.        When          the       gate         opened,        I saw a

          Policeman            was       holding           on    to    it a n d t h e n he               closed          the         g a te.       As    this

          was      going       on    the     crowd              began       to    push harder                 a n d I was pushed                   up

          against            the    fence        at    the       rig h t     hand       side        of        the gate.                  I was     right       by

          the      gate,       almost        against             the     g ate      p o s t . .. T r a c e y w a s              r i ght     next        to me

          on rny right              hand     side          and Richard              on m y      left.               I could           see       s o m e ..fans

          sitting            on t o p of         ^he w a l l          behind        the    gates             inside          the      ground.            I

          didn't        see        any Club           Stewards           outside          the       ground,             but         there       were     two

          other       Policeman             on    horseback.                 They       were        positioned more                        at     the    back

          of    the     crowd.              I wasn't             aware       that       they        came          into       the      c r o w d at       ail.

          The      pressure          from        people          pushing          began        to    increase more                       and more            and

          I was       beginning             to    get           frightened.               My    left          a r m was         t r a p p e d at        my

          s id e    against          the     fence              and    so    the     gate       was          j u s t at m y back.

          At    t his        point,       Richard           said       t hat      if    the     gate             opened again               he w o u l d

          have      to m a k e       a run          into        the    ground             I was          getting more                     and wore

inches         and       the     f a ns        inside        had       bsen asking             him      to    open       it    up b e c a u s e

people         were        being          crushed           up a g a i n s t       it.       As    he     opened,        it a b o u t      half

a    dozen        or     so     f ans         rushed        and       grabbed         the    g at s     and     pulled         it    open.           I

straight           away and               I had        to    really          force         my way       sideways          and against

them      to      prevent            being          crushed           against         the    fe n c e .       I was       then       pushed

into      the      clearing               through           the       gateway         by    the    ground,          but       once     1' w a s

in s i d e     that       area,           1 was        able       to    stand         clear       and     there      was       no    pressure.

1 stood           with Richard                  in the           middle       of      the    clearing           to w a i t      for       Tracey

and    within            a minute              or     so    she       had    joined         us.

Richard           said        that        we    would        h a ve     to    go      in v i a a        tunnel       that       wa s

directly           in f r ont             of    us.          I wasn't            aware       of    any       other       way    of     getting

to    the      terraces              either           left       or    right.          I didn't           see      any    signs

indicating               where           we    should        go       and    I d i d n ’t see           any Policeman                or

Stewards           there         to d i r e c t            us.

We    started            to w a l k           down     the       tun n e l    towards          the      terracing.              N o b o d y w as

pushing           a n d we w e r e             walking           normally.             There       were       quite       a    few     people

in     the t u n n e l ,         but          Iwa s        relieved andsurprised                          that     nobody           was

jostling               t h ere b e c a u s e           Ihad feared               it    would          be the     same         as o u t s i d e

and       I was        still         a    bit       shaken        up.        1 did         notice       about       three        people         on

either         side        of    the          tunnel        urinating            against          the     wall.

We w a l ke d          out      of       the    tunnel           and    o nt o     th e     terracing,              1 d o n ’t k n o w

go    one      s i de      or a n o t h e r           and,       in    fact,       I w a s n ’t e v e n a w a r e             that     it w a s

mouth        of     the       tun n e l .

We    walked            down     the          terrace         a few         steps      to     try and         find a space                to

stand        towards            the       fron t .          Tracey was             standing           to m y       left a n d        slightly

I was        suddenly              shoved       from       behind ana              I was       thrown          forward       down          the

steps.            I was        losi n g        -ny foot i ng a n d              stumbling          but m a n a g e d        to    keep my

feet.            I was        still       being          pushed        forward          and    into       people       in f r o n t         of

me.         The       surge        seemed       to       stop and          created a           gap      behind        us.        Tracey

had      fallen          clown be hi nd me               and     a     load       of    people       pulled          her    up.           She

shouted           that        she'd       lost       her       shoe a n d         I could       see       it    to    the    side          of     me

a few        steps           down.        I c o u l d n ’t r e a c h            it,     but    somebody          picked          it       up a n d

gave        it    back        to    her.

I ’m       not    certain what                 happened          then,          I just        became       aware       of    being

gradually               pushed          down    towards          the       fron t .       The      closer        I got       to       the

front        the jiore p r e s s u r e               increased.                 I w a s n ’t p u s h e d        into       any    barrier

at     all       and     I was          turned       around          by    the     pressure          of    the       crowd.           I

c o u l d n ’t t u r n         back       round,          I was        trapped          and    c o u l d n ’t m o v e       backwards

or     sideways.               I c o u l d n ’t see             Tracey          or R i c h a r d     and with          the       crowd

pushing           so     hard,          I was       literally             fa ce    to    face      with        someone,          a half-

caste        and        I couldn't             see       past.         I knew          I had    been       pushed a          long          way

down        the       front,        but       I d i d n ’t k n o w         ho w    far.        The      pressure           was    so

intense            I felt          as    if    1 c o u l d n ’t b r e a t h e ,          although          I was       screaming                 ’ I ’ve

go t t o g e t o u t * .

This        went        on    for       a few       minutes          and     I was       screaming.              People          were

looking           at     me,       but    nobody          could move              at a l l .       Th e    half-caste             lad

seemed           to     foe g o i n g     down       to    the       floor,        but    somehow          he g o t        back       up.

I began            to    feel       faint          and    thought          I was        going      to     pass       out.        Then        X

j us t      heard        someone          from       the       s ide      of me        say,    ’Q e t     through there

love’.             I turned             round       to m y      side and           j u s t ^ s > ^ pped        up and out             onto         ?

the        pitch.            I d o n ’t k n o w          how    it     happened          and     I d o n ’t k n o w         if    I went

th r o ug h a gate                 or    if    the       fencing          had     collapsed,            I j ust       found myself

on     the        pitch.           As    t ha t     happened,             I was        aware     t hat     the m a tc h was                 in ■

    progress,           but     prior         to    that       I d i d n ’t h a v e       any      i ndication that                   the

    game     had      even      started
                                                                                                                                                 S520

    As    I go I o nto              the       pitch       I wasn't            aware        of' a n y b o d y          at    all      to   my     left

    and     I ’m        not    sure       if      there        was    anybody             on m y       right.               I saw         that    a

    television                camera was             about       two       yards          in    front        of me          and      that

    it, w as         pointing            at    me.         i    saw     that         the       goal     net w a s           just       on m y        left

    hand        side       and      then       1 walked          off       to      the     right        a    short          distance.                I was

    just        standing            facing         the     pitch and               people        were        filing          past m e          both

    fans        and Policeman.                     It     didn't        seem         to    be a        rush       or a n y t h i n g        but       I

    was     a      bit     dazed         and      wasn't        paying          that       much        attention.

    At    this          point,       a Policeman                said       to me,          "Come-on              love,"         and       started          to   J

    t h e r e . 11

    By    this          time,       I was         further        over         to     the       corner        Of       the    pitch.            1 just

    stood          there       then       for      what        seemed a very                   l ong    time.              I remember            I was

    crying           but      I c a n ’t r e m e m b e r         anything             much       going           on a r o u n d me.              I

    remember, a P o l i c e w o m a n                   telling         me      to    go a n d         sit       on    the      pitch and             it

    was     then         I realised               the     game       had      stopped.                 I sat          down,       but      stood

    back        up a g a i n        because          it w a s        wet.          A man was            comforting                me      and while
£
    I was          standing          there         I realised              people          were        being          carried          onto      the            I

    pitch"and              being         l a id    do wn.

    1 h ave          got      no    i dea      how      long     1 had          been standing                    the r e ,      it     seemed

    a g es.          Then      someone,            I have        no     i d e a who,            said        to    go a n d        s t a n d at        th#

    s ide       of      the    pitch.

    I walked             with       the       lad who          was     comforting               me     across          to t h e        side      of       the

Policemen             ther e.          I asked             t hem      if    there       was          any       way    of       finding            out

who      was       injured        or m a y        be       dead.           They    asked             me    if    I ’d lost            anybody

and      1 said          I had        lost- m y        brother             and    his       girlfriend.                    T h e y w o u l d n ’t

g iv e     me      any     information                and       said       I must, go            to       H a m m e r ton R o a d P o lice

 • tation.               They     started             to    give                      one       of    the       lads       who was           with

me,      directions             how        to    get       there.            I was          a    bit       upset          and       said     to

them,         "Do y o u m e a n            there       is       nobody       h e r e , " and              they       said,          "No     love,

there's            nobody       there."               So    we     made      our       way       to H a m m e r t o n R o a d              and       I

was      seen        straight          away       by a          D.C.       O'BRIEN.              Ig a v e       him       the       details              and

descriptions                of R i c h a r d          and       Tracey.           He    took them               down       but       didn't

g ive      me      any     indication             that          there       might       have been               a    list       of a n y

casualties.                 1 wasn't             given          any    i n f o r m a t i o n at             all.          1 was          j us t    told

to    go      to     the B o y s       Club       just          down       the    road          on       the    cor ner.             He     said         he

would         contact        me       there       if       he    had a n y        inf orm at io n and                     he    g av e     me      his

name       and       the    number          of    th e      Police Station                      and       said       if    I had any

problems             with    transport                or    a n y t h i n g , then              I should             r in g     up.         I think

1 would            have     got       into       the       Boys     C l u b at         about               p.jn.          I was          given a

cup      of     tea a n d       spoken           to    by a m e m b e r           of    the          S a l v a t i o n Army.                I rang

h ome      again and            told        them       the       position and                   then       j ust      waited             the r e .        I

was      joined          by a S o c i a l         Wo r}£e_r,                                         .     She       said       t hat       she

would         tr y    to    get       as    much       information                for       me       as     possible,               but     even         she

c o u l d n ’t get          any       information                from       the       Police.

The      only        piece       of    i n f o r m a t i o n we            got    was       at       about          8.45       p.m.       when

s o m e o n e , a woman who                     I don't          know,       read       out          about          8 or       so    names         of

people          who      wera     injured             but       were       alright.              I don't             think          anybody          in

the      hall        knew any          of       them.

We    didn't          get       any more           information               unti l         the          early hours                of    the

            I am       the    sister        of    Richard J O N E S .

            I am a Liverpool                 F o o t b a l 1 C 1 ub     supporter, although                     I have           only

            visited          their       ground,        or    others     on o c c a s i o n s ,      but        each       time       w i t h my

            brother,          Richard.

            My    brother,          Richard,           was    a season        ticket         holder       at    Liverpool             F .C,. a n d

            on S a t u r d a y 8 A p r i l         1989,       Richard        bought         two    tickets          for      the     semi­

            final       of    the F.A.           Cup    w h i c h was    to    foe p l a c e d      at    Hi 1 l s b o r o u g h ,

            Sheffield             Wednesday        F.C.

            The       t i cke ts were        I think          six   pounds       each and           were       for    the        standing

            area       in L e p p i n g s    Lane.           I paid R i c h a r d       for    one       of    the    tickets           which
                                                                                                                                      PAGE

he    then      g ave      to me          and       X put       it     in m y     purs e.           1 did          not       examine       the

ticket.

On Monday            10 A p r i l         1989,          Richard        rang      to    say       tha t      his       girlfriend

Tracey CQX             also         wanted          to    go    to    the m a t c h      and       asked          if    1 could       try

and    get      another             ticket          for    her.

My father            went       to L i v e r p o o l           F.C.     on F r i d a y       14 A p r i l         after       it    had    been

announced            on    the       r a dio        that       tickets        were      still       available.                 This

ticket         cost       £12 and was                for       one    of    the    stands.              On    the       same       day,    my

mother         came       home       wi t h a ticket,                 having       bought          it     from         someone       at

work                                                                                     Liverpool).                    She    bought          it

for    its      face       value          of £ 1 4 a n d         it w a s       also     for       one       of    the       stands.

Although            1 don't          know which                ticket       was    for       which        st a n d ,     I ca n      say

that     one        ticket          was       for    the N o r t h S t a n d           and    the       other          for    the    West

I took         possession                of    both       these       tickets          and    put       them       in m y      purse,

together            w i t h my       own       ticket.           Richard          said       that       at    some       stage       he

would         try    to    swop          one    of       the    tickets         for     a Leppings                Lane       standing

area     ticket           so    t hat         Tracey       could        be w i t h      us    and       then       probably          sell

the    other         one       at    face       valu e .

At a b o u t        7.35       p.m.       F r iday        14 A p r i l ,      I made         my    way       to S h e f f i e l d     by w a y

of    train         and Ri ch ar d             p i c k e d me        up f r o m S h e f f i e l d         Railway            Station,          the

intention            being          to    stop       overnight             with Richard             and       Tracey          at

                                Sheffield.                 We    went       out    for       one    drink          and       then    back       to

the    house .

On    the m o r n i n g         of S a t u r d a y         15 A p r i l       Richard         went        out      without          having

eaten         breakfast             and       exchanged          the       £.12 t i c k e t       with a friend                of    his

whose         name     I d o n ’t r e c a l l .                Richard        came      back       with       the       standing

ticket         for T r a c e y .              1 d i d n ’t see          him     give     the       ticket          to T r a c e y ,       so

I assume            he m u s t       have       kept       it    himself.

R i c h a r d ate         scrambled             egg       on    toast       for    l u n c h at         about          1.15    p.m.

                                                                                                                                       S520

and    had a        cup       of    cof f e e .        Richard           said      that          it w o u l d      probably

take    about          15 or 2 0 m i n u t e s            to      get     to      the       ground       and       so we        set     out

at    about       2.10        p.m.       in T r a c e y * s       car w i t h Ri c h a r d              driving.

Richard          had made           an agr eem en t            with          some       friends         to m e e t       t h e m at a

pub    to    sell       the        ticket        he    had     left          to    someone          they knew a l t h o u g h                  I

d o n ’t b e l i e v e       Richard         knew       the       lad     himself.                I don't          know which

pub    it w a s        although            1 do       know     that       it w a s          on    the    other        side       of

the    City       to    the        football           ground.

We w e n t       into       the     pub,     but       Richard           said       his      f r i e n d s w e r e n ’t

the r e .        Then       someone         came       u p to       us       and     asked         if    it was       us    t hat

had    the       spare       ticket.             Richard          said       yes     and         sold    the       ticket        for

face    value          of £14.             I have       no     idea who            it w a s        he    sold       it     to.        We

stayed       for a q u i c k             drink        and Ri ch a rd           had      a    pint       of    beer, although

I c a n ’t say w h a t              sort.

We    stayed        in the          pub     for       about       15 m i n u t e s          or    so a n d      then       left

for    Hillsborough Football                           Ground with                Tracey          driving.            We    parked

the    car       in F a r r        Lane     intending             to w a l k       the       rest       of    the     way.

On    the    way       to    the     ground,           we w a l k e d a f e w               streets          and    began        to

notice       a    build        up    of     other       fans       making          their          way    to     the      ground.

It    took       us a b o u t       ten m i nu t e s         to    reach          the       ground       and       the     closer          we

got,    the       more       people         there       were.           On     the      way       the r e ,     I d i d n ’t see

any Police             Officers            wit h any         of    the^fans,                although          when       the     ground

was    in si ght,             I did        see    one     officer            d i r ecting          traffic.

We    got    to     the      ground         together           and      1 think             the    ground          was     on    our

right       hand       side.         We     turned        into         the     entrance            of    the       ground        and       I

was    quite        surprised              such a       large          crowd       of       people       standing           at    the

front       of    the       g r o u n d.     I d i d n ’t k n o w w h i c h                 turnstile           we w e r e       to    go          in

via,    but       because           of     the    amount          of    people          there        I c o u l d n ’t e v e n          see

the    turnstiles.                  Although           people          were       obviously             moving,          there        d i d n ’t

seem    to       be a n y      obvious           movement          forward           towards            the     entrance.              I
                                                                                                                                         PAGE
                                                                                                                                         S520

became       aware       of a        lot     of    people          coming          behind          us a n d        as    the       crowd

built       up,    we    started            to    get     pushed            forward.               Although             we    managed

to    stay    on       the    r i ght       hand       s ide      of    the a p p r o a c h         w a y we        were          being

jostled       and       pushed         a n d we        tried       to       hold    onto       each       other          but       kept

being       separated           by     people          pushing.

By    this    time,          I saw        some     blue        metal         gates       and       we    were       being          pushed

against       these          ga te s .       There       was       a Policeman                on    horseback                in the

middle       of    the       crowd about               S or       10 y a r d s      from       the       gates.              He

appeared          to    be    trying         to    split          the       crowd a nd was               shouting             to

everyone          to    get     to     the       right.           At    t his      point ,         I saw       the       gate       open

inwards.               Loads      of      people        outside             were    shouting             open       the       gate       and    I

saw maybe          three        or     four       people          go    in.        When       the       gate       opened,          I saw a

P o l i c e m a n was        holding         on to       it a n d           then    he       closed       the       gate.           As    this

was    going       on the         crowd          began       to    push       harder          and       1 was       pushed          up

against       the       fence        at     the    r i ght        hand       side       of    the       gat e.          1 was       right       by

the    gate,       almost         against          the       gate       post.           Tracey          was    r i ght        next       to me

on m y      ri ght      hand      side       and Richard                on m y      left.           I could             see       some    f ans

sitting       on t o p of            the     wall       behind          the       gates       inside          the       ground.           I

d i d n ’t see         any Club S te wa rd s                 outside          the       ground,          but       there          were    two

other       Policeman           on     h o r s e b a c k.         They were             positioned             more          at    the    back

of    the    crowd.             1 w a s n ’t a w a r e            that       they       came       into       the       c r o w d at      all.

The    pressure          from        people        pushing             began       to    increase             more       and more             and

X was       beginning           to     get       frightened.                 My    left      a r m was         trapped             at    my

side     against         the      fence          and    so     the      gate       was       just       at m y      back.

At    this    point,          Richard            said    t ha t        if    the    gate       opened          again          he    would

have     to m a k e      a     run     into       the    ground.              I was          getting          more       and more

frightened             and    t his       was     the    only way             I could          see       of    not       getting

seriously          i n jured .

The    gate       then       o p e n e d,    this       being          about       five       minutes          after          the

previous          occasion.               I would        say       this       gate       was       about       9    f eet         high and
                                                                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                                                                       8520

maybe       10 or        12 f eet           wide.           T h e Pol, i c e m a n      opened       the       gate     just       a few

inches       and        the      f an s     inside          had     been asking            him      to    open     it     up b ecause

people       were        being         crushed          up a g a i n s t        it.      As    he    opened        it a b o u t         half

a    dozen       or    so     f an s      rushed and              grabbed        the     gate       and    pulled         it      open.           I

d o n ’t k n o w w h a t           happened            to    the P o l i c e m a n .          The    crowd       surged           forward

straight          away and             I had       to       really        force       my way        sideways          and against

them    to       prevent           being         crushed against                 the     fence.           I was       then        pushed

into    the        clearing            through          the       gateway        by     the    ground,          but     once       I was

inside       that        area,         I was       able        to    stand       c l ear      and    there       was      no      pressure.

I stood with Richard                         in the m i d d l e            of    the     clearing          to w a i t        for       Tracey

and within             a minute             or    so    she       had     joined        us.

Richard          said       that       we    would          have     to    go    in v i a a         tunnel       t hat       was

directly          in f r o n t         of    us.            I w a s n ’t a w a r e       of    any       other    way        of    getting

to    the    terraces              either         left       or     right.         I d i d n ’t s ee a n y            signs

indicating             where        we      should          go a n d      I d i d n ’t see          any Policeman                 or

Stewards          t h e re to          direct          us.

We    started          to w a l k         down     the       tunnel        towards         the      terracing.               Nobody          w as

pushing          a n d we w e r e           walking          normally.            There        were       quite       a few        people

in t h e     tun n e l ,         but      I was        relieved and              surprised           that       n obody was

jostling          there          because          I had        feared         it w o u l d     be    the       same     as     outside

and    I was          s t il l     a bit         shaken        up.        I did       notice        about       t h ree      people          on

either       side        of      the      tunnel        urinating             against         the w a l l .

We w a l k e d        out     of    th e     tunnel          and     onto       the     terracing.              I d o n ’t k n o w

which       side       of     the      tunnel          we w e r e .        X wasn't           aware       of    any     divide          to

go    one    side        or a n o t h e r         a nd,      in fact,           X w a s n ’t e v e n a w a r e          that       it w a s

divided          in th ere.               I d i d n ’t see a n y P o l i c e m e n               or S t e w a r d s at            the

mouth       of    the       tu nnel.

We w alk e d          down       the      terrace           a few       steps      to    try     and      find a space                 to

stand       towards           the      front.           Tracey          was     standing         to m y        left     and       slightly

in f r o n t      of me a n d R i c h a r d w a s                   slightly          behind        me    to    the     right.              Then
                                                                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                                                                      S520

I was        suddenly          shoved          from       behind and             I was       thrown          forward       down        the

steps.           I was       losing        my       footing           and     stumbling          but     managed          to     k e e p my

feet.           I was       still       being        pushed           forward and            into       people       in f r o n t       of

me.        The       surge     seemed          to    stop and           created         a gap         behind        us.        Tracey

had     fallen         down     b e h i n d me           and a        l oad    of     people       pulled          her    up.         She

shouted          tha t      s h e ’d lost J^e r            sJ t q e    and      I could       see       it    to    the    side        of me

a    few     steps         down.        I couldn't              reach         it,     but    somebody           picked         it up a n d

gave       it    back       to her.

I ’m not         certain what              happened             then,         I just        became       aware       of    being

gradually             pushed       down        towards          the     front.          The      closer        I got       to     the

front        the      more     pressure             increased.                I wasn't        pushed          into a n y         barrier

at    al l      and    I was       turned around                  by the         pressure          of    the       crowd.         I

couldn't             turn    b ack      round,           I was        trapped and            couldn't          move       backwards

or    sideways.              I couldn't              see    Tracey            or R i c h a r d     and with          the       crowd

pushing          so    hard,       I was        literally              face      to    face      with        someone,          a half-

caste        and      I couldn't           see       past.            I knew        I had     been       pushed a          long w a y

down       the       front,     but       I didn't          know        how      far.        The      pressure           was     so

intense          I f elt      as     if    I couldn't                 breathe,         although          I was       screaming              'I'1

got     to      get    out *.

This       went       on    for a f e w m i n u t e s             and       I was      screaming.              People          were

looking          at me,       but       nobody           could move            at     all.       The    half-caste               lad

seemed          to    be g o i n g      down        to    the     floor,         but    somehow          he    got       back     up.

I began          to    feel     faint          and       thought        I was         going      to     pass       out.        Then     I

j ust      heard       someone          from        the    side        of me        say,     'Get       through          there

love*.           I turned          round        to m y      s ide       and      just       stepped          up a n d     out     onto

the     pitch.             I don't        know       how     it       happened and            I don't          know       if     I went

throu gh a gate               or     if    the       fencing           had     collapsed,             I just        found        myself

o n the         pitch.        As     that       happened,              1 was        aware     that       the m a t c h w a s           in

progress,             but    p r io r     to    that       I didn't            have     any      indication              t hat    the

game       had       even    started.

As    I got          onto      the        pitch       I wasn't           aware        of    anybody          at    all       to m y       left

and      I ’m not         sure        if     there       was a n y bo d y           on m y       right.            I saw       that           a

t e levision             camera was              about       two y a r d s          in f r o n t       of m e      and       t hat

it w a s          pointing          at     me.         I saw        t hat       the     goal      net      was     j ust      on m y          left

hand         side       and    then        I walked          off        to    the     right       a short          distance.                  I was

just         standing          facing         the      pitch        and        people were            filing         past     me     both

fans         and Policeman.                   It      d i d n ’t    seem        to be      a     rush      or a n y t h i n g        but          I

was      a    bit       dazed and wasn't                       paying          t hat m u c h      attention.

At    this         point,          a Policeman                 said          to me, “C o m e       on l o v e , " a n d s t a r t e d                  to

walk         w i t h me       to    the      right.

I could            see    the       line      of      fans       just        going      over      the      w a ll,      th rough a gap

in the            fence       and     into       an    empty        part       of      th e K op .           There didn't             s e e m to

be a n y          panic       about        them       or a n y      rush.

As    s o o n as         I saw        them       going       in    I stopped               and    said,       "I'm       not     going                in

t h e r e ."

By    this         time,       I was         further         over        to    the      corner        of     the       pitch.         I just

stood         there       then        for    what        seemed a very                  long      time.           I remember              I was

crying            but    I c a n ’t r e m e m b e r a n y t h i n g             much       going        on a r o u n d        me.         1

remember            a    P o 1icewoman telling                     me    to     go a n d        sit     on     the      pitch        a n d it

was      then        1 realised              the      game     had       stopped.                I sat       down,       but     stood

back         up a g a i n      because           it w a s      wet.           A man was           comforting             me    and     while

I was         standing             there      I realised                people were              being       carried          onto        the

pitch and               being       l a id    down.

I have            got    no    i d e a h o w l ong          I had        been       standing            there,          it    seemed

ag e s.           Then    someone,            I have        no     i de a who,          said      to    go a n d        stand        at           the

s id e       of    the    pitch.

I walked             with      the        lad w h o      was       comforting              me    across       to       the    side        of          the

pitch         on the          right.          Another          man       joined        us a n d       started           to    comfort              me

and      the       first       man walked              off.        This        man     stayed         with        me    for    some           t ime

and      he       t o l d me       hi s    name       and    g a v e me        his     details          as                                ,1

friends        in the         tragedy.

I described            both Richard                and       Tracey          to    him and           he w o u l d     keep        popping

off    to     try and         find      them and             his m a t e s .          He       also     t o l d me     that           when       he'd

s e e n me     in the         crush         he    couldn't           remember             seeing        what     happened              to me

as    h e ’d p a s s e d      out      and       came       round       on    the     pitch,           being     revived              by a

Policeman.

I s t ill      kept        standing          the r e ,       I d i d n ’t m o v e          at     all.         I was    aware              of

more     and more           people          being       brought          out       onto        the     pitch.         I was           aware

of    people        trying        to    revive          them,       but       some        of    them were           just      l y in g

there.         It w a s       a   long       time       before          I saw a n A mbulance,                    but    I saw              one

come     from       the     other       side       of       the    ground.            It       stopped         in f ront          of       the

t e r race     I ’d come          out       of    behind          the    g o al     mouth.

I could        hear        the N o t t i n g h a m          Forest       fans       chanting            ’Y o u ’re all            a    load

was    going        on,     and     saw      three          Liverpool             f ans    running         down       the     pitch

towards        them,        but     they were               stopped          by    t he P o l i c e .

I was       still      aware        of a         load m ore          people         being         carried        onto       the

Policemen           across        the       pitch,          but    nobody          was     bothering            them.         I could

what     to    do,     but        I thought            that       if R i c h a r d     was       l o o k i n g for     me,        I ’d          be

cars.        I said        I didn't             know          know     where          the    car       was.       She      said        t hat         I

told    her     that           I'd lost            my    brother and                 his    girlfriend,                but       she       s t ill

When    I was        standing            on     the       side,         I saw         that       maybe       about         45     or       so

unconscious           or    dead.             I was        aware           of    one m a n        though,             l y i ng    face          down

on the       pitch.              He h a d      no       shirt        or t r o u s e r s      on a n d         his u n d e r p a n t s

were    pulled        down.              But       he w a s     just        lying      there        on        his o w n          left

there.        There        was      nobody           round           him.            I assumed          that          he wa s         obviously

dead.        I saw a small                   boy     c l ose         to me       who       looked       in a b a d way,                    but

there    were        loads         of    people           working           on him,          I don't             know what

happened        to    him      .

After    that,        I went            round        the       ground           looking          for    Richard.                 Someone             was
                                                               ivl          ?
w i t h me,     I think            it w a s                   |"s b r o t h e r       who    is a L i v e r p o o l              Policeman

and    there       was     another            man.         We        went       round       the    b ack         of    the       stand and

came    back       down     the         tunnel          onto         the    terracing.                 We    l o o k e d all           around,

b ut   I couldn't           se e        any     sign          of R i c h a r d        or    Tracey.              By    this       tim e,            the

terraces        and      stands          were        empty.            We       looked       around          outside             by    the

turnstiles           but    still            couldn't            find       them.           We    decided             it was          best          to

try a n d     find       the       car,       went        outside           and made             off    towards           where            I

thought       it was.              It w a s n ' t         too        long       before       we    found          it.

I stayed with              the      car       for       about         half       an    hour       or    so,       waiting             to       see       if

Richard       or T r a c e y m a d e            their          way     back          there.        When          they      hadn't,              I

thought       I'd     better            rin g       home       to     tell       my    parents          that          I was       alright.

I was    hoping          that       they        would maybe                 tell       me    that       Richard            had        rung          up

and was       looking          for       me.         Anyway,           they          hadn't       heard anything                      a n d my

mother       a s k e d me      to       go    back        to     the       ground          and    try       to    get      some        more

information.                 So    I went          back        down      to    the     ground           and    I saw          two

Policemen             there.         I asked            them       if    there        was       any w ay       of       finding          out

who      was     injured          or m a y     be       d e ad.         They       a s k e d me       if    I'd     lost          anybody

and      I said        I had       lost       my     brother            and    his     girlfriend.                  They          wouldn't

give       me a n y        information and                   said       I must        go    to H a m m e r t o n R o a d P o l i c e

Station.              They    started          to       give                  , one        of     the      lads w h o w a s          with

me,      directions           how     to      get       there.            I was        a    bit       upset        and       said    to

th e m,     "Do y o u m e a n         there          is      nobody       here,"           and       they     said,          "No    love,

there's          nobody       there."              So     we      made    our w a y         to H a m m e r t o n R o a d            and    I

was      seen     straight          away       by a D.C.                O'BRIEN.            I gave          him     the       details          and

descriptions               of R i c h a r d        and       Tracey.           He     took        them      down        but       didn't

give       me    any       indication          that          there       might        have        been a       list          of    any

casualties.                 I wasn't          given any             i n f o r m a t i o n at          all.         I was          just    told

to    go    to    the B o y s       Club       just          down       the    road        on     the      corner .           He    said       he

would       contact          me    there       if       he     had any         info rm at io n and                 he    gave       me    his

n am e     and    the      number        of    the        Police         Station           and       said     if    I had any

problems          with       transport             or a n y t h i n g ,        then        I should           ring       up.        I think

I would          have      got     into       the       Boys       C l u b at a b o u t          6    p.m.         I was          given    a

cup of          tea and       spoken          to    by a m e m b e r           of     the       S a l v a t i o n A r my .          I rang

home       again and          told       them       the        position and                then       just     waited             there.        I

was      joined        by a S o c i a l        Worker,                                                She     said       that       she

would       try       to   get a s       much        information               for     me       as    possible,              but    even       she

c o u l d n ’t get a n y           information                 from      the P o l i c e .

The      only     piece       of    i n f o r m a t i o n we            got w a s      at       about       3.45        p.m.       when

someone,          a woman who              I don't             know,      r ead       out a b o u t         8 or        so    names       of

people          who    were       injured          but       were       alright.            I don't           think          anybody       in

the      h all    knew any          of     them.

We    didn't          get a n y m o r e        information                until        the        early       hours          of    the

               could     i d entify who             we    had       lost.

               We    were    then       taken       to    the            ground       by      coach     and as ke d           to          wait     as h o r t

             My    brother         was    employed       as    an Office           Based       Salesman working           for

                                                                                        He   was   always     fit a n d

             healthy.

             c a n't    recall       the     last      time    t ha t   Richard          attended       the   Doctors,      but    I

             don't      think       he    had    ever    changed address                 from when       he w a s   at    Sheffield

             University,            although          I don't       know     his    details.

             Richard         was    5'11.5",          stocky    b u i l d.         He    had    brown    hair     which    he w o r e

             s h o r t , blue       eyes.        He    did    not   wear      glasses.

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY


Thank you for your faxed letter of 18 October, covering one of
the same date to Mr Heyes of the HSE.

Mr Heyes replied to your letter on 20 October.  So far as the
barrier itself is concerned, the West Midlands Police, who are in
charge of the enquiries on behalf of the Director of Public
Prosecutions, have directed that the barrier should be preserved
in its present form as further investigation of it may be
necessary in respect of those enquiries.

In your letter to me you mention paragraph 243 of Lord Justice
Taylor's Interim Report.

The documents which were presented to Lord Justice Taylor in the
course of the public Inquiry in Sheffield consisted of:-

     i.        the "summary of HSE investigation to date - 8 June
               1989" (ref SMR/343/235/01 );

     ii.       "an investigation into various technical aspects
               prepared for the court of Inquiry," submitted by Dr
               Nicholson on 13 June 1989 under the reference
               i r /l /m e /m m /89/1;

     iii. a diagram of the capacities of pens 3 and 4, which
          includes the totals of 822 for pen 3 and 871 for pen 4,
          referred to by Mr Collins on 26 June (Day 28, page
          20D).
Lord Justice Taylor's conclusions in paragraph 243 were based
upon the documents mentioned above, the circumstances prevailing
in pens 3 and 4 as a whole (in particular the numbers of
spectators), inspection of the broken barrier at the Health and
Safety Executive laboratory and discussions with Dr Nicholson.

If Dr Nicholson produces any further report for Lord Justice
Taylor, Lord Justice Taylor will consider what circulation, if
any, should be given to it.

    Dear Sir

    HnXSBQROOGH INVESnGKTICN

^     refer to your FAX of 18 October 1989 concerning samples of barrier 124A from
    Hillsborough. HSE has received no previous correspondence from either yourself
    or your Engineer (Elrond Engineering) on this subject. In view of the
    impending criminal investigation, I have been instructed by Mr R Whalley,
    Secretary to the Inquiry, to retain the broken barrier in its present
    condition. Samples cannot, therefore, be made available to the parties
    involved in civil action and I have been asked to refer all such requests to
    Mr Mervyn Jones, Assistant Chief Constable, West Midlands Police. I will
    forward a copy of your letter to Mr Jones.

    I suggest that you submit any further requests to Mr Jones or Mr Whalley.

    Yours faithfully




    P F HEYES

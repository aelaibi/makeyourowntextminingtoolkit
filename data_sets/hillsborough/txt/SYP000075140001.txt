    I have       been       shown a diagram                    of      the     ground and           the     turnstiles             I r ef er

    I can o n l y          d e s c r i b / the          s c e n e as a         l a r ge     throng     of     p e o pl e     closely

    packed       trying         to      get      into        the    game.




    The    two    others          and myself                 joined       into        the    crowd     outside          the

    wrought       i ron        gates.            A     lot    of    c r u s hi n g,       pushing      and       shoving         w as    taking

    pla c e .     I would            sa y     it w a s        a general            f re e    for    all     to    get      in.        There

    was    no    queuing          whatsoever.




    Directly          in si d e      the w r o u g h t         i r on    g a t es      were    tu)C or m a y b e           three        mounted

    people       to    stop       pushing              etc    but      th is    w as      having      no    effect         due     to    the

    pressure          of    the      crowd.



    Whilst       we w e r e       s t i ll       outside           these_       ^es         they were         s hut     by      the m o u n t e d

    from    being          crushed          it       caused        people       outside        Ime     gates       to      be    crushed

    against       it.          I s aw       t hat       several         people         agaymst        the     gates        were       very

    much    in d i s t r e s s .            I do        not    think         the     Police        had any a l t e r n a t i v e          but

    to    open    the w r o u g h t           iron       gates         which       they      did.

 All     three        of    us m a n a g e d       to    get      to    the    r i g ht     of    the       pathway       leading          to

 the     turnstiles A               to G.




 The     c r u s h at       this      p oi nt      was     tremendous              and again           I saw       people        in

 Numerous         calls        were      coming          from       the      crowd       for     the    gates       to    be     opened

 including            myself.           I f elt         the      common       sense        thing       to    do w as      to     open      the

 gates        because        the      situation            outside           was    no     doubt       dangerous          for

 youngsters            and     o ld     people          in the         crowd.

I honestly              believe        t hat      the     opening           of    the    l a r ge     b l ue    g at e w as     wise

and     the      only        thing     to    do    due     to     the       crush       outside.           However         I feel

tha t    having          d on e   t h at     supporters            should          not       h a ve   beena l l o w e d        to    go

through          the     tunnel        in s u c h        larg e    n u m b er s .




I believe              the    ground        to    be     unsuitable              when Liverpool                FC a r e    playing         a

big     g am e     ther e.        The       standing         r oom a l l o c a t e d          for L i v e r p o o l       is j ust

not     sufficient.




I do     not       h a ve m y      ticket         n ow    due     to    giving          it    to                          so   t h at     he

could      purchase a ticket                      for     the     re— a r r a n g e d m a t c h .          I believe           he    has

obtained           a    c ash     refund         however.

                      TAYLOR REPORT : HOME OFFICE CONSIDERATION OF RECOMMENDATIONS
                      FOR NEW FOOTBALL RELATED OFFENCES.


                      Mr Atkins has seen Mr Baden's minute of 1 August confirming
                      the outcome of the Home Secretary's considerations on this
                      matter.

                      In relation to the three new criminal offences (at para 2 ),
                      the Minister has asked whether the second and third are
                      really enforceable.

                      You will also see from his manuscript note that he hais
                      queried whether there is going to be a statement on this and
                      if so he would like to add something on discipline in clubs
                      and on the field to support Lord Justice Taylor's
                      recommendations. I understand that there is unlikely to be
                      any announcement on this at present but I should be grateful
                      for further advice on these two points.

                      Mr Atkins has noticed that the Home Secretary was given a
                      demonstration of evidence-gathering techniques at football
                      grounds (para 5 of the Home Office note). Mr Atkins would be
                      keen to see this. I should be grateful i £ you would ascertain
                      whether this might be feasible.

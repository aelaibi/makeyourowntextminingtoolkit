    As requested, I am sending you some b r i e f notes r e l a t i v e to the v i s i t
to Hillsborough by the Working Party on Friday, 19th May, 1989. These notes
are purely,my own personal observations and in no way represent the o f f i c i a l
view of the City Engineer's Department since the Department's only input
with respect to Football Ground Areas i s in the making of T raffic Regulation
Orders to a s s i s t resid en ts in t h e i r parking problems and ensure reasonably
fre e t r a f f i c flow. The Police deal with a ll aspects of crowd control and
t r a f f i c control on th e public highway during match times.


      My observations are those of a person who does not attend foo tb all matches
and, th e re fo re , will view the s itu a tio n from a d if f e r e n t angle. Since the
majority of the time, during the v i s i t , was spent at the ground, my observations
are r e s t r i c t e d to t h i s area which, of course, i s the City Building Surveyor's
domain, but I am sure Mr. Bush will not take exception to me making my comments
more or le s s from a layman's point of view.

     My comments are as follow s:-


1.   During discussions on the coach, you quoted figu res fo r the numbers of
     t i c k e t s issued, capacity allocated to Liverpool fans, number of t u r n s t i l e s
     a v a ila b le , and Mr. Bush advised on t u r n s t i l e c a p a c itie s . I t would appear
     th a t t h e o r e ti c a l l y i t would take some 3 | hours to get the Liverpool fans
     in to the ground. I f the fig u res and c alcu latio n s are c o rr e c t, then c le a r l y
     3 | hours i s an unacceptable length of time and i t would, th e r e f o r e , appear
     t h a t th ere were very serious problems t h a t would have been apparent at
     th e planning stage. I would have thought th a t 1£ hours would be a more
     r e a l i s t i c fig u re to work to and th a t i f t h i s was not achievable, then th e
     question should be asked was Hillsborough the c o rre c t choice of ground
     fo r such an event?


                                                  / continued
                                     - 2 -


Moving in to the ground I f i r s t examined the "anti-surge" b a rrie rs and
found th a t t h e i r height measurement to the top of the r a i l s varied
between 36|" to 4 8 |" . The 34 steps in the te rra c e ware approximately 3"
high and in at l e a s t one lo ca tio n , the b a r r ie r s were so close to the
next step th a t t h e i r e f f e c ti v e height was reduced by 3". My height
i s 5'8" and the location of the: b a rr ie r s on my body varied between the
lowest part of th e trunk and the mid-chest position. The e ffe c t of these
b a r r i e r s under pressure I thought may cause one to topple over or s l i p
under. I would have thought t h a t t h e i r height should have been more
c o n s is te n t, probably a t th e higher level with a second r a i l at the
m id-position. Most of the r a i l s were of 2|" diameter tube which would
exert a g rea ter pressure on the body than the rearmost r a i l s which were
of a f l a t cross section and would consequently be less harmful.


I next examined the gates leading from the te rra c e s to the pitch. These
gates a ll opened outwards towards the pitch and were controlled by a heavily
constructed latch mechanism containing a powerful spring. This mechanism
could only be operated from th e pitch side. Additionally, they were
f u r th e r secured by a su b s ta n tia l chain and padlock. Their width varied
between 29" to 37" (bear in mind the standard width of a door in a house is
30") and th ere was some v a ria tio n in t h e i r "effective" height. More
importantly was th e d i f f i c u l t y of using some of the gates caused by the
f a c t t h a t the pitch perimeter wall had only been p a rtly cut away fo r the
gates and.in some cases had not been cut away at a l l .
S ta rtin g with the gate on the northwest te r r a c e to the Leppings Lane side
enclosure and working round to the gate next to the Police control box,
the s itu a t i o n i s as fo llo w s:-
The concrete perimeter wall had not been cut away which meant you had to
nego tiate i t s f u l l length of 39" from the te r r a c e with a drop of 31" to
the pitch side. Although the height of the gate was 84", the e ff e c tiv e
opening was only 70" due to th e gate overlapping the wall. Above the
gate opening was a 12" section of mesh angled at 45° towards the te rra c e
and spiked which tranversed the f u l l length of the pens.

                                             / continued
                                      - 3 -



The next gate which was only 29" wide required a threshold height
of 18|" to be cleared.
The t h i r d gate was fo r Police use and was situ a te d between fences 74|"
a p art, spanning between the perimeter fence and the rear of the pens
(-tjiere were gates at the rea r allowing Police access to. -the, adjacent
pens). The width of the gate was 33" but in t h i s case, wooden steps
were provided reducing the threshold height to 13".
The fourth gate was 33" wide with a 6|" concrete step upto a
threshold height of 9".
The f i f t h gate was 37" wide but in addition to the concrete perimeter
w all, which was 44|" high, an additional mesh panel was fixed giving
a t o ta l threshold height of 4 8 |" .
The sixth gate next to the Police box was 30" wide with a t ''eshold
height of 12".
There does not appear to be any logical reason for the va ria tio n in
threshold heights, but quite obviously t h i s would have a dramatic e ff e c t
in t h e i r usefulness in emergency.       These gates c o n tra st sharply with
those a t the Kop end which had r e l a t i v e l y easy access with one step up.
(Widths varied between 29£" - 43").
I am not c le a r as to the purpose of these gates. Were they ever intended
to be used in an emergency to allow fans onto the pitch?               I f not, then
th e re was c le a r ly no escape from the pens. I f they were fo r emergency
use, then why seriously reduce t h e i r capacity.with threshold obstructions
and p r a c t ic a ll y render them useless in two lo ca tio n s. Additionally, why
chain and padlock them which only causes f u r th e r delay in t h e i r use in
an emergency. The only reason I can see fo r locking them i s in the event
of a pitch invasion, fans may attempt to open these gates from the pitch
sid e , thus causing more tro u b le .
I suspect t h a t they were never intended fo r emergency use, but only to
be Used fo r Police purposes or to remove someone taken i l l . In any
case, t h e i r design would hamper these a c t i v i t i e s .

         I t would appear to me t h a t in a ll buildings where the public are
         admitted such as t h e a t r e s , Public Houses, h o s p ita ls , o f f i c e s , m ulti­
         storey car parks, e t c . , e t c . , adequate emergency e x it s must be
         provided and properly signed, but none of t h i s , i t seems, applies
.-'.v,       rfootbal 1 grounds. I can ’Only assume th a t tor                                      1
         f a c i l i t i e s would weaken the "defences" and make i t e a sie r to get in
         without paying and reduce the effectiveness of the segregation of rival
         fans. There appears to be double standards, safety f a c i l i t i e s are
         provided when i t i s r e l a t i v e l y easy to do so, but not when they a ff e c t
         law and order and th e "nuisance" value of matches being disrupted.

   4.    I next moved outside the ground to view the arrangements fo r gaining access
         at the Leppings Lane end.
         There were no physical means such as b a r r ie r s to segregate queues to
         the t u r n s t i l e s so t h i s would depend e n ti r e l y on Police c o n tro l. I t is
         understandable t h a t as kick o f f time approached and many fans were
         s t i l l outside, order would eventually break down and increased pressure
         would be put on the perimeter wall by fans desperate to get in . I
         understand t h a t a t t h i s p o int, the Police were concerned t h a t fans would
         be crushed against t h i s w all. I t i s apparent now t h a t the wall has
         become unstable (as evidenced by the f a c t th a t i t i s now shored
         up on the inside) and the w all, i t s e l f , may have come down on fans. I
         would, th e re fo re , suggest t h a t such walls adjacent to t u r n s t i l e s should
         be constructed as r e ta in in g walls to reduce any p o s s i b i l i t y of t h e i r
         collap se.
         When fans had passed through th e         t u r n s t i l e s , th ere did not appear to
         be any method whereby they could be evenly d is tr ib u te d to the groups of
         pens situ a te d e it h e r side of the Police access "corrido r".             Maybe
         t h i s was intended to work by means of t i c k e t numbers but c le a r l y i t
         failed .

                                                    / continued
                                           - 5 -



I f i n a l l y moved to the t u r n s t i l e s at the Kop end which are situated
adjacent to a very busy and f a s t dual carriageway and separated from
i t by a footway in th e region of 4m wide (I did not measure i t ) .
There were no pedestrian gu ard rails and I would consider t h i s i s a very
hazardous s itu a t i o n with a large concentration of fans so close to
f a s t moving t r a f f i c . APf'esiaWafe1y; th i s - 'i s why only’ some of the
t u r n s t i l e s were in use on the day.
To provide more space in f r o n t of the t u r n s t i l e s would require the
temporary closure of one carriageway of the dual carriageway. In
my opinion i t would not be f e a s ib le to operate a contra-flow system
due to the number of t r a f f i c sign als and pelican crossings, apart from
the inherent po ten tial accident problems associated with these schemes.
I t would be sa fe r to d iv e r t the t r a f f i c to another route, but given
the volumes concerned, i t i s most unlikely th a t any other route would
be s u ita b le . I f th e carriageway adjacent to the ground was reduced
to one lane, t h i s would provide some additional space but fo r safety ,
timber baulks would need to be used to protect pedestrians. This would
not be p ra c tic a l fo r the r e l a t i v e l y short duration of time required
fo r the r e s t r i c t i o n . I f any reduction in capacity was made to the dual
carriageway, I think i t would c re a te t r a f f i c jams. Normally when such
closures are made fo r say sewer works, they l a s t fo r days or weeks not
hours and t r a f f i c has a chance to r e d i s tr i b u t e i t s e l f . I t i s unlikely
t h a t the general public would accept the t r a f f i c chaos caused by such
closures f o r reasons of entertainment and not e ssential road works.

     REPORT ON THE PUBLIC MEETING HELD AT ST. GEORGES HALL ON 25TH MAY, 1989

     (Officer contact:   Andrew Pink 225 2334)
     CS/123/89

1.   The meeting, attended by approximately 150 people, was held in order to give
     football supporters the opportunity to discuss the Hillborough Disaster and
     the way forward for football.


2. Invitations to speak were sent to the following:-
   Dr. John Aston       Liverpool University
   Rogan Taylor         Football Supporters Association (FSA)
   Gordon Taylor        Professional Footballers Association (PFA)
   Jack Dunnett         Football League (FL)
   Graham Kelly         Football Association (FA)

     Unfortunately the PFA had no representative available who could' attend the
     FA declined the invitation and the FL were advised that as they were giving
     evidence to the Lord Justice Taylor Inquiry it would be wrong for them to
     express views beforehand, particularly at a. public meeting.


3. At the invitation of the Chair, Councillor Harry Chase, the M.P. for Liverpool
   Broadgreen, Terry Fields, reported to the meeting the efforts of the
   Liverpool M.P's in the House of Commons with regard to the disaster.


4. Most speakers expressed the view that the tragedy was preventable and that
   legislation together with money for ground improvements were required to
   ensure that football grounds are made safe.


5.   Several supporters took the opportunity to make statements about the Hillsborough
     Disaster, which will be submitted to the Taylor Inquiry via the FSA.


6.   The enclosed statement presented to the meeting by the Chair was unanimously
     approved.

STATEMENT TO THE PUBLIC MEETING ON THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

FROM CLLR. HARRY CHASE, CHAIR - HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER WORKING PARTY


1.   This meeting welcomes both the City Councils Hillsborough initiatives and
     the work of the F.S.A in their submissions to Lord Chief Justice Taylors
     Inquiry.

2.   We recognise the need to take-up those issues already identified with
     Hillsborough recognising that the events of April 15th were neither a
     tragedy parochial to Liverpool nor a set of events which happened in
     isolation. Therefore we need to look beyond the immediate tragedy to the
     issues of spectator safety and facilities; the threat to civil liberties
     inherent in the I.D. schemes; and the involvement of supporters in effecting
     change within the football industry.

3.   We condemn the media coverage of Hillsborough and its aftermath which
     portrayed the city of Liverpool and its football supporters as the
     perpetrators of the tragedy which took place. We call on the Hillsborough
     Disaster Working Party to investigate and contest such smears and vindicate
     the heroic role of fans in the life-saving evacuation of Hillsborough.

4.   We are determined to effectively involve football supporters in resolving
     the problems they have long-highlighted. For too long we have, as
     supporters tolerated the entrenchec. dictates of clubs and administrators,
     and the blind prejudices of Governments.

5.   The inertia of the F.A in the wake of both Hillsborough and the Government's
     proposed I.D. scheme bears testament to a body which neither recognises
     nor understands the concern and protestations of fans.

6.   We call for a full independent investigation into the administration and
     financing of football to expose the greed and mismanagement that permeates
     the professional game.

7.   We urge all football fans to co-operate with the work of the City Council
     and the F.S.A in their efforts to ensure that those responsible for
     Hillsborough are exposed and brought to justice and that football\i future
     is secured through meaningful representation of supporters within the
     football industry.

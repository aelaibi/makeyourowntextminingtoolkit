     ^^J^will raise the second point at the same time because
  it p h y be easier for you to deal with the two things
  tp^rether.    At those hearings we dealt in considerable
 Retail, in fact infinitely more detail than we would
^/normally deal with in an Inquest, with events after the
/pathologicalcause of death and I did it because I realised
  that the families were desperately anxious to know what had
  happened immediately after the incident.     My question ,to
  you is - and I think this is what we need to deal with and
  get right - bearing in mind wehave only dealt with the
  question of who, whenand where and that we have done it in
  considerably greater detail than one would normally expect
  to do, why is it necessary to review that very'activity
  again which I think is what you are really, asking me to do?
       MR. KING:   Sir, as I understand the individual
  Inquests there was not an inquiry into, in the individual
 cases, the i^act .of^-Mie organisation rescue on the
 survival or otherwise of the particular loved one.    All
 that was done when one looks at those Inquests was to
 identify the time of a first sighting, that is to say,
 somebody who seemed to be unconscious, and of a time when
 effort was made to resuscitate in any given case and then
 death was certified.    In many of the cases there was a
 large 9aP of time after 3.15 pm when it was not
 investigated at the individual Inquests the nature of the
 services available to deal with those being brought off and
 if I can just give one or two examples of that, you have
 examples of people who are brought off at 1522 and it is
 said that there was an effort to resuscitate by a lay
 individual and then that particular lay individual is not
 heard of again, or the officer is not, and it is said that
 the given loved one arrives at the temporary mortuary.
 There has been no investigation directed to the global,
 organisation of what happened immediately after they were
 brought off the terraces. Certainly I have been through
 the individual transcripts and there does not seem to be
 any evidence directed to that issue and those witnesses who
 were called could not deal with those issues, sir.
   ✓
     MR- CALLAGHAN;      Sir, you know the representation on
previous occasions and I should say it is my intention to stay
only for today and in the case of one or two witnesses- I
will not take any major part in the Inquiry.
     THE CORONER:   I have got no particular objection to
you being here-   X thought you probably would not be here
continuously but I wanted to be sure about that>   Perhaps
the best thing would be if we started with you really and
if we started with appropriate legal submissions.   It may
be easiest if we start with Mr. King and then we will move
across the table, so to speak.
     MR. KING:    Sir, my primary legal submission is
directed to your preliminary ruling on the last occasion
that this Inquest should be concerned only with events up
to about 3.15 pm.    As I understand your ruling, sir, it
was designed to ensure that this Inquest would only be
concerned with events leading to the crushing on the
terraces and the first arrival of an ambulance.
       As you know, sir, the families whom I represent are
very anxious that this Inquest should deal with what to
th«>rn is a very major issue, as to how their loved ones came
by their deaths, namely how the services and the rescue
services, and those attending with the emergency, coped
with it immediately after people were brought off the
terraces because death was not certified in many, if not
most, cases until after 4 pm.     Sir, I do not know if you
have had an opportunity to read these.     I did ask those
instructing me to send to you statements from each of the
families whom I represent setting out a number of
individual questions directed to their own Inquest but also
incorporating in their individual cases why they were
anxious to learn of what happened between the time there
was a first sighting of any loved one being brought off the
terracing and the pronouncement of death.     I do not know
if you had an opportunity to read them.
     THE CORONER:   I have briefly because these did not
arrive until Friday afternoon but I have looked at them.
     MR. KING:    What I would like to do is take you
through some individual examples in order to persuade you
that this is a question which ought to be gone into at this
particular Inquest.    I do not know whether that is a
format you want to follow or whether you want first to hear
some other representatives as to their attitude to my
submission.    I am happy to go into considerable detail
about it.
     THE CORONER:   There are several points which have
occurred to me and the first point I would like you to deal
     THE CORONER:   Are you suggesting that the cause of
death in respect of these individuals is not in fact the
pathological cause of death which we have been given but due
to a novus actus in effect by person or persons whose
evidence you have not yet heard?   __......
      MR. KING:. Certainly-the families, and I put it' as7
openly as this, sir, and putting it bluntly, cards on tiia
table, are not convinced at all that had there been a far \
more sensible, logical organisation of the rescue services, \
of the major disaster team being brought in, of proper       )
medical equipment being available, of proper triage being
carried out, that those measures, had they been there, in
several cases, would not have resulted in the survival of
their loved ones.    They cannot - obviously they were not
t^ere - produce through me concrete evidence of^that at this
stage but at every stage of an Inquiry intg.this disaster,
and, this certainly is true even in the Baylor Inquiry, that
particular aspect of the disasterhas never properly been
gone irrfco.__.___
      Again putting it very simply to you, sir, most of the
families I represent feel there has been a complete blanket
 (not a deliberate blanket) been held down over what happened
after they were brought off the terraces and before
individuals were certified dead and there has been no effort
made systematically to analyse what was the organisation at
the time for the rescue, what might have been, and what could
have made a difference.    A very simple example again is that
I am instructed there is evidence of Dr. Gumpert given at the
Inquest that without an electrocardiogram we can never be
sure whether or not there is a pulse and when dealing with
individual loved ones taken off the terraces and simply dealt
with by lay people, the absence of such sort of equipment
means that one would never know whether or not that
individual was alive or dead at that stage.    it is a
matter - and I do not mean this pejoratively - which is swept
under the carpet as if to say, "All we are interestedin is
the immediate crushing leading to those being broughtoff the
terraces”.    I cannot put it any more firmly than that, sir.
     THE CORONER:    You have put it very plainly and I
appreciate it.    I will give a ruling on your application in
a few moments but do you want to develop it further?
Obviously I want an opportunity to hear from your colleagues.
     MR. KING:   Have you the individual statements which
were supplied?

     THE CORONER:   I do have those in front of me.   I would
not want to go through all of them but if you wish to pick
one or two as examples I am prepared to listen to you and
indeed it also makes it easier for everybody else.
     MR. KING:    Sir, if you were to turn to No. 11 to start
with, which is the submissions to you of the Jones family,
Richard Jones, I do not know whether you     have beengiven one
or two documents.    I have two documents in relation*to Mr.
Jones one headed "Dear Miss Steel” and one headed "Dear Mr.
King”.
     THE CORONER:     No. 11, did you say?
     MR. KING:   Yes, sir.   Ibeg your pardon, sir, it is
No- 10.   Sir, if you look --
     THE CORONER:    Mr. King, may I just stop you for one
moment because something has occurred to me, and I have been
reminded, which I ought to say to the Press before we go
further?    The session this morning is being heard without
the Jury and the reason we have not got the Jury is because
we are dealing with legal points.    That means no doubt that
you can report we are in session but you should not actually
report what is being said.    You will no doubt be familiar
with the provisions of Subsection 2 of Section 4 of the
Contempt of Court Act and I say you must not report what we
are discussing.    If we had wanted the Jury to hear we woulc
have had them present but we do not wish them to hear at thi
stage-   You may, when' we have finished the Inquest, if you
still feel it is a reportable and interesting aspect then, c
course, that is a different matter but for the moment please
do not repoirt the content of the legal matters we are
discussing-    Mr. King, I am sorry to interrupt you, would
you continue?
     MR. KING:   Sir, the document I am looking at and I
appreciate those alongside me are not looking at any documei
but it is just to 'help you is one headed to myself, "Dear Mi
King"-
     THE CORONER: . I have a document headed "Dear Miss
Steel” dated 22nd October.
     MR. KING:      Sir, this is dated 7th November-
     THE CORONER:   I have not got it I am afraid.     It is
not in front of me.
     MR. KING:   I apologise for that and I will take.you
through, if I may, through five points which are raised by
Mr. and Mrs- Jones.   Sir, they make the basic point that tl
report into the death of their loved one, Richard, was
certified at 1600 hours in the temporary mortuary and,
therefore, so far as the family are concerned, so far as
evidence is concerned, they presume, as they say they must 1
entitled to, up to that time the evidence of death is not
clear as having already occurred.
     Point No. 2, sir, is extracted from the evidence given
by Dr. Gumpert at the Inquest already held here and in fact
it was evidence given on the occasion-of Kevin Tyrrell and,
sir, it is a quotation from his evidence which yOu^giay
recall:      .                                       \
      "I^would like to observe that feeling the carotid pulse
     is quite difficult in someone who has a low blood
    /pressure as would have been here.    In fact it can be so
   / difficult it is impossible and you have to have an
  i electrocardiogram on to know whether the heart has
     stopped or not."
    .Then there is the statement of Mr. Eccleston, y?hich is
certainly a statement in the large bundle of .statements given
to the West Midlands Police, and indee^J4rir^!iccleston gave
evidence to €Be~Tay-lor Inquijy--inrwfilch he says this:

                                  /"For an extremely long.
   , "tor an extremely long time we were without any form
     of medical equipment of any description.  I still
     cannot understand why the local health authority s
     major medical disaster team were not called upon.  I
     understand that all health authorities in this
     country have a major disaster policy.  It is
     impossible accurately to estimate the difference this
     would have made in saving life.  I do, however,
     believe that the Liverpool fans should have been
     given the chance".

And the question raised by Mr. and Mrs. Jones is this,
sir:  there was a major incident vehicle.  Why was it not
called?  Lack of equipment undoubtedly resulted in deaths.

     Sir, I. pause there. Of course, Mr. and Mrs. Jones
were not thare and of course they are not experts, but you
will see, sir, from the basis of that evidence they are
firmly of the belief that one cannot just ignore an
inquiry, an inquest, into that aspect.'" - - ^

      S i r , number 4 point made by Mr. and Mrs. Jones comes
from the statement made, again in the       large bundle, sir,
from Dr. Glynn Phillips, particularly      where he says that
after 3.15 p.ra. he gave mouth to raout resuscitation to a]
man for 15 minutes, and just as he w>>c giving up the heart
sprang to life, and after that the man started breathing
ori his own.     We know that this does not prove this man
lived, or if he did he may have been brain damaged, but
the point we are trying to put across to the coroner is
that after 3.15 p.m. not all the people who were later
certified dead were necessarily dead.

     Sir, finally Mr. and Mrs. Jones direct your attention
to the long statement which I am sure you have seen, sir,
of Or. John Asaton in which there is a series of reasoned
critical comments on the disorganisation of the medical
and the rescue attempts, honest and in good faith though
they were, after the people were brought off the terraces.

     Sir, that is Mr. and Mrs. Jones in tnose comments and
in the short letter, sir, which you have, which you have
already referred me to, sir, they emphasise an issue as to
the failure to implement triage after the disaster
happened, again, concentrating on what Dr. Gumpert has
said as to the fact that without an electro-cardiogram it
is not possible to know wnether a heart has stoppped.

     Sir, can I move on from Mr. and Mrs. Jones* comments
and just give you one or two more examples - I appreciate
that in many ways it is repetitious but it is making the
point - to number 14, sir, which is in the case of William
Roy Pemberton.

     THE CORONER:    And this one is addressed to you.
    , MR. KING:  Sir, it is not often that instructions         to
Counsel are given in advance to the Tribunal, and I
suspect, sir, that it is not a wise move i n m o s t cases.

     THE CORONER:     You are probably right.

     MR. KING:   Sir, it was an effort in the relatively
short time since we were before you to put before you the
various matters which the families wished to place before
you and it was felt this was the easiest way to do so,
sir.

        Sir, if I can then turn to Mr. Pemberton,- you will
see that he makes the following points:            the report into
the death of his loved one Roy that life again in his case
was pronounced extinct at 16.00 hours hours, and again in
the absence of medical evidence to the contrary, the
family can only assume that their loved one was alive
until that hq.ucj -and sir,' if you then go to paragraph 3 of
that d o c u m e n t you will see there is'"iaN reference^tb: tne
statement of Mr. Saxton of the St. J o h n 1s Ambulance
Service, because he refers to the resuscitation bf a young
map at 15.50 hours, indicating in the heart-f el t:-' view of
Mri% Pemberton, as with all the other families,./that death
m u 3 \ have occurred after 3.15 p.m.

                                  in paragraph 4, to the
statement-bf Dr / ByrnTe when) he quotes that he was
approacndd by a senior PoM.ce Officer and asked to start
certifyingv^the dead^aLS-^nere may be some still alive, and
sir, again, ttre-proint has been made that as we only know
for certain that death was at 4 o ’clock, to ignore these
concerns as to the adequacy of the attentions and the
rescue efforts after 3.15 is to not investigate what could
well have been a major reason for why somebody died and
did not survive.

     The final point on Mr. Pemberton, sir, in paragraph
7, is the question he asks:  why was it that the very
seriously ill and dying, and those who appeared to be
dead, were not taken to the hospital in the very first
available ambulance, and he raises himself the issue as to
why the serious accident response vehicle was not called
out to the stadium, as he understands to be the case.

     Sir, if I can then deal with perhaps one example of
minutiae, of detail, if one turns to the cases of the
Hicks sisters, of Victoria and Sarah Hicks* sir, wnich is
at numbers 7 and 8 in your list, sir, you will notice the
case of Victoria, that on the face of the summary wnich
was produced at the Inquest prior to today, there was a
gap in time.  There is a gap in time between 15.21, which
was the time when Police Constable McGuinness rescued
Victoria from a pile of those who unfortunately had
fallen, and 15.23 when Mr. Turner was seen helping
Victoria out onto the pitch.

      the arena as a sort of side wind,    Beyond that, sir, it is
      obviously a matter for you.
           MISS ADDELMANN:   Sir, X have no observations or submissions
      about the point, and I can do no better than echo those remarks
  B   made by my learned friend, Mr. Catchpole.
           MR. RUSSELL:   X too endorse those remarks-.: None of us,
      other than my learned friend, Mr. King, has seen the original
      statements, and so are being invited to comment upon a course in
      the dark because we have not seen the nature of an example of the
      material he now seeks to rely upon. I recognise it is a matter
      for you, and if you decide I don’t take a stance one way or the
      other.
           THE CORONER:   Shall I then deal with this point? Is there
      anybody else wants to say anything on this issue? Mr. King?
           MR. KING:   Sir, only to emphasise that it is not a side
      wind which I am embarking on. I am seeking to address causes,
      contributory causes to. the deaths, and I am concentrating on
      that, and it is in that context I have inyited rhe Court to look
      beyond 3.15, and certainly we are dealing with it from the point
 D    of view of possibilities of novus actus. yes, I accept that.
           THE CORONER:    I have listened hopefully with attention, and
      perhaps I ought to say this to you, Mr. Russell, before I go on.
      I know you have not had the advantage of seeing xne letter, but
      it is only fair to say Mr. King in his summary of the points as
      far as I can see summarised the points which his clients were
      making entirely fairly. There is nothing extra in the letter, so
      to speak, except connectiiig words',— basicaiiy.. That is for your
      reassurance, if Ijpafr"f>ut it like that.
              Throughout, and in fact almost from the word "go" on the
       15th Apjpil, 1989, when I first learned about this incident, one
       of the"underlying criteria which I tried to apply in thinking
       how; "to set about dealing with the Inquests was to as far as
       possible treat the Inquests as if they were completely
      ^standard, if I can put it like that - it is a horrible word -
       but completely normal Inquests. The fact that it was national
       news, that it was 95 young people, that it created a terrible
       amount of anxiety, pain and so on, in some ways is unique
       because of the numbers, but each individual death I dealt with
       families are in exactly the same situation, and I tried to
       think and I still try to think, what and how would I set about
       if I had had a road traffic incident or a works accident as
       opposed to an incident in a football stadium. I have thought
       back on many occasions to say a road traffic incident where
       somebody might have suffered a serious head injury. That
       person may well have baen at the road side for X number of
       minutes while one was waiting for the ambulance services to
       attend. They may then have been taken by an amoulance to a
       hospital. They may have gone into the resuscitation room.
      ^They may have been worked on by the doctors. They may have gone
       into^hQspital and they may have then died two, three days, may
       be longer~~ct£ter the incident. Qri^lt-erTiatively. you could have


 H
  a situation where by chance the road traffic incident occurs <
  the'road and a doctor happens to be. He walks up to the
  patient, looks and says, "I am sorry, the injury is so.severe
  "that this person is dead". Or you could have a situation whe:
  the person has this road traffic incident and is taken into
  hospital and is certified dead on arrival.
         In none of those instances would I as a matter of routin*
   call evidence of what happened after the incident ;itself was
   concerned, and indeed, the pathologists in_ the example which :
   have used would have given.-as-'cause of death“serious head inji
   for instance, or mul~t±j5ie injuries with fracture of)the skull
   something of thatT nature. It seems to me that -the fact that ■
   person may sufVive an injury for a number of minutes, or hours
   even days,^is not the.-question which—I -as Coroner -ha-vfe^ to
   consider. My- task is to establish who the person was         i‘am
   sorry- *to repeat this - where he died, when he died and how he
   died. It is from my understanding of the pathological evldem
   the overwhelming pathological evidence is and was that the..pe<
   died as a result of crushing or traumatic asphyxia. DiffeirWil
  .words were used, but the sense was always the same. The ! \
 / underlying problem which these poor men and women were subjedl
i? to was an inability to breathe.                               i
\       That does not mean to say that some of them did not /in fi
 \ respire for a period of time or even have a heart beat /
  thereafter, but the damage was done, and indeed, both Dr.
  Gbjppert, Dr. Slater, Prof. Usher, who dealt with this questior
  an axerall point of view, all in fact said, as I understand t l
  eviden©^, exactly the same.

      One of thS~i>©i-Bts-r-41rT—K±ng, which you have made is that
 because ;a person has not been certified dead until a particujl
 point in time, one must therefore assume that^.he""is alive. Wj
 the greatest.respect I don’t accept that ,asa reasonable -
  reasonable" is a vsry ~unk-i-nd---w©-F-d— -"asT a proposition which I
 would take. Indeed, if you think about it for a moment I am £
 you would agree with me, if a body were to be found in a
 macerated state one would call a doctor who would
 certify death, but it would be a little bit illogical to
 assume that that particular body was actually alive
 until that point.

      The issue of death certification and the timing of it is
 important, because one wants to have if possible certainty. 1
 is the first thing. Secondly, the conventional way of
 establishing a person is definite dead is that a medical man s
 so, but to draw the conclusion that until a medical man has ss
 so a person is alive is in my view an impossible proposition t
 maintain.




                       /I do understand the anxiety.
                                                                  17

A


          I do araderstand the anxiety^i^ici^a^stsof the families
    ha ye about this issue, but as I have already said:.^the
B   overwhelming medical evidence, the pathological evidence,
    and that is the crucial one I am interested in, is___th& \
    damage that caused the death was done due to the crushing.
         Now I picked the arrival of the first ambulance not/
    because there is anything magical about that but because^
    when we look at the videos we can actually see that^-aiid it
    is a convenient marker, that is all.    If the f.irst
    ambulance had arrived at 3.30 I would haye'-picked that time.
    It is simply intended as- a marker, but, and this is an
    important point, I considered the medical evidence. The
    medical evidence was that once - I am not quoting verbatim -
    but the sense of what Professor Usher said, and, indeed, the
    others as well, was that once the chest was fixed so that
    respiration could no longer take place, then irrecoverable
    brain damage would occur between four and six minutes.
    That is the point.
         Now I felt that the evidence which I had heard and in
D   the light of what I had read that the latest time, the
    latest, when this permanent fixation could have arisen would
    have been approximately six- minutes past, which is when the
    match stopped.     It almost certainly was before, but let us
    assume six minutes past, add another six minutes to that,
    that is twelve minutes past and then as I say I.went on to
    find a convenient marker beyond that point in time.        In
    other words, what I am trying' to say -is-. I. did no^ just pick
    the arrival of the first ambulance entirely ibut-^of the blue,
    I did try and consider iju*i*»e^£K’C o T ’'
    had heard what couid-^have been the latest time wfiena^the real
    damage was doles’"'
          T fa-ave—a.1ready indicated that at the - I will call^^ein'
    the ititerim inquests if I may just for the sake of a name -v
    we/did endeavour to give a great deal more information or >
    evidence than we would ever do in a normal inquest and in
    that sense I broke my own rule straight away because^! satid
    I wanted to treat this matter as if it were ajipiBptltely
    standard normal road traffic incident|_jj^ytscrlike*      I
    didn’t, I gave a great dealoj^Jja^orflation for various
    reans^ns which I donlJb^a^eajr^ogo into now.
         As an aside I can assure you that within the limits of
    our ability the summaries and the evidence which was given
    was an accurate reflection of what people said and if there
    was a gap, for instance, as has been suggested in some cases
    which is unexplained, the reason wasn't because there is
    some hidden evidence which we have put under the curtain,
    but because we didn't know of it or couldn't find it or it
    doesn't exist. The truth of the matter, of course, is that
    people weren't being watched individually continuously by
  somebody else recording what was happening.     It is entirely
              h S i° wheth®rxor n°t there is a witness or
  uhJ rf    k     happens (a) to have been with a person, (b)
  whoremembers who he is and (c) has some idea of the timing.

                y°U who were there wil1 remember that in some
         u   j a great defll of evidence with regard to what

 thoL               £ecause      ls very sad particularly for
       £a™ilies where we have got so little to share with
 them, but we are living in the real world and in some cases
 there was overwhelming - for instance, there were dozens of
 photographs as you know - some of the people were all over

                                              rlSht to say
    tu<     u* i. calling witnesses it may be that some of
the things which worry you aay be dealt with t o a m i n o r
degree but it is certainly not my intention to allow us to
stray down that path.
     I have also got to say, it is only right, that what I
think you are really inviting me to do, Mr. King, is to hold
a further judicial inquiry into matters into which, as I
understand it, are outside my authority and scope.    I also
seem to recollect, although Lord Justice Taylor s Inquiry
isn’t - as I have already said to you at the business
meeting, I don't really want to spend too much time on it -
but I do recollect that the emergency services were very
well represented at that Inquiry and, indeed, a lot of
discussion, from my reading of the transcripts, did deal
with the issues of the medical response.
     Whether or not that was satisfactory, whether Lord
Justice Taylor should have done more, whether somebody else
should look into that when we have finished that is nothing
to do with me.   However, as far as I am concerned, my
intention is to stick with what I gave you as my initial
preliminary intention.
     I have, of course, already looked through the documents
which you sent me and insofar as in one or two instances
witnesses are mentioned, if I think, and, indeed, I have
thought that one or two of these in fact I think three at
the moment, you have goJ^JaH^i»4^~--^It wouId perhaps be
advantageous to caHr^tfiose persons anB'~ftre^are making
appropriate arrangements^— Pieas^^o^t--Jthin^'^th91 I have
said, "Good griefr fifty pages, I am not dealingwi&h that,"
I have already spent quite a bit of time thinking aboQt it
and I will hopefully have another look.       If I were - which;
is highly unlikely - in any particular instance to feel we
ought to go a little bit further down that line because
there is a specific point to be made in any particular
instance, then I will if I think it necessary, tell you.
However, I think it is unlikely from what I have seen and
what I have read and for the reasons which I have given you.




           MR. KING:    Sir, thank you for that.
                                                            52




      Secondly, those of you who were here for Lord Justice
■Taylor s Inquiry, we have been provided with the big rooms
 on tne other side of the main staircase - one is called
 the Mandela Room, the other I have forgotten the name of.
The Mandela Room has been laid out with a big screen like
 this, so if there is an overflow or somebody wants to know
 what is going on but does not want to be in the Court,
 they can go and watch and hear.  As I understand it, if we
 use, for example, a video, you will see the video but you
•will not be able to see the Court, because we have only
 got one camera.  In the normal course of events you will
 be able to see and hear what is going on in Court but in
 certain circumstances you may have a slightly limited
 recording, because of the facilities - w'e have had to draw
 the line somewhere.

     The other room has been laid out and is intended
really mainly for the families, if they want to withdraw
and sit and be quiet.  That is one half of it and in the
other half we have built small partitions, cubicles, so if
any of you wish to speak to your clients you have got a
measure of privacy but they are not soundproof, so you
have to judge how good they are and whether you want to
use them.  They are there for your use if you wish.

     At the back of the hall I think there is a list of
restaurants, which has not been put up by me, so if you
want to go and look and see what is what and where you can
go - and no doubt there are dozens of others as well - we
are right in the centre of town so it should not be too
difficult to eat and have refreshments.

     We have had quite a long session.  I hope you will
forgive me, but I wanted to get on with it.  We are going
to rise.  Is there anything - yes, Mrs. McBrien?

     MRS. HcBRIEN:   I just wanted to say something
relating to the other matter earlier in the day.  I was
wondering if the time limits could be extended, in the
individual inquests, the time limit of 3.15 for the day in
question could be extended for individual inquests but not
apply to the generic inquest?

       THE                answer to that is that 'iE-~t^ok Mr.
 King's submission to incorporate that point and I hS’Vf
 said,,what I want and am not going to change my mind orKit.
 I-am going to stick to what I have said, 3.15 or          )
;thereabouts, so I am not extending it but-we did say that
 if there are any specific errors which you were going to '
 bring to my attention in the summaries, that I would
 consider it, and that would apply to you as well, of
 course, as far as your boy i s c o n c e r n e d .

     MRS. McBRIEN:    Thank you
                                                                          53

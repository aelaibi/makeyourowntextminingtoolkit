   At 8.00 am on Saturday 15 April 1989 I paraded for duty at the gymnasium,

   Hillsborough Football Stadium where I assisted with minor administrative duties.

   I had previously been informed that my main duties for the day would involve the

   recording and custody of property taken from the supporters at the 'Liverpool'

    side of the ground, ie: the Leppings Lane end of the Stadium assisted by Police

   Constable Campbell.




    Shortly after tty arrival at the ground I was briefed by Inspector Bennett and

    directed to a Portacabin which was situated at the rear of the West Stand,

    adjacent to the fence that runs from the rear of the turnstiles 1 - 9        and Gate A

    to the North Stand.        The cabin was situated approximately 4 yards from the gate

    in the fencing allowing access to and from the West Stand enclosure, with the

    door facing that gate.        The window to the left of the cabin looked out on to the

    rear of turnstiles 1 - 9       and A, the window to the right looked out onto the

    ladies toilet situated at       the far left of the West Stand.




    Following the briefing in       the North Stand, myself and Police Constable Campbell

    went to the Portacabin and were involved in preparation for 12 noon when the

    turnstiles were opened.




    Once the turnstiles had opened I could see that a steady stream of supporters

    were coming through the turnstiles to the North Stand.




    At approximately 2.35 pm Inspector White entered the Portacabin followed by PC

     Graham Wright of El Sub Division, he was carrying a boy of 13-14        years who was

     in a collapsed state, the      boy was clutching a 'Ventolin' inhaler   and I was   aware

     that this was medication for asthma sufferers.       After using his medication,     the

     boy recovered slowly and I was engaged in conversation with a man aged about 20

     24 years who was looking after him and another boy of similar age.         I can
                                                                                    2J     2P   &




recollect looking at my watch and saying that it was 2.40 pm and there was still

plenty of time for them to get in.    He said   'It is murder out on Leppings Lane

and people are being crushed'.    After 5 to 10 minutes the boy had recovered

sufficiently to walk and they left the cabin.




Whilst I was in the cabin with the young boy I was aware from the radio traffic

that extreme problems had developed outside the turnstiles and I heard requests

for the gates to be opened, although I did not hear who made the request.          Also,

around this time Gate A began to    'bounce' and it looked as if it was about to

collapse inwardly I noticed that a further serial of men had lined up at the

rear of Gate A supervised by Sergeant Higgins.




People at this time were coming through the turnstiles in a very distressed

condition and also very slowly.




At 2.50 - 2.55 pm I saw that Gate A was being opened by police officers and

supporters streamed through.     This was shortly followed by fans attending at the

gate in the fence dissecting the North Stand entrance and the West Stand

enclosure requesting entry into the West Stand.      Conversely,   fans were

approaching from behind with North Stand tickets wanting access through the

gate into the North Stand entrance.     This was constant for approximately 5

minutes and the stewards on that gate began to get flustered and I was vetting

the tickets for them and getting them through in both directions.        Events

settled down and I then heard a radio message requesting all available manpower

to report to the front of the West Stand terrace on the playing area.          I

locked the Portacabin and remained outside.      There were still a few fans wishing

to get through the gate.


                                                         \

I was then aware of constant radio traffic and I believe it was Chief Inspector




                                                                                                    /
Sumner requesting that a temporary mortuary should be set up, this was shortly

followed by fans reappearing in the enclosure of the West Stand and one in

particular looked to be in a very distressed state and was being aided by some

other supporters.    PC Campbell went to him and after a few minutes indicated

that an ambulance was required.     I attempted to contact the control to request

an ambulance but because of the constant traffic I was unable to get through.




I told PC Campbell that I would go down to the gymnasium or Police Room and

rquest one from there.    I ran down under the North Stand and I could see through

the entrances what appeared to be hundreds of supporters and police officers on

the field of play.




When I reached the gym the St John Ambulance had gone and personnel were in the

process of clearing the gym of tables and chairs.     Outside the gym was Inspector

Martin and his serial awaiting instructions,    I quickly obtained two officers

from him with the intention of carrying the injured man being cared for by PC

Campbell back to the gym area to await an ambulance.




I went with the officers back to the West Stand enclosure but PC Campbell and

the injured man had disappeared.     I released the two PC's to return to their serial

and I remained outside the portacabin.     At this time there were many supporters

milling about the enclosure with some hurling abuse in my direction, as I was at

that time the only officer there.     I noticed that the Stewards who had been

manning the gates had removed their fluorescent waistcoats.




PC Campbell returned to me and informed me that she had got some supporters to

carry the man outside because she had heard the ambulances travelling along

Leppings Lane and that they had laid the man alongside some who were obviously

dead.   She then informed me that she was a member of the Casualty Bureau and I
                                                                            q s i s ^



directed her to the gym.




From that time supporters were returining to the portacabin to retrieve their

property,   flags, banners, penknives etc and after that procession had ceased I

cleared the property and returned to the gymnasium.




It was only that that stage did I realise the full extent of the disaster when I

saw the number of bodies on the gymnasium floor.




I took no further part in the police activity at the Stadium.

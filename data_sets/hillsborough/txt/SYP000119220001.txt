However       initially I wa s d e p l o y e d outside a w a i t i n g             i n s t r u c t i o n s should

we be nee d e d inside.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 . 4 0 p m    (1540)    I went    inside the g r o u n d w i t h my

Po l i c e dog and stood f a c i n g             the N o t t i n g h a m Forest s u p p o r t e r s wh o were

s t o o d on the Spion Kop.                  I w a s stood on the p l a y i n g a rea near             to the

goalmouth.

I n o t i c e d that at         this       tim e a number      of s u p p o r t e r s w e r e b e i n g brought

out       of the ground t o w a r d s          the Police      room at the b a c k of the North

stand,       some of these w e r e            on improvised s t r e t c h e r s a n d a p p e a r e d badly

h a v i n g bee n de tained by P o l i c e officers.

Th e m o o d of the fans,            m a i n l y N o t t i n g h a m Forest,   in the area         in w hich

I was stood was of a c a r i n g nature and most a p p e a r e d s h o c k e d at what

h a d occurred.

I p e r s o n a l l y did not h a v e a n y t h i n g to do wit h           in jured or d e a d persons.

Up until being stood d o w n                  f r o m the gr o u n d after d i s p e r s a l   of the

suppor ter s,       m y time w a s         s p e n t stood facing the fans on the Kop.

At 4.45pm        (1645)      I followed          the fans back towards            the c i t y centre area.

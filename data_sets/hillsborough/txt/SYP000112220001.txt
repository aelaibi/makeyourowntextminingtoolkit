a s k e d us w here        the     “ticket        touts" were.            They were         i n f ormed that we

had not       seen        any and we b e l ieved there were                     very few about.             Many of

the    fans were         surprised           by this,         and    i n f ormed us that        there were

many    "touts"         last year and they had had no trouble                               obtaining       tickets.

It was a p p a r e n t       that all        these      fans      had no tickets.             All    day    I heard

the    call    for      "spares",         "spares"       from L i v erpool         acce n t s as      they

directions,           o b v i ou s l y   rushing       to the       turnstiles.         A lot of Liverpool

The   only other      observation      I w i s h to add     is that       it was appar e n t        that

                 newspapers.            The remarks were made by two doctors who
                 attended Hillsborough as Liverpool supporters on 15 April
                 1989.        During the course of the evidence it became clear
                 that the first five criticisms by Doctor A related to events
                 in the area behind the Loppings Lane stand and terrace (day
                 25 piaiD).

                                   otherwise relatively fit i n d i v i d u a l s w e r e
                                   rendered hypoxic (lack of oxygen), the likely
                                   heart pattern is asystole (continuous line of

                                                      4
                   electrical activity with no effective heart
                   contractions) and not ventricular fibrillation.
                   The purpose of a defibrillator is to jolt a
                   fibrillating heart rhythm back into a normal
                   pattern.    The standard treatment for asystole
                   is CFR.   Successful CPI would normally produce
                   a regular heart pattern rather than ventricular
                  .fibrillation.

            iv.   However, given the length of time during which
                  most of the patients had been d e p r i v e d of
                  oxygen, even the use of a defibrillator would
                  not have made any practical difference (see Dr
                  P's s t a t e m e n t to t h e police, p a g e 7 "my
                  thoughts that in view of the length of time he
                  was pulseless it would probably be kinder if he
                  died.   I am sure he must have been severely
                  brain damaged by that time" and at the bottom
                  of the page "I looked desperately for somebody
                  not dead but seriously ill who needed help.        1

      ambulances is appended hereto.

2.   This equipment is intended for use by SYMAS personnel and
     not by third parties.

3.   Much of the equipment has to be kept with the ambulance
     for use on the journey to hospital.

4.   The primary purpose of the ambulance is to give immediate
     treatment to casualties and convey them to hospital.

          5.    Before each critical match the liaison officers from the

           PREAMBLE

           We expect that most of the matters set out below have been
           SS25K    already by the Tribunal, but we list them to demonstrate
           SYMAS   strength of feeling that the disaster should not have
           occurred, and could have been avoided.

           1*     CHOICE OF GROUND

                . A.

                        1.1   In e v i t a b l y , b eca use of need for segregation,
                              Hillsborough *a design was not safe to accommodate
                              one set of supporters if they had to enter the
                              ground at Leppings Lane.

                        1.2   There is an obvious bottle neck leading into the
                              outer perimeter gates and there is the added
                              problem of channelling the supporters into the
                              appropriate turnstiles for the north **-*nd, the
                              west stand and the west terracing.

                        1.3   It should be noted that the shortest distance
                              across the funnel leading into the outer perimeter
                              gates la only 24 metres.

                        1.4   One© the supporters gain access through the outer
                              perimeter gates those heading for turnstiles A-G

                              metres between the handrail leading down from
                              turnstile G and the edge of turnstile 16,                The
                              maximum distance across turnstiles A-G is only 13
                              metres.

                 B*    Turnstile Flow Rate

                       1.1    The Liverpool supporters were allocated
                              approximately 24,500 tickets for the semi-final,
                              covering the north stand and the west stand and
                              terracing,

                       1.2    Paragraph 47 of the Green Guide gives a maximum
                              notional rate per turnstile at which spectators
                              can pass through, not exceeding 750 persons per
                              hour,

                       1.3    Based on the figure of 23 turnstiles for 24,500
                              spectators, at the rate of 750 per hour, it would
                              tak® almost 1 1/2 hours for 24,500 spectators to
                              gain entry Into the ground.

                       1.4   If one then takes the figure of 7 turnstiles for
                             the 10 , 1 0 0 s p e c t a t o r s f o r t h e w e s t s t a n d

                             paragraph 47, it would almost take 2 hours for the
                             10,100 spectators to gain entry.

                       1.5   It s h o u l d b e c l e a r l y n o t e d t h a t t he above
                             estimates represent the minimum possible time to
                             allow spectators into Hillsborough based upon the
                             Green Guide figures.

                       1.6   The inadequacy of the turnstiles to accommodate
                             24.500 spectators appears to have been recognised
                             b y th e South Yorkshire Police and SWFC.     See
                             Transcript day 11 p38D~G,

                       1*7   In our submission it was absurd to believe that
                             24.500 spectators could have been safely allowed
                             entry through Leppings Lane in the time available.

          2.    FAILURE TO DELAY KICK-OFF

                 2.1   The senior officers inside the police control box
                       should have realised by 1430 hours that the crowd of
                       supporters outside the Leppings Lane entrance could not
                       got into the ground by 1500 hours even on the most
                       optimistic of flow rates through the turnstiles.

                 2.2   It therefore follows that kick-off should have been
                       postponed prior to or very shortly after 1430 hours,
                       an<3 indeed many people were under the impression that
                       kick-off had been delayed.

          3.    OPENING OF GATE C

                3.1    The decision to open Gate C was Inevitable in all
                       circumstances, but the failure to prepare and cater for
                       the resultant ingress of supporters into the concourse
                       behind the west stand and then onto the terracing, was
                       a clear and fundamental mistake by the police-

          4.    SIGNING AND LAYOUT OF CONCOURSE

                4.1    Once supporters found themselves in the concourse area
                       behind the west stand the directional signs onto the
                       terracing was so poor that it resulted in the majority
                       of supporters quite reasonably deciding that there was
                       no w a y o n t o the terracing other than through the
                       central tunnel.

                4.2    The situation was made worse by the presence of the
                       internal wall which although useful for a normal match,
                       probably dissuaded many supporters going to their left
                       after entering through turnstiles A-G and Gate c.

                 5.2   The emphasis In erecting the radial fences, perimeter
                       fence gates and barriers was clearly.on containment of
                       the supporters on the terracing, and for example we
                       would point to:

                               with no new uprights being constructed. ,

           6.    SjZE..OF GATES IN PERIMETER FENCE

                 The perimeter gates leading onto the perimeter track are
                 clearly too narrow for the purposes of emergency evacuation
                 onto the pitch area.

           7.    ESTIMATION OF TERRACE CAPACITY

                 The capacity of the whole of the west stand terracing, and
                 in p a r t i c u l a r p e n s 3 and 4, has been clearly wrongly
                 calculated.         Reference should be made to document headed
                 "Sheffield Wednesday Football Club west terrace - ideal
                 distribution of persons" for pens 3 and 4.          The Health &
                 Safety Executive has calculated that the maximum numbers of
                 spectators for pens 3 and 4 are 822 for pen 3 and 871 for
                 pen 4. Furthermore, if one takes into account paragraph 216
                 of the Green Guide, the appropriate capacities of pens 3 and
                 4 are substantially reduced, to 542 for pen 3 and 605 for
                 pen 4.

           8.    tACK OF ANTICIPATION

                 8.1   W h a t e v e r c r i t i c i s m s can be made of the Liverpool
                       supporters, it appears fairly clear that the South
                       Yorkshire Police should hove anticipated the s o r t .of
                       behaviour from the Liverpool fans which they alleged
                       took place on 15 April 1989.

                 8.2   In p a r t i c u l a r , this is borne out by the evidence
                       gathered by the South Yorkshire Police during the
                       course of the Inquiry, a n d ,served in the last week of
                       evidence given to the Inquiry.           This documentation
                       contains numerous reports of behaviour by Liverpool
                       fans during the course of the 1988-89 football season
                       which indicates a pattern of behaviour identical to
                       that which took place on 15 April,

                 8*3   The following are examples of such reports:

                           i. Humberside Police - Hull City v Liverpool dated
                              18 February 1989.

                              dated 12 December 1988.

                              dated 24 September 1988.

                 8,4    In addition, during the course of the 1987-88 season,
                        there is a report from the Hertfordshire Constabulary
                        concerning the Watford v Liverpool game which took
                        place on 13 February 1988 w h e r e 1 ,50 0 L i v e rp o ol
                        supporters arrived at the ground without tickets and
                        were allowed in.

                 SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE - FMLURS TO RECOGNISE THE DISASTER


           1,     SYMAS’ submission is that South Yorkshire Police were in a
                  position to identify the existence of a disaster by 1459
                  h o u r s at t he v e r y l a t e s t * In f a c t , as the attached
                  chronology shows, they failed to do so before 1505 hours and
                  failed to call SYMAS until 1508 hours.


           2,     In view of the unchallenged medical evidence it is SYMAS'
                   submission that those 9 minutes were critical, and of all
                   the claims that lives could have been saved, this is the
                   only one with any merit.

           3,     SYMAS' submission is that there is evidence to indicate that
                   supporters were being crushed to death by 1459 hours and
                   t h a t t h i s w a s e v i d e n t to a n y o n e w h o s e m i n d w as not
                   conditioned by the need to contain supporters within the
                   central pens.


           4,      It is 5V M A S ' subm*    that the persona who were in a
                   position to, and should have recognised the plight of the
                   persons in pens 3 and 4, are the police officers in the
                   control box, and those stationed along the perimeter track
                   in front of pens 3 and 4.

          PART B
          1.    SYMAS submit that the telephone call at 14.59 from Snig Hill
                to Ground Control by PC Waugh was not, as claimed by PC
                Waugh, prompted by overhearing the conversation between
                 Superintendent Marshall and Ground Control.

          2.    it is SYMAS' submission that the length of time that elapsed
                 between the end of the communication from Superintendent
                 Marshall and the making of that call (some 8 minutes) is
                 consistent with an urgent call being made as a result of
                 o v e r h e a r i n g s c e n e s of d e s p e r a t i o n and crowd distress
                 indicating a need for ambulances.

           3.   We propose to deal with each gate in turn in support of our
                 contention that in fact it must have been the cries of
                 distress from supporters within the perimeter fence and the
                 request by officers stationed at the perimeter gates which
                 prompted the call by PC Waugh.

           WAS IT GATE C?

           1.   Waugh alleges that it was Gate C in his statement and in his
                 evidence to the Tribunal.

           2«   However, his statement was not made until 27 June 1989,
                 after the existence of that conversation had been discovered
                 by Counsel for SYMAS.

           3.   In c h i e f (d a y 31 p , 11 I B } PC W a u g h s a i d t h a t he had
                 telephoned G/C "immediately after* the repeated requests for
                 the gate to be opened.

           4.   In cross examination (day 31 p.114D) PC Waugh confirmed that
                 he had made the telephone call "within seconds" of hearing
                 the repeated requests to open the gates.

           5.   There is no evidence from Marshall that he asked Gate C to
                 be opened on the third occasion.    In any event the evidence
                 is t h a t the t h i r d opening of Gate C was a controlled
                 operation not caused by a crush outside.   See:

                 - Bain: statement p.4 at the bottom of the page.
                 - Mr Macrell: transcript day 30 p.99E-F
                 - RJH2 i supporters still entering at a steady stream
                   (14.59.12),

                 The 8 minute time lapse between *Superintendent Marshall's
                 screaming for the gate to bo opened" (14,51.40) and the

     _un ! ui i   D r'.u uririL M L 1 #   .j~         rs   *         U D J iH iiO C Q D -




           telephone call made by PC Waugh (14,59.30) is not consistent
           with PC Waugh's making the call "immediately after" or
           "within seconds of" hearing the repeated requests. No panic
           or dangerous crushing evident from the evidence on the video
           {RJ12) prior to Gate C being opened for the third time.

           No evidence as to precisely when Gate C was opened for the
           third time and no evidence that the third opening was
           occasioned by any repeated requests from an officer for it
           to be done.
           SYMAS submit therefore that it is unlikely that it was the
           request to open Gate C which occasioned PC Waugh to make the
           telephone call at 14.59.


WAS IT GATE B?

When was Gate B opened?
1,          Gate 1 was under the control of serial                                          15 and Sergeant
            Bums,

2.          Stewards                            and            were also present at Gate l«

3.          The evidence was as follows:

                   ; Statement "Gate l not opened before kick-off,                                        If
            this is correct Gate B was not opened before 14.59.30.

                    (day 21 p.X28A) "Police ordered me to open the gate
            at 14,55, I said "No way tt n

            PC A I T K I N ; statement p.4 "Gate B opened.                                    200 supporters

            gate.    I looked at my watch it was 15,02."

            time) but PC referred to says Gate C already opened.

            RJH2 1 no exact time possible but certainly Gate B was open
            by ....

Could PC Waugh have overheard requests relating to Gate B?

1.         There is limited evidence as to exactly how Gate B came to
           be opened. The main evidence comes from Sergeant Burns.

                  in all the circumstances, and in view of the evidence that
                  has been given, we submit it is evident that conversations
                  relating to the Gate B to be opened could not have been
                  overheard by PC Waugh.

                  surprised them because it was towards their side per Aitkin
                  (day 17 p.62F-G).


            WAS IT GATE A?

            When was Gate A opened?
            i.    According to leading Counsel              for the inquiry Gate A waa
                  opened at 14.58 (day ...).
                   INSPECTOR SYKES; Statement p.7 "I have no actual time of the
                   next event, but would estimate it to be at 2.50 and I then
                   saw Gate A open wide."

                   SERGEANT HIGGINS: (day 17 p.92C) "Made a request that Gate A
                   be opened because I thought someone might be killed outside.
                   That message was received."   No evidence as to when this
                   request was made.

PC CAMMOCK; (day 29 p.38D-F) "Made my way to Superintendent
Marshall who was standing on the parapet. Asked permission
to open Gate A.

therefore submit not been heard by PC Waugh.

In any event we submit clearly not Gate A because the entry
through Gate A was orderly and controlled by a serial of
police officers directing the fans towards the north stand.
In a n y .event the weight of the evidence seems to suggest
that Gate A was opened because Gate C was opened and it was
thought that a general permission to open gates had been
given.
 We submit that in all the circumstances this is unlikely to
 have been the urgent and unusual circumstances to cause PC
 Waugh to act as he did*
 In any event there is no evidence of any requests having
 been made over the radio and no evidence that such requests
 were repeated before it was granted.


IT THE PERIMETER FENCE GATE TO PENS 3 AND 4?

 We submit this is the most likely explanation for PC Waugh's
 conduct.
 The evidence is clear from other sources that by 14.59 the
 disaster had already occurred.

the Leppings Lane terraces. One can see to the right of the
photograph the hack of the goal, the goal netting, and one
can see the gates In the terraces in the perimeter fence
open.   I think those gates are 3 and 4 # and at that time
there are a considerable number of people already outside
the perimeter fence. ? ... and your St John's people are
already assisting? - answer - correct."

Evidence from aerial 1 officers on the perimeter fence

PC Smith (day 17 p.114-115) stationed at Sate 3

"I could see people were being pressed up tight against the
fence; that they had not fallen back as they would normally
fall back,"

"I think some people were shouting "Open the gate, we are
crushed" or something like that."

Cue: "Did you try to get through on your radio to anyone?"

As "I tried to shout "Come and open these gates. People are
dying in here." or something like that. Quite honestly from
past experience I had no doubt that they would not have
received that at the time due to the noise of the crowd,
sir."

Cue: "Did you realise by then that people were in trouble?"

As "Certainly, sir."

Cue; "So did you in fact open the gate?"

At "We opened them, yes sir."

P. 135B-E "As   people became distressed and I realised they
were in pain,   I put a radio message over to say that there
was a serious situation at the front."

Cue: "Apart from seeing people in distress,        could you hear
whether they were in distress?"

A: "Yes"

                Cue: "It wets obvious to you that people were being crushed I
                take it?"
                At "Blatantly obvious,          yes.     PC Illingworth then opened
                Gate 4."

                 Evidence from the fans
                 Numerous fans gave evidence that in the time running up to
                 kick-off a n d .at the time of kick-off there were screams for
                 help and screams to the police drawing attention to the
                 plight of those at the front of pens 3 and 4,

                 We submit that it is unnecessary to recite all the fans
                 whose evidence m u s t be v e r y m u c h in t h e m i n d of tne
                 Tribunal.   We particularly rely upon the evidence of Mr
                 Hicks who was seeking to draw attention of senior police
                .officers in the police control bo* to the evident crushing
                 which he could see from his position in pens X and 2             *




                 Summary
                 We submit that it 'is abundantly clear that although it 'is
                 possible that messages in relation to other gates could
                 been picked up by PC Waugh which would have motivated his
                 telephone call to SYMAS h e a d q u a r t e r s , t he b a l a n c e of
                 probabilities indicate that it in fact was cries for help
                 emanating from the fans crushed behind pens 3 and 4.

                 We reassert this submission in view of the fact that again,
                 without reguest from G/C for them to do so, another officer
                 at F/C telephoned SYMAS at 15.06 merely to put them on
                 notice. it is evident that many of the officers at F/C in
                 snig Hill were disturbed by the messages that they were
                 receiving by monitoring the VHF radio channel 25 and these
                 were by 15.08 totally unconnected with any respect to open
                 gates outside by the turnstiles.

                  In our submission these calls for help and calls of concern
                  must have been coming from officers at the perimeter fence
                  who were clearly upset and perturbed by the evidence before
                  their eyes.
                  It is submitted that this would have been apparent to
                  officers in the police control box were they prepared to
                  b e l i e v e th e e v i d e n c e b e f o r e t h e i r ey es and also to
                  Superintendent Murrey and Superintendent Greenwood when they
                  went down to the pitch and to investigate why fans were
                  climbing over the perimeter fence.

                Superintendent Greenwood (day 12 p,99&) identified himself
                as the inspector in p h o t o g r a p h .South Yorkshire Police 2

                Superintendent Gr een w o o d a s s e r t e d t ha t he was m e r e l y
                assessing the situation.              He accepted that it was clear if
                one looked at those crushed behind the fence that some were
                in d i f f i c u l t i e s a n d being c r u s h e d . A perusal of the
                following photographs: 1/10A shows that far from assessing
                the situation Superintendent Greenwood in fact has caught
                hold of a fan and is pulling him back towards the fence.

                 Evidence from the BBC recording MAF9 and 10

                 From an early stage shortly after 15,00 the commentators
                 viewing the piatures being produced by the video observed
                 that the problem is being caused by overcrowding and fans
                 are spilling over onto the pitch.

                 Evidence of the call for Operation Support from G/C

                 In our submission this was clearly in response to what was
                 then identified as a pitch invasion and n o t .recognising that
                 in fact a major emergency had occurred.

                 we submit that It Is abundantly clear that the tragedy
                 commenced some time before 15.00, that the tragedy wbb
                 i d e n t i f i e d b y j u n i o r p o l i c e o f f i c e r s p r e s e n t at the
                 perimeter gates at 14,53 and onwards, that that tragedy was
                 not identified for whatever reason by senior officers until
                 15.05,24 (MAPI) when Superintendent Greenwood went onto the
                 pitch.

                 It is regrettable that no call was made to SYMAS until 15.08
                 for ambulances because given their response time it is
                 l i k e l y t h a t t h e y w o u l d have arrived at the ground in
                 sufficient numbers to have made a material difference to the
                 number of deceased than they were otherwise able to.

                One is not able to say if in fact anybody’s life would have
                been saved or, if so, how many but one is able to say that
                undoubtedly had the disaster been recognised by those in
                authority earlier than it was and the appropriate assistance
                been called s om e 8 m i n u t e s e a r l i e r t h a n it w as then
                undoubtedly the chances of survival for many of the people
                who were pulled out dead would have been enhanced.

                  Green Guide figures„

           i»8    The inadequacy o£ the turnstiles to accommodate
                  24,500 spectators appears to have been recognised
                  by the South Yorkshire Police and S W F C ,   See
                  Transcript day 11 p38D~G.

           1.7    In our submi ssion it was absurd to believe that
                  24,. 500 spectators could have been sufetiv * 1 1owed
                  entry through Loppings Lane in the time available.
    FAILURE TO DELAY U C K - O F F

    2»l    The senior of fleers Itiwlde the police control box
           should have realised by 1430 hours that the crowd of
           supporters outside the Leppings Lane entrance could not
           get into the ground by 1500 hours even on the most
           optimistic of flow rates through the turnstiles.

    2.2    It therefore follows that kick-off should have been
           postponed prior to or very short"! y after 1430 hours,
           and indeed many people were under the impression that
           kick-off had Linen delayed.

    OPENING OF GATE C

    3.1   The decision to open Gate C was in*" 1 1mi i Jn «11
          circumstances, but the fail nits to prepare and cater for
          the resultant ingress of supporters into the concourse
          behind the west stand and then onto the terracing, was
          a clear and fundamental mistake by the police.
   SIGNING MTD W i QcjT pp CONCOURSE

   4.1    Once supporters found themselves in the concour«« m ea
          behind the west stand the directional a ions onto the
          terracing was so poor that it resulted in the majority
          of supporters quite reasonably deciding that there was
          no way o n t o the terracing other than through t;h&
          central tunnel.

   4.2    The situation was made worse by the presence of the
          internal wall which although useful for a normal match,
          probably dissuaded many supporters going to their left
          after entering through turnstiles A-G and ftate c.

                         haphazard and carried out with littiit or insufficient
                         thought concerning the set®ty of supporters on th*
                         terracing.

                  3*2    The emphasis in erecting th® radial fences, perimeter
                         fence gates and barrier® was clearly on containment of
                         the supporters on the terracing, and for example we
                         would point t o *

                                paragraph 1 1 5 of the Green Guide was a deliberate
                                policy decision. Please see Dr Eastwood's plan No

                                with no new uprights being constructed.
           6>         E OF GATES IN PERIMETER FENCE

                  The perimeter gates leading onto th© perimeter track are
                  clearly too narrow for the purposes of emergency evacuation
                  onto the pitch area.

           7♦    ESTIMATION OF TERBACE ZKPhCZTY

                 Th® capacity of the whole of the west stand terracing, and
                  in part Ir,;v? Ijir pens 3 and 4 , has been clearly wrongly
                 calculated.       Reference should be made to document headed
                 "Sheffield Wednesday Football Club west terrace - ideal
                 distribution of persons" for pens 3 and 4.       The Health fi
                 Safety Executive has calculated that the maximum numbers of
                 spectators for pens 3 and 4 are 822 for pen 3 and 871 for
                 pen. €, Furthermore, If one takes into account paragraph 2,16
                 of th® Green Guide, the appropriate capacities of pens' 3 and
                 4 are substantially reduced, to 542 for pen 3 and 605 for
                 pen 4 ,

                         supporters, it appears fairly c l m m that U ft South
                         Yorkshire Police should have anticipated the sort of
                         behaviour front the Liverpool fans which thev all
                         took place or. >*, April 1989.

                 ©•2     In p a r t i o u l a r , this is born© out by the evidence

                         which indicates a pattern of behaviour identical to
                         that which took place on 15 April*

 SYMAS1 submission is that South Yorkshire 'Police were in a

 h o u r s at the v e r y latest* in fact, as the attached
 chronology shows, they failed to da so b®fore 1505 hours and
 failed to call SYMAS until 1508 hours.


 In view of the unchallenged medical evident;* <t in bYMAS*
 submission that those 9 minutes were critical, and of all
 the claims that lives could have been saved, this is the
 only one with any merit.


 SYMAS1 submission is that there is evidence to indicate                that
 supporters were being crashed, to death by 1459 hours                   and
 that this w as e v i d e n t to a n y o n e w h o s e m i n d was       not

 SYMAS submit that the telephone call at 14*59 from Snig Hill
 to Ground Control by PC Waugh was not, as claimed by PC
 lough,, prompted by overhearing the conversation between
 Superintendent Marshall and Ground Control.

it is SYMAS' submission that the length                      of tints that elapsed,
between the end of the communieat ion                       from Superintendent
Marshall and the making of that call                         (some 8 minutes) Is
consistent with an urgent call being
o v e r h e a r i n g sc e n e s of d e s p e r a t i o n   and   t.t jhJ olp' ^ass
indicating a need for ambulances.

We propose to deal with each gate in turn in support of our
contention that in fact it must have been the cites cf
distress from supporters within the perimeter fence and the
request by officers stationed at the perimeter gates which
prompted the call by PC Waugh.

IT GATE «:f

Waugh alleges that it was Gate C in his statement and In. his
evidence to the Tribunal.

However, his statement was not made until 27 Jur-n IMiiQ
after the existence of that conversation had be©/) "h u covered
by Counsil for SYMAS.

In c h ie f (da y 31 p , 11 I B ) PC Wauq h asjci
telephoned G/C "immediately after” the repeated requests for
the gate to be opened«

in cross examination (day 31 p . U 4 D ) PC Waugh confirmed that
he had made the telephone call "within seconds n of hearing
the repeated requests to open the gates.

There is     no evidence from Marshall that                  he asked Gate G to
be opened     on the third occasion.  In any                 event th® evidence
is that      the t hird opening of Gate C                     was a controlled
operation    not caused by a crush outside-                   S

The 8 minute time lapse between "Superintendent Marshall's
soreaming for the gate to be o p e n e d ” ( i4. n 1 .it) « Hid the
     telephone call iadi by PC Waugh (14      Hi) is not <.,;sist*nt
     with PC l a u g h ’s making th® call mimmrn              '* or
     "within seconds of* hearing the repeated requests. No panic
     or dangerous crushing evident from the ovidem^e      lie video
     (KJH2) prior to Gate C being opened for the third tin#,

6,   Mo evidence as to precisely when ©ate C was opened for the
     third tine and no evidence that the third opertl ftg w » r
     occasioned fay any repeated requests fro* an officer for it
      Ik U done,
7.   SYMAS subnit therefore that it is unlikely that it was the
      request to open Gate C which occasioned PC Waugh to make the
      lntaphorie call at 14.59.

          in all the circumstances, and in view of the evidence that
          has been given, we submit it is evident that conversations

in any event we submit clearly not Gate A because the entry
through Gate A was orderly and controlled by ft     ri a*. i}J
police officers directing the fans towards the north stand.
In any event the weight of the evidence seems to Huyg*st
that Gate A was opened because Gate C was opened and it was
thought that a general permission to open gates had hmmn
given.
We submit that in all the circumstances this is unlikely to
have been the urgent and unusual circumstances to cause PC

In any event there is no evidence of any requests having
been made over th© radio and no evidence that such reguests
were repeated before It was granted.

               been picked up by PC Waugh which would have motivated his

               In our submission these colls for help and calls of concern
               must have been coning from officers at the perim©<.‘’i’ f#iice

               Dear Don
               Article in BMJ

               I have now been through the BMJ article in some detail and have
               also considered the statements that we took following the
               Hillsborough disaster. I have not been through all of the other
               documents because I am conscious of the time, and hence the
               costs, that would be involved.
               I am concerned that we don't stir up a hornet's nest by
               responding too vigorously to the BMJ article, and my view is that
               we should confine ourselves to the question of the notification
               of a major incident to the Northern General Hospital.
               I therefore enclose the draft of a letter that I suggest you send
               to the BMJ; you might want to copy it to Jim Wardrope.        The
               factual matters set out in the letter are taken from the
               statement of Mr Sykes.

               You might wish to add some comment upon the suggestion in the
               first paragraph under the heading "Implications for Disaster
               Planning" that the ambulance service have responsibility for
               declaring a major incident and that other emergency service
               communications to hospitals should be relayed via the ambulance

       to consider it.

Dear Sir

The Hillsborough Tragedy - Article in BMJ
I have seen the article which appeared in the BMJ on 30 November
1991.

I am concerned that the article could be considered to be
critical of The South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service.
The tragedy has already been the subject of a great deal of
public investigation and comment which I do not wish to add to
unnecessarily.   I shall not, therefore, respond to a number of
points with which I would otherwise take issue, but I must point
out the error     relating to the claim that      there was no
notification to the Northern General Hospital      that a major
incident was taking place.
Notification of a major incident was given to the Northern
General Hospital at approximately 1525, before any casualties
arrived.    That information was given, in person, by an
ambulanceman to a member of the hospital staff, who appeared to
act upon the notification. Any suggestion that the hospital had
not received notification is, therefore, wrong.
Please point out the error in the next issue of the BMJ.
Yours faithfully

Dear    Sir,

Re;     The Hills b o r o u g h T r aged y - Art icle in BMJ

I h a v e seen the a r tic le w h i c h appeare d in the BMJ on 30th Novem ber 1991.                                       I
am c o n c erne d that the article could be cons id e r e d to be critical of the
South Yor kshire M e t r o p o l i t a n Amb ulanc e and Paramedic Service (SYMAPS).

The t r a gedy has a l r e a d y been the subject of a great deal of public
i nve st i g a t i o n and comme nt w h i c h I do n ot w i s h to add to unnecessarily. I
shall not, therefore, respo nd to a n umb er of points w i t h w h i c h I would
oth er w i s e take issue, but I must point out the error relat ing to the claim
that there was no n o t i f i c a t i o n to the North e r n General Hospital that a
m a j o r incident was taking place.

N o t i f i c a t i o n of a m a j o r incident was g iven to the N o r t h e r n General Hospital
at ap prox i m a t e l y 1525 hours, before any casualti es arrived.                That
informa tion was given, in person, by an a m bu lancem an to a m e m b e r of the
hos pital staff, who app eared to act u p o n the notification.                    Any suggestion
that the h ospital had not received n o t i f i c a t i o n is, therefore incorrect.

Finally, with regard -to the parag raph implications for disaster planning.
This service ma de formal representations at the Lord Jus tice Taylor enquiry
and w e r e instrumental in introducing legislat ion to increase the emergency
pro vision w ith in football stadia.  SYMAPS also declare, on behalf of the
o the r emergency services, a major incident b y c ontac t i n g the relevant
 Accident and Emergency departments.

 Please point out these errors in the next issue of the BMJ.

D e ar Sir,

Re;    The Hi l l sb oro ug h Tr agedy - Art icl e in BMJ

I h a v e seen the ar tic le w h i c h appear ed in the BMJ on 30th No vember 1991.                              I
a m c o n c erned that the ar ticle could be conside red to be critical of the
S ou th Y o rk sh ire Met r o po l i ta n Amb ul anc e and Paramedic Service (SYMAPS).

Th e t r a ge dy has al re a d y be en the subject of a great deal of public
i n v e s t i g ati on and co mment w hx c h X do no t w x s h to add to unnecessarily. X
shall not, therefore, respond to a nu m be r of points wi t h whi ch I would
o t h e r w i se take issue, but I m us t point out the error re lating to the claim
that t here was no no t i fi ca ti o n to the N o r th e r n General Hos pital that a
m a j o r i ncident was taking place.

N o t i f i c a ti on of a m a jo r incident was given to the No rt h e r n General Hospi ta l
at a p p r ox im at ely 1525 hours, before any casualties arrived.            That
i n f o r m a tion was given, in person, by an amb ul an cem an to a me m be r of the
h o s p i t a l staff, who app eared to act u po n the notification.         Any suggesti on
that the ho spital ha d not rec eived no t if i c at i o n is, therefore incorrect.

 Final ly, w it h regard to the pa ra graph implications for disaster planning.
 This s e rvice mad e formal representations at the Lord Justice Taylor enqui ry
 a nd w e r e instrumental in introducing legisla tio n to increase the emerge nc y
 p r o v i s i on w i t h i n football stadia. SYMAPS also declare, on be ha l f of the
 o t h e r e m er gency services, a m a jo r incident b y co nt act ing the relevant
 A c c i d e n t and Emergen cy depart ments.

 P l e a s e point out these errors in the next issue of the BMJ.

Dear Sir

The Hillsborough Tragedy - Article in BMJ

I have seen the article which appeared in the BMJ on 30 November
1991.

I am concerned that the article could be considered to be
critical of The South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service.

The tragedy has already been     the subject of a great deal of
public investigation and comment which I do not wish to add to
unnecessarily.   I shall not, therefore, respond to a number of
points with which I would otherwise take issue, but I must point
out the error     relating to the claim that      there was no
notification to the Northern General Hospital      that a major
incident was taking place.

Notification of a major incident was given to the        Northern
General Hospital at approximately 1525, before any casualties
arrived.    That information was given,       in person, by an
ambulanceman to a member of the hospital staff, who appeared to
act upon the notification.   Any suggestion that the hospital had
not received notification is, therefore, wrong.

Please point out the error in the next issue of the BMJ.

Yours faithfully

The ambulanoe service is one of the country’s 3 emergence
services.           Its j o b is to attend to victims at any accident or
e m e r g e n c y ; to provide immediate care f o r those victims ard to
transport, them to the nearest hospital for further treatment..
Ambulance crews are highly fruited and accident end emergency
crews are trad.red for the wide variety of conditions which face
them in the sort, of work they do.            Their training consists of H
weeks at a regional ambulance training school, followed by a
further 12 months working with a qualified affibulaneeman/woman
during which time they gain experience in all aspect? of accident
and emergency work.             They undertake regular post~proficieney
training and many of them now go on to do what is known as
extended training in defribi11 ation, intubation and infusion
techniques,           Earlv attendance of an accident and emergency
vehicle with trained aribul.an.ee staff is therefore crucial in
ensuring that, an injured person receives the most appropriate
treatment possible prior to their admittance to e hospital,.

3 members of the ambulance service were as we understand it
hrvm?,ited on the afternoon at Hillsborough,         There has been an
unfortunate t m d n n c y in recent years to treat ambulance staff as
figures of authority rather than as peep]e who are completely
newt re.] in all of l.hewe events, wishing to give attention to all
those who need it regard.! rrs of who they are.        Seme of the fault
for this lies within the ambulance service itself which still has
a rather militaristic attitude to its work and the way it treats
it.s own s t.a ff , but somy of it arises curt, o f the gpftpra j wta ]a is e
and break down in respect for one another in society generally.
If the ambij] a n c e s e r v i c e is to do its w o r k e f f e c t i v e l y in v e r y

Ve would therefore ask the Inquiry to consider savin?? something
about this in your report in order that all those who work in the
nervine and those who are responsible for it, along with the*
public at large, will understand the necessity to treat the
ambulance service in a mariner which will n'lwByg allow ambulance

acknowledged                as    the        major       organisation                   representing               ambulance

The    Union          does       not     intend          to    comment             on     any      of    the       operational
decisions             that       were        made       on    the       day       at    Hillsborough               as       that        is
something             which        will       be    dealt          with       by       the     south         \orkshirt=

It    is    however          the        intention             of    the       Union          to    give       evidence            on
matters          of    public           policy          which       we       feel       arise          out    of    the         traged>
at    Hillsborough                 and       are    issues          on       which        the      Union         has       held       views

The    role       of       the     ambulance             service


The    ambulance                 service       is       one    of       the       c o u n t r y ’s      3     emergency
services.              Its        job    is    to       attend          to    victims             at    any      accident             or
emergency;             to     provide          immediate                care        for      those          victims         and        to
transport             them        to    the    nearest             hospital              for      further          treatment.
Ambulance                c r e w s    are        highly             trained             and       accident          and       emergency
crews       are          trained               for    the       wide         variety              of    conditions            which           face
them       in    the         sort          of    work          they      do.            Their          training          consists             of       8
weeks       at       a     regional              ambulance                training                school,          followed          by       a
further           12       months              working          with          a   qualified                 ambulanceman/woman
during          which           time           they       again          experience                in       all    aspects          of
accident             and        emergency                 work.           They          undertake             regular
post-profi c i e n c y                     training             and       many          of    them          now    go    on    to    do       what
is    known          as      extended                training                in   d e f r i b illation, intubation                                and
infusion             techniques.                      Early          attendance                   of    an    accident          and
emergency                vehicle               with       trained             ambulance                staff       is    therefore
crucial           in       ensuring              that          an    injured             person             receives          the    most
appropriate                  treatment                possible                prior          to    their          admittance             to       a
hospital.


It    is    recognised                     by    all       concerned                   that       response          times       for       999
calls       are          critical               to    a    patients               wellbeing                 and    ambulance             services
strive          to       attend            all       emergencies                   as    soon          as    they       possibly          can,
and    certainly                    well        within          the          limits          laid       down       by    something                known
as    the       ORCON           STANDARDS                 which          are       Department                of    Health
recommendations                           for    response                times          for       emergency             vehicles.


The    Tragedy               at       Hillsborough


Without           wishing                 to    comment             in       detail          upon       the       events       at
Hillsborough                    there           can       be    little             doubt          that       had    an       extended
trained           ambulance                    crew       been       on       duty       at       the       ground       with
defribillators, then                                 at    the       very          least,          there          would       have       been          the
opportunity                   of      saving          the       lives             of    some       of       those       people       who          so
tragically                 died.


Whilst          it       must         be       the    job       of       the       Inquiry             to    make       recommendations
on    football                grounds            safety             that          will       ensure          to    the       best    of
everyone's                 ability              that       such          a    tragedy             will       never       occur       again,                it
is    the       job        of        the       emergency             services                to    plan       for       events       of       that
sort        and      wherever                  possible             to       be    in    a    position             to    take       whatever
action          is       necessary               to       alleviate                suffering                and,    of       course,          to
save        lives.


It    is     the         U n i o n ’s          view       that       the          South       Yorkshire             Met.       Ambulance
Service           acquitted                    itself          extremely                well       on       that    occasion             taking
into        account             all        of    the       problems                that       they          faced.           However,             the
Union        would            like         to    comment             upon          certain             aspects          of    the    events
that        day      and        to        recommend             to       the       Inquiry             that       recommendations
could        be      made            which       would          ensure             that       the       role       of    the    ambulance
service           was         even         more       effective                   on    any       future          occasion.


The     provision                    of    extended             trained                ambulance             crews       at    public
events


It     is    the          v i e w     of       the    Union          that          at    all       major          public       events''(and
V

      here       we       talk       about        events          where       large       numbers              of    people              are
     congregating                    and     would          include       all       football             events)              there           should
     be     on       duty        extended          trained             ambulance          crews          provided               by       the       local
     NHS        ambulance              service.              The       promoters          of       the       event            (in    the          case
     of     a    football              match,       the          football          club)       should           pay       an        appropriate
      sum       to       the     local       health          authority             for    the       provision                 of     that
     ambulance                  attendance.


     At     the          moment        the    only          medical       attendance                at       the     majority                 of
     these           events          are     that       provided          by       the    voluntary                 St    Johns
     Ambulance                 and     Red    Cross.


     The        view       of     the      Union        is       that    both       St    Johns          and        the       Red        Cross
     play        a       very    valuable           role          in    attending             functions              of       this        sort          and
     are        very       capable           of    dealing             with    simple          first          aid        matters.
     However,              they       are     not       trained          or    equipped             to       deal        with        more
     serious incidents                        amongst             which       we    would       include              serious                 iniury,
     h e a r t a t t a c k etc.


     We     see       no       reason        why    St       Johns       and       the    Red       Cross          should           not
     continue              to    provide           the       very       useful       function             they           do    but        that
     that        needs          to    be     supplemented                by    trained          ambulance                 crews          capable
     of     providing much                    more       sophisticated                   care       for       seriously                  injured
     or     ill p e o p l e .


     Our     first             recommendation,                    therefore,             is   that        qualified                 NHS
    ambulance               crews          should        be      made     available             at       major           public          events.




    First         Aid       and       rescue        equipment .


    It     was       clear           from    the     television                pictures            at     Hillsborough                       that
    the      football                club    had     made         little           provision             for    dealing              with
    casualties                  on    their       ground.              There       were       no     stretchers                 readily
    available               and       football           fans      were       seen       tearing             down        advertising
    placards               to    use    as    stretchers                for     friends            and       colleagues.


    Our     understanding                    is    that          all    public       places             have        to    have           a    fire
    certificate                  before       the>          are    allowed          to    hold          public           events.                  Our
    second           recommendation                 therefore             is       that       all       public           places
    including               football          grounds             should       have       what          we     are       terming              a
    F. i - r s t— A i d — C e r t i f i c a t e .           It    is    our    view       that          anybody           wishing                 to
    put     on       a    public        event       on       premises          to    which          the        general              public             pay
    for     access              should       have       a    certificate             from          their        local           health

     Assaults             on    ambulance                  staff


     3 members             of    the           ambulance              service              were       as     we        understand                  it
     assaulted             on    the           afternoon              at       Hillsborough.                       There            has       been       an
     unfortunate                tendancy              in        recent          years           to    treat            ambulance               staff          as
     figures          of       authority              rather              than       as     people           who          are       completely
     neutral          in       all    of        these           events,             wishing           to     give          attention                to       all
     those       who       need           it    regardless                 of       who     they       are.            Some          of       the       fault
     for    this          lies       within           the        ambulance                 service           itself             which          still          has
     a    rather          militaristic                    attitude              to       its     work        and       the          way       it    treats
     its    own       staff,          but        some          of     it       arises           out    of       the        general             malaise
     and    break          down       in        respect              for       one       another           in     society                generally.
     If    the    ambulance                    service           is       to    do       its     work        effectively                      in    very
     difficult             situations,                    then        it       is    most        important                 that          it    is       always
     l°°ked       upon          as    a        neutral           Dody          of    men       and     women           dedicated                   to    the
     relief       of       suffering                 and       pain        and       the       saving           of     life.              Regardless
     of    what       other          tensions              there           be       in    society,              the       ambulance                 service
     should       always             be        able       to     go       into       those           situations                 in       the
     knowledge             that       ambulance                 crews           are       going        to       be     left          untouched                by
    whatever              event       is        taking          place           in       order        that        they          can       provide
     support          and       comfort              to    those           who       need        it.


    We     would          therefore              ask       the        Inquiry             to    consider               saying             something
    about        this       in       your        report              in    order          that        all       those          who        work          in   the
    service           and      those           who        are       responsible                 for        it ,      along           with          the
    public        at       large,          will           understand                 the       necessity               to      treat           the
    ambulance             service               in    a    manner           which          will        always             allow          ambulance
    staff        to    do      the        job        for       which           they      are        trained,              without              the
    constant           fear          of    themselves                     being       assaulted.


    Stress        and       trauma


    The    last        issue          we       wish        to    give          evidence              about           is     an      issue          that
    affects           ambulance                staff        themselves.                     Unfortunately                        major
    tragedies             have       become           a     wav       of       life        in    this        country                in    recent
    years    and          whenever              they        occur,             it     is    members               of      the       three
    emergency             services              who        are       called           upon       to    clear              up     the      problems.
    To    attend          any    of        these          disasters                 and     be       faced         with          the      horrific
    problems          that       one           has    to        deal       with          has     an    adverse                 affect          even          on
    the    most       experienced                    and        hardened             of     staff.                I know            very       well
    that    experienced                    members              of    ours          who     attended              Hillsborough                      were
    very    badly          affected              by       what        they          saw     and       had       to     do       deal          with       and
    whilst       they          dealt           with       the        matter          very        professionally,                          it       was
    after    the          event       was        over          and        they       had        time       to     reflect                on    the
    situation             that       they        become              very       stressed              indeed.                  It    is,       of
    course,       not          only        in    major           disasters                 where       stresses                 occur,
    but    very       often          in        the    day        to       day       work       of     the       ambulance                 service.
    Members       of       the       service              are        called          upon        to    deal          with           horrific
    injuries          -    very       often           to       young           children,              which          leave           a    major          mark
on them after the event.   I have to say that our members in the
South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service who attended at
Hillsborough have been very complementary about the way in which
the health authority have tried to assist them in relation to
these matters afterwards.   The Union has no criticisms of the wa.v
in which the health Authority has handled the matter.   However,
it is very difficult for any employer on the spur of the moment
following an incident of that sort to put into place the sort of
counselling that maybe required by staff who have gone through
quite dreadful experiences.   It is therefore our view that
consideration should now be given to the setting up of an
appropriate organisation with Government funding which would have
available to it, professional help upon which employers could
call to provide counselling facilities for any of their staff
when it is needed.  Our last recommendation therefore is that the
Government should be asked in consultation with the appropriate
Trades Unions/Government Departments and Employers to set up an
organisation of the sort described above which could provide the
advice needed immediately when it was required.

                 Dear Don,
                 HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY
                 Andrew and I have now had the opportunity to sift through all
                 documentation corrected in relation to this inquiry, and we
                 have come across a number of documents which we would like to
                 return to you.
                 I understand that you are seeing Andrew some time next week,
                 and so Andrew will take the opportunity to hand the relevant
                 documents back to you at that time.
                 I understand that you still retain two videos in relation to
                 the inquiry and perhaps you can arrange to collect the same and
                 hand them over to Andrew when you meet next week.
                Yours sincerely,

Personal History           *
1.   I was born on 16th April 1949.


2.   I am the Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer with the South
     Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service (SYMAS).     SYMAS is
     a part of Trent Regional Health Authority and provides
     ambulance services for the whole of South Yorkshire, an area
     which covers the District Health Authorities of Sheffield,
     Rotherham, Doncaster and Barnsley.


3.   The SYMAS headquarters and control are at Heather Close in
     Rotherham.


4.   I am a Justice of the Peace and a Fellow of t          bulance
     Service Institute and a member of the Associati        f Chief
     Ambulance Officers.


5.   I joined the ambulance service as a cadet in Liverpool in
     1966   and   spent    18 months   as   a cadet.   I became   an
     ambulanceman in 1968 and between then and 1974 I worked on
     general out-patient duties, emergency duties, which included
     shift work.      During that time I became a qualified in-
     service instructor and spent time at the Liverpool training
     school and was seconded to the regional training school for
     short periods.       In 1974 I was promoted to the position of
sub-officer in charge of the headquarters station on a shift
basis, and my duties primarily involved administration and
responsibility for control.   In October 1974 I was promoted
to Station Officer over three stations in Liverpool.   I was
promoted to Superintendent in January 1975 and was put in
charge of the St. Helen's Station which was a large sub-unit
and was totally self-contained.    This was a station of 40
men, it included its own control unit plus workshops and
stores.   In February 19'S^/l transferred to SYMAS and was
appointed Assistant Divisional Officer (Operations)       in
charge of six ambulance stations in Doncaster and Rotherham.
I became Assistant Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer for
SYMAS in 1978 and was appointed Chief Metropolitan Ambulance
Officer for SYMAS in 1982.


Since 1986 I have been an instructor at the National Health
Service training establishment in Harrogate on courses for
senior ambulance officer development.


I am a member of the Association of Chief Ambulance Officers
Working Party To Review Control Procedures For Ambulance
Services, which has just re-written and issued the control
procedures for ambulance services nationally.


From 1979 to 1986 I was an Executive member of the Institute
of the Certified Ambulance Personnel.
9.    In the new national training notes for ambulance personnel
      issued by the NHSTA there is a section written by me on the
      ambulance service response to civil disorder incidents.
      This was as a result of the SYMAS involvement in civil
      disturbances at Orgreave.     We had pnrnh^s^d protective
      equipment and specialised vehicles (then^ja^ converted Land
      Rovers) prior to Orgreave and were therefore in a position
      to deal immediately with that incident when it arose.


Organisation of SYMAS
10.   The ambulance service is split into two main divisions, the
      operational division and the control division.


11.   On the operational side most ambulancemen in SYMAS now start
      as cadets when they are 17 and spend two years training in
      all fields of the ambulance servicej emergency services and
      NHS.   They have no responsibility for the patients other
      than in observing their treatment.


12.   The next stage is the basic grade ambulanceman, some of whom
      will not have been cadets.    They normally begin on part-
      time work within the BDT services transporting the elderly
      before moving on to full time transporting of general
      outpatients.


13.   The next grade is that of qualified ambulancemen.   They are
      trained in all aspects of the ambulance service including
      dealing with emergencies.        They do six weeks training and
      two weeks driving training after twelve months of general
      experience.     The national guidelines are for the training to
      be repeated every five years but in SYMAS the ambulancemen
      receive      repeated training between each attendance on
      national courses.       The next grade is that of leading
      ambulanceman, who takes responsibility for a shift on an
      ambulance station in the absence of a station officer.


14.   Station Officers are in charge of an ambulance station and
      are responsible for the vehicles, manpower, and operational
      resources of that station.           The next rank is that of
      Superintendent      (Operations).      We have   two in SYMAS,
      Superintendent Dale who is responsible for Sheffield and
      Rotherham, and Superintendent Horner who is responsible for
      Barnsley and Doncaster.         They co-ordinate manpower and
      vehicle resources, monitor wages and salaries,       and advise
      the Support Services Officer of any difficulties relating to
      finance.     They report to the Assistant Chief (Operations) in
      relation to operational matters.


15.   The   Assistant     Chief    Metropolitan Ambulance     Officer
      (Operations) is Mr Jones who is responsible for every aspect
      of operational cover.       He reports to Mr Hopkins, my deputy.


16.   On the control side the lowest rank is that of Control
      Assistant.    The Control Assistants have no ambulance service
experience in operations.     They receive telephone calls from
the general public, hospitals, ambulance stations and the
police and fire services and they work in shifts.       They do
not deal with patients themselves but pass the calls onto
the Control Officers who make the decision on the action to
be taken.


The Control Officers decide on the deployment of ambulances
in response to information passed to them by the Control
Assistants.    During the working week day there are four on
duty.    One dealing with accidents and emergencies,        one
dealing with out-patients in each of/^ the areas of Sheffield
and Rotherham, and the other dealing with out-patients for
Doncaster/Barnsley.     After 1700 only the Control Officer on
accident and emergency remains on duty with control
assistants and Superintendents and the situation is the same
for the whole of Sunday.     On Saturdays there are two Control
Officers on duty during the day.


The control room is supervised by a Control Superintendent.
There is always a Superintendent on duty and they work on a
shift basis.       On the afternoon of Saturday 15th April the
Control Superintendent on duty was Mr Clarke.


The Assistant Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer (Control
and Communications) has overall responsibility for Control.
This    is Mr A.    Smith.   He is responsible for control,
      planning,    registration (the pre-booking of general out­
      patients),     ambulance liaison posts,           and standards   and
      efficiency officers.      The standards and efficiency officers
      are of superintendent rank and their job is to monitor the
      standard      of   services   to     individual      hospitals,   the
      investigation of complaints about services provided,              and
      liaison with the hospitals.


20.   Mr Smith is accountable to Mr Hopkins.


21.   In addition to the personnel mentioned above there are            also
      the following officers:-


      1.   The Assistant Chief Ambulance Officer (Training), who
           is responsible for arranging all aspects of training
           all SYMAS personnel.     This is Mr Wade.


      2.   The     Assistant   Chief Ambulance          Officer (Support
           Services).      He is primarily responsible for advising
           u pon    and procuring    computor          and communications
           equipment, and giving budgetary advice.              This is Mr
           Truman.


      3.   The Assistant Divisional Officer (Support Services).
           This    is Mr Morley.         He     is   responsible   for the
           investigation of complaints,               certain disciplinary
           matters,      strategic and operational planning,         joint

             planning with hospitals and emergency services, and he
             plays a supporting role to Mr Truman.


      4.     Myself.     I have overall responsibility for all aspects
             of the ambulance service in SYMAS.


Paramedics
22.   Thirty three of the SYMAS           ambulancemen and women are
      paramedics.       Ten of them having qualified as paramedics only
      recently.        Paramedics are also referred to as "extended
      trained".     In 1985 we began our own paramedics training in
      SYMAS.    There had been a national paramedics training scheme
      for some time but it was slow in getting off the ground, and
      I was anxious for some of my staff to receive extended
      training and I knew that there were a number of ambulancemen
      and women who wished to receive such training.      We began our
      own paramedics training in 1985 and the national scheme was
      started in the following year.        Those people who had done
      the SYMAS paramedic course simply had to pass an exam rather
      than attend        a national   course.   The SYMAS paramedics
      training goes beyond that required by national guidelines
      and SYMAS has been certified to do its own paramedics
      training     by    the   National   Health   Service   Tra i n i n g
      Authority.


23.   The most      important aspects of paramedics training are
      intubation, infusion, defibrillation, cardiac monitoring,
      and drug administration.        At the end of that course
      paramedics take an exam and every twelve months thereafter
      they must prove to a consultant anaethatist and ambulance
      officer that they are proficient in each of the aspects of
      paramedic training.     An ambulanceman who has not received
      extended training is not permitted to deal with the matters
      referred to in the preceding paragraph.       There is strict
      control over the work done by paramedics.    They should only
      put   their extended    training into practice when it is
      absolutely necessary and as a last resort.    They must do a
      case summary for each patient they treat and provide a copy
      of the case summary to the accident and emergency department
      of the hospital to which the patient is taken,        and to
      ambulance headquarters.                 summaries are later
      reviewed by consultants and            xaining department.


Vehicles
24.   SYMAS has the following vehicles:-


      1.    (How many?)Front    line vehicles.     These are fully
            equipped emergency ambulances.   They carry essential
            rescue equipment, special stretchers, oxygen, entonox
            (a pain killing gas), splints, immobilisers, and (if
            there is a paramedic on the ambulance) a defibrillator,
            infusion kit, a paramedics kit and cardiac monitoring
            machine.
(How   many?)   Sitting   case vehicles.       These   are
essentially mini buses which are normally used for
transporting the elderly, and general outpatients who
can walk with the assistance of one person.     They carry
little in the way of equipment,        but they do have a
first aid kit, blankets and a carrying chair.


We have one major incident vehicle (emergency tender).
This is essentially a mobile stores and communications
centre.    A schedule showing the equipment carried by
the major incident vehicle appears in a separate bundle
of documents.


The special incident unit.   This is essentially a riot
vehicle and is a fully protected Range Rover.      It was
not used at Hillsborough and is intended for lifting
casualties from civil disorder incidents.


Marked and unmarked staff cars.      The marked staff cars
are used by Station Officers and are occasionally used
on operational duties.


A marked Range Rover which is the management incident
vehicle.   It contains back up equipment to be used in
support of an ambulance at the scene of an accident and
is a mobile flood lighting system.
The Control Centre
25.   In the control centre we have a separate incident room which
      was set up earlier this year following the Kegworth and
      Lockerbie disasters.   Saturday 15th April was the first time
      that the incident room was used operationally although it
      had, of course, been tested previously.     The intention is to
      be able to manage a major incident from a separate room
      without disrupting the general services or "domestic"
      emergency work being dealt with in the control room which is
      next door.


26.   SYMAS use four radio channels:-


      Channel 1 is the emergency reserve channel which is a
      national emergency channel.       The intention is that any
      ambulance using ERC can pass from one area to another
      without having to switch channels and have radio contact at
      all times.


      Channel 2 is the SYMAS emergency channel.


      Channel 3 is the domestic channel for use on out-patient
      duties in the Rotherham/Barnsley areas.


      Channel 4 is the domestic channel for out-patient duties in
      the Sheffield/Doncaster areas.
27.   On Saturday 15th April ambulances were using the SYMAS
      emergency channel and only one of       the domestic channels
      because it was a Saturday.     During the incident many of the
      ambulances were told to use the emergency reserve channel.


Changes Following the Bradford Fire
28.   Following the fire at the Bradford      City Football Ground in
      May 1985 I arranged to meet with        John Davis,    the Chief
      Metropolitan Ambulance Officer for the West Yorkshire
      Metropolitan Ambulance Service, to find out about the sort
      of   problems which they had experienced        indealing with the
      Bradford fire, in     order to improve the      SYMAS planning for
      major incidents.      He identified the following main areas of
      difficulty:-


      1.   Locating off-duty officers because they were not
           equipped with radios or pagers.


      2.    Once contact had been made they did       not have marked
           cars   to   go   to   a major   incident    and   no   radio
           communications in their own cars.       As a result of this
           the WYMAS officers had great difficulties getting
           through crowds to reach the Bradford City Football
           Ground and to gain access to the ground itself.


      3.   When the arrived at the ground they had no radio
           communications to their control.
29.   I immediately implemented an on-call rota call for the
      operational ambulance officers in SYMAS in order to give
      senior officer availability 24 hours a day.    There is a pool
      of six senior officers who work an on-call rota outside
      normal   working    hours   so that one of them is always
      available.       In addition the Deputy Chief Metropolitan
      Ambulance Officer and I work an on-call rota on a weekly
      basis,   taking alternate weeks.     When this    system was
      introduced by me in 1985 it was done on a totally voluntary
      basis, payment was only introduced by national agreement in
      1987.


30. In 1987 because of the ambulance officers salary increase, I
      restructured the service by inserting another        line of
      operational officers.    I now have a station officer on duty
      with the emergency tender from 0600 to 2400 every day.


31. Therefore, outside normal working hours,     there is always a
      Station Officer on duty, a Senior Officer on-call,    and the
      Deputy or myself also on-call.


32.   All senior officers had been issued with pagers before the
      Bradford fire but these were upgraded after.


33.   All senior officers have had portable radio sets since the
      Bradford fire.
34.   All officers on duty now have marked vehicles with radios.


35.   The senior duty officer is equipped with a vodaphone as are
      the major incident vehicle and the Range Rover which acts as
      the management incident vehicle.


36.   All senior officers now have magnetic blue lights for their
      own vehicles.


Major Incident Planning
37.   There has been a major incident plan in SYMAS for as long as
      I have been there.     It is reviewed from time to time,
      specifically after each exercise.


38.   When a major exercise takes place only a few senior officers
      know about it, and none of those who would be taking part
      are informed.   The last exercise was in November 1988 at
      Doncaster Railway Sidings.   In 1987 there was an exercise in
      Rotherham where a building which was being demolished was
      used to simulate a collapsed building, and in 1985 there was
      an exercise in Sheffield where there was a simulated railway
      incident.


39.   Following each exercise each of the emergency services and
      the hospital involved have an in-house debriefing followed
      by a co-ordinated debriefing.       The major incident plan is
      then updated.     The current version of the major incident
      plan is dated 1985.    It has been reviewed, but not altered
      since then.


40.   In fact, we were in the process of preparing a new major
      incident plan at the time of the Hillsborough disaster and
      the plan had reached its second draft.    A meeting had been
      arranged for the working party to discuss the second draft
      on 19th April, but this has been postponed as a result of
      the Hillsborough disaster.    The working party consists of
      myself, my Deputy, the four assistant Chief Officers, the
      Assistant Divisional Officer (Support Services) and the
      Public Relations Officer (Mrs Rhodes who also acts as my
      secretary).


The Hillsborough Plan
41.   Following my meeting with John Davis of WYMAS in 1985 I
      delegated to an Assistant Divisional Officer (Mr Wilkinson)
      responsibility to co-ordinate plans for ambulance service
      involvement at five football grounds within South Yorkshire.
      Those   football grounds     are the grounds of Sheffield
      Wednesday,    Sheffield United,   Rotherham,   Barnsley,   and
      Doncaster.


42.   In January 1986 I wrote to all five football clubs.    A copy
      of my letter of 16th January 1986 addressed to the clubs
      appears in a separate bundle, together with a reply from
      Sheffield Wednesday dated 29th January 1986.    Following that
      correspondence Mr Wilkinson contacted the club and the
      police and started     a process of drawing up plans in
      conjunction with the Station Officers local to each of the
      football clubs.   In the case of Hillsborough the plan was
      prepared by Mr Wilkinson,    Station Officer Higgins and




43.   The plans relating to the football grounds were prepared in
      the late summer of 1986 and appear in a separate bundle of
      documents.   The incident plans for the grounds are intended
      for use by control and senior officers.   I would not expect
      individual ambulancemen to be aware of the contents of those
      plans.


Provision of Liaison Officers and Ambulances to Hillsborough
44.   The circular HC( 78)45 from the Department of Health and
      Social Security is entitled Health Services Management-
      Ambulance Services:    Operational Control and Use.       The
      circular summarises and updates advice and practice about
      the control and use of ambulance transport.    Paragraph 28 of
      the circular deals with sporting and other public events and
      states:-


           "Although the voluntary aid societies usually
          provide first aid cover at sporting and other
          public events where accidents and emergencies
                are likely to arise, NHS ambulances may be
                provided     if   appropriate.          In    such
                circumstances a written undertaking should be
                obtained in advance from organisers to meet
                the cost of providing special standby cover,
                though no charges      should     be   made    for
                conveying any patient to hospital.      It may be
                inappropriate     to   make   a   c harge     when
                ambulances are provided at public shows as a
’9              public relations exercise to benefit the
                ambulance service.     This is a matter for
                discretion of Authorities."


     45. Following the Bradford fire I decided that irrespective of
           finances we would place ambulances and crews into grounds at
           games where we felt it advisable;           this would happen at
           Sheffield Wednesday if the ground was going to be full or if
           the supporters had some particular reputation for trouble.
           In the case of the FA Cup Semi-final between Liverpool and
           Nottingham Forrest an ambulance was provided at the ground
           with its crew (with another ambulance and crew on standby
           nearby) because of the size of the crowd.


     46.   Our policy is for either or both of Station Officers Eason
           and Higgins to attend all matches at Hillsborough.


     47.   I recall that after                attended one meeting with
          Club Officials at Sheffield Wednesday he came back and told
          me that if it was going to cost the club money to provide
          ambulances   then they were not interested.       For major
          matches, therefore, the ambulances are provided in breach of
          the terms of paragraph 28 of DHSS circular HC(78)45.


    48.   The Club were, however, prepared to provide free tickets for
          the two liaison officers at every match and they regularly
m         sit in the same two seats in the South Stand behind the
          directors box from where they have good views of most of the
          ground.   When, however, the club knows that they can sell
          all the tickets for a match the seats are taken away from
          the liaison officers to be sold to the general public.   The
          liaison officers then make arrangements with the police to
          gain access to the ground and they position themselves at
          pitch level and I understand that this would normally be at
          the North East corner of the pitch.


    49.   In April 1988 I wrote again to the five football clubs and,
          in addition, to Doncaster race course.   I sent this letter
          because   there had recently been a pop concert at the
          Sheffield United football ground and they had refused to
          allow ambulances to be on standby because we had given them
          a price estimate of £1,000.     The attitude of the clubs
          generally seems to be that they would prefer to make a
          donation to the St. John's Ambulance Brigade or the Red
          Cross of about £50 and rely upon 999 calls if they need us.
      St. John's Ambulance Brigade and Red Cross do excellent work
      but they are not in a position to give immediate help beyond
      first aid.


50.   Another reason for my writing in April 1988 was that I
      thought that it may generate some income for the ambulance
      service.     This was a secondary motive.    There had not been
      any pressure put on me from any source to generate income
      but there was a lot of talk generally at the time about
      income generation within the National Health Service.




15th April 1989
51.   On Saturday 15th April 1989 I would normally have been on
      call but Alan Hopkins had agreed to do my on call duty
      instead because I was on a course at Sheffield University
      that morning in relation to my position as a Justice of the
      Peace.     The course finished at 1230 and I arrived home at
      about 1330.


52.   At about 1535                telephoned.    She was at ambulance
      control in Rotherham and she told me that there was a major
      incident at Hillsborough.    I told her that I was on my way.




53.   I left home and arrived at ambulance control at about 1550.
      I saw Mr Jones leaving in a staff car to go to Hillsborough.
He told me that there was a major incident at Hillsborough,
that people had died, and that Mr Hopkins and Mr Morley were
at the ground.    He was going down to the ground to back them
up.


I went into the control centre and met Mr Clarke in the
incident room (which had been set up by then) with Albert
Smith.   They briefed me of the situation, providing details
of the officers present at the ground, vehicle deployment,
and the backup from the neighbouring ambulance services.      I
gave instructions to call additional officers into the
Northern General and Royal Hallamshire Hospitals to act as
liaison officers.    Standards and efficiency officer
was sent to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital and Control
Superintendent                to the Northern General Hospital.
It was clear when I arrived that we had sufficient officers
at the ground but we also needed eyes and ears at the
hospital.     I was told by Mr Clarke that there were eleven
ambulances which had already been to the ground.
was in the incident room dealing with press enquiries.        I
went into the control room to speak to                about the
out-patient vehicles deployed to the ground.         He told me
that a further twelve vehicles had been deployed to the
scene.      I also spoke to                  to ensure that the
"domestic" emergency services were still being provided.
Having satisfied myself that they were in control of the
situation I went back to the incident room where I remained
until about 1755.



Whilst I remained at control I was basically monitoring what
was going on.      I was satisfied that my officers knew what
they were doing and that they were doing an excellent job.


There was no point in my going to the ground whilst the
incident was at its height.      Mr Hopkins was at the ground
and I was more use supervising the control end of the
operation.    In the event of a major incident either Mr
Hopkins or I will attend the incident itself and the other
will be at control.      The decision as to which of us is in
which position depends purely upon our locations when the
incident arises.      As I live near Doncaster it clearly made
more sense for me to travel to control in Rotherham.


Whilst at control I spoke to a number of the officers at the
scene and took a number of phone calls.     It is difficult for
me to recall the exact content of those conversations or the
order in which they happened.     I do remember that I tried to
contact Mr Hopkins at the ground and that there was some
difficulty with communications (which I shall deal with
later).   At one point I was able to speak to Mr Hopkins whom
I believe told me that either 27 or 37 were then dead but
that he thought there would be many more.     I told him to try
to keep in contact.     I spoke to him again later when he told
me that there were 53 dead.     I also spoke to Mr Jones and Mr
Morley during this time in order to receive up dates
relating to the situation at the ground.


I also remember a police inspector coming through to me at
about 1605 requesting more body bags.


As well as receiving up dates from the ground itself I was
being kept informed of the position by the staff both in the
main incident room and in the control room.     I took about
six telephone calls from the media which were mainly from
television or radio.   I had wanted to speak to them myself
because I knew that their reports would be going out almost
immediately and there would not be an opportunity to correct
any matters.


I recall speaking to David Jones at about 1620 when he told
me that all live casualties had left the ground and that
ambulances should be sent to Herries Road Bus Depot.         By
that time we were also transferring patients from the Royal
Hallamshire to make more space available for the incoming
casualties.


Throughout the whole of my time at Control I was satisfied
that we had sufficient vehicles and manpower at the scene.
I spoke to the Regional General Manager of Trent Regional
Health Authority twice whilst at Control.   He rang at about
1615 and I outlined the situation to him and he said that he
would do anything he could to help if we needed further
resources.    I told him that we had sufficient resources at
the scene and that we were receiving additional help and
cover from other ambulance authorities.      I then telephoned
Mr Edwards at about 1745 to give him an outline of some of
the statistics involved in the operation.


I went to the ground with Noel Wade,        leaving Control at
about 1755.    At that stage I was satisfied that, as far as
live casualties were concerned, the incident was closed.
When Mr Wade and I arrived at the ground we saw Mr Hopkins
and Mr Jones.     They briefed me as to the then current
situation and how the incident had gone.      Mr Hopkins said
that he thought we had moved about 200 casualties.      I also
spoke to each of the crews (about 8 crews) who were then
still at the ground before going into the gym to meet Chief
Superintendents Addis and Mole.      We arranged that our
ambulances would take the deceased to the Medico Legal
Centre in Sheffield when they had been identified by
relatives.    Dealing with the deceased is actually a police
responsibility but it is normal for the ambulance service to
co-operate in moving them in a situation such as this.       I
left the ground at about 1850 and went back to headquarters.
I gave a press statement to reporters who were there from
the Sheffield Star and Sunday Mail and an interview to the
BBC with Mr Hopkins.     They basically wanted details of
statistics.
64.   I went of duty at 2100.


Statistics
65.   Forty two ambulances attended the ground, of which 31 were
      SYMAS vehicles and 11 came from outside areas.             Most of
      these vehicles made several trips between the ground and the
      Sheffield Hospitals.       In addition further vehicles were
      brought in from outside SYMAS and were put on standby.          172
      casualties were taken to hospital by ambulance, initially to
      the Northern General and then to the Royal Hallamshire.
      Three patients were taken to Barnsley District General
      Hospital.     Ninety Four fatalities were taken to the Medico
      Legal Centre in Sheffield, some having been returned from
      the Northern General and Royal Hallamshire Hospitals to the
      gymnasium at the ground.       The last of the fatalities left
      Hillsborough at 0528 on Sunday 16th April 1989.                 The
      incident itself was closed by Mr Hopkins at 0530 on Sunday
      16th April.


66.   Four paramedics attended the ground and three others were on
      duty.   There was no point in deluging the ground with
      paramedics because it is difficult for them to put their
      extended training into practice in crowds.        In any event, by
      1620 there was no need for them.           I understand that there
      has   been    some criti c i s m   about   the   failure   to   use
      defibrillators.       I should explain that a defibrillator
      should not be used in a crowd situation.       It must only be
      used on a patient without a pulse.        If it is used on a
      patient who has a pulse, however weak, it would kill that
      patient, and if anyone was to touch a patient whilst the
      patient was being defibrillated then that person would
      receive an electric charge sufficient to kill them.


67. We received a large number of calls from the media.          The
      transcripts of our tapes show that by 1630 we had received
          53*0       calls   (although some calls may have been
      counted twice if they were transferred from one telephone to
      another).     These calls caused a problem in that they blocked
      lines which were much needed, for example by nurses doctors
      and ambulancemen calling in to see if they were needed at
      work plus otherr routine calls and domestic emergencies.


68.   Between 1500 and 1800 hours on 15th April we also dealt with
      49 domestic emergency calls.


61. As a result of the Hillsborough incident we have put in
      three additional telephone lines to the incident room to
      handle press calls.


Difficulties Experienced
62.   We did experience some difficulties in relation to access to
      the ground.     One problem was simply the crowds outside the
      ground, and another was vehicles in the way.      At one stage
the yard in the area of gate 0 was partially blocked         by
police vehicles and police horses.      It would have been our
intention to drive ambulances into the entrance by the
gymnasium which has recently been made in the row of
terraced houses, collect patients and drive out through gate
0 but that road was blocked because of a police feeding unit
being parked outside the gymnasium and because of other
police vehicles parked in the area of the entrance between
the terraced houses.     As a result of this ambulances had to
reverse into the yard through gate 0 which slowed down the
rate at which we were able to remove casualties away from
that area.


In addition a number of the ambulances         (and the major
incident vehicle when it first arrived at about 1540) were
trying to proceed up Penistone Road to gate 0 but were
directed by the police into the service road to the south of
the ground.


We did experience some difficulties in relation to radio
contact.     There were three main areas of difficulties:-


1.   The handsets did not always work properly because of
     the stands at the ground.     I understand that there is
     not normally any difficulty in using the handsets from
     the seats in the South Stand which Mr Eason and Mr
     Higgins would normally sit in because these are well
           above ground level.


      2.   The    sheer   weight   of   radio   traffic caused   some
           difficulties.     Most ambulances were told to use the
           emergency reserve channel but one or two used other
           channels in order to reduce the pressure on ERC.


      3.   There was      interference on the emergency reserve
           channel.     This seemed to appear only on 15th April but
           is still present.       Phillips (who supply and maintain
           our radio equipment) were called in immediately after
              15th April and they are still trying to locate the
              source of the interference.


      The problems with the radio transmission has only caused us
      minor difficulties.     They did not result in the operation
      being handled any differently.


Conclusion
65.   My attitude and that of my officers is that we wish to
      provide a swift and efficient service.      We have always tried
      to be at the forefront of the ambulance services.            The
      equipment obtained prior to the Orgreave civil disorders,
      our training of paramedics, the setting up of the incident
      room, and the changes introduced following the Bradford
      fire,    are all evidence of this.        Since the Hillsborough
      incident we have, as I mentioned above, already put in new
                              ■ ■ i-«M—»




        telephone lines to the incident room and a television and
        commercial radio are being installed so that, in any future
        major incident, contemporaneous media reports will also be
        received in the incident room.     We shall be reviewing the
        position to see if any further changes should be made but
        the only alterations which we have put in motion at present
        relate to the incident room which had not previously been
        used other than for testing.




Sports Grounds;       The Future

66.     SYMAS would wish to make submissions to phase two of the
        Inquiry as to safety of sports grounds in the future.    The
        fire service have a degree of involvement in the question of
        safety both because they issue a fire certificate and
        because they are consulted by the local authority who issue
        a certificate under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.
        I would wish the ambulance service to fulfil a similar role.
        Such a role would, in particular, deal with the question of
        ambulance access and egress as well as the provision of
        equipment and ambulances at major sporting events.       Our
        views and recommendations will be set out in more detail in
        due course.

     given       a     seat         in     the           Stand             but       I       had      been            asked         previously                by

     Graham          Mackrell,                the            Club          Secretary,                      to        take      a    seat       behind             the    di

     a    Football             match         elsewhere                         in    which            a       player           nearly          choked              b y _

     swallowing                his        tongue                 when          knocked             out.                  The       Football             Associatic

     had    made          a    direction                     that          a    Doctor              should               be    near       the          pitch.           Whe

     I    was    to       be    seated               was          a    much          more           convenient                     place       for          getting

     onto       the       pitch           quickly                 than          being             seated              in      the    Stand.

            My       wife       and         I    attended                      a    luncheon                    inthe         Executive                Suite       befc

     the    match             and     I     actually                      got       to       the area                    where       I was             to   be seatec

     at    about          2.40p.m.                       I       did       not       notice                anything                about       the          crowd       at

     that       stage.                Indeed                 I    cannot              say         that              I noticed            anything             unusual

     prior        to      the       match            being                stopped.                     I      had        not       particularly                   lookec

            When          the       match            was          stopped                I    simply                 thought         that          the       Police

              It       must       be       understood                          that              we       were              working                     in        the           middle                  of

    a       large          crowd.              We              were           slightly                         to              the           left             of        the           Goal              Posts

    the       Pitch.                  There            were             hundreds                       of         people                   in       that              immediate

         I    had       two       Brookes                airways             in       my       pocket          which         were          used       but

proved            useless             as       they       became             choked              with          vomit         very          quickly.

         I    remember                that          during             this p e r i o d              I    spoke           tp. a       Policewpman.

and      told       her       that             there          was       a    stretcher                   in     the       players           tunnel

which         she       should             go       and       fetch.                  I    never           actually              saw       her       with

the      stretcher                but          to        my    knowledge                   thestretcher                    has     gone          and       has

not      been       returned                   to        the      Club.

         When       there             seemed             to       be    no    more             that       we        could        do    on    the          pitcl

Mr.      Evans          and       I    ascertained                      that          there          were           casualties              in       the

Gymnasium.                    We       made          our          way       off       the       playing              area        and       round          the

back         of    the       North             Stand          where          we       came       upon           a    number           of    casualties

 laid        on    hoardings,                   most          of       whom were                obviously                 dead        but    there             was

one      lad       aged       about             twelve             years          in       a    red        shirt          (possibly              a

Liverpool               Football                Club          Team          strip)             who       did        not     appear          cyanosed.

 He    was        not       breathing                and          there       was          no    pulse              so    Mr.     Evans          and       I

 started           work       upon             him.               We    maintained                   that           task     until          an

 ambulance              crew          took          over          and       moved          him       from           us.          I would             add       the

 there        was       a    lorry             parked             between             where          this           lad was           laying          and

 the     First          Aid       Room          so       that          the    people             in        the       First        Aid       Room

  (which          was       dealing             with          a    number             of       minor          casualties               at    the          time)

 would        not       have          been          able          to    see       him          lying          there.

            I    arrived         in       Sheffield             at    about       2.00    pm    <1400)       on    Saturday,          15th

            April      1989       (150489)                with       my    brother       and    two    friends*           We    parked       abc

            half      to    three-quarters                      a    mile    from       the    ground    and       then    walked       to    t   t
            Leppings         LN       end       of       the    ground*           I    noticed    that       the    pubs       were    open

            with      fan?       relaxing                outside          with    drinks.        The    pubs       all    seemed       to    ha\

            been      open       on       the    route          from       the    motorway       to    the    ground*           I

At    about       2.1Q       pm    (141D)             we   arrived           at    the       ground.           Many          fans    were

loosely          congregated                and       moving       freely          about.           The       turnstiles             were

quite       quiet       with       approximately                   ten       to    fifteen          people          in       each       queue

My    carrier          bag    was       searched             by    a    Policeman.                 Once       inside          the

turnstile          it    was       again          easy       to    move       about          freely       and       my       young       broti

bought       a    programme.                 My       carrier          bag    was          searched       again          by    a    Police

inside       the       turnstile.                 I    visited          the       Gents       and       then    we       made       our       wa;

to    the    terracing             -    the       centre          section.                 Walking       through             the    tunnel

the    terracing             was       not    difficult,                there          was    no    pushing            or     crowding

that       stage.        On       reaching             the    terrace             we       found    that       it      was     already

quite       full.        We       decided             to    move       to    the       right       (looking            at     the       pitch

away       from    the       tunnel.




Two    of    us    reached             the    point          about          ten    yards          from    the          pitch       fence       a

realised          we    were       separated                from       the    other          two.        On    seeing          them       hig

up    we    made       our    way       up    to       the    crowd          to    join       them       about          fifteen          to

twenty       yards       away          from       the       perimeter             fence       and       five       yards       from       the

fence       separating             the       c e n t re      and       side       sections          of    the          terracing.




Between          2.2Q    pm       (1420)          and       3.00       pm    ( 150Q)         we    gradually             became          more

and    more       tightly          packed.                 Much    more       so       than       even    in       a    tight       crowd

the    Anfield          Kop.           It    became          so    tight          that       occasionally                surges          of

pushing          and    pressure             did       not    actually             cause          any    movement             of    note.

Occasional             groans          of    pain          were    heard.              I    specifically               mentioned              to

friend       “ It's      so       tight       in       here       that       we    are       not    even       surging             at    all,

just       oscillating             more       or       less       on    the       spot."




I    noticed       that       despite             this       increase             in       pressure       in       the       centre

section,          fans       on    the       other          side       of    the       fence       (ie.       in       the    side       sect

to    our    right)          were       moving             about       freely          and    that       section             did    not

appear       to       be       filling        at        all.




I    looked       up       from       time         to    time     to       the    front       of    the       stand       above       and

behind       us       -    there        was        a    Police        Sergeant          there       observing             the

terracing             but       not     really           doing        much.




A    few    policemen                or. t h e         pitch    side        of    the       perimeter          fence          did    not    se

to    have       noticed             (1 ) how           tight     we       were       packed       and    (2 ) t h a t         the    side

section          was       noticeably                  more    empty.




Fans       began          to    express            their        discomfort             by    criticising                the    ground,

brought          no       response            in       terms     of    action          from       the    police.




I    vaguely          remember            a    tannoy           announcement                asking       us    to       move    down       to

the    front          -    there        were           ironic     jeers          from       the    crowd       in       response       to


this.




The    game       started.                I didn't              feel       any    surge       in    terms          of    movement          -

just       another             noticeable               increase           in    the    by    now       abnormal          level       of       be

pressure          all          round.          People           stood       on    barriers          in    front          and    shouted

"Get       back,          get    back."                 This     was       impossible,             we    were       all       pinned

stationary                by    the     pressure               from    front,          sides       and    back.




Policemen             at       the     perimeter               fence       at    last       seemed       to    notice          the

problem.              The       gate      was          opened.         A    policeman             tried       in    vain       to    pull       e

fan    out.           I    could        not        see    the     game          which       had    started          never       mind        whs

was    happening                on     the     terracing              below       us.        The    policeman             looked       verv

worried          and       seemed         to       shout        into       his    radio       as    he    looked          to    his        lefi

and    my    right.              I     got     the        impression             he    was    saying          “S t o p    it,       stop       iT


stop       it"    -       I assumed            he       meant     the       match.

Of        the       six       minutes          of       the      match        (I    heard          later          it    was       six       minutes)

remember                 less       than       twenty            seconds.               I was          so       intent       and       occupied                b

d u   r    safety             that       watching             the       match       was       impossible.                    I    tried       to       kee

an        eye       on    my    young          brother             who       was    pressed             firmly          against             the       side

fence           a    few       yards          away.           He       seemed       okay          but       I    couldn't          get       near          hii

anyway.




Fans        seemed             to    spill          over         the     front          perimeter                fences          but    they          were

walking              and       running             although             obviously             shaken.




The        match          stopped             and       many       police          arrived             at       the    perimeter             fence.




Fans        next          to    the       side          fence          had    begun          to    climb          over       in    small          numbe

to        reach          the    side          section            of     terracing.                 A    very          distraught             young             m

on        the       other       side          of    the       fence          (he    had       previously                been       in       the       cent

section)                 shouted          "Get          over       the       fence       -    t h e y ’ re        getting          squashed                at

the        bottom."




One        by       one       fans       climbed             over.       I    followed             my       brother          over       and       by       th'

I     saw       the       first          of    the       injured             or    dead       being             lifted       out       at    the

front.               I    immediately                   headed          for       the    pitch          gate.           At       the    gate          thers

were        two          or    three          policemen                inside       the       terrace            and     one       or       two       on       t!

trackside.                     I shouted                " I ’m     a    doctor,          let       me       on    the    pitch."              I was

pushed              away       as    a    body          was      passed           through          (having             been       lifted          over             t

side        fence             and    carried             to      the     gate       in       the       side       section          where          I    by

t hen' w a s          situated).                    I    put       my    foot       on       the       wall      and     a    policeman                call

me    as        I    leapt          up.       My        head       struck          the       crossbar            of     the       gate       with          a

heavy           blow.           Adrenalin                coursing             through             my    body          rendered          the       blow

virtually                 painless            but        I    felt       unsteady             for       a    few       seconds.

I made        my       way         on    to       the          pitch          and       reached          a       body       near    the       goal       lin

Somebody           was         crouched                over             it.        I asked          is       he       breathing,           has      he    go

p u l s e , the         answers                  were          no.        I    saw       he    was       cyanosed             and       was

pulseless.                 I       knelt          next             to    him       thumped          and          thumped          his     chest       hard

three        times.                I    commenced                   mouth          to    mouth          r e s u s c i t a t ion         and     instruc

the    man       next          to       me       to    give             cardiac          massage             in       the    ratio        5-1.        I ma

a    conscious             decision                   "This             man    was       one       of    the          first       out,     therefore

give       him     a    decent               chance                at    cardiopulmonary                         r e s u s c i t a t i o n ."




As    we     continued                  to       give          CPR       I shouted             to       nearby          policemen             to    find

out     if    we       could            get       a    Defibrillator                         and    some          oxygen.           We     continued

with       CPR     and         I       discovered                   my    assistant                was       a    male       nurse.




We    were       by     now            surrounded                   by    milling             figures             in    black       -     policemen

policewomen.                       A    distraught                      teenage          fan       came          over       and    pu t    his      face       *

to    that       of     the            body       and          yelled          words          like       "Come          on    mate,        don't         die

you     can't          die,            you're          a       Liverpool                fan."           I was          told       that     there         was

Defibrillator                      but       I was             given          an    oxygen          cylinder                and    informed           that

was    switched              on.             I    pulled                the    flimsy          ventimask                off       the     tube      and    p

the    open        tube            in    my      own           mouth          to    enrich          the          oxygen       in    the       air     I wa

giving       to        the         patient.




We    continued              with            CPR.              I    soon       realised             nothing             was       coming        out      of '

tube.        The        valve            was          turned             on    and       I    looked             at    the    gauge        which

showed       an       empty             tank.              I       discarded             the       tube.




People       kept          coming             up      and          shouting              advice          and          I kept       i n f o r m i n g ther

that       I was       a     doctor              and           knew       what          I was       doing.

A    gentleman          with       a    blazer             and    tie       indicated                he   was           a    doctor                and    gai

encouragement.




Ten       minutes       passed.              The       patient             seemed          to    have             lost       some          of       his

cyanosis          but       he    was       still          pulseless.                 At    tan       minutes                I said                "Five

more."           By    now       there       was       a    cacophony                of    sound          around             me       and          from    ti

terracing.              However,             as       I was       surrounded                by       people             mainly             standing

I    could       not    see       anything             that       was       happening                at       the       front             of       the

centre       section*              A    distraught                young          fan       was       making             it       difficult                for

me    to    concentrate                and       I    asked       a    policeman                to    "Get             rid       of       him."           He

gently       escorted             the       fan       away.




At    about       fifteen          minutes             I was          about          to    say       to       a    policeman                   to    cove

the       body    when       his       heart          sprang          to    life          and    he       developed                   a    good

pulse.           He    was       still       not       breathing                so    I    continued                   to    ventilate                   him

A    policeman          asked          if    I       needed       a    stretcher                and       I       said       yes.              One

arrived          and    we       lifted          the       man    on       to    i t.       We       lifted             and       started

towards          the    ambulance                which       had       arrived             behind             the       goal.




As    I    stood       up    I    saw       for       the    first          time          some       suggestion                   of       the       seal?

of    the    casualties.                    To    get       to    the       ambulance                we       had       to       step          over       abe

ten       bodies.           They       mostly          looked          like          young       men,             some       had          their          heac

covered          with       Police          raincoats.




We    had    to       stop       every       few       paces          so    I    could          give          the       patient                a    breath

into       his    lungs.           As       we       lifted       him       into          the    ambulance                   I    saw          the       bodi

of    two    young          men    already             in    there.              I    continued                   to    ventilate                   him    wi

mouth       to    mouth          resus citat ion                 and       he   began           to    make             his       own       breathinc

efforts.

It    is    almost          impossible                   to       express'my                   thoughts             at       that       time-              No

words       will       do    but       it       felt             like       a    chaotic             nightmare                overloading                      all

senses,




I    told    the       ambulance                man          and       a    police             sergeant             that          the       man       was

seriously             ill    and       needed                a    hospital             "Now."                 The       ambulance             man          said

he    c o u l d n ’t       get    out.              This          added          to    the          frustration                   -    not    helped

by    my    thoughts             that          in       view          of    the       length             of    time          he       was    pulseless

it    would          probably          be       kinder                if    he       died.           I    am    sure          he       must       have          be*

sevsrly          brain       damaged                by       that          time.




I    left    him       lying          on       his       side          breathing                on       his    own          and       asked          a

policeman             to    try       to       get       him          to    hospital                as    soon          as    possible.                    I    sa:

I    would       go    to    see       if       I       could          help          somebody             else.              It       seemed          at       tha'.

time       that       the    perimeter                   fence             was       obscured             by    policemen                   and       some        f-:

trying       to       get    people             out          of       the       terraces.




I    searched          for       somebody                needing                help.           I    stopped             a    group          of       fans

lifting          a    body       on    a       makeshift                   stretcher,                some       of       them          seemed             to    be

trying       to       do    CPR.           I    saw          that          it    was       a    boy       aged          about          14.        I       said       t

them       that       if    they       wanted                to       give       him       a    chance,             they          should          stop          anc

do    the    resuscitation                      properly.




They       put       him    down       and          I    started                mouth          to    mouth          -    filling             his          lungs

with       air.        A    girl       next             to       me    did       the       heart         massage.                     His    face          was

covered          with       vomit          and          he       was       obviously                dead       so       we    stopped             within

about       60       seconds.




I    looked          desperately                for          somebody                not       dead       but       seriously                i ll         who     ne

help.        I       could       not       find          anybody                in    that          category             in       the       goal      area.

They    were          all       either            dead        or      okay         with       nothing          in    between-              I    looks

up    and       saw       three         or       four       groups            of     people         at       the    other       end       of    the

pitch       giving             CPR-          I    ran       to     the        other          end.




The    first          body          I    came       to      was       a    man       about         25       years    old*        A    dark       hair

young       woman          in       a   Celtic           football               shirt         was       trying       to    give       him       CPR-

asked       "Has          he    a       pulse,"          she       said         "I      d o n ’t    think          so."     I    started

giving          him       mouth         to       mouth        as      she       did      the       cardiac          massage-              After       a

short       while          we       swapped            over.              Opposite            me    his       friend       (or       brother?)

was    beside             himself            with        overwhelming                    grief          and    distress-              He       was

shouting             words          like         “C o m e     on,         you're         not       dead"       and    looking             at    me    an

shouting             "Keep          going,          don't          stop,           don't       stop-"




I    said       to    the       girl         quietly             "He's          gone."             She       replied       calmly          but

obviously             very          sadly         "I     know-"               His       friend          (brother)          was       so    much       in

despair.              Another             young          doctor               took      my    place          doing    heart          massage,

was    hopeless -




I    went       to    the       other            two     or      three          bodies.             People          were    doing          very       go

cardiopulmonary                         resuscitation                     but      it    was       obviously          too       late       for       the




I    said       to    a    photographer                     that          I    hoped         that       the    papers       were          going       to

"Hammer          this          ground            for     what         happened               today."           I    told    them          my    name

about       the       absence             of      equipment.                    They         took       a    photograph          despite             me


telling          them          not       to.




I    went       to    the       side         of     the       pitch            (opposite            the       players       tunnel)             and       s

quite       a    few       people            propped             up       against            the    hoarding          with       somebody

helping          them          all.          I    shouted             that         I was       a    doctor          and    did       anybody          ne

only       people             I    had       seen       carried             up    the          field          were       dead       so    I headed

back       to    the          Leppings             LN       end.        I    passed             through             the       line       of    policems

across          the          entrance             ('.•.'hat w e r e         they       doing,             I    thought          -    not       much!).

As    I went             through             I    asked       four          or    five          of       them       if    they       could          tell       r

where       there             might          be    injured          people             I       could          help.           The    general             re p !

was       that       they          couldn't             and       that       they          were          sorry.




I    am    fairly             sure       that          I went       back          into          the       goal       area       at       the    Leppinc

LN    end.           I       have       to       admit       that       by       now       I was          angry,          confused             slightly

and       feeling             quite          helpless.              I did          definitely                      ask    a    policewoman                "I

a    doctor,             can       you       tell       me    where          the       injured                may    have       been          taken       so

might       help?”                 No    she       could          not.




There       did          not       seerr: t o          be    much       I    could             do    at       that       end.        Some       people

lying       down             with       people          helping             said       they          were          okay.        I    could          not     f:

anybody          seriously                   ill       needing          help.              Just          dead       or    seemingly             minor

injuries             and          shaken          people.




I    headed          towards             the       other          end       again.              Quite          a    few       people          asked       me

how       I was          -    I    remembered                my    head          and       my       face       was       now    covered             in

blood.           I       kept       saying             "I'm       okay"          but       I    really             didn't       feel          okay.




I aksed          the          police          again          where          I should                go.        They       did       not       know.




By    now       the          combination                of    having             been          in    the       crush,          trying          to    do

resuscitation                      on    hopeless             cases,             trying             to    find       others          to       help,       the

absolute             cacophony                and       confusion,                the          lack       of       information                from       the

police          and          the    bang          on    my    head          became             too       much.           I felt          very       angry

at    the       way          we    had       been       treated.                 I knew             who       was    to       blame       -    the

Police.              I       felt       compelled             to    tell          some          senior          Liverpool                football

club       official                not     to       let    them       blame         the       fans       for    this.




I    went       up    the          players'           tunnel          saying            "I'm    a     doctor.             I        need       to see

somebody             in    authority                from       LFC."           These          words       opened          the       police

line.           Outside             the       changing          rooms          it       was    very       confused.                 Lots         of    ms

in    suits,          blazers             and       ties-.




I    saw    Jimmy          HILL          (BBC)       and       forced          him       to    listen          to    my       account            of    wf-

happened-                 Hs       looked       pale       and       very       concerned-                 Then       a    man          said       "Wil

you    come          and       say       that       on    the       air?"           I    said       "Why?"          but       agreed          to.       F

took       me    a    few          yards       to    the       laundry.                 He    put    headphones                on       and      wrote

down       my    name-              He    shouted          into       a    microphone                "Tell          Peter          to    hand         ovt

to    me    now!"




Next       he    was       talking             and        introducing               me,       and    then       shoved             the       big

microphone                up       to     my    face.           I    felt      awful,           angry         andupset             but       I     just

started          talking.                 The       last       words        I said            were       "It's        an absolute

disgrace-"                 I meant             the       way    we    were          allowed          to       get    so       tightly            packs

and    on       the       pitch          the    total          lack       or    organisation                   and    equipment                  after

disaster             struck-              I    said       on    the       air       that       I had          seen    eight             to    ten

dead.           In    retrospect                I    had       probably             seen       about          fifteen          so       I thought

probably             twenty          to       thirty       were       dead          overall.              The       radio          men       said

thank       you       in       a    very       sombre          voice.           I said          "Was          that    going             out      live.

He    said       thank             you    again          and    shook          my       hand.




I    went       out       and       saw       Kenny       DALGLISH.                 I told          him       what    had          happened            ar

t h a t ■h e     must          not       let    the       fans       get       the       blame-           I    told       him       that         the

ground          (Hillsborough)                      was     "Shit."             He       told       me    that       LFC       were          not      haj

about       the       ground             being       used       but       these          things          were       out       of    their

control.              He       was       very       shaken.

A    linesman             or    the       referee           showed            me       into       their             room       to       get          cleaned

up.        I    did       this       and       inspected             the          split          in    my       scalp          -       it       needed          twc

or    three          stitches             but    that          could          wait       I thought.                       I    remember

apologising                for       getting          blood          on       a    towel          -    how          ridiculous!




I went          back       on       the       pitch.           All       the       bodies             had       gone.              I    climbed             ba ct

on    the       terrace             up    to    my    brother                and       friends.                 I    saw       policemen                   in       tt-

now    almost             empty          centre       section                collecting                belongings.                          I    told       the

lads       what       had       happened             on     the      pitch.              All          of    a       sudden             for       the       first

time       I    felt       a    searing          pain          in    my       head       and          said          "God,          my       head       hurts.




At    no       time       at    Hillsborough                   did       I    realise             people             had       died             in    the

tunnel.              At    no       time       did    I     see      anything                to       substantiate                      claims             that

policemen             were          assaulted             or    bodies             were          looted.                 I saw          brave          young

fans       trying          to       save       lives        hopelessly.                      I    saw       brave             lads          organise

themselves                to    make          makeshift             stretchers                   to    carrythe                    dead.              I saw

some       police          desperately                trying             to       save       lives.                 I also             saw       some       poli

standing             idly       -    not       knowing          what          was       happening                   or    making                any    attemj

to    f ind      out .




I    did       not    see       at       any    time        any      fan          (whether             before             or       after             the    brie

game)       misbehave                deliberately                   in    any          way.




After          the    game          had       been    abandoned                   we    left          the       ground             via          the    centre

section          on       the       tunnel.           Remembering                      the       fan       we    had          resuscitated                      I

gave.a          policeman                my    name       and       address.                 I felt             it       very          unlikely             that

he    would          have       survived             arid      reconciled                myself             by       the       fact             that       if       he

STA T EM E NT OF DR. G L Y N PHI LL I PS W I T H R E G AR D T O EVENTS AT SHFFFTET.n WEDNESDAY

F O O T B A L L CLUB, HILLSBOROUGH, SHEFFIELD, O N SATURDAY, 15th A PR IL 1989.



I a m Dr. G l y n M i c h ae l Ph i ll i ps o f _______________ _________ ___________     Glasgow

a fully q u a l i f i e d medical pr a ctitioner having qualified frcm Leeds University

in J u n e 1980.       M y qualifi c at i on s are M.B. Ch.B. M.R.C.G.P. D.R.C.O.G.



I arrived in Sh ef fi e ld at about 2.00p.m. on Saturday, 15th A pril 1989 w i t h my

brot he r and two friends.              W e parked about h a l f to three-quarters a mile from

the gr ound a nd then w a lk e d to t he Leppings Lan e end of the ground.                 I noticed

that the pub s w e r e op e n w i t h fans relaxing outside w i t h drinks.             T he pubs all

seemed to h a v e b e e n op en o n the route from the motorway to ths g r o u n d .           I

specifically r e m e m b e r thinking that this w ould not h a v e been the case in Scotland
w h e r e I n o w live and work.



A t about 2.10p.m. we arrived at the ground.                 Ma n y fans we r e loosely congregated

and m o v i ng f r ee l y about.       T h e turnstiles w e r e quite quiet w i t h approximately ten

to fifteen p e o p l e in e ac h queue.         M y carrier b ag w as searched b y a policeman.

On ce inside the turnstile it w as again easy to move about freely and m y young

brother boug h t a programme.             M y carrier b a g w as searched again b y a policeman

inside the turnstile.              I visi te d the G ents and then w e m a de o u t wa y to the

terracing — the centre section.                Walk i ng through the tunnel to the terracing w as

not difficult,         there w a s no pushing o r crowding at that stage.          O n reaching the

terrace w e found that it w as already quite full.                 W e decided to move to the right
(looking at the pitch) aw ay from the tunnel.



T w o of u s r e a c h e d the point about ten yards from the pitch fence and realised we

were separated fr om the o t h e r two.            O n seeing them higher up w e mad e our wa y up

to the crowd to jo i n t h e m about fifteen to twenty yards away fr om the perimeter

fence and fi ve yards fr om the fence separating the centre and side sections of
the terracing.



Betw e en 2.20p.m.           and 3.00p.m. w e gradually be came more and m o r e tightly packedJ

Much more       so tha n even in a tight crowd on the Anfield Kop.              It became      so tight

that o cc a si o n a l l y    surges o f pushing and pressure did not actually cause           any

m ov e me n t of note.          O ccasional groans of pa i n w e r e heard.   I specifically

m en t io n ed to m y friend "It's so tight in here that w e are n ot even surging at all,
just oscill a ti n g mo r e or less on the spot."



I noticed       that despite this increase in pressure in the centre section,                  fans on

the other       side of the f ence (i.e. in the side section to our right) were moving

a bout freely and that secti o n did not appear to be filling at all.
I looked u p f r o m time to time to the front of the stand above and behind u s -

there w as a p o l i c e sergeant there observing the terracing but n o t reallv doing
    , - ■—                        _____
much. -                                   .........                    ....            .... — ---



A few p ol i ce m en o n the p i t c h side of the perimeter fence did no t seem to have

noticed (l) h o w t ight we wer e packed and ( 2 ) that the side secti o n was noticeably
more empty



Fans b e ga n to e x p r e s s their discomfort by criticising the ground.            It brought
n o response in t e rm s of a c tion from the police.



I vaguely r e m e m b e r a tarmoy announcement asking us to move down to the front -
there were iron ic jeers from the crowd in response to this.



T h e game started.      I didn't feel any surge in terms of movement - just another

noticeable i n c re a se in the b y n o w abnormal level of body pressure all round.

People stood on ba rriers in front and shouted "Get back, get back".                    This was

impossible, w e w e r e all pinned stationary by the pressure from front, sides and
back.



Policemen at th e perimeter fence at last seemed to notice the problem. The gate

w as opened.    A p o l i ce m an tried in vai n to pull a fan out.           I could not see the

game w h ic h h a d s t a r te d never mi n d what w a s happening on the terracing b el o w us.

The policeman l oo k ed very wor r ie d and seemed to shout into h is r ad i o as h e looked

to his left an d m y right.        I got the impression he was saying "Stop it, stop it,
s to p it" - I a s s u m e d he meant the match.



O f the s ix m i n u t e s of the m a t c h (I heard later it was six minutes)       I remember less

than twenty seconds.        I w as so intent and occupied by our safety that w atching the

m at c h was impossible.     I tried to k e e p an eye on m y young brother w h o w as pressed

firmly against the side fence a fe w yards away.                He seemed o k ay but I couldn-'t
get ne ar h i m anyway.



Fans seemed to sp i ll over the front p er imeter fences but they w e r e walking and
running a l t h o u g h ob v iously shaken.



T he m a t c h s t o p p ed and m a n y police arrived at the perimeter fence.



Fans next to the s i d e fence had begun to c l i m b over in small numbers to reach

the side s e ct i on of terracing.        A ve ry distraught young m a n on the other side of

the fence (he h a d previously be e n in the cent r e section) shouted "Get over the
fence - they're g e t t i n g squashed at the b o t t o m " .
                                              Page 3



O n e b y one fans climbed over.            I followed m y brother over and b y then I s aw

the first of the injured or dead being lifted out at the front.                      I immediately

headed for the p i t c h gate.         A t the g a te there w e r e two or three policemen inside

the terrace and o n e or two o n the trackside.                I shouted "I'm a doctor, let m e on

the pitch."       I w a s pushed a w a y as a b o d y w a s passed through (having been lifted

over the side f e n c e and c a r r ie d to the g a t e in the side section w he r e I b y then

w a s situated).      I put m y foot on the wall and a policeman polled m e as I leapt

up.   M y head s t r u c k the cro s sb ar of the g a t e wi t h a h e av y blow.    Adrenalin coursing

thro ug h m y b o d y r endered the b l o w v i r tu al l y painless but I felt unsteady for a few

seconds. —



I m a de my way on to the p i t c h and reached a bo dy near the goal line.                Somebody

was crouched o v e r it.         I asked is h e breathing, h a s h e got a pulse, the answers

w e r e no.   I sa w h e w as c yanosed and w as pulseless.           I knelt next to h i m fckfaaag and

thumped his ch e st hard t h re e times.              I commenced m ou t h to m o u t h resuscitation and

instructed the m a n next to m e to give card i ac massa ge in the ra tio.5-1.                - I made

a conscious d e c i s i o n "This m a n was one of the first out, therefore, give h i m a

decent c h an ce at c ar d io p ul m on ar y resuscitation."



As we continued to g i ve C P R I shouted to n e arby policemen to find out if we could

g e t a D e f i b r i l l a t o r and so me oxygen.   W e continued w i t h CPR and I discovered my

a ssistant was a m a l e nurse.



W e we r e by n o w surroun d ed b y m i l l i ng figures in bl a ck - policemen and policewomen.

A distraught t e e n a g e fan c a m e over and put h is face u p to that of the body and

yelled words li k e       "Come on mate, don't die, you can't die, you're a Liverpool fan".

I was told that t he r e w a s no D e fibrillator but I was given an oxygpn rviindpr and

informed that it w a s s w itched o n ?           r pulled the flimsy ventimask off the tube and

p u t the open tube in m y own m o u t h to enri c h the oxygen in the a ir I w as giving to
                                                          *
t he p a t i e n t .



W e continued w i t h CPR.        I soo n realised nothing was coming out of the tube.              The

v al ve was turned on and I looked at the g a u g e w h i c h showed an empty tank.             I
discarded the"tube.



P eople kept c o m i n g u p a nd sho ut i ng a dvice and I kept informing them that I was a

d octor and k n e w w h a t I w a s doing.



A gentleman w i t h a b la z er and tie indicated h e was a doctor and g a v e encouragement.
T e n m i nu t es passed.      T he pati en t seem e d t o have lost some of hi s cyanosis but

h e w a s still pulseless.            A t ten minu t es I said "Five more".            B y n o w there was

a ca c ophony of sound around m e and from the terracing.                      However, as I was

s urrounded b y p e o p l e m a i n l y standing,     I could not see anything that was

h a p p e ni n g at th e   front    of the centre section.         A distraught young fan w as making

it difficult for           m e to c on c en t ra t e and I asked a policman to "Get rid of him".
H e g e n t l y e s c o r t e d the fan away.



A t about f i f te e n minutes I w a s about to s a y to a policeman to c o v er the body

w h e n his h e a r t s p r an g to life and h e developed a good pulse.               H e w as stilt not

breathing so I c on tinued to v e nt i l a t e him.           A policeman asked if I needed a

s tr e tc h er and I said yes.         O ne arrived and w e lifted the m a n on to it.               W e lifted

and started t o w a r d s the ambulance w h i c h had arrived behind the goal.



As I stood u p I s a w for the f irst time some suggestion of the scale of the

casualties.        T o g e t to the a m bu l an c e w e ha d to step over about ten bodies.                   They

m os tl y looked li ke young men, some had their heads covered wi t h police raincoats.



W e h a d to sto p e v e r y fe w paces so I could give the patient a b r e a t h into his lungs.

As v<e lifted h i m        into the a mb u lance I s a w the bodies of two young men already in

there.      I c o n t i n u e d to v e n t i l at e h i m w i t h m ou t h to m o ut h resuscitation and he
began to ma k e h i s own b r e a t h i n g efforts.



It is almost impossible to express m y thoughts at that time.                          N o words will do

b u t it felt like a chaotic nightmare overloading all m y senses.



I told the a m b u l a n c e m a n and a police sergeant that the m a n w as seriously i n                     and

needed a h o s p i t a l   "Now".     T h e ambulance m a n said he couldn't ge t out.              This added

to the f r u s t r a t i o n - not h e l pe d b y m y thoughts that in v i e w of the length of time

h e w as pulseless,        it w ould pro ba b ly be kinder if h e died.            I a m sure he must have
b e e n s everely b r a i n damaged b y that time.



I left h i m l y i n g on his side br ea thing on his own and asked a policeman to try to

g e t h i m to h o s p i t a l as soo n a s possible.      I said I would g o to s ee if I could help

some bo d y e l s e .   It seemed at that time that the perimeter fence wa s obscured b y

pol i ce m en and s o m e fans trying to g et people out of the terrace.



I searched for som e bo d y nee d in g help.           I stopped a g r ou p o f fans lifting a body

on a m ak e sh i ft stretcher, s o m e of them seemed to be trying to d o CPR.                     I saw that

it w a s a boy a g e d about 14.         I said to them that if they w a nted to give h i m a

chance, they s h o u l d stop and do the resuscitation properly.
T h e y put h i m d o w n and I started m o u t h to m o u t h - filling his lungs w i t h air.

A girl next t o m e did the h e a r t massage.         H is face was covered w i t h v om i t and

h e was o b vi o u s l y de ad so w e stopped w i t h i n about 60 seconds.



I looked d e s p e r a t e l y for s omebody not dead b u t seriously ill w h o needed help.

I could not fin d a n y bo dy in that category in the goal area. T h e y w e r e all either

dead or okay w i t h noth i ng in between.         I looked u p and s a w three or four groups

of people at the other end of the p it c h givi ng CPR.               I ran to t h e other end..



The first b o d y I c a m e to was a m a n about 25 years old.           A dark-haired young        '

w o m a n in a C e l t i c football shirt was trying to give h i m CPR.          I asked "Has h e

a pulse", she said           "I don't think so".       I started giving h i m m o u t h to m o u t h as

she did the c a r d i a c massage. A f t e r a short w hi l e we swapped over.         Opposite me

h is friend (or brother?) wa s beside h i m se l f w i t h overwhelming grief and distress.

H e w a s shouting w o r d s like "Come on, y ou ' re n ot dead" and looking at m e and

shouting "Keep going, don't stop, don't stop".



I said to the g i r l q u i e tl y "He's g o n e ” .   She replied calmly b u t obviously v e r y

sadly "I know".         H i s friend (or brother) was so mu c h in despair.            Another young

doctor took m y p l a c e d oing h e a r t massage.      It was hopeless.



I   vent to   the o t h er two or three bodies.         People were doing v e r y good card io ­

pul monary r e s u s c i t a t i o n b u t it was obviously too late for them.



I said to a p h o t o g r a p h e r that I h oped that the papers were going to "Hammer this

ground for w h a t h a p p e ne d today".    I told t h e m m y name and about the absence of

equipment. T h e y t o o k a p ho t o g r a p h despite m e telling them not to.



I wen t to the s i d e of the p it ch (opposite t h e players tunnel) and s a w q uite a few

people propped u p against the ho arding w i t h somebody helping t h e m all.                 I shouted

that I w as a d o c t o r and did anybody need a n y help.          All I he a rd in reply was that

they w e r e all o k a y .    The only people I h a d se en carried u p the field we r e dead

s o I head e d b a d e to the Leppings lane end.          I passed through the line of policemen

across the c e n t r e (what w e r e they doing, I thought - no t much!).            A s I w e n t through

I asked, four or five of th e m if they could tell m e w here there m i g h t b e injured

people I c ould help.          T he general reply was that they couldn't and that they were
sorry.



I a m f airly s u r e that I we n t b a c k into the goal area at the L eppings L a ne end.

I have to a d mi t that b y n o w I w a s angry, confused slightly and feeling quite

helpless.     I did defini te l y a s k a p o licewoman "I a m a doctor, c a n y o u tell m e
where the injured m a y h a v e b e e n taken s o I m i g h t help?".      N o s h e could not.
T h e r e did n ot s e e m to b e m u c h I could do at that end.             Some people lying down

w i t h pe ople h e l p i n g said they w e r e okay.           I could not find anybody seriously ill

n e e di n g help.   J u s t dead or s ee m in gl y m i n o r injures and shaken people.



I h e aded towards th e other end again.                    Q u i te a few people asked m e h o w I was -

I remembered m y h e a d and m y face was n o w covered in blood.                     I ke pt saying "I'm
Okay" b ut I r e a l l y     didn ' t feel             okay.



I asked the p o l i c e      again w h e r e           I should go. T h e y did       not know.



B y now the c o m b i n a t i o n of h a vi n g bee n in the crush, trying to do resuscitation

on h o peless cases,        trying to find others to help, the absolute cacophony and

confusion,     the lack of information from the police and the ba n g on m y head became

t oo much.       I f e lt    v e r y a n g r y at     the w a y w e h a d been treated.   I knew   w h o was

to blame - t he police.            I felt compelled to           tell sane senior Liverpool football
c l u b officials not to let t he m blame the fans for this.



I went u p the players'           tunnel saying "I"m a doctor. I need to see somebody in

a ut h ority f r o m LFC".      T h e s e words opened the police line.            Outside the changing

rooms it was v e r y confused.             Lo ts of m e n in suits, blazers and ties.



I s a w Jimmy H i l l   (BBC) a nd forced h i m to listen to m y account of w ha t happened.

H e looked p a l e and v e r y concerned.              Then a m a n said "Will y o u come and say that on

the air?".       I said "Why?" b u t agreed to.                H e took m e a fe w yards to the laundry.

H e put h ea dp h on e s on and wrote down m y name.               H e shouted into a microphone "Tell
P eter to hand o v e r to m e n o w !".



Nex t he w as t a l ki n g and introducing me, and then shoved the big microphone up to                            „

m y face.     I fe l t awful, a n g r y and upset b u t I j u s t started talking.            The last         /

words I said w e r e "It's an a b solute disgrace".                   I meant the w ay w e were allowed

to g e t so t i g h t l y packed and on the p i t c h the total lack of organisation and

e qu i pment a f t e r disaster struck.              I said on the air that I h ad seen eight to ten

dead.     In r e t r o s p e c t I h a d pr o ba bl y seen about fifteen so I thought probably

twenty to t h i r t y we re dead overall.               Th e radio m a n said thank you in a very

s om b re voice.     I said "Was that g o in g out live"?               H e said thank you again and
s ho ok m y hand.



I went out a nd s a w Ke n ny Dalglish.                I told h i m w h a t h a d happened and that h e must

not let the fans g et the blame.                    I told h i m that the ground (Hillsborough) was

 Shit".     H e told m e that L F C w e r e n o t h a pp y about the ground being used b ut these

things wer e o ut of their .control. H e was v e r y shaken.
A linesmen o r t he refer e e s h o we d m e into their r o o m t o g et clea n ed up.         I did

this a n d i ns pected the s p l i t in m y s ca l p - it needed two, or three stitches but

that could w a i t I thought.             I r emember apologising for g e t t in g b l oo d on a towel
h o w ridiculous!



I w e n t ba c k on t he pitch.*         A l l the bo dies h ad gone.    I climbed ba ck on the

terrace u p t o m y b r o t h e r and friends.           I s a w policemen in t h e n o w almost empty

c ent re s e c t i o n c o l l e c t i n g belongings.   I told the lads w h a t h a d happened on'the

pitch.     A l l of a s u dd e n f or the first time I felt a searing p a i n in m y head and
said "God, m y h e a d hurts".



A t no time at H i l l s b o r o u g h did I realise people had died in the tunnel.             A t no

time did I s e e an yt hi n g to substantiate claims that policemen w e r e assaulted or

b odi es we r e looted.         I s a w b r a v e young fans trying to save lives hopelessly.

I s a w b rave lads organise themselves to m a k e makeshift stretchers to carry the

dead.     I s a w s o m e police despe r at e ly trying to save lives.           I als o s a w some

police sta n di n g idly - n o t know i ng wh a t was happening or m ak i ng any attempt to
find out.



I did not s ee at a n y time a n y fan (whether before or after t he brief game) mis­
b eh av e d e l i b e r a t e l y in a n y way.



A f t e r the gam e h a d bee n abandoned w e left the ground via the centre section on

the tunnel.        R e m e m b e r i n g the fan w e had resuscitated I gave a policeman m y name

a nd address.        I fe lt it v e r y unl i ke l y that h e would have survived and reconciled

m y s e Jf b y the fact that if h e h ad h e w o ul d have been brain damaged.

                                                Criticisms of SYMAS

             A, ^ Criticisms of SYMAS appeared in quotations contained in an
                  article which appeared in The Times and The Independent of
                  17 April 1989* They also appeared In other newspapers. The
                  remarks were made by two doctors who attended Hillsborough
                  as Liverpool supporters on 15 April 1989. During the course
                  of the evidence it became clear that the first five
                  criticisms by Doctor A related to events in the area behind
                  the Leppings Lane stand and terrace (day 25 pl21D).

                          one or two St John’s ambulancemen. There was no medical

                                  ground by 1606 (SYMAS recording track 19 page 19).
                                  Therefore about 35 casualties, all of whom survived
                                  were conveyed by SYMAS vehicles between 1532 and
                                  1606.

                                            injured were hypoxic (lack of oxygen), the
                                            usual heart pattern is asystole (continuous
                                            line) and not ventricular fibrillation, (The,

                                            would normally produce a regular heart pattern

                                    goal area.   They were either all dead or okay

             B.       Ambulance Equipment

                      A list of equipment carried by all SYMAS frontline ambulances
                      is appended hereto.   This equipment is intended for use by
                      SYMAS personnel and not by third parties.        Much o£ the
                      equipment has to be kept with the ambulance for use on the
                      journey to hospital. The primary purpose of the ambulance is
                      to give immediate treatment to casualties and convey them to
                 ^    hospital. On 15 April 1989 many SYMAS ambulancemen rendered
                      Hi-it aid (CPR and resuscitation) as well as conveying 172
                      injured to hospital.   Any criticism of lack of equipment on
                      SYMAS vehicles is ill-informed.

E V I D E N C E F ROM TH E N A T I O N A L U N I O N O F P U B L I C E M P L O Y E E S TO THE
HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

The NATIONAL UNION OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES is the 5th largest Union
in Britain with 650,000 members.

Approximately 250,000 of those members work in the National
Health Service and are spread across all grades of staff.   The
Union is by far the largest Union in the ambulance service and
ambulance staff who attended the tragedy at Hillsborough are
members of the NATIONAL UNION OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES.

The Uni on’s evidence will be presented at the Inquiry by Mr Roger
Poole, the Uni o n ’s Health Service National Secretary (Designate)
who is also Trades Union Side Secretary of the NATIONAL AMBULANCE
COUNCIL and
Chair of the AMBULANCE OFFICERS JOINT NEGOTIATING COMMITTEE.

The Union is represented on all of the major Ambulance Committees
in this country including the NHS Training Authority’s Ambulance
Staff Training Committee.  The Union is critically involved in the
professional issues surrounding the ambulance service and is
acknowledged as the major organisation representing ambulance
staffs.

The Union does not intend to comment on any of the operational
decisions that were made on the day at Hillsborough as that is
something which will be dealt with by the South Yorkshire
Metropolitan Ambulance Service and which our members working in
that service will have an input into.

It is however the intention of the Union to give evidence on
matters of public policy which we feel arise out of the t r a g e d y
at Hillsborough and are issues on which the Union has held views
for a long period of time.

The role of the ambulance service

The ambulance service             is one of the country’s 3 emergency
services.  Its job is             to attend to victims at any accident or
emergency; to provide             immediate care for those victims and to
transport them to the             nearest hospital for further treatment.
      Ambulance crews are highly trained and accident and e m e r g e n c y
      crews are trained f o r the wide variety of conditions which face
    . them in the sort of work they d o . T h e i r training consists of 8
      weeks at a regional ambulance training school, followed by a'
      further 12 months working with a qualified, ambulanceman/woman
      during which time they again experience in all aspects of
      accident and emergency work. They undertake regular
      p o s t - p r o f i c i e n c y t r a i n i n g and many o f them now go on t o do what
       i s known a s e x t e n d e d t r a i n i n g i n d e f r i b i l l a t i o n , i n t u b a t i o n and

Dear Andrew,

RE:    JUDICIAL REVIEW OF HILLSBOROUGH INQUESTS

Please find enclosed the draft Affidavit concerning the above.                                                                                I have
completed the document as follows

1.     I have inserted the appropriate date in the first paragraph.

2.     I have made one amendment in paragraph 31, when I believe the word
       Payment should actually be Report.

3.     I have enclosed a copy of the letter sent to the BMJ dated
       29th January 1992.

I look forwarding to hearing from you in the near future.

Yours sincerely,




A. Page,
CHIEF EXECUTIVE

                         A F F I D A V I T



I, Albert Page of ______________ Rotherham, make oath and say as
follows:
1.   I am the Chief Executive of South Yorkshire Metropolitan
     Ambulance and Paramedic Service which was granted NHS Trust
     status on [ U* A ^ \ \^ 1 ]. Prior to that I had, since 1982,
     been the Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer for South
     Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service (which was then part
     of Trent Regional Health Authority).

2.   I swear this affidavit in opposition to the applications for
     Judicial Review of the inquests of six of the victims of the
     Hillsborough Disaster which took place on 15 April 1989.
     Except where otherwise appears, this affidavit is based on
     matters within my own knowledge, information and belief.


                                    1       F :\WP\CALLAGHA\STRING01.AFF\09.07.93\EC\V2
I am a Justice of the Peace, a Fellow of the Ambulance Service
Institute, and a member of the Association of Chief Ambulance
Officers.     Since   1986,    I have   been     an    instructor at             the
National Health Service Training establishment at Harrogate on
courses for senior ambulance officer development.                    I recently
acted as chairman of the inquiry into the failure of a newly
installed computer system at the London Ambulance Service.


I have read the memorial and supporting documents that are
exhibited to the affidavit of                          I am concerned that
there are matters which are raised in the memorial which are
misleading.    I restrict my comments to matters which I consider
to be relevant to the ambulance service; these comments largely
relate   to   the   claims    concerning    the       involvement         of     the
ambulance service, a lack of care and the cut-off point of 3.15
pm which are referred to in paragraph 5 of the memorial.


In paragraph 9 of the memorial, it is suggested that, in his
inquiry, Lord Justice Taylor recognised that a quicker response
to the emergency by the police to ensure the attendance of the
emergency services might have saved at least some lives, and
that these findings raised the further question of whether the
crush injuries had been aggravated by a lack of care.                                I
presume that the memorial is referring to paragraph 252 of Lord
Justice Taylor's Interim Report (which I refer to below).                        The
memorial does not seem to me to contain a fair reflection of
Lord Justice Taylor's findings which say that it is unlikely
(my emphasis) that lives would have been saved if the emergency
services had been called more promptly.


There is now produced and shown to me marked "API" a true copy
of Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report.               I wish to refer to
the following paragraphs of the interim report:


Paragraphs 87-90         which give details of the response of
                         the St John's Ambulance Brigade.



                                 2         F :\WP\CALLAGHA\STRING01. AFF\09.07.93\EC\V2
     Paragraphs 105-106       which       give    details      of    the    ambulance
                              service response,           and give statistics
                              relating         to the    number       of   ambulances
                              involved and the casualties,
     Paragraph 252            which states that it is unlikely that
                              the emergency services could have saved
                              lives       if   they     had    been     called     more
                              promptly, but it is possible,
     Paragraphs 296-301       which include the specific finding that
                              the         ambulance        service           responded
                              promptly,        that it brought             appropriate
                              equipment          and    that    their        personnel
                              operated efficiently.                 There is also a
                              specific finding that,                in view of the
                              nature and extent of the crushing, the
                              time the police rescue began and the
                              pathetically         short       period       for    which
                              those unable to breathe could survive,
                              it is improbable that quicker recourse
                              to    the emergency         services         would    have
                              saved more lives.


     In the light of the above (particularly paragraphs 252 and
     301), I think it is overstating the position to say that Lord
     Justice Taylor recognised that a quicker response might have
     saved some lives.


     The BMJ Article of 30 November 1991
7.   Paragraph 10 of the memorial refers to the BMJ article of 30
     November 1991.   I saw that article in early 1992 and I wrote
     to the editor of the BMJ in relation to factual inaccuracies.
     There is now produced and shown to me marked "AP2" a true copy
     of my letter to the editor of the British Medical Journal dated
     C                   ].


8.   The BMJ article shows that no one who suffered a cardiac arrest
     and was taken to hospital actually survived.               Of the 14 victims


                                      3
      who suffered a cardiac arrest and were taken to hospital, five
      were dead on arrival, resuscitation was attempted but failed
      on seven of them,     and two were resuscitated and taken to
      intensive care but then died.     The article does not, therefore,
      support the Applicant's contentions.


9.    The BMJ article also points out that most of the seriously
      injured arrived at the hospital within the first 30 minutes.
      I believe that this not only shows the rapid response of the
      ambulance service, but also indicates that the ambulance crews
      were selecting the more seriously injured victims and taking
      them to hospital first.


10.   Paragraph   10 of   the memorial    also refers   to   Lord   Justice
      Taylor's rejection of the evidence of two doctors, Dr Phillips
      and Dr Ashton and it is said that a jury might have reached a
      different view of their evidence.        I find it difficult to
      accept that a jury is likely to form a more reliable view of
      the evidence than a highly experienced judge who is now the
      Lord Chief Justice.
>

11.   Paragraph 11 of the memorial goes a step further than paragraph
      9 by stating that Lord Justice Taylor did make findings which
      suggested that the lives of some of the dead might have been
      saved if there had been a more timely response by the police
      to the crisis and if they called in the emergency services more
      quickly.    I cannot agree that Lord Justice Taylor made any such
      findings.


      D-E-Philllps
12.   Paragraph 12 of the memorial refers to the evidence of Dr Glyn
      Phillips.    There is now produced and shown to me marked "AP3"
      a true copy of the transcript of the evidence that Dr Phillips
      gave to the Taylor inquiry which Counsel will refer to in more
      detail at the hearing of the applications for Judicial Review.
      As far as the specific claims made in the memorial in relation
      to Dr Phillips' evidence are concerned:


                                    4
      12.1     Neither     his    statement       nor     the     transcript      of        his
               evidence demonstrate that lives could have been saved
               by what the memorial refers to as "proper emergency
               help".     In fact the opposite is the case and I would
               draw   attention      to    the     following       extracts      from        Dr
               Phillips' statement:-
               Page 9         "I could      not    find     anybody     seriously           ill
                            needing help.          Just dead or seemingly minor
                            injuries and shaken people."
               Page 11      "Remembering the fan we had resuscitated I
                            gave a policeman my name and address.                  I felt
                            it very unlikely that he would have survived
                            and reconciled myself by the fact that if he
                            had he would have been brain damaged."
      12.2     His statement makes no reference to his asking for a
               ventilator.        It does, however, refer to his asking for
               a defibrillator.         Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report
               (at    paragraph      298)        states     "I     am    satisfied           on
               overwhelming        evidence       that     to     attempt   to     use        a
               defibrillator on the pitch with people milling about
               would have been highly dangerous owing to the risk of
               injury from the electric charge".
      12.3     Dr Phillips claimed to have been given an empty oxygen
               cylinder.     This is dealt with in paragraphs 14 to 16 of
               Appendix    6 of     Lord       Justice    Taylor's      Interim    Report
               which concludes that Dr Phillips may have been mistaken
               as to the cylinder of which he complains being empty.
      12.4     In the circumstances it is simply not appropriate to
               suggest     that    Dr     Phillips'        evidence      points        to     a
               significant lack of equipment as a problem that "may
               have   contributed         to     the     deaths    of    some     of        the
               deceased".


13.   There is now produced and shown to me marked "AP4" an extract
      from the submissions made to Lord Justice Taylor on behalf of
      the ambulance service.         They respond to criticisms made by Dr
      Ashton   ("Dr A")     and Dr      Phillips         ("Dr P " ).     The     detailed


                                           5
       12.1    Neither     his     statement             nor     the    transcript       of        his
               evidence demonstrate that lives could have been saved
               by what the memorial refers to as                          "proper emergency
               help".      In fact the opposite is the case and I would
               draw   attention         to    the        following        extracts       from       Dr
               Phillips' statement:-
               Page 9         "I    could          not    find        anybody    seriously ill
                            needing help.                Just dead or seemingly minor
                            injuries and shaken people."
               Page 11      "Remembering the fan we had resuscitated I
                            gave a policeman my name and address.                         I felt
                            it very unlikely that he would have survived

               a defibrillator.         Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report
               (at    paragraph      298)           states        "I     am     satisfied           on
               overwhelming        evidence          that        to    attempt     to     use        a
               defibrillator on the pitch with people milling about
               would have been highly dangerous owing to the risk of
               injury from the electric charge".
      12.3     Dr Phillips claimed to have been given an empty oxygen
               cylinder.     This is dealt with in paragraphs 14 to 16 of
               Appendix    6 of     Lord          Justice       Taylor's       Interim    Report
               which concludes that Dr Phillips may have been mistaken
               as to the cylinder of which he complains being empty.
      12.4     In the circumstances it is simply not appropriate to
               suggest     that    Dr        Phillips'          evidence        points        to     a
               significant lack of equipment as a problem that "may
               have contributed              to     the     deaths        of    some     of        the
               deceased".


13.   There is now produced and shown to me marked "AP4" an extract
      from the submissions made to Lord Justice Taylor on behalf of
      the ambulance service.         They respond to criticisms made by Dr
      Ashton   ("Dr A")     and    Dr    Phillips              ("Dr    P" ).    The     detailed


                                              5
      patient who had          suffered a cardiac arrest but he did not
      survive.     Nothing in his evidence suggests that any more lives
      would have been saved if matters had been handled differently.
      His claims of lack of equipment are refuted by the Taylor
      Interim     Report,      and   his   comment    about     the    "Major Medical
      Disaster Team" are dealt? with on page 2 of exhibit "AP4".


18.   It is clear that, with the possible exception of one point, to
      which I refer in paragraph 24 below, Dr Phillips, Dr Ashton and
      Mr   Eccleston     are not      able     to give    evidence      that directly
      relates to the deaths of any of the six victims whose inquests
      are the subject of these proceedings.                 Whilst I do understand
      the feelings of the families of the six victims, I am concerned
      that what they are really seeking is another public inquiry by
      the back door.                                            s


19.   Paragraph 15(ii) of the memorial is blatantly untrue.                          The
      Applicants have not put forward any evidence to suggest that
      some of the injured could have been saved by a "more timely"
 ^    response.        Each of the allegations set out in this paragraph
      are refuted by the report of Lord Justice Taylor, and I have
      dealt     with    them    previously      in   this     Affidavit.        In   the
      circumstances I fail to see how                                has felt able to
      swear an affidavit stating that the contents of the memorial
      are true to the best of his knowledge and belief.


20.   In paragraphs 18 to 22, the memorial gives some detail of the
      evidence    relating      to    the deaths     of   the    six victims     whose
      inquests    are the subject of            the applications         for Judicial
      Review.     I shall comment on each in turn.


      Paul Carlisle
21.   The Applicants        have     produced    a   report     of    Dr West   of   the
      Department of Forensic Medicine of Guy's Hospital.                        In his
      report Dr West refers to two different                    types of traumatic
      asphyxia.    The first type is "classic" traumatic asphyxia.                   He
      doesn't give a label to the second type.


                                           7
22.   Dr West states that most of the individuals who suffer from the
      classic form of traumatic asphyxia do not survive if they are
       severely affected and not rescued rapidly.

23.   Dr West's report indicates that Paul Carlisle suffered from
      "classic" traumatic asphyxia.    Even if he was alive after
      3.15pm it seems highly unlikely that he could have survived.

24.   The evidence indicates that Paul Carlisle was taken to the
       Leppings Lane area, perhaps about 10 minutes or so before Dr
      Ashton arrived in that area.    It does, however, seem likely
      that Dr Ashton saw Paul Carlisle and decided that he was dead
      and that there was therefore no point in him being placed in
      an ambulance or taken to hospital.

      Ian Glover
25.   I can see nothing in the information contained in the memorial
      and its supporting documents that justifies the suggestion that
      Ian Glover might have survived had there been a "more timely"
      attempt at resuscitation.

    Michael Kelly
26. I can see nothing in the information contained in the memorial
     and its supporting documents that justifies the suggestion that
    Michael Kelly's death was preventable and that he died because
     of some shortcomings in the care he received after he was
     handed over to the St John's Ambulance Service.

     Kevin Williams
27. Dr West puts Kevin Williams in the category of "classic"
     traumatic asphyxia, and even if he was alive after 3.15pm, it
     seems highly unlikely that he could have survived.

     Richard Jones
28. Dr West indicates that Richard Jones suffered from "classic"
     traumatic asphyxia, and there is nothing to indicate that he
     was alive after 3.15pm. In the light of Dr West's expert view,


                                  8
       even if Richard Jones was alive after 3.15pm, it seems highly
       unlikely that he could have survived.

       Peter Tootle
29.   The memorial does not suggest that there is any evidence that
      Mr Tootle was alive after 3.15pm. Furthermore, Dr West accepts
      that the evidence given to the inquest was consistent with a
      degree of "classic" traumatic asphyxia.

30.   At paragraph 23(ii) of the memorial it is suggested that there
      was evidence that tended to suggest that lives could have been
      saved by more prompt medical attention. That is not the case.
      More particularly, there is no evidence to suggest that any of
      these six lives could have been saved by more prompt medical
      attention.


31*   It seems to me that the expectations of the memorialists are
      unrealistic. I can understand that each would want the best
                                                            /
      care for members of their families. The Taylor Interim Payment
      states that the ambulance service responded quickly~'~and
      efficiently and I think it appropriate that I quote from
      paragraphs 297 and 298 of that report:
        297. I find that all three of the emergency services named
             above responded promptly when alerted, that they
             brought appropriate equipment and that their personnel
             operated efficiently.
        298. It would be unreasonable to expect, at any sports
             stadium, medical facilities capable of dealing with a
             major disaster such as occurred. To have in advance at
             the ground, oxygen, resuscitators, stretchers, other
             equipment and medical staff sufficient to deal with
             over 100 casualties is not practicable. "

32.   The memorial refers to examples of "successful resuscitation"
      but the memorial puts forward no evidence that anyone who
      suffered a cardiac arrest subsequently survived.      On the
      contrary, the BMJ article states that no one who arrived at


                                 9
      hospital,   having     suffered     a   cardiac       arrest,         ultimately
      survived.


33.   Paragraph 23 (ii) claims that the evidence was very strong that
      there had been shortcomings in the response of the emergency
      services.   That is not true.           It seems to me to be grossly
      irresponsible to make slich a claim and I cannot understand how
      Mr Hawthorn can say on oath that such a claim is true to the
      best of his knowledge and belief.


34.   In the   light   of   the   available    information,          the     Coroner's
      decision to adopt a cut off point of 3.15 pm does not seem to
      me to be unreasonable.


35.   As far as the complaints about the Coroner's failure to advise
      the jury of the availability of a verdict involving a "lack of
      care" are   concerned,      these   matters    will      be     deal     with      by
      Counsel.

            Dear Don

            Judicial Review of Hillsborough Inquests

            I now enclose the draft Affidavit.

            I should be grateful if you could read it carefully and make any
            alterations (whether to content or style) that you think are                                                                     *
            appropriate. In particular I should be grateful if you could deal
            with the following points

            1.      Please insert the appropriate date                                in       the first paragraph.

            2.   Paragraph 3 is based largely upon the statement that was
                  prepared for the Hillsborough Inquiry. It may need amendment.

            3.   Could you let me have a copy of the letter referred to in
                  paragraph 7. I sent a draft response to you on 22 January
                  1992, and I imagine that you wrote to the editor of the BMJ
                  shortly afterwards.

            I am also sending a copy of the draft to Michel Kallipetis.

            I look forward to hearing from you.

            Best wishes,

            Yours sincerely

                          SA FE T Y A N D C O N TR O L AT S P O R T S G R O U N D S

                                                  Introduction

Sirs,
   1. On 13 M ay 1985 I was appointed to undertake an Inquiry with the follow ing terms o f reference:
        “To inquire, with particular reference to the events at Bradford City and Birmingham football grounds
        on 11 M ay, into the operation o f the Safety o f Sports Grounds A ct 1975; and to recommend what if
        any further steps should be taken, including any that may be necessary under additional powers, to
        improve both crowd safety and crowd control at sports grounds.”

  2. The. Assessors appointed to assist me were M r A lan G oodson OBE, Q PM , Chief Constable o f
Leicestershire and Mr Martin Killoran Q FSM , formerly C hief Fire Officer o f Greater Manchester. They
have been o f the greatest assistance. Their professional expertise and advice has been invaluable to my
Inquiry. W ithout their help m y task could scarcely have been com pleted with such expedition.

   3. Neil M organ was Secretary to the Committee. He has contributed enorm ously to the sm ooth running
o f the Inquiry by his constant good humour and efficiency. Mark de Pulford and Jill Hales have both
shown the twin virtues o f the Civil Service, intelligence and hard work, and they have been ably assisted
by Jane Osborn. N athalie Austrie has been our efficient personal secretary.

   4. A t an early stage o f my Inquiry I decided to prepare an interim report giving the results o f my
investigations into the events at Bradford and Birmingham, together with som e preliminary recommenda­
tions on safety matters and crowd control. This was done so that safety levels could be improved quickly,
before the start o f the new football season in the middle o f A ugust 1985. In a list o f provisional
recommendations I also gave a tentative view on a number o f longer-term issues which I proposed to
follow up in this my Final Report. M y Interim Report was submitted to the tw o Secretaries o f State and
subsequently presented to Parliament on 24 July 1985 (Cmnd 9585). I am grateful for the Government s
quick and positive response to my Recommendations and to local authorities and sports management for
their subsequent action to improve safety.

  5. Since my Interim Report was published I have considered the written evidence submitted by a wide
range o f organisations and individuals on the remaining aspects o f my Inquiry. I have also heard oral
evidence from m any o f them. A full list o f those w ho submitted evidence to the Inquiry is given in Appendix
A to this Report. I am grateful to all o f them.

  6. During the course o f the Inquiry the two Assessors and I have, between us, visited 3 1 soccer grounds
in England, Wales and Scotland. They are listed in Appendix B. We have also visited sports grounds
devoted to Rugby U nion, Rugby League, cricket, horse racing, greyhound racing, athletics, tennis, m otor
racing, stock car racing and speedway. In addition, we have visited indoor stadia.

 7. In this, my final report, I deal with five main subjects. The first, in Chapter 1, is the disaster at the
Heysel Stadium in Brussels on 29 M ay 1985. It was agreed that I should take account o f any lessons arising
from this tragic event, although the official investigation was, o f course, a matter for the Belgian authorities.
I visited Brussels, together with my Assessors, and met the chairman o f the Belgian Parliamentary
Commission which investigated the disaster and Madame Coppieters’t W allant, the investigating judge,
together with representatives o f the police, gendarmerie and fire service. A ll were extremely helpful, and I
am grateful to them, and also to the British Ambassador and his staff in Brussels for their assistance and
advice.

     8. In Chapter 2 I review previous inquiries over the last sixty years into crowd safety and hooliganism
at sports grounds and conclude that there is still need for action:
                                                                                    /< “ " 75- • " « the need for further

    That opim on holds good, but as the last editton o f               r niH         8 for aA sP ° ^ Sround management

                                              Tragedy at Brussels

   1.1 A t about 7.30 pm on 29 M ay 1985, English fans charged into Block Z o f the terrace at the Heysel
Stadium, Brussels, shortly before the European Cup Final between Liverpool and Juventus was due to
take place. There was a panic am ong the spectators in Block Z; as a result 38 people died and some 400
people were injured.

  1.2 It was agreed that I should take into account any lessons arising from the events at Brussels. In
doing this I d o not intend to apportion blame. Neither d o I propose to make any comments which might
prejudice any possible criminal proceedings.

   1.3 The official investigation into these events has already been carried out by a Com m ission o f Enquiry
set up by the Belgian Parliament, which reported on 9 July 1985. A t the present time M adam e Coppieters’t
Wallant is carrying out an inquiry into the circumstances. She will be producing a confidential report,
which will be used purely to consider the prosecution o f those alleged to have com m itted criminal offences.

   1.4 The death and injury o f so many people must be the main subject o f m y investigation. However, it
is clear from all the evidence available to me that the behaviour o f the crowds, both inside and outside the
ground, and before the match, as well as during it, needs also to be considered. So d o the precautions
which the various authorities sought to take to prevent outbreaks o f violence.

   1.5 I have had the opportunity, together with my Assessors, o f visiting the H eysel Stadium and discussing
the matter with the Belgian and British authorities and with Liverpool Football Club. I have been provided
with a very large number o f statements by those w ho were present, together with reports from Belgium
and a variety o f official documents. I have also talked to M adam e Coppieters’t W allant. It will be obvious
that in the absence o f a thorough and prolonged public enquiry the evidence available to me is somewhat
limited. It is bound to be fragmentary, and while it gives generally the broad picture it will not necessarily
coincide with the individual observations o f everyone w ho was present. Indeed there are acutely differing
views about som e matters. The lessons to be drawn are, however, reasonably clear.

The Heysel Stadium
  1.6 It was opened in 1930. It has been regularly used for football m atches, including an international
football match a few weeks before the 29 M ay, between Belgium and France, at which the attendance was
about the same as at the Liverpool/Juventus game.

  1.7 The Stadium is owned by the City o f Brussels and leased to the Belgian F ootball Association. There
had been no criticism by the Belgian Football Association nor by U E F A , w h o are the body controlling
European football, o f the facilities at the ground or o f the structure.

   1.8 A plan o f the Stadium is at Appendix C. There are two open terraces at each end o f the ground
marked “ X ”, “Y ” and “ Z ” and “ O ”, “N ” and “ M ” respectively. Between the two sets o f terraces are two
stands. The stand marked Tribune 2 was built in ahout 1980. Apart from that, the Stadium is as it was
constructed in 1930. It is the largest o f its kind in Belgium and provides facilities not only for football
matches but for athletics. •

   1.9 T he terraces at “ X ” , “Y ” and “Z ” were formed o f a slope o f approximately 1 in 10 at the shallowest
and about 1 in 6 at the steepest. The surface o f the terraces was earth with only the nosing o f the steps
being formed in concrete. Over the years the concrete nosing has deteriorated, and rusted re-inforcing bars
have been exposed. The edges were uneven and jagged where pieces o f concrete had broken off. The general
condition o f the terracing may be described as poor. The crush barriers showed signs o f deterioration to
both the concrete uprights and the re-inforcement. On the day o f the match the perimeter fence consisted
basically o f two barriers. One was a brick structure; the other, on the terrace side, was wire fencing about
two metres high.

   1.10 There was a barrier dividing Block “Y ” from Block “ Z ” . It consisted o f two lines o f tubular steel
hand rail fixed by metal straps to the top o f the existing concrete crush barrier uprights. It thus formed a
passageway from top to bottom o f the terrace. T o one o f the,continuous hand rails were fixed fairly
lightweight steel posts approximately 2.5-3 metres high. Tied to the steel posts was plastic coated wire
  mesh fencing. This com posite construction, whilst forming a physical barrier, was not o f sufficient strength

  fan^from BlTClc^^”^nt^B lock0‘‘Z ”aC^ ^ * WaS rem° Ved by PhySi° a! f0rCe dUring thC ChargC by EngUsh

     1.11 T he flank wall where the disaster occurred was about three metres high at its maximum, reducing
   o just under two metres adjacent to the terrace. The brickwork wall did not appear to have been bedded
  in mortar nor fixed in any other way to the concrete wall. The buttresses o f the wall were such that they
  would not assist in restraining the wall from movement when subjected to crowd pressure. It was not
  constructed as a crush barrier. N o t surprisingly, it was not adequate to act as such. The wall and perimeter
   ence in front o f the terrace were o f fairly light construction which readily collapsed under the forward
  pressure o f the crowd.

    1.12 There were three places o f entry and exit at the back o f Blocks “X ” , “ Y '’ and “Z ” and three single
 access doors from the terraces onto the pitch. There were no turnstile controlled access points, but som e
 control was exercised by gatemen. It was thus impossible to know the numbers going into each block or
 to prevent overcrowding in one block. In addition there were gaps in the boundary walls through which
 entry was effected by a number o f spectators into Blocks “X ” and “Y ”

     1.13 Having regard to the state o f the crush barriers and fences, and the general condition o f the terraces
 it seems unlikely, had it been located in this country, that a certificate w ould have been issued under the
 batety 9 f Sports Grounds A ct 1975 for this part o f the ground. However, the poor state o f the terraces
 played no part in the tragedy.

 The Arrangements for the Game

    1     14 By 24 April 1985 the finalists were known. A meeting was held by the Belgian F ootball Association
 at its own Headquarters. There were present M. Roosens, the Secretary o f the Belgian Football Association,
 a number o f police officers, a member o f the gendarmerie and representatives o f Liverpool Football Club.'

    1.15   In Belgium the policing is carried out by both the local police force and by the gendarmerie, w ho
 are a national body organised on military lines. The Brussels police were to be responsible for the area
 including Blocks ‘O ” , “N ” and “ M ” , and the gendarmerie for Blocks “ X ” , “Y ” and “Z ” .

 _ ! ’! 6, ^ was ag,r?^ci that the distribution and the positioning o f spectators should be organised so that
 English fans would be positioned in Blocks “X ” and “ Y ” o f the terraces, in “ U ” , “V ” and “W ” fin Tribune
         rinu"A ” ’ * F ” B” and < D (in tr ib u n e 1). Juventus were to be accom m odated in Blocks “O ” and
  N o f the terraces, in “Q ” , “ P” and “W ” (in Tribune 2) and in “G ” , “ L” , “ I” and “ K ” (in Tribune 1).
 It was agreed that each side would be issued with som e 14,500 tickets o f which 11,000 were for the terraces.

   1.17 It was arranged by the Belgian Football Association that Block “ Z ” and Block “ M ” would be
allocated to neutral spectators, and Liverpool Football Club officials were told that a maximum o f five
tickets per person w ould be sold to spectators. There was agreement that there should be a barrier put up
between Block Y and Block “ Z” , and another barrier between Block “ N ” and Block “ M ” . The Belgian
Football Association had agreed with the authorities that there should be at least one gendarme on each
ot the steps o f the segregation gangway between Block “ Z” and the English fans in Block “Y ” These and
other matters were discussed, including the times o f opening the ground and how English fans should
arrive. There were further meetings during M ay in Belgium and England. O ne matter which was agreed
was that there should be a ban on the sale o f alcohol around the ground.

   1.18 Thus it was hoped that the English fans and Juventus supporters w ould be properly segregated and
that they w ould be physically prevented from being able to get at or to throw missiles at each other. They
would be contained within their ow n areas. However, the officer-in-charge o f the gendarmerie at the ground
did not fully understand what his instructions were, nor unfortunately had he attended any o f the meetings
preceding the game. In the result, for a number o f different reasons, the gendarmerie presence between
Blocks “ Y ” and “Z ” was insufficient.    «

   1.19 The advance intelligence was, broadly, that the English fans would present little or no trouble. This
  ad a marked effect on the precautions which were taken. Liverpool have a go o d record, so far as European
competitions, in which they have played for som e 22 years, are concerned. Their m anagem ent has long
experience and they sought to take the normal precautions to prevent the unauthorised acquisition o f
tickets, to co-ordinate travel arrangements and to liaise with the Belgian authorities.


                                                       4
   1.20 So far as the sponsored travel arrangements were concerned, supporters were accompanied by
officers o f the British Transport Police. That generally seems to have gone off without difficulty. However,
one group o f unsponsored supporters were refused passage by a Belgian vessel and there was a further
group o f 400 unsponsored coach travellers w ho had apparently had a great deal too much to drink.

The Sale o f Tickets for Block “ Z ”
   1.21 There were various alarms about the sale o f black market tickets and forged tickets. One o f the
matters o f concern for the Liverpool Club was the sale o f tickets for Block “Z ” . By the U E F A instructions,
no blocks o f tickets were to be sold at the venue o f the match except in small quotas. W hat happened to
the sale o f som e o f the tickets for Block “ Z ” was described by M. R oosens. H e said that there were some
3,000 tickets available for sale on the first day and they were put in the hands o f a M . D esm ent who had
been selling tickets for the last twenty years. The sale took place at the Heysel Stadium, and a notice was
put up saying that they were available for 300 Belgian francs each and that the maximum which couid be
purchased was five per person. When the staff arrived there was already a massive queue before sales had
started. M . Desment later walked through the crowds and noticed that there were more tickets being sold
to foreigners than to Belgians. He enquired from M . Roosens whether the sale should be stopped. The sale
was in fact stopped. By then they had sold 2,000 to 3,000 tickets.

   1.22 Because tickets were being sold from five different windows it was impossible to control who bought
them. It was quite clear from all the evidence that som e organisations had been buying large quantities o f
tickets. They did this by using a large number o f their employees to take it in turns to go to the ticket
windows. M . Roosens agreed in evidence that people had left the Stadium with whole rolls o f tickets.
Additionally, M. Roosens allowed 1,000 tickets to be sold to a director o f a sports club committee w ho
apparently sold them to an insurance com pany which sponsored the club. One witness spoke o f a travel
agent from Sicily with 60 tickets for Block “Z ” which he was selling outside the ground at 100 times the
official price.

  1.23 It is quite clear that whether the tickets found their way onto the black market or not, a large
number o f tickets for Block “Z ” came into the hands o f Juventus supporters. The effect was, therefore,
that all the careful preparations for the segregation o f the English and Italian fans were rendered useless.

The events o f 29 M ay
   1.24 It is not surprising that there is a great deal o f conflicting evidence about the events o f this day even
from experienced witnesses such as police officers. Contradictions about the behaviour o f the English fans
before the game abound. I set out here as best I can som e o f the evidence presented to me.

   1.25 Elaborate arrangements were made within the Belgian authorities for meeting and escorting the
English supporters after their arrival in Belgium and on the train. Unfortunately, because o f the timetable
which the shipping companies operated, large numbers o f English fans arrived in Brussels well before kick-
ofT.

   1.26 The behaviour o f the English fans in the centre o f Brussels gave a foretaste o f what was to happen
later in the day. It is only necessary to refer to one or two incidents so as to give an idea o f how some,
albeit a small minority o f the English supporters, were behaving. It is said that about 2,000 supporters had
taken over the Grand’ Place and the surrounding area. They were throwing beer bottles at the Belgian
Police, they were spitting, they were hurling beer at cars. One witness described the Grand’ Place as looking
like a broken glass factory. One supporter, w ho had drunk too much and was wearing a toy British police
helmet, stood at a nearby cross-roads directing traffic, thereby causing severe dislocation o f traffic. A
jeweller’s shop was robbed by English fans. Other fans were bathing in the fountains. A witness described
a grocer’s shop being pillaged. The steps o f the Stock Exchange were invaded. A number o f English fans
arrived at Jette from the train. They already had drink with them, although a good deal o f it was
confiscated. They tried to get into the buses provided for them without paying. In this they were unsuccessful
because the bus driver simply refused to drive them. A very experienced senior British police officer
described the conduct o f the English fans as the worst he had ever seen.

    1.27 Other witnesses, however, gave a totally different picture. Som e supporters have written to say that
while there was some noise, the general behaviour was good, the atmosphere friendly and relaxed, and that
far from the police standing by while something akin to a riot was taking place, the police were heavy
handed, interfering with people w ho were merely singing and enjoying themselves and treating both sets
o f supporters to an excessive display o f authority.

to keep the spectators occupied; this occurred somewhere between 6.15 pm and 6.30 pm. The English fans
fired flares and rockets and threw stones into Block “ Z ”, which was beginning to be occupied by what
were clearly Italian supporters. There was also a number o f English fans in Block “ Z ” w ho sought to
escape into Block “ Y ” . According to Captain M ahieu, w ho was in charge o f the gendarmerie responsible
for patrolling the area between Block “Y ” and Block “ Z ” , everything was calm between 6.15 pm and 7
pm. Accordingly he had gone out o f the Stadium; so too had Lieutenant Bonnet w ho was his second-in-
com m and, to investigate a criminal complaint and to see about closing Block “X ” . It appears there were
about 15,000 spectators in Blocks “X ” and “ Y ” and about 5,000 in Block “ Z ” .

   1.36 There is no doubt but that somewhere between 7.15 pm and 7.30 pm English fans charged Block
“ Z” . Preceding this there had been an exchange o f missiles between Blocks “ Z” and “Y ” . There were three
charges by English fans. The first two seemed to have been repulsed; the third resulted in the Italian
supporters in Block “ Z” , w ho were seeking to escape towards the perimeter, being squashed and suffocated
by the press o f large numbers.

Extreme Political Parties
              *
   1.37 There was evidence about the presence o f supporters from the extreme right. The M ayor gave
evidence at the Inquiry that he had seen British and Italian spectators wearing the political insignia o f
parties o f the extreme right and carrying flags. One British supporter, him self a referee, said that the ground
outside the Stadium was littered with British National Front leaflets, som e overprinted by the British
National Party with their address. One witness spoke o f passengers on the boat crossing the Channel with
N ational Front insignia singing songs o f hatred and exhibiting violence.

    1.38 Mr John Smith, Chairman o f Liverpool Football Club, spoke o f how six members o f Chelsea
N ational Front had boasted to him o f their part in provoking the violence and said that they seemed proud
o f their handiwork. Mr Bob Paisley, a former manager o f Liverpool Football Club, said that he was forced
to leave the Directors’ Box at the start o f the game as dozens o f fans poured over the dividing wall and
that the person next to him claimed that he was a Chelsea supporter and was wearing a National Front
badge. A number o f banners decorated with swastikas were recovered after the match, including one
marked “ Liverpool Edgehill” . There was also evidence that the flag o f a right wing organisation, “N ew
Order” , was being flown by a small group o f Juventus fans. A banner with “ England for the English” and
“ Europe for the English” was observed and a contingent o f the National Front were clearly seen in Blocks
“ X ” and “Y ” . One party leaving Brussels main station was observed to be Londoners wearing Liverpool
colours, carrying U nion Flags and having N ational Front and swastika tattoos.

  1.39 Apart from their presence, there is very little hard evidence that they caused any o f the violence.
Commissioner Meura said that he had not-seen anyone from any extreme right wing organisation wearing
any insigna. On 5 July a press statement was issued by the Merseyside Police which said:
      “There is no evidence to suggest that any National Front members were involved in the riot at the Heysel
      Stadium in Brussels."

What lessons are to be learned?
1.40 A Parliamentary Com m ission o f Enquiry was set up in Belgium on 12 June 1985. It reported on 9
July 1985. ‘

   1.41 The Com m ission concluded in this way:
      “ It should be emphasised from the outset that it was the British supporters who mounted the disastrous
      charge into Section “ Z ” . They bear the main responsibility for the terrible events that followed and this
      must remain the case for whatever blame might be attributed to others as having aggravated the matter.

  A n extract from their conclusions appears in Appendix D .

  1.42 When I spoke with M . Collignon, the Chairman o f the Parliamentary Commission o f Enquiry in
Brussels in Novem ber, he told me that the only matter in his report that on reflection he might like to alter
was to make rather more criticism o f the Belgian and European football authorities and less o f the individual
members o f the gendarmerie.

  1.43 In his principal statement to Parliament about the Hejfsel disaster, the Belgian Minister o f the
Interior said:
     “ Everyone knows that those guilty o f the violence, those responsible for the deaths o f the victims, are
     the violent groups among the English supporters.”

  H e also referred to the
     “ collective responsibility o f English society which tolerates this violence and tries to channel it without
     wanting to eliminate it.”

   H e said that the organisers o f the match were the second group o f people responsible. With regard to
the role o f the police and gendarmerie, he said that the overall plan had been adequate. He acknowledged
that there had been errors in execution and announced measures to improve training and equipment to
remedy these deficiencies. H e added that if in future a larger police deploym ent was necessary, he would
prefer to ban matches. H e did not want to turn Brussels, even for a day, into a police state, for the sake
o f those who liked to manifest their violence.

  1.44 The lessons to be learned from the disaster can be summarised in this way:
 (a) It is essential that opposing fans at matches such as this should be properly segregated so that there
     is no possibility o f their being within attacking distance o f each other. M issiles from rival supporters
     caused enormous problems and contributed in no small w ay to the disorder which occurred. So f ^ f c
     as domestic football is concerned, that means ensuring either that there is an unoccupied s p a c ^
     between opposing factions or that the physical m ethod o f securing segregation is such that they are
     unable to attack or bombard each other with missiles.
 (b) Sales o f tickets need to be properly controlled so that segregation can be effectively enforced. One o f
     the problems o f all-ticket matches is that ticket touts m ay be able to purchase numbers o f tickets and
     sell them indiscriminately; the effect o f this is to put the whole segregation policy at risk. Police need
     to be aware if this occurs. In Scotland any person w ho in a public place touts for the purpose o f
     selling so as to give another person cause for annoyance com m its a criminal offence under the Civic
     Governm ent (Scotland) Act 1982.
 (c) It is clear that a large number o f spectators, particularly the English, had consum ed substantially too
     much drink, and that they were able to take drink into the ground. This is now covered by the
     provisions o f the Sporting Events (Control o f A lcohol etc) A ct 1985 in England and W ales and by
     the Criminal Justice (Scotland) A ct 1980.

 (d) In addition to the fact that a number o f fans were able to get into the ground without paying, most
     o f them were also able to get in without being effectively searched; i f they were searched, they were
     able to recover weapons which they subsequently used. This is particularly relevant to the pow er o f
     the police to search at sports grounds in the U nited Kingdom .
 (e) While the structure o f the police in Belgium is different from that in Britain there was o b v i o u s ly j ^
     breakdown in com m unications and instructions both prior to and during the course o f the match, u
     was accepted by the Commandant o f the gendarmerie that mistakes had been made. The important
     lesson for us to learn is that there needs to be strict co-operation between the football club and the
     police; that the police need to lay dow n and observe fixed procedures and that the communications
     need to be efficient. There was also criticism at the lack o f liaison between the Headquarters outside
     the ground and those inside the ground. There needs to be goo d early planning with close co-operation
     between all the relevant authorities and clear decisions made. Those w ho are to be in charge on the
     day n“ed to have taken part in the planning and to clearly understand their role.

 ( 0 A nother lesson which can       be learnt is that in order to enforce segregation, apart from physical
     barriers, it is necessary to    have present a sufficient number o f properly instructed police to take
     effective action at the first    sign o f trouble. I f there are perimeter fences, they should contain an
     adequate number o f doors       in them; they need to be manned and to be opened immediately in the
     event o f an emergency.
 (g) It is clear that, notwithstanding the previous g o o d record o f any particular club, those w ho go to see
     that club play can readily behave like hooligans, particularly when affected by drink. Unfortunately
     a previous good record is no guarantee o f good behaviour in the future.
 (h) The final and m ost important lesson, which I cannot too strongly or too frequently emphasise is that
     if hooligans did not behave like hooligans at football m atches there would be no such risk o f death
     or injury.

                                         EUROPEAN CONVENTION

  1.45 In August 1985 “The European Convention on Spectator Violence and M isbehaviour at Sports
Events and in Particular at Football Matches” was agreed. It has at the m om ent been signed by ten o f the
parties. It has been ratified by four.
  1.46 The key points are that the Contracting Parties shall:
       1. co-ordinate the policies and actions o f Government Departments and other public agencies against
       spectator violence and misbehaviour (Article 2);
  •    2. secure that adequate public order resources are employed to counter outbreaks o f violence and
       misbehaviour near and inside grounds and along transit routes used by spectators; and facilitate co­
       operation and exchange o f information between police forces o f different localities (Article 3.1);
       3. seek to ensure that offenders (especially visiting supporters) are identified, prosecuted and that they
       receive appropriate penalties (Articles 5 and 3.1(c));
       4. encourage the co-ordination o f travel arrangements to inhibit potential troublemakers from leaving to
       attend matches (Article 3.3);
       5. introduce procedures to identify problem matches in advance and for effective co-operation between
       authorities and clubs on precautions and measures to be taken (Article 4);
       6. encourage the use o f stewards in supporters’ clubs for crowd control and information (Article 3.2);
       7. press football and local authorities and stadium owners and clubs to* take the necessary practical
       measures for problem matches, eg in the design, improvement and selection o f stadia, segregation, alcohol
       control, ticket sales, the exclusion o f drunks and troublemakers etc (Article 3.4);
       8. encourage football authorities to review their regulations continuously (Article 6.3);
       9. looking further ahead, take social and educational measures to promote the more positive side o f
       sport, eg fair play and active participation (Article 3.5); and
        10. establish a standing committee to police the operation o f the Convention and to propose improvements
      --(Article 8).          -

  1.47 This is a blueprint for European football, which has lessons for our dom estic game.
                                                 CHAPTER 2

                                         History o f previous Inquiries

  2.1 When my Interim Report was published, it might have been thought by som e that the suggestions
which I set out had only recently been considered. It was said to be unfair to expect the football clubs to
have taken earlier steps to arrange their affairs. It was urged that they should now be entitled to more time
and more m oney in order to deal with the problems o f crowd control and safety at their grounds. The
problem o f crowd control and safety had, so it was said, suddenly arisen. I have to say that alm ost all the
matters into which I have been asked to inquire and alm ost all the solutions I have proposed, have been
previously considered in detail by many distinguished Inquiries over a period o f sixty years.

The Shortt Report
  2.2 On 11 June 1923, the then Secretary o f State for the H om e Department asked the Rt H on Edward
Shortt KC to form a Committee to inquire, am ongst other things, into arrangements made to deal with
the abnormally large attendances on special occasions, especially attendances at athletic grounds. This
arose from disorder which occurred at Wembley Stadium on the occasion o f the firstCup Final bn 28
Apfril 1923. The Com m ittee reported on 13 M arch 1924. The Report was presented to Parliament and
published as C om m and Paper 2038 at the princely sum o f 6d.

  2.3 About responsibility for control inside grounds the Report had this to say:
     “ As regards the general question o f the apportionment o f responsibility inside the ground as between the
     police and the ground authority, the principle to be followed should, in our judgment, be that the police
     should be responsible for all matters appertaining to the preservation o f law and order and that for
     arrangements for the convenience o f the public the ground authority should be responsible. It is, however,
     most important not only that the police arrangements should be under the control o f a single officer, but
     also that the duties for which the ground authority is responsible should be assigned to a definite
     individual, who should be competent to give instructions and to deal with any incident which arises. If
     responsibility is definitely allocated in this manner it appears to us that, in ordinary circumstances, there
     need be no difficult}' in this division o f duties and that no disadvantage need result from the existence of
     dual control so long as the closest co-operation is maintained between the two authorities at all times.
     We are o f the opinion, however, that if any emergency arises or there appears to be the slightest
     probability o f a disturbance, it is essential that control should pass into the hands o f one individual, and
     we recommend that, in the case o f grounds providing accommodation for more than 10,000 persons, on
     all occasions when specially large attendances are anticipated or for other reasons unusual excitement
     is to be expectcd, arrangements should be concerted beforehand by which one individual can at any
     moment take control o f the situation.”

  2.4 That paragraph o f the report continued:
     “The question in such circumstances would have become one o f the preservation o f law and order and
     we therefore have no doubt that the control should then pass into the hands o f the senior police officer
     present, and we consider that such officer would be justified in any circumstances, whether in accordance
     with a pre-arranged scheme or not, in assuming control If he considered it necessary for the purpose o f
     the restoration o f order. As part o f the arrangements for this purpose we think that, in the very large
     grounds, there should be a central control box in telephonic communication with all parts o f the ground
     and that the principal police and ground officials should be stationed there so that they may be in constant
     touch with the situation.” . . . (Paragraph 22).

  2.5 A bout stewards the Report said:
     “We understand that there is no uniform practice with regard to the employment o f stewards at sports
     grounds, that in some cases they are only used to show spectators into the seating accommodation, and
     that, in cases where stewards are employed for packing o f the standing room, they are only employed
     when there are specially large crowds. We consider it desirable in the interests o f safety that, for the
     purpose o f handling a crowd, stewards should be employed in any case where the crowd is likely to
     approach the capacity o f the ground. For seating accommodation stewards should always be employed.
     It is in the highest degree important that any such stewards should be properly trained in their work and
     intimately acquainted with the part of the ground placed under their charge. We doubt whether it is
     practicable to secure suitable men for this purpose unless they are given continual experience in the


                                                       10
           work, and we therefore recommend that every ground with a capacity exceeding 10,000 which P r i d e s
           terraced accommodation for its spectators should maintain, or have a call upon, an adequate staff of
           efficient stewards, and should ensure that they keep proficient by requiring them to p e r fo r m duty at
           frequent intervals. Stewards should be organised as a disciplined body and should actunder thecontrol
           and supervision o f their own officers. They should wear a distinctive badge o f authority, which the)
           should not be able easily to discard.” (Paragraph 27).

     2.6    The. Report had this to say about precautions against fire:
           “We have been somewhat surprised to find that in many cases little or no precaution is taken against
           the risk o f fire in stands. W e do not suppose that either the risk or the co n seq u e n c e so ffir e w o u ld b e so
           serious in an open stand as in a closed building, but we consider it most important that adequate
           arrangements should be made to deal with any outbreak which might occur. (Paragraph 40),

           but concluded generally:
           “W e are assured that these governing bodies are only too anxious to secure tha* ‘heir sport is carried
           on under conditions which will promote the public safety, and we feel that at this stage it is safe to leave
           the matter to them.” (Paragraph 47).

    The Moelwyii Hughes Report
      2     7 The next report (published as Cmnd 6846) arose out o f the disaster at Bolton Wanderers’ F °otbalI
    Ground on 9 March 1946. Mr R M oelw yn Hughes KC was appointed by the then H om e Secretary to
    conduct an enquiry into the circumstances o f the disaster which arose by the presence o f som e 85,000
    spectators. 50,000 had been expected. Because o f the press o f people in an enclosure tw o barners collapsed
    and 33 people were killed.

      2     8 It is interesting to observe that the previous best attendance at Bolton in the 1945-46 season had
    been 43,000 and it was amply policed by a force o f 60. On this occasion t h e r e w e r e 103 police to comro'
    85.000 spectators, which is about l/1 0th o f the present ratio o f police to spectator* at foo.ball grounds,
    both, inside and.outside the ground.

      2.9     Mr Hughes made a number o f recommendations. He said:
            “ Burnden Park is typical o f most home grounds o f the leading football teams in the country. They have
            grown stage by stage from humble beginnings on sites acquired when the large gates o f these days were
            S Z S J , or Jhen ,he clubs had not achieved eminence. It would be idle ,o suggest .hat lb..groun,b
            or large sections o f them, should be rebuilt, but if they are to be made reasonably safe and if toe nsk of
            repeating the tragedy o f Burnden Park is to be avoided, then, I have formed the clear view that the
            following steps must be taken . . .” (Page 10).

^     2.10 The recommendations included inspections o f the enclosures scientific c a k ^ a tio n o f the m axm u m
    number to be allowed entry, counting those entering the ground by mechanical means and central co
    ordination o f the system, all to ensure the admission o f a safe number of spectators.

       2.11 So far as future regulation was concerned the Report said:
             “The preceding safety measures cannot be secured without legislation. A D e p a r t m e n t a l Committee
             reporting on C row ds" , a previous Home Secretary in 1924 (Cd
             adequate provision for safety be left to the pressure o f the governing bodies in sport. The most
             important o f these was, o f course, the Football Association, which had not deigned to appear before .
             Committee . . .
             The legislation should empower the Home Secretary to issue general regulations for different kinds of
             grounds and the broad conditions necessary for safety.
             No ground o f any considerable size should be opened to the public until it has been licenced b > ,I s u gSest
             as an appropriate licensing authority, the local authority . The issue o f the licence would depend upon
             satisfying the authority as to the construction and equipment o f the ground, its compliance with regulations
             and the proposed maximum figures o f admission to the different parts.

       2.12 Mr Hughes went on to say:


                                                                     11
       “ Compliance with the recommendations of this Report will cost money. They will involve grounds in a
       loss o f gate money on popular days . . . The insurance for greater safety for the public demands a
       premium.”

Mr Hughes ended his report by saying:
      “I earnestly hope that, if the proposals I have made in this Report, or similar suggestions, commend
      themselves to you, Parliament will not be slow in granting you the necessary powers.” (Pages 11-12).

The Chester Report
2.13 Mr H ughes’ words fell on deaf ears. It was another 22 years before there was a further report
commissioned by the Government on the problems o f football. In June 1966, the then Secretary o f State
for Education and Science appointed Mr N orm an Chester CBE, as he then was (Warden o f Nuffieid
College, Oxford), to chair an Enquiry. His terms o f reference were:
      “To enquire into the state of Association Football at ail levels, including the organisation, management,
      finance and administration, and the means by which the game may be developed for the public good; and „
      to make recommendations.”

2.14 Mr Chester made this observation about crowd behaviour:
      “In recent years there has been an increase in disorderly behaviour by spectators. During the p e r i^ ^
      1946-1960 there were 195 cases brought to the attention o f the FA, an average o f 13 per season. In the
      following six seasons 148 cases were reported, an average o f 25 per season. The matter was discussed
      some time ago at a meeting between representatives o f a number o f police forces (including the British
      Transport Police), the Football Association and the Football League. Both these governing bodies have
      been very concerned at this development.”

2.15 The Report continued:
      “W e have not been able to devote the time and resources to the study o f this problem which its complexity
      deserves. W e very much welcome the initiative o f the Birmingham Research Group, o f which Dr J A
      Harrington is Research Director and have been fortunate enough to see the Group’s preliminary report.
      We are sure that its findings will be o f value, to all concerned.” (Page 97).

The Harrington Report
2.16 This was made to the then Minister o f Sport.1 It observed:
      “Some spectators carry knives, hammers, sticks and spikes, choppers, and other offensive weapons like
      powdered pepper which are not necessarily used for violent purposes but may be used in threatening
      displays. There is also the problem o f singing or chanting bawdy or obscene songs and phrases some of
      which are also threatening and provocative.” (Page 8).

2.17 About riots the Report said:
      “ While such riots must be regarded as almost unknown accompaniments o f football in this country, their
      potential seriousness and danger were exemplified recently by football riots in Turkey, where many
      people were reported killed. While comparable riots seem unlikely here, it would be foolish to rule out
      the possibility' o f much more serious crowd disturbances at football matches than we have yet experienced.”
      (Page 9).

2.18 The Report regretted inactivity thus far:
      “The question o f public safety and crowd control at football matches was dealt with by a departmental
      committee report published in 1924 (Cmd. 2088) and the inquiry into the disaster at the Bolton Wanderers
      Football Ground in 1946 (Cmd. 6946) . . . Unfortunately the most helpful suggestions in these reports
      have often been ignored, though the committee’s recommendations do carry some weight with boards of
      football clubs.”

  2.19 The Report went on:
      “The absence of national legislation outlining minimum standards o f safety and amenity at football
      grounds means that some club managements do not feel obliged to put their grounds into a state
      considered by the police to be necessary for crowd control.” (Page 33)._______________________________

    2.27 On 4 February 1971 the Rt H on Lord W hcatky was asked                           appraisal o f the

                                                                  13
   2.28 On 16 March 1972 Lord W heatley completed his Report and it was presented to Parliament and
 published by H M SO as Cmnd. 4952.

     2.29 The Report contained a technical Appendix. Follow ing the Report, the Safety o f Sports Grounds
  A ct 1975 was passed. A licensing system involving the issue o f a safety certificate for designated grounds
- was introduced and supporting guidance (the Green Guide) was published. In his Report Lord Wheatley
  said:
       “ I recognise that a decision to introduce a licensing system for grounds along the lines I have recommended
       may cause anxiety to some football clubs and football administrators. As I see it, their misgivings are
       associated with a fear that such stringent conditions might be attached to the granting o f a licence that
       many clubs may not be able to afford the cost and some may have to go out o f business.” (Paraeraph
       66).

     2.30 “M y answer to that is this. M y task was to consider the problem o f crowd safety at the grounds. Clubs
        which charge the public for admission have a duty to see that their grounds are reasonably safe for
        spectators. That is a primary consideration. It is accordingly necessary that some standards should be
        imposed and observed. This has been recognised by the football authorities themselves . . . I have
   t    canvassed all the alternatives that have been proposed or which I personally thought were reasonable to
        consider, and the one which I decided was best to meet the situation in the interest o f the public is
        licensing system by a local authority. There is nothing new in this proposal. It has been mooted ^ 7
        almost fifty years. It can come as no surprise to the football world, and in the light o f happenings over
        the years the demand for an independent appraisal and determination o f the safety of grounds becomes
        almost irresistible. I certainly cannot resist it.” (Paragraph 67).

   2.31 Lord Wheatley ended his Report by saying:
       “ I trust that this Report may be o f assistance to you in deciding what should be done to solve this
       important question o f crowd safety in football grounds. O ne thing is certain. The public demand for
       something to be done has been growing over the years. I am sure I am reflecting public opinion when I
       say that something must be done now. The evidence certainly supports that view.”

 The McElhone Report
   2:32 In October 1976 the then Secretary o f State for Scotland asked M r Frank M cElhone M P to chair
 a W orking Group on Football Crowd Behaviour
       “ to consider the problems caused by some Scottish football supporters and to make recommendations
       to the Scottish Football Association and other organisations concerned.”

 A m ong the membership o f the Working Group were representatives from the football authorities, from
 the football clubs and the Strathclyde Police.

   2.33 In the introduction to the R eport1, Mr M cElhone said:
       “There is no simple solution to the problem; it is but one o f the manifestations o f anti-social behaviour
       besetting society in general today. W e have however in our findings arrived at a number o f conclusions
       and recommendations which we hope, given a commitment to implement them on the part o f all those
     ■ most closely concerned, will go some way towards reducing the problem o f hooliganism at football
       matches and by so doing turn football grounds once again into places o f entertainment where parents
       can take their children to enjoy, in relative comfort and safety, the pleil'ures o f our national gam e.”

   2.34 The Report observed that:
       “ A hooligan is a hooligan no matter where he operates and the fact that his behaviour is conspicuous at
       a football match has very often nothing to do with the game itself.” (Paragraph 4).
 Mr M cElhone saw the problem as one o f trying to reduce, or at least contain, the incidence o f hooliganism
 at football matches without restricting the pleasure o f the majority o f supporters.

    2.35 So far as drink was concerned, the R eport recommended that it should be an offence for a spectator
 to carry or attempt to carry alcohol into a football ground; that it should be an offence to be in possession
 o f alcohol within the ground or to attempt to gain adm ission while drunk. The Report recommended that

more people w ho were physically capable o f carrying out the duties o f enforcement would have to be
recruited and suggested that, in their recruitment o f stewards, clubs should look to their supporters’ clubs
to assist in providing the kind o f men required for the job. So far as transport w as concerned, the Report
recommended that it should be an offence for anyone to be in possession o f alcoholic liquor on a vehicle
hired specifically for the purpose o f carrying passengers bound for a football match; or to allow any
alcoholic liquor to be carried on a public service vehicle being used for the purpose o f carrying passengers
to football matches; or to allow the carriage o f any drunken person on such a vehicle bound for a football
match.

  2.36 So far as the separation o f supporters was concerned the Report recommended:
     “That in the interests o f crowd control and safety, separation o f rival supporters at turnstiles should be
     carried out if the police, in consultation with the club, consider such a step to be necessary; that for
     matches where larger than average attendances are expected, sufficient turnstiles should be opened
     timeously in order to achieve speedy admission:” (R ecom m endation 13).
     In order to protect the players, match officials and the pitch, access to the playing area should be made
     as difficulttas possible. T o prevent an invasion o f the playing area by spectators . . . the erection o f a
     physical barrier in the form o f a fence not less than 1.8 metres in height with access points to allow the
     pitch to be used if necessary for the evacuation o f spectators in an emergency.” (Paragraph 53).

  2.37 A further recommendation was that:
     “the Courts should make full use of the higher fining powers under the Criminal Law Act 1977 in respect
     o f common law offences which include malicious mischief, breach of the peace and assault, these being
     the most common offences associated with football hooliganism, and in respect o f persistent offenders,
     should normally impose imprisonment without option.” (Recom m endation 19).

  2.38 The Report recommended that:
     “The police should have statutory powers to search for any containers . . . in the possession o f any
     person entering or attempting to enter football grounds.” (R ecom m endation 24).
but went on to point out that the clubs must bear their share o f the responsibility for the behaviour and
conduct o f their staff at all levels:

  2.39 A m ong other observations the Report says this:
     “ We recognise that many football grounds in Scotland are very old; some could even be described as
     primitive in that not only do they lack any kind o f comfort for spectators but they, also lack basic
     amenities including adequate toilet accommodation. This primitive environment encourages some people
     to react in a primitive manner. Moreover there is a strong case for more seating accommodation. In our
     view it would go a considerable way towards reducing hooliganism; potential trouble spots could be more
     quickly recognised and identification o f troublemakers by police would be made that much easier.”
The Report therefore recommended:
     “ that clubs should consider the provision o f additional seating accomodation. In addition clubs must
     provide adequate toilet facilities for men and women and generally improve amenities for spectators.”
     (Paragraph 88).

  2.40 This Report also recommended that:
     “ players should be encouraged by the clubs to extend their voluntary public relations work in the
     community including personal appearances at youth clubs etc and coaching sessions in schools with the
     objects o f promoting the game and the concept o f good sportsmanship.” (Recom m endation 37).
CCTV was recommended and supporters’ clubs encouraged. The Scottish Football Association was
recommended to take appropriately firm action against clubs.

Department o f the Environment Working Group
  2.41 The m ost recent Government publication on the subject o f football is the Report o f an Official
Working Group on Football Spectator Violence set up by the Departm ent o f the Environment, which was
published by H M SO in 1984. The Working Group was set up following serious incidents o f violence


                                                       15
 involving British supporters at England’s soccer matches in Luxembourg and France in N ovem ber 1983
 and February 1984 respectively. It dealt partly with problems arising out o f international football.

   2.42 However, as regards domestic football the Report said:
       “ the Group reaffirmed the importance o f consistent planning, preparation and co-ordination; o f building
       on experience; and o f the need to consider afresh all possible measures, including those previously thought
       to be impractical or unnecessary.” (Paragraph 5.1).
      “W e recommend therefore that the FA reviews and better defines its powers and procedures and the
      responsibilities o f the clubs. If their powers prove to be inadequate, the Association should consider
      enhancing them.”
 T he R eport went on:                                                                           ' - _

      “This would better equip the FA to implement some o f the recommendations.” (Paragraph 5.5).

   2.43 The Football Association had issued a “ blueprint” detailing the precautions which league clubs
 should take against violence, which was circulated to clubs at the beginning o f the 1983-84 season. The
 W orking Party Report said that it:

         . . has not been rigorously adopted by all clubs. Since it represents the collective wisdom o f fo o t^ ft
      clubs, many o f whom have successfully countered serious threats o f violence, its implementation should
      have prevented some o f the violence in grounds last season.”. (Paragraph 5.7).

   2.44 The R eport observed that the enforcement by the Football Association o f its “ blueprint” occurs
after the event when the deficiencies in a club’s planning has becom e apparent. The Report recommended
that:

      “ improved means should be found for ensuring that clubs adopt the provisions o f the “blueprint” in a
      way appropriate to their own grounds and matches.” (Paragraph 5.7).

   The Report went on to recommend that each club should produce a detailed set o f plans to be
 submitted to the football authorities for endorsement. This w ould prevent som e clubs from avoiding their
-responsibilities; and might ensure also a more co-operative and com m itted response.

   2.45 T he Report recommended that matches between high risk clubs should be programmed so that the
risk or threat o f violence could be reduced. The R eport said:
      “ It is more likely to take place at the beginning and end o f the season and at holiday periods, particularly
      at seaside fixtures when other groups o f young people sometimes also clash with football supporters.”
      (Paragraph 5.13).                                                                            ^

  2.46 The R eport went on to recommend the introduction o f club membership, the introduction o f CCTV
and closer links with the community. It did not recommend that alcohol should be banned in grounds and
concluded that in the absence o f clear evidence that the introduction o f legislation along the lines o f the
Criminal Justice (Scotland) A ct 1980 would reduce violence at English soccer matches, it could not
recommend such action. Furthermore, said the Report:
      “legislation o f this kind would be unwelcome to many; the majority o f football clubs are untroubled by
      violence and would unnecessarily be penalised financially and the vast majority o f non-violenl spectators
      would suffer for the actions o f the few.’’(Paragraph 5.34):

  T he Working Group did not recommend additional measures for banning alcohol on trains or on football
coaches.

Conclusion

  2.47 A study o f all these reports (and there are numerous reports and discussion papers by other bodies)
show s that the follow ing are measures which have been frequently recommended:
      1. Closed Circuit Television
      2. Membership Cards
      3. Segregation


                                                        16
     4. M ore seating at football grounds
     5. Encouragement o f supporters’ plubs
     6. A ban on alcohol
     7. Involvement o f the clubs with the community
     8. Heavier penalties.
I too shall argue for these and related measures. It is to be hoped they will be m ore vigorously pursued by
the appropriate bodies than in the past.

                                       Future safety at sports grounds

Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975

   3.1 The terms o f reference o f my Inquiry require m e to com m ent upon the working o f the Safety o f
Sports Grounds A ct 1975. The A ct was introduced in 1975 to give effect to the recommendations o f an
Inquiry into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds. This Inquiry, under the chairmanship o f Lord Wheatley,
was set up in February 1971 following the tragedy at Ibrox Park in January 1971 when 66 people died as
a result o f pressure from massive crowd surges on a gangway towards the end o f the match.

  3.2 T he main concern o f the Wheatley Report was, understandably, with crowd safety in the context o f
the hazards o f uncontrolled crowd movement, with the measures appropriate for mitigating such risks and
with the provisions o f a regulatory system to ensure that necessary safety measures were taken.

  5.3 The statutory framework o f the Safety o f Sports G rounds A ct 1975, providing for local authority
certification o f designated stadia, follows broadly the pattern outlined in the Wheatley Report.

   3.4 M y enquiries into the working o f the Act have show n that in the designated stadia it has proved
effective in securing improvements in safety. Until August 1985,-however, the only stadia designated were
those with accom m odation for over 10,000 in D ivisions One and T w o o f the Football League, the Premier
League in Scotland and certain international football and Rugby League stadia. In August o f this year,
following the tragedies at Bradford, Birmingham and Brussels, designation was extended to Divisions Three
and Four o f the Football League and to Divisions One and T w o o f the Rugby League.

   3.5 The provisions o f the Act have not been applied to the remainder o f stadia and grounds in England
and Wales and Scotland. I find that neither it, nor the H om e Office/Scottish H om e and Health Department
Guide associated with it (the Green Guide) have been successful in raising the levels o f safety at the non­
designated grounds. I have the clear impression from my various enquiries that until the tragic events at
Bradford, Birmingham and Brussels, the Green Guide was disregarded by the non-designated clubs. There
has, however, been an upsurge o f interest since these events took place and there have, o f course, been the
further designations referred to above. These developments do not themselves, in my view, yet assure a
proper standard o f safety for the public at sports stadia and grounds. They do, however, provide a climate
in which, if prom pt action is taken, a proper standard can be set and maintained. It is to be hoped that
this opportunity will not be missed.

   3.6 In his Report Lord Wheatley identified the various problem s in the grounds relating to crowjA
pressures and gradients in covered stands as well as the more acute risks that such factors presented o™
the standing terraces. He also drew attention to the dangers peculiar to stands, such as the risk o f fire,
which normally do not arise on open terraces. Lord Wheatley went on to say: “ M any o f the stands used at
present were built years ago. The materials o f which they are built, their design and the use to which the
accommodation underneath is put, may constitute fire risks. Thus while events in recent times have highlighted
the dangers in the terracing and its exits, the potential dangers in stands are self-evident.”

   3.7 T he level o f spectator accommodation currently required before a stadium can be designated is not
an indicator o f all the risks identified by Lord W heatley as being present in sports grounds and stadia.
Whilst it is acknowledged that a designated ground will have all safety matters attended to, there are
present, on many non-designated grounds, stands capable o f accom m odating large numbers o f spectators.
If these grounds do not qualify for designation, the risks, in particular those associatd with fire, will not
receive the systematic attention that they should.

  3.8 There is, therefore, a need to reconsider the application o f the safety controls at sports grounds. To
ensure the safety o f persons attending it will be necessary to provide a wider measure o f control in future
over sports grounds, sports stadia and indoor sports arena than currently.

  3.9 There is no wish on my part to add unnecessarily to the burdens which those w ho organise and
manage the various sporting activities carry. There is, however, a real responsibility to ensure that those
people w ho attend sporting events can feel confident that all reasonable steps have been taken to ensure
their safety in case o f emergency.


                                                     18
 Future designation and certification policy o f grounds with accommodation o f over 10,000
 (i) "Stadia"/"Grounds" distinction
   3.10 T he power under Section 1 o f the 1975 A ct to designate stadia as requiring safety certificates has
 been applied only to the grounds o f the four Divisions o f the Football League in England and Wales, to
 the two Divisions o f Rugby League, to the Premier League in Scotland, and to a small number o f major
 international grounds where football is played. Three o f the major grounds where Rugby U nion is played
 are also covered, Twickenham, Murrayfield and the National Stadium at Cardiff Arms Park.

   3.11 In my Interim Report, I provisionally recommended that there should be designation o f those
 grounds capable o f holding over 5,000 spectators1 and that indoor sports premises should also be
 desienated2. I have now had an opportunity o f reconsidering the position on further designation after
 hearing extensive evidence on the matter. I have had to take into account, for example, the financial
 position o f the smaller clubs and balance that against the general safety o f the public.

   3.12 By Section 1(1) o f the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975, the Secretary o f State may by order
 designate as a' stadium requiring a safety certificate any sports stadium which, in his opinion, has
 accom m odation for more than 10,000 spectators. By Section 17, sports stadium is given a particular
 m eaning, namely “ a sports ground where the accommodation provided for spectators wholly or substantially
 surrounds the area used for activities taking place on the ground.”

   3.13 According to Section 17 o f the Act, sports ground means “ any place where sports or other competitive
 activities take place in the open air and where accommodation has been provided for specators consisting of
 artificial structures or o f natural structures artificially modified for the purpose.”

    3.14 There is, in my view, no logic in making a distinction for safety purposes between a sports ground
 and a sports stadium, simply according to whether the accommodation surrounds, say, three or two sides
 o f the ground. For instance, a Bradford-type stand is just as dangerous to the occupants in a stadium as
 in a ground. In my view, the limitation on the interpretation o f sports stadium, namely that the structure
 has wholly or substantially to surround the area used for activities, is a limitation which should now be
 removed and the Safety o f Sports Grounds A ct 1975 should apply to any sports ground as defined in
 Section 17 o f the Act. I recommend that the distinction between sports grounds and sports stadia be abolished.

  (ii) Extension o f designation under Section 1 o f the 1975 Act
      3.15 Given the present structure o f the Act, I first have to consider those grounds and stadia with a
^ ca p a city for accom m odation in excess o f 10,000 spectators but which are presently undesignated. Should
   they all be designated? Or should the full procedure under the Safety o f .Sports Grounds A ct 1975 be
   limited to those sports where in addition to a fire hazard there is a general problem o f crowd control?

     3.16 It has to be recognised that at any sports grounds or stadia there may be three potential hazards the
  fire risk, structural failure and problems o f crowd control. But it does not follow that all grounds with
  accom m odation for over 10,000 spectators have all three problems. There are sports stadia and grounds
  where by reason o f the activity and the atmosphere there is no crowd control problem. For them I see no
  purpose in imposing the full certification process under the Safety o f Sports G rounds A ct 1975.

    3.17 Lord Wheatley, in his Report, recommended (paragraph 56) that the licensing system should be
  phased as follows:       ;
  Category 1 (a) All International Grounds, ie Hampden Park, Ninian Park, W em bley Stadium, Cardiff
             Arms Park, Murrayfield and Twickenham.
                (b) All English 1st and 2nd Division Football League grounds and all Scottish 1st Division
                Football League grounds.
  Category 2 (a) All English 3rd and 4th Division Football League grounds and all Scottish 2nd Division
             Football League grounds (unless in Category 1).
                (b) Rugby League grounds.
  Category 3 Grounds o f other Soccer Clubs and Rugby Clubs o f either code with a capacity o f more than

under the 1975 Act, but having seating capacity in a stand for over 500 spectators, should be designated
under the Fire Precautions Act 1971. Another possibility is by the application o f the “self compliance”
procedure. (See paragraphs 3.29 and 3.30).

10712- ? July 1985, ^ ° U Published a consultative document— “ A Review o f the Fire Precautions Act
   t    . w?s arranged that my attention should be drawn to it so that I might consider its relevance to
my Inquiry into the operation o f the Safety o f Sports Grounds A ct 1975.


                                                          20
  3.27 In paragraphs 3.57 to 3.63 o f my Interim Report, I dealt with the position o f the fire authority at
law under the Fire Precautions Act 1971. Two matters in the' Consultative D ocum ent, which are o f
particular relevance to my considerations, are these. Because o f the administrative workload o f fire
certification under the Fire Precautions Act 1971, and the failure o f the Act to discriminate between the
degrees o f risk, it is suggested in the Consultative D ocum ent that what is needed is a more flexible and
discriminating system o f fire precautions control under which premises which pose the greatest risk to the
safety o f occupants in the event o f fire can be identified. Secondly, the system should enable resources to
be devoted to improving fire safety in premises which pose unsatisfactory fire risks, without having to
devote equivalent attention to premises where standards are acceptable.

  3.28 At present, hotels, boarding houses, factories, offices, shops and railway premises are designated
under the Fire Precautions Act 1971. Fire authorities inspect these premises and issue a fire certificate with
which the owner or occupier must comply. Sports grounds and sports stadia as such are not currently
designated under the Act.

   3.29 Put shortly, the proposal in the Consultative D ocum ent is that the Secretary o f State should have
power to designate premises by class o f use similar to that contained in the Fire Precautions A ct 1971.
Those which are designated would first have to be registered; then an obligation would be im posed upon
the person responsible for the premises to achieve and maintain reasonable standards o f fire safety. For
this purpose he would be provided with advice in the form o f an approved code o f guidance. Thus the
present fire certification process would be replaced by a system requiring the occupier to comply with the
requirements o f the Act by a specified date. The fire authority would have a duty to inspect and re-inspect
after the said date to ensure that the occupier had in fact complied with the requirements o f the A ct.

  3.30 This type o f approach to compliance with the requirements o f safety legislation (which for ease o f
reference I call self compliance) has not received universal approval am ong those to w hom I have talked.
However, for the purpose o f application o f the Safety o f Sports G rounds Act 1975 this approach m ay have
some significance.

   3.31 The Chief Fire Officers in England and Wales and the Firemasters in Scotland have already carried
 out a detailed survey o f a large number o f sports grounds and stadia which were not designated under the
'Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975.

   3.32 The returns from the Chief Fire Officers in England and Wales about the extent o f restrictions or
prohibitions they had imposed on the use o f outdoor sporting venues o f all kinds, show that by 17 August
1985 there were restrictions or prohibitions applying in som e 106 grounds. In som e cases Section 10 o f the
Fire Precautions Act 1971 had been used. In others, Section 77 o f the Building Act 1984 (which gives
district councils certain powers in respect o f dangerous buildings) had evidently been used and no doubt
Section 10 o f the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975 had also been invoked.

  3.33 A total o f 228 non-designated sports grounds were inspected by Firemasters in Scotland. In August
1985 it was found that in about'half o f the grounds the fire precautions arrangements were unsatisfactory.
At none o f the clubs in the 1st and 2nd Divisions o f the Scottish Football League were the fire precautions
found to be satisfactory. Six out o f twenty needed significant work done to improve fire safety levels.

  3.34 Having regard to the lack o f safety precautions at sports grounds disclosed in evidence to me, it
would in my view be a mistake to leave to sports grounds’ management the discretion o f “ self com pliance.”
1 therefore recommend that all'sports grounds and sports stadia not designated under the Safety o f Sports
Grounds Act 1975 and having a capacity in a stand o f over 500 should be designated under the Fire Precautions
Act 1971 as premises requiring a fire certificate.

  3.35 The thresholds o f 10,000 or o f 500 are bound to be arbitrary and this is no more than an empirical
approach. I have to exercise my judgment as best I can. It is an attempt to balance the expense o f inspection
against a reasonable degree o f safety. It has to be remembered that the fire authority already have some
control over non-designated sports grounds by virtue o f Section 10(l)a o f the Fire Precautions A ct 1971.
Similarly, local authorities have some control under Section 10(1) o f the Safety o f Sports G rounds Act
1975.      -

  3.36 Som e anxiety has been expressed about the additional expense which would be incurred by further
designation and questions were raised about resource implications. However, the authorities have already
done the inspections necessary to ascertain the problems in many oF the grounds and substantially to
remedy them. Although further expense and time will be required if there is to be certification o f all sports
grounds with accom m odation for over 500 spectators in a stand, nevertheless som e o f the ground work
has already been done. The speed and efficiency with which the Fire Authorities have acted in carrying out
the inspections is much to be commended and should allow for the early implementation o f further
designation.

   3.37 I have given consideration to the possibility o f using the provisions o f the Safety o f Sports Grounds
Act 1975 in relation to non-designated sports grounds and sports stadia. As I have said, it may be argued
that it is more appropriate to use, if possible, the 1975 Act and have all sports ground and sports stadia
under one A ct rather than to apply the provisions o f the Fire Precautions A ct 1971 or in relation to
structural safety, the Building Act 19S4 or the Health and Safety at W ork etc A ct 1974.

   3.38 A n additional difficulty may arise if the Fire Precautions Act 1971 is amended in the near future
as a result o f the proposals contained in the Consultative Docum ent. Then the issue o f a fire certificate
under the Fire Precautions Act 1971 could create an anom alous situation in respect o f other sports grounds
or stadia which might be inspected after, any changes in the legislation. It would, o f course, be for
consideration, as and when the suggestions in the Consultative D ocum ent are implemented, whether the
Sfelf compliance scheme (as I have called it) would be sufficient to deal with the risk o f fire at a sports
ground or stadium. I do not comment on that. It is not, o f course, possible for me to anticipate
legislation would be introduced or how the Act might emerge after debate. If, however, after debate it
appeared that the fire certification process could properly be replaced by the se lf compliance scheme in
relation to sports grounds or stadia, then no doubt you would-be advised that that was the proper course
to take.

  3.39 However, I have to deal with the position in relation to the non-designated grounds and stadia
now. I have to take account that at grounds or stadia not designated under the Safety o f Sports Grounds
Act 1975 there may still be stands o f the Bradford type; unless they are subject to adequate statutory
control in the immediate future unacceptable risks may remain. Thus it seems to me that, until the legislation
governing fire precautions has been amended or consolidated, my recommendation about designation under
the Fire Precautions Act 1971 o f sports grounds and stadia should be implemented.

   3.40 However, if it were possible under the provisions o f the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975 to
introduce som e form o f certification for those grounds and stadia not designated, it would be logical that
all sports grounds and stadia should be under the umbrella o f that Act.

   3.41 By Section 15 o f the 1975 Act, you “may by order direct that any o f the provisions o f this Act which
are not expressed to apply to sports grounds other than sports stadia, shall, subject to such exceptions,
adaptations and modifications as may be specified in the Order,. extend to classes o f such sports grounds” .
The effect o f that is that you may apply to sports grounds, the provisions o f the Safety o f Sports G rou i^ ^
A ct 1975. In particular, you may apply those provisions relating to a safety certificate subject to s t l ^
exceptions, adaptations and modifications as you may specify in the Order. Thus, so far as non-designated
sports grounds are concerned, it would be possible for you, by Order, to introduce a modified' safety
procedure for those grounds relating to structural safety, crowd control and fire risk. This w ould have the
advantage o f covering the risks inherent at a sports ground.

  3.42 However, there is a difficulty in that Section 15 may not govern non-designated sports stadia. So
that, if you were to proceed by an Order under Section 15, it might still leave the problem o f sports stadia
which are not designated, because Section 15 only applies to sports grounds which are not sports stadia.

   3.43 It may, o f course, be possible for the Safety o f Sports Grounds A ct 1975 to be so amended so as
to have all sports grounds and stadia under the umbrella o f the Safety o f Sports Grounds A ct 1975. That
would make som e sense.

   3.44 Additionally, it may be argued that by amending Section 1 o f the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act
1975, all stadia which are presently not designated (by reason o f having accom m odation for fewer than
10,000 spectators) could be subject to a certification process under the A ct. However, this certification
process would have to be the full safety certification under the Act. There is no provision for a modified
certification procedure for stadia under the Act as appears possible for sports grounds under Section 15. I
have to consider the immediate problem, until the A ct is amended, if it is. If it is thought that in the long
term an amendment is the m ost sensible m ethod o f approach, I have to say however that a designation
order under the Fire Precautions Act 1971 seem s the only immediate step which can be taken to deal with
the fire risk now.


                                                      22
  3.45 Thus, while there are alternatives to the recommendations which I made in paragraph 3.34, they
require amendment to Acts o f Parliament, and until those amendments have been made, I am firm y o
the view that my recommendation should obtain.

  3.46 M uch the same point may be made about indoor sports facilities, as I shall explain below (see
paragraphs 3.53— 3.59).

Structural safety o f undesignated sports grounds and stadia
   3.47 I return to the question how best to ensure the structural safety o f those grounds and stadia not
designated under the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975. It might be done by am ending Section 15 o f the
Safety o f Sports Grounds A ct 1975 as I have already indicated. Unless and until that is done what are the
alternatives? It appears that there are three authorities w ho have the power to deal with breaches of
structural safety at undesignated sports grounds: the Health and Safety Executive (under Section 3 o f t v.
Health and Safety at Work etc A ct 1974); a county council (under section 10 o f the Safety of bports
Grounds A ct 1975); and a district council (under Section 77 o f the Building A ct 1984).

  3.48 It is alsc? clear that while these authorities have the power to enforce provisions o f their respective
Acts, they have no duty to inspect the premises to ascertain whether there have been any breaches. This
difficulty was highlighted by the events at Bradford referred to in my Interim Report.

  3.49 It is in my view essential that one authority, and only one authority, should have the responsibility
for the structural safety o f undesignated sports grounds and stadia. If not, there will not only be a
duplication o f effort and waste o f resources, but also a risk that no-one will in fact inspect these grounds
and stadia.

  3.50    The necessary inspection must depend on the perception o f risk, particularly having regard to other
buildings within the jurisdiction o f the particular authority. But a duty to inspect and ensure compliance
with reasonable standards o f safety is necessary.

  'Interim Report: Provisional Recommendation 5


                                                        23
    3.55 M ore than half o f the remainder are subject to liquor licensing and/or other legislation which
 includes consideration o f .the adequacy o f fire safety measures, eg the Fire Precautions A ct 1971, the
 Theatres A ct 1968, the Cinemas Act 1985 and local legislation in relevant parts o f the premises. In only
 five per cent o f these premises does no fire safety legislation apply at any time.

   3.56 In 1983 there were around 200 fires in indoor sports premises in the United Kingdom . It appears
 that at about half o f these fires no-one was present at the time. In approximately 40 per cent o f the total
 cases the cause was suspected to have been malicious ignition or children playing with fire.

  3.57 These figures reveal that there is a fire risk at indoor stadia. There is no evidence to suggest that
there is a crowd problem, nor that there is a problem o f structural safety. Accordingly, it seems to me that
what is necessary for all indoor sports facilities with accom m odation for more than 500 spectators is a fire
certificate under the Fire Precautions A ct 1971. It may be in m any cases that nothing further needs to be
done. In others, it may be necessary for the protection o f the public that further steps should be taken.
That seems to me to balance the risk to the public with the expense to those responsible for the indoor
sports facilities and also to bring the control o f the fire risk at these premises within a single Act. Accordingly,
I recommend that all indoor sports facilities with accommodation fo r over 500 spectators should require afire
certificate under the Fire Precautions Act 1971.

   3.58 If, however, the Local Government (M iscellaneous Provisions) A ct 1982 or equivalent GL1^
legislation were amended to include all sporting and recreational activities, then I am satisfied that the
necessary control in relation to fire precautions could be assured. Unless and until the A ct has been
amended in that way, I repeat that these premises should be designated under the Fire Precautions Act
1971 by Order and require a fire certificate.

(v) Indoor facilities in Scotland

  3.59 Fire precautions at indoor facilities in Scotland are governed by a number o f different Acts. It is
by no means clear to me that all activities at indoor stadia in Scotland are presently covered by fire
regulations. Accordingly, I recommend an urgent review o f the existing legislation and if there is such a gap,
indoor facilities in Scotland should be designated under the Fire Precautions A ct 1971 and require a fire
certificate.

Section 10 and prohibition notices

   3.60 As I have indicated, I do not regard the proposals in the Consultative Docum ent for what I call
self com pliance as appropriate for premises covered by the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975. There is,
however, an important proposal in the Consultative D ocum ent about prohibition notices which is highly
relevant to'the application o f the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975.

   3.61 I had occasion, in my Interim Report (paragraph 3.60), to m ake som e observations about the e f f ^ )
o f Section 10 o f the Fire Precautions Act 1971. This section seemed to me to be available only when there
was an immediate risk o f a fire taking place. The Consultative D ocum ent deals with this in this way:
     “32 In circumstances where an inspection revealed the existence o f abnormally serious risk it is important
     that the fire authority should have power to prohibit or restrict the use o f the premises until the necessary
     remedial action has been taken. So far as England and W ales are concerned the power currently available
     for this purpose under section 10 o f the 1971 Act has not been wholly effective. Som e o f the defects of
     Section 10'are:

        (a) because o f pressure on Magistrates Courts there are sometimes delays in obtaining the hearing o f
        applications and some Courts insist on prima facie evidence before granting a summons;
        (b) considerable documentation is involved in cases where there are a number o f occupants since they
        must each be summoned;

        (c) it must be demonstrated that the dangerous condition exists at the time o f the court hearing.
        Consequently Section 10 procedures are not easily applied to situations which can be manipulated by
        the occupier to frustrate proceedings. Examples are the storage o f inflammable material in exit ways
        and dangerous overcrowding at night;

        (d) in the event o f failure to comply with the court order the only sanction is to proceed under the
        law o f contempt which does nothing to remove the hazard which gave rise to the original complaint
        to the court.”


                                                       24
   3.62 I made a provisional recommendation at paragraph 3.61 o f my Interim Report that Section 10 o f
the Fire Precautions A ct 1971 should be amended so that the fire authority could go to court, not when
the risk was so serious, but when the risk was an ordinary one. I hoped that the power would be exercised
in cases other than those which were regarded as exceptional. Additionally, I w as minded to recommend
that there should be power under Section 10 to apply for an injunction to the High Court or for an interdict
to the Court o f Session in Scotland.1

  3.63 The Consultative D ocum ent (Paragraph 33) recommends a simpler m ethod o f approach and one
which seems to me to be sensible. It says:
      “33 It is therefore proposed that provision should be made for authorised officers o f the fire authorities
      to have a power similar to that accorded to Health and Safety inspectors under Section 22 o f The Health
      and Safety at Work Etc A ct 1974 to issue a Prohibition Notice. The 1974 Act procedures have the
      advantage o f being simple to operate and, because no court hearing is involved, o f achieving the aim o f
      restricting the use o f premises with the least possible delay. Once issued, a prohibition notice has more
      impact than action under Section 10, and is evidence o f the situation, which if continued or repeated,
      could Jead to immediate prosecution for failure to comply with the notice. A s in the case o f improvement
      notices, there would need to be suitable appeal provisions. Like Section 10 o f the 1971 Act, the power
      to issue restriction or prohibition orders extend to any premises falling within the general class ot use
      from which a particular use could be designated.”

   3.64 Accordingly, I recommend that provision be made in the Fire Precautions A ct 1971 fo r authorised
officers o f a fire authority to have power to issue a prohibition notice.

   3.65 A similar difficulty also arises in the application o f Section 10 o f the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act
1975. As I explained in my Interim Report, under the terms o f this provision a court has to be satisfied
that the danger is so great that immediate action has to be taken. There are thus difficulties for the local
authorities w ho are responsible for enforcement in ensuring that some safety precaution is taken by a c u
where there is no immediate risk o f danger. It may be that the threat o f Section 10 has and will continue
to persuade clubs to d o what is needed. However, it is clear that recently som e local authorities have been
requiring clubs to carry out certain expensive precautions which the club, on professional advice, do not
themselves regard as either being a problem, or as being an immediate problem. Thus there may be a
conflict between local authorities and clubs, which may have an adverse effect on the safety ot sports
grounds. In my Interim Report, at paragraph 3 .7 6 ,1 was minded to make a recQmmendat.on m relation
 lo Section 10 similar to my recommendation on Section 10 o f the Fire Precautions A c 1971 It seems o
 me however, that the introduction o f the power to issue a prohibition notice similar to that proposed m
 the Consultative D ocum ent on the 1971 Act would be a sensible' provision and I recommend that provision
 be made in the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975 fo r authorised officers o f the local authority to have power
 to issue a prohibition notice in relation to sports grounds and stadia.

 Revocation o f certificates; reinspections
    3.66 Once a safety certificate under the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975 has been issued there is no
 power for the local authority to revoke it. By Section 4(1) “ the local authonty may, in any case in which i
 appears appropriate to them to do so - (a) amend the safety certificate by notice in writing to i t s h d d e o r
 (b) replace a safety certificate.” It would be possible for the local authonty, i f a club did not comply with
 an instruction, to amend the certificate so that the particular area o f the ground would have
 limited. I do not believe that this section was intended to act like a prohibition order, t h o u g h itm a y
 that effect. It seems not, however, to have been used in that way. In a d d i t i o n to a Proh«b«u°n not^ e
 powers should be given to the local authority to revoke the safety certificate. The ability for a local autho y
 to amend a certificate to reduce the capacity, could have the sam e e ffe c t as the power o f revocation,
 this is a device. The right to revoke a certificate should be available to the local authonty and a nght o
 appeal should be available to the holder o f a certificate.

   3.67 Another possibility w ould be to require that the safety certificate shall be re-issuedI :annually; this
 would have two effects. It would ensure that there is an annual inspection; secondly it w ould g i\e the local
 authority added power if a club were dragging its feet in carrying out som e work which is required by th
 local authority. Som e local authorities have complained to me that work which they require is often
 done as quickly or as efficiently as it should be, and that the effective sanctions are som ew a—lmi— .-------

                                                        25
     3.68 N o r is there any duty, under the Act, on the local authority to make a regular inspection. A s a
   matter o f practice it appears that som e local authorities do make regular inspections. Representations have
   been made to m e that in order to ensure that the provisions o f the certificate are being carried out, there
   should be a statutory obligation to have an annual re-inspection. I therefore recommend ( I ) an annual
   renewal o f the certificate (2 ) a duty on the local authority annually to inspect the premises prior to re-issuing
   the certificate and (3 ) the power to revoke.

   Composition o f local authority team
      3.69 I have been generally impressed with how well the 1975 A ct has operated in designated grounds.
   There have been som e criticisms by the various members w ho m ake up the certificating team that their
   particular expertise has not been given the full recognition that it should. In any organisation, let alone
   several organisations, som e difficulties are inevitable due to the personalities o f those involved. But the
   teams for the m ost part have worked together well.

       3.70 The fire service have made representations to me about their position in the “ team” . T hey rightly
   say that it is the local authority w ho issue the certificate. W hen the local authority receives a copy o f an
   application for a safety certificate, it is to the chief officer o f police and the building authority for the a r c a _
   in which it is situated that a copy o f the application is sent. The local authority are obliged to consult t h e n ^ P
   about the conditions to be included in the certificate. There is no express requirement that the fire service
   shall be similary consulted. They also point out that on the hearing o f an appeal relative to the terms o f .
   the certificate, the local authority can be a party; so too can the-chief officer o f police and the building
   authority and any other person w ho may be concerned in ensuring com pliance with the terms and conditions
   o f the safety certificate. But not the fire service as such. I f there is an appeal against a court order made
   under Section 10, under the Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975, the local authority, the club, the ch ief
   officer o f police and the building authority may be parties but again not the fire service as such.

     3.71 The powers o f entry and inspection are given to persons authorised by the local authority, to the
   chief officer o f police and to the building authority. Again the fire service do not have the same pow er
   unless it is delegated to them by the local authority.

        3.72 The fire service point out that though fire is one o f the major risks at a sports ground, the fire
--s e r v ic e i s not identified as having any particular role in the issue o f the safety certificate or its enforcement.
    (I am dealing now with the position before the abolition o f the M etropolitan Authorities). They com plain
    that even if changes are made to permit a local authority to issue a prohibition notice under the provisions
    o f the Safety o f Sports G rounds Act 1975, they will be unable to do it on the spot. They suggest that it
    will be necessary for the solicitor to the local authority to be contacted, and that there are times when he
    m ay not be readily available to give the necessary authorisation for the prohibition notice to be issued.

      3.73 I am unconvinced by this argument, particularly so since the fire officers produced no evidence to ^
   me as to any real problem during the years since the introduction o f the Safety o f Sports G rounds A ct
   1975. In the event that problems should arise in future because o f the non-availability o f the authorised
   local authority official, the matter can be speedily remedied by the local authority giving delegated powers
   to the chief fire officer.

     3.74 It was further pointed out when district councils are given the local authorities’ responsibilities in
   the M etropolitan C ounty Council areas in 1986 there m ay be even m ore difficulties. I hope this is a .:eedless
   anxiety. The elected local authority is, in the end, the body responsible not only under the Act but to local
   people. It would be possible for the local authority to delegate to each discipline the power to issue a
   prohibition notice - that must be a decision o f each local authority. A t the m om ent I d o not accept that
   there is any problem in practice.

     3.75 The fact that the C hief Fire Officer is not named as a party to the A ct is said, albeit by only a
   minority am ong fire officers w ho spoke to me, to give rise to difficulties. It is argued that because o f their
   expertise the fire service should be in charge o f issuing the certificate and in enforcing the provisions.

      3.76 It has to be pointed out that the fire service, important as it is, is but one arm o f the local authority,
   which includes the surveyor’s, architect’s, engineering and building and legal departments o f the local
   authority. The reason that the C hief Officer o f Police gets a special m ention, and the C hief Fire Officer
   does not, is due to the constitutional position o f C hief Constables and for no other reason. I find it difficult
   to believe that simply because the fire service does not get specific m ention in the A ct it should not be able


                                                             26
 to work harmoniously with other sections o f the local authority; nor do I believe that if it were mentioned,
 greater harmony would result. I do not believe that it should be given the leading role m the team. The
 certification procedure is essentially a team exercise in which all the disciplines have to be consulted and
 in which all have an equal part to play. I do not in any way underestimate the immense value o f the fire
 service but in my view the present system should continue. It would be a very unwise local au thonty which
 did not obtain and take full account o f the views o f the fire service.

   3.77 The Society o f Chief Building Regulation Officers also submitted evidence to me that its members
 should be responsible for the operation o f the Act and that they are not, in fact, being consulted, on some
 occasions, as the Act requires.

    3.78 There is no doubt that the chief building regulation officers do have a very important role to play.
 Their duties include linked statutory controls over existing buildings in relation to the safety o f users. They
 have responsibility for the enforcement o f other legislation controlling safety in buildings which are licensed
 as places o f public entertainment or for public exhibitions or certain sporting contests. It is obvious that
 they, individually and collectively, have a large amount o f expertise relevant to safety at sports grounds.
 They may well h iv e as much expertise, or indeed more, than those who are part o f the team at county
 level. They are physically closer to the actual grounds with which they are dealing.

    3.79 For reasons which no doubt appeared valid at the time they were not, however, given the; task o f
 leading the team, when the Act was passed. For my purpose it matters not what the r e a s o n was. The fact
 is that the present situation has now obtained for ten years and has been working satisfactorily. It is,
 therefore, quite impossible now to start again, nor right for me to suggest that the c h i e f building regulation
 officer o f a district council should take over this function o f the county council. O f course the district
 council in the metropolitan areas will, from early 1986, be exercising the powers o f the local authorities in
 respect o f this Act previously exercised by county councils.

    3.80 The Society o f Chief Building Regulation Officers has also suggested to me that the consultation,
  imposed upon the local authority under Section 3(3) o f the Safety o f Sports G rounds Act 1975 with the
  building authority, has not in all circumstances been complied with. One o f the difficulties that has been
  pointecTout to me is that because o f the geographical distance between the building authonty and the local
  authority, the level o f consultation with the building authority may be less good than with the other
  interested parties. I should be unhappy to think that was so. I have no firm evidence that building authonties
  are not fully consulted; but if it is necessary to emphasise the necessity for consultation, I am happy so to
  do.


  A mode] safety certificate
     3.81 I have seen a number o f safety certificates. They vary enormously as to their detail. It would be
i useful if the local authorities could draw up a document which contains the conditions which m ost generally
  need to be included. They will have to avoid the danger o f their model being treated as containing on y
  minimal conditions or o f a local authority treating the m odel as o f universal application; each 8 r°und
  different problems and a flexible approach is necessary. But guidance is needed and I hope that me
  Association o f M etropolitan Authorities, Association o f County Councils and the Convention ot bcottisn
  Local Authorities will be able to draw up a suitable model.


  The Green Guide
     3.82 I have been asked to review this document. I have had many representations as to what should go
  into it. It has to be a document which is sufficiently detailed not to be merely a bland exposition o f genera
  precautions and at the same time it has to be flexible. Accordingly, I set up a technical working party with
  distinguished members under the chairmanship o f M r Killoran, my Fire Assessor, to examine w hat additions
  or alterations are needed to be made.

    3.83 Their recommendations, which I accept and com m end to you, are contained in A ppendix E, as are
  their names. I am grateful to them for giving up so much o f their valuable time and for the speed ana
  expertise which they brought to the task. I add below my own comments and emphasis on one or two
  important matters connected with the Green Guide.


                                                         27
(i) Status o f the Green Guide
   3.84 I am satisfied that the Guide .should continue to be voluntary and not form a statutory code; but it
is important that all those concerned with sports grounds should read and understand the contents, and
apply the lessons relevant to their own sports grounds.

   3.85 A number o f officials o f sports grounds I have visited have pointed out that the Green Guide has
in som e cases little relevance to their particular sport. For instance, questions o f a perimeter fence at a dog
or horse race are largely irrelevant. The Guide needs to be applied in a com m on-sense wa>.

 (ii) The Use o f Timber in Stands
   3.86 In my Interim Report, paragraph 3.132, I said I w ould like totally to prohibit permanent w ooden
stands, including those made from combustible material. I recommended that the building o f new permanent
stands o f combustible material should be prohibited as a general rule1 and I pointed out that treatment
with fire retardant materials may not be effective. That recommendation w as made on the advice o f the
fire authorities to whom I had then spoken. I had not then consulted the timber trades. N o t unnaturally,
such a recommendation caused a certain degree o f consternation in the timber trades, and representations
have been made to me that this sweeping recommendation should be reconsidered. In particular m y
recommendation was taken to mean that no w ood should be used in new stands.

   3.87 I have now had the opportunity to have a full discussion with the trade. I had, and have, no
 intention o f banning all combustible materials from a stand. I was, however, anxious to reduce the fire n sk
 as far as possible and it seemed evident that, the less combustible material in a stand, the less the fire
 hazard.

   3.88 It was urged on me that if proper exits were provided then the danger from combusitible cladding
 could be ignored. I believe it is important to deal with the risk o f an outbreak o f fire occurring by the
 provision o f proper structural fire precautions, as well as providing an adequate number o f exits for use in
 an emergency.

— 3.89 O n - 11 N ovem ber 1985 new Building Regulations came into force which covered, inter alia, stands
 at sports grounds. It was suggested that if a new stand were to be built in accordance with the Regulations,
 there could be no criticism.

   3.90 Unhappily, I have been advised that under the guidance issued in support o f the new Building
 Regulations it would be possible, in certain circumstances, legally to build a Bradford-type stand. T h e
 Department o f the Environment recognise the problem and are to give urgent consideration to altering the
 guidance on how to comply with the requirements. I recommend that they do so without delay.

    3.91 W hat then is to be done in the meanwhile? It is obviously possible to build a stand in com bustible
 material which, because o f its construction, will have a fire retarding effect, thus providing sufficient length
 o f time to allow spectators to escape. Having regard to the general level o f safety at sports grounds w hich
 has been revealed since the Bradford fire I am not optimistic that anything more than minimum standards
 will be adopted by some clubs because o f financial problems.

    3.92 I am anxious, therefore, about the possibility that som e new single-storey stands lacking adequate
 structural fire precautions might be built .prior to any n ec e s s a ry amendm ents to the Building R egulations
 G uidance Codes. When they have been so revised conform ing with them should be sufficient. Until then. I
 have to say that construction o f a new stand with inadequate structural fire precautions constitutes a fire
 risk to which members o f the public should not be exposed.

  (iii) Artificial Pitches
      3.93     Som e concern has been expressed to me, in the light o f greater use o f artificial pitches, that there
  may be, in the circumstances o f a fire such as occurred at B r a d f o r d , danger to the public from toxic fun-es
  if, the artificial pitch is exposed to too great a heat. I have not s u f fic ie n t evidence upon \vhich to pass
  judgement. It is, however, a matter, which those w ho are concerned, namely the fire and football a u t h o n ..^ .
  need to examine in close co-operation, to see whether there is, in fact, a problem, and if so to devise m e^ns
  by which such problem can be avoided. The Sports Council, J understand, have set up a Working
  ‘Interim Report: Recommendation 13.


                                                         28
with the assistance o f the Fire Research Station to investigate the problem and hope to be able to report
in 1986.

(iv) Temporary Stands and Marquees
   3.94 In England and Wales and in Scotland there appears to be no general legislation governing the use
o f temporary stands and marquees if they are only in existence for less than 28 days. Fears have been
expressed to me that the increasing use o f these stands at g o lf matches and elsewhere gives some cause for
concern, both from the safety o f the structure in the case o f stands and the fire hazard in the case o f
marquees and stands.

   3.95 Hospitality tents which involve cooking facilities are now com m onplace at sports grounds. Control
o f their use needs, in my view, to be considerably stricter. Fire authorities to whom I have spoken are
concerned that, even when they are notified, it is sometimes not possible to be sure that a temporary stand
is safe because it may be erected in the morning for use in the afternoon. It is not then possible for them
physically to check their condition before the public are admitted.
                  t
   3 .9 6 1 therefore repeat the Recommendation in my Interim Report that consideration should be urgently
given to how best the question o f temporary stands and marquees can be dealth with;1 at present they
undoubtedly constitute a risk to the public. I understand that there are plans for you to publish national
guidance for fire precautions in places o f public entertainment including temporary structures and marquees.
I hope that this can be done quickly.

Variety o f legislation
   3.97 It has already been noted that there is a variety o f laws governing sports grounds and indoor sports
facilities and therefore there are different bodies with legal responsibilities. This is not likely to lead to
efficiency o f enforcement. One anom aly appeared during the course o f my Inquiry. If Wembley arena is
used for boxing it needs to be licensed because it is “entertainment” under the London Government Act
1963 but the same stadium used for the “ Horse o f the Year Show ” does not. The result is that two quite
different standards o f safety can be applied to the events in the same building.

  3.98 It is not possible always to eliminate anomalies in legislation which have grown up through a
piecemeal approach to a particular problem. The anomalies apply to both outdoor and indoor sports
grounds and stadia. In the long term they need consideration by the appropriate Government departments.




'Interim Report: Recommendation 18.
                                                 C H A PTE R 4

                                                 Crowd control

Who is to deal with the problem?
  4.1 Everyone is agreed that there is no single answer to the problem o f hooliganism at football grounds;
there are, however, a number o f steps which can be taken by various bodies interested in football which
together may result in better control o f the problem.

   4.2 Thus Parliament needs to ensure that the police have the necessary powers. The police need to ensure
that they identify and apprehend the law breaker and provide the proper evidence to secure a conviction.
Courts need to pass the appropriate sentences and without undue delay. Clubs need to ensure that their
grounds are physically safe, with reasonable facilities and staff properly trained to control those w ho are
invited into the grounds and to deal with any emergency. They should involve themselves in community
affairs. Managers need to ensure their players, by their behaviour on the field, do not incite the spectators.
Parents too a^e involved. They have a general responsibility for where their children g o and what they do.

  4.3 The genuine law-abiding supporters, who are the vast majority, have' an interest in ensuring the
peaceful result o f a football game by helping to support those enforcing law and order. The football
authorities need to take a positive approach to football problems.

   4.4 Persons in authority cannot stop violence by condem ning it: but one thing is certain, that failure to
condemn violence undoubtedly encourages it. T hose w ho hold responsible positions, w ho encourage others
to com m it violence by failing to condemn or worse by praising violence, have much to answer for.

  4.5 There is no typical football club. A m ong the league clubs in England, Wales and Scotland there are
wide differences in quality o f management and in attitudes. They range from the very good to the indifferent.

  4.6 Every club has different problems. Each problem m ay need a different approach. Som e clubs are
virtually trouble-free, both in relation to their own supporters and supporters from other clubs. Som e clubs
may be trouble-free when they play at hom e but their supporters may cause trouble elsewhere. Som e, a
very small minority, have troublesome supporters generally. N o one m ethod to com bat hooliganism will
be successful on its own. What is needed is a recognition by all concerned, and particularly by football
clubs and the football authorities, that nothing less than a determined and imaginative attack on the
problem will save football.

   4.7 W hile football is the national game and enjoyed by millions, it has n o natural entitlement to survival.
It is but one form o f entertainment in a highly competitive world o f entertainment. T he public are voting
with their feet. Gates in the English League were down from 28 million ten years ago to 17 million last
year. This year, except in the Fourth D ivision, figures are again down. Those clubs who are currently at
the top o f the League do not need reminding o f other great names who once were regarded as the “greatest”
and who now languish in lower Divisions with large grounds, small crowds, large debts and faded memories.

   4.8 With 92 League clubs in England and W ales, it is not surprising that agreement on almost any
 proposal for action is difficult ta reach, or that the football authorities are regarded by som e clubs as quite
 ineffective. I do not see my role as laying down a blueprint for the survival o f football. I am concerned
 with safety only. But if football falters then safety will suffer. Like others before me I can only poinr a
 way. I can guarantee no success. But one thing is clear— those clubs which are unimaginative, weakly ied
'or determined to live in the past will certainly go the way o f the D o d o and the Brontosaurus.

4.9 Finally, it may be o f interest to note the attitude o f som e football clubs in England and Wales. After-
the fire at Bradford and the riot at Birmingham a general invitation was issued by me to all those interested
in football to give me the benefit o f their advice. This m any did, and I was able to write my Interim Report
with the advantage o f their views. I was also able to visit a number o f clubs m yself and I had useful
discussions with them.

   4.10    In the Interim Report I again invited those interested in the very difficult problems in football to
let me have their views. T o make sure that I did, indeed, have the considered views o f those most closely
affected by the problems and most experienced in the game, I wrote a personal letter in the following terms
io all 92 football clubs in the English League:
      “I am anxious to have the views o f the Clubs about what steps can be taken or recommended to prevent
      the repetition o f the events at Birmingham. I shall, o f course, be getting the collective views o f the Clubs
      from the FA and Football League when I meet them again.
      I would also welcome any views o f your Club about other aspects o f my Inquiry. In addition, if you
      would like to come and have a discussion with me I shall be happy to see you or any o f your Board at
      your convenience.”
       Oliver Popplewell (sgd)

   4.11 I am glad to say-that a number o f clubs helped me by giving me the benefit o f their experience,
either in writing or by taking the time and trouble to com e and talk to me— in som e cases clubs have done
both. I also managed myself, together with my Assessors, to visit a number o f clubs. I am very grateful to
them. Their views have been o f immense value. I have, however, rather sadly to record that over SU out 01
the 92 League Clubs did not even take the trouble to acknowledge receipt o f my personal letter.

How can the problem be controlled?
   4.12 I turn to deal with the elements which combined are necessary for coping with the problem o f
hooliganism.

A. The Police
   4 13 I made it clear in my Interim Report that the state o f the premises and the conduct o f the event
 therein is not the responsibility o f the police. A club is a commercial organisation, which is run for profit,
 and its legal status is little different from that o f the person who organises a pop concert a garden party,
 or many other private events. Because, as a matter o f practice, police officers have regularly attended in
 large numbers at football grounds, it has somehow been assumed by the clubs that the responsibility for
 control o f what goes on inside the ground has passed from them to the police. A police presence is there
 to assist in the enforcement o f law and order. Those responsible for organising a private function however
 have the primary and continuing obligation and responsibility to ensure reasonable safety for those
 are invited onto their premises.

   4.14    This responsibility,'which is a legal responsibility, continues throughout the time that those whom
 they have invited onto their ground remain there. It does not, for instance, cease when an emergency arises.

   4 15 The police’s responsibility is to preserve law and order. W hen an emergency arises they are likely
 to be the only body there capable o f dealing with it. They have the facilities. They have the training They
 have the authority. As I said in my Interim Report, the police have to take the de facto responsibility o f
 organising the crowd with all that entails;

   4.16 This has given rise to a certain apprehension amongst police o ffic e rs . W hat a r e the resource
 implications? D oes it require a police presence at a ground which hitherto has not had one. D o es it require
 the presence at a ground, which presently has three or four constables, o f a senior officer or more men in
 case an emergency arises?

   4.17 It was never intended that my Recommendation that: “ Evacuation procedure should be a matter o f
 police training and form part o f the briefing by police officers before a football match” should result in an
 increase o f resources or o f a", greater presence by police officers at a ground. Their purpose a a groun i
 to assist in the preservation o f law and order.

     4.18 It is aereed generally that evacuation procedures, at major grounds at any rate, should be the subject
  o f pre-planning, involving the club and its stewards, the local fire service ( w h o s e experience in evacuation
• is second to none) and the police. The nature and extent o f police manning will vary fr° m c lub to club.
  Thus at a ground where there are only two or three police officers there will undoubtedly be a different
  system from that which exists at a ground where there are present 300 officers in the charge o f a very semo
  officer.

    4.19 Thus, whilst it is important that the police should treat evacuation procedure as a matter for training
  and briefing, they do that in order more readily to assist the owners o f the private club to carry out their
  responsibilities, as they w ould any other private organisation in an emergency, and n o t as a resu— o—any
  11 nu-rim Report: Recommendation 1.


                                                           31
legal responsibility resting upon the police. It cannot be too strongly emphasised that it is upon the club,
or the occupier o f the ground w ho is putting on the function, that the primary and continuing obligation
rests.

(i) Stewards and Policing
   4.20 A number o f clubs have been impressed by the presence o f stewards from visiting clubs who look
after their own supporters. This is a practice which has much to com m end it. One witness reported that at
Ostend a serious confrontation between the Belgian police and Liverpool supporters was defused by the
presence o f Liverpool stewards.

   4.21 In som e police forces it has been possible for one or two officers to travel with fans when they go
away and thus assist the “ hom e police” in identifying trouble-makers. In other cases home stewards have
been able, at away matches, to stand at the home turnstile and ensure that their ow n supporters do not
infiltrate the opposition terraces.

   4.22 A number o f clubs have shown me the handbooks which have been issued to their stewards. I have
seen also cards issued to police officers with instructions as to their duties in the ground. The handbook
fo r Bristol Rovers, for instance, was written pursuant to the conditions o f their Safety Certificate and was
approved by the police. It is a thoroughly comprehensive and sensible document dealing both with general
matters o f stewarding and with the question o f evacuation in the event o f an emergency. It is to be hoped
that all other clubs will have done the same.

   4.23 In my Interim Report I recommended that the Green Guide should be amended to read: “ All exit
gates should be manned at all times while the ground is used by the public and be capable of being opened
immediately from inside by anyone in an emergency.” 1 Leicester City Football Club have a system o f exit
doors worked on a magnet system which are automatically controlled from a central office. Ipswich have
a similar sort o f system. Understandably there is concern that if my Recomm endation were applied to
them they would be required to have a steward at each gate and that this would vitiate the whole scheme.
It was not my intention that this Recommendation should apply to exits which are automatically controlled,
if these types o f mechanisms are acceptable to the responsible local authorities.

(ii) Powers o f Search
  4.24 In my Interim Report I said that I was minded to recommend that, in England and Wales, the
police be given the unfettered right o f search before entry into football grounds, by statute.2 I there set
out the problems relating to police powers o f search which are contained in the Police and Criminal
Evidence A ct 1984 which comes into effect on 1 January 1986.

   4.25 The disquiet arose because, by Section 1(3) o f the Act, a constable only has power to search a
 person or a vehicle, or anything in or on a vehicle, if he has reasonable grounds fo r suspecting that he will
find stolen or prohibited articles. A prohibited article includes an offensive weapon.

  , 4.26 The passage o f the Bill through Parliament gave rise to considerable controversy about the extent
and nature o f police powers. On the one hand there were those w ho expressed disquiet about what were
called colloquially the “sus laws” and those who wanted to give the police a more effective weapon against
crime. It is not part o f m y function to comment on the arguments nor on the result. N o r do I wish to
make any observation about the'Act, save in relation to sports grounds (and particularly football grounds)
with which I am concerned. The wider implications are not for me to consider.

   4.27 Football grounds are in their way unique in that they are a regular place for very large numbers o f
people to meet. Som e o f those w ho attend football do so intending to cause trouble. Every Saturday, for
about three-quarters o f the year, about half a million people go to football matches. Thus football is
different in kind, nature and purpose from any other activity o f the community.

   4.28 The “ reasonable ground for suspicion” safeguard in the Act, which is there for the general protection
o f citizens as they go about their ordinary business, needs to be reconsidered in the light o f what actually
happens at football grounds.

  4.29 The effect o f the “ reasonable ground for suspicion” clause is that anyone can go into a football
ground carrying a weapon without fear o f detection or search by simply carrying it in his pocket. There is.
‘ Interim Report: Recom m endation U .
’ Interim Report: Provisional R ecom m endation I.
nothing thereby to give a constable reasonable ground for suspecting that he will find an offensive weapon.
N o one wishes to see a situation in which it is possible for a large number o f people to be at a football
ground in possession o f offensive weapons. If there is, as I believe there is, a determination by all responsible
members o f the public to seek ways to remove violence at football grounds, any measures which assist in
that task need to be considered.

  4.30 The difficulty which arises at present is this: 5,000 fans seek to enter a football ground. Experience
shows that some will be carrying an offensive weapon. A police officer has no special method o f detecting
which o f those 5,000 is carrying an offensive weapon. He may reasonably suspect that some, or many, will
be doing so. He cannot individually identify those persons. Thus he is not empowered by the Act to search
that person, either before or after entry.

   4.31 I have observed police searching visiting fans on a number o f occasions. They were light-hearted
affairs to which no one appeared to take objection. They were speedily done. N o one was asked for their
consent. It has been put to me that if there is a general search there is less likely to be trouble than if a
single person is picked out and wants to know why he has been individually selected.

   4.32 What then is to be done? I believe a football ground should be treated as a special case. So far as
searching people entering the ground is concerned, it has been suggested that it can be made a condition
o f entry that they agree to be searched. Thus, it is said that anyone who is inside the ground is deemed to
consent. Therefore the search by a police officer is not a search under the provisions o f the Police and
Criminal Evidence A ct 1984 but is contractually agreed to by reason o f an arrangement made between the
football club and the spectator. This is an arrangement which can be properly made. It takes it outside the
Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. O f course it only applies after the spectator enters the ground,
because the contract is made as he enters the ground. But at many grounds there are physical problems
about searching within the ground. Thus that solution is not really a practical one.

   4.33 What then about searching a spectator before he enters the ground? It is suggested that the limitations
o f the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 do not apply if a policeman says, in effect, to a spectator:
“ I propose to search y o u ” . If the spectator says nothing, or agrees, then because it is a voluntary search
the policeman need not have reasonable grounds for suspicion under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
1984. If the spectator does object, then the police officer says to him: “ I cannot therefore search you, but
you will not be allowed into the ground” . He then will go and report that fact to the operator o f the
turnstile, who will decline to admit the spectator.

  4.34 This allows a police officer to search by a method outside the provisions o f the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act 1984.

  4.35 Unless a search is made lawfully by agreement or under the provisions o f the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act 1984 it constitutes an assault. But if a spectator agrees to be searched, a police officer is not
guilty o f an assault. There are, however, a number o f problems. Firstly, the police, on the occasions I have
witnessed, invariably search without any sort o f discussion. Is silence by the spectator consent? If the
consent is obtained by the threat o f refusal o f entry, is it consent? And finally, at what age can consent be
given by a spectator? If it is not until 16 or 18 years o f age then the proposed system is o f little value.

   4.36 It is not my task to give a definitive ruling on these matters; but the disquiet which has been
expressed by the police leads me to suggest that if the present practice o f searching those who enter a
football ground is to be allowed to continue, it should be carried on in circumstances where the practice is
clearly legally based.

   4.37 It has, I think, to be recognised that a football match is an occasion outside the ordinary run o f
normal activity o f the community. Accordingly, there is no reason w hy there should not be specific
provisions relating to activities at football matches. This is the case with the Sporting Events (Control o f
Alcohol etc) Act 1985. It has been recognised to be wrong to give the police a general power o f search in
all circumstances. But I am absolutely satisfied that the control o f hooliganism at a football ground could
be seriously hampered by the inability o f the police lawfully to search at random those entering the ground.

  4.38 I recommend, therefore, that in England and Wales the unfettered right to search those who are either
entering or trying to enter a football ground should be conferred by statute. In Scotland there are divided
views. Consideration should be given as to whether this Recomm endation should be extended to Scotland.
The Scottish police do not as a matter o f practice search before entry as the police in England and Wales


                                                       33
  do. It may be that because o f their “ breach o f the peace” offence (see Paragraphs 4.68-4.70 below) they
  have found that fans dump weapons and other undesirable items, including alcohol, outside the stadium
  before they enter without the necessity for searching. There is no doubt that the knowledge that there is
' to be a search has proved to be a deterrent to bringing into the ground these undesirable items.

   4.39 A similar problem arises out o f the Sporting Events (Control o f A lcoh ol etc) Act 1985. That Act
 was designed, among other things, to prevent those entering sports grounds from taking alcohol in with
 them. By Section 7(2) “ a constable may search a person he has reasonable grounds to suspect is committing
 or has committed an offence under this Act and may arrest such a person.” W hile the police officer obviously
 has reasonable suspicion for looking inside a bag which plainly contains bottles, or bears the name o f some
 well known supermarket, those w hose ingenuity is greater will not be subject to suspicion if they bring a
 bottle or cans in an inside pocket o f a heavy overcoat. Thus the clear intention o f Parliament is flouted.

   4.40 A n additional problem has been drawn to my attention in relation to the searching o f vehicles on
 suspicion o f carrying alcohol. By Section 7(3) the police have power to search vehicles being used for the
 principal purpose o f carrying passengers for the whole or part o f a journey to or from a designated sporting
 event on reasonable suspicion. The Act, however, does not cover all vehicles but only public service vehicles
 or railway passenger vehicles.

    4.41 The problem o f control, which has arisen, is that a large number o f trouble-makers now no longer
 go by public transport. They do not wish to be organised or disciplined, and ch oose to go in their own or
 hired vehicles. Minibuses are favoured but they are by no means the only type o f vehicle used. In some
 cases, the trouble-makers carry with them a large quantity o f drink which they consum e before they get to
 the ground. They may even intend to smuggle drink into the ground. There is presently no power to search
 such vehicles for alcohol, whether or not there is reasonable suspicion. T he right to search these vehicles
 gives rise to a number o f very difficult questions, but you should be aware o f the problem.

 (iii) Offences
     4.42 There is general agreement am ong the police officers to whom I have spoken that their powers to
  deal with the more serious specific criminal offences are adequate. These include assault, wounding, actual
  bodily harm, assault on the police, obstructing the police, criminal dam age and possessing offensive
_ .weapons. In addition, the Law C ommission has recently made a number o f recommendations about offences
   relating to public order (Law Commission 123) which appear in your Review o f Public Order Law (Cmnd
  9510).

    4.43 The recommendations o f the Law Commission do not, however, deal specifically with other
 unacceptable forms o f behaviour at sports grounds which have com e to m y notice, namely the throwing
 o f missiles, running onto the pitch and obscene and racialist chanting. They are less serious in the sense
 that throwing a missile is not as important as an offence o f riot. On the other hand, it is quite obvious that
 throwing a missile at a football match often triggers disorder. It is the inability to prevent or check that
 trigger which leads to greater disorder. Just as a bucket o f water might extinguish a fire, if detected in time,
 so the ability to deal with the first sign o f trouble on the terraces is likely to have a beneficial effect. It is
 no comfort to be able eventually to punish those- who engage in a full-scale riot, if the riot could be
 prevented at a much earlier stage, by stopping those guilty o f missile throwing or other disorderly conduct
 just as soon as they begin. Should they be specific offences or can they be dealt with by an offence o f breach
 o f the peace or disorderly conduct?

    4.44 It is acknowledged that the m ood o f a football crowd can be very volatile because o f the nature o f
 the game, the excitement the game engenders and the behaviour o f the spectators. The margin between
 order and disorder at a football match is very narrow and it does not require very much to turn an exciting
 but peaceful afternoon into a scene o f grave disorder. The balance is a fine one and can be upset by what
 would be regarded elsewhere as a trivial incident. Thus disorderly conduct which would pass as unremarkable
 in everyday life takes on a new significance in the context o f a football match.

 (a) Throwing o f Missiles and Running on to the Pitch
    4.45 The first question to be asked is whether either should be an offence at all. Nearly everyone is agreed
 that throwing a missile at a football ground should constitute an offence. So far as running onto the pitch
 is concerned there are divided views. Those who are against it say, quite rightly, that a properly organised
 stadium will have perimeter fences which will prevent people from running onto the pitch; therefore those
 who run onto the pitch may only do so because they want to escape from danger on the terraces. They
    m ay also run onto the pitch at the end o f play ini e x c i t e m j j l j ! e T n d e S 1U°may be^ ery^ifficult                 to
    ^          i S       ^    S                                          E       S tc h . ThePre , also the difficulty   o f drafting an
    offence so as tcrexclude the person who legitimately com es onto the pitch.

      4.46 The contrary argument is that if there is an        offence ° f                                   do
    In Scotland, where the breach o f the peace offence see s>      ^      bg difficult to arrest all those who
    not have pitch perimeter fences as a general rule-      ‘          arrested should not be arrested. Those
    com e onto the pitch does not mean that those wh°          , arrested j h e offence canvassed would give


                                                                                                                     a h ir ta .      ..

     all cases it is likely to lead to further disorder.

         4.47 I am dearly o f .he view that running onto the pitch without good reason and m i ^ t h r o « t a g
     should constitute offences. The police should have t e                                        U      d t   consider whether these

        enforcing this as an offence.

          4 . 4 9 T he contrary view is that a very large                                          j ^ n o T e S c e d the law is brought
        player such an offence would be difficult for the P                          aimed if it is an offence which is not enforced.




           4.50 T hose w ho favour som e legislation, point oul lhat a                                      ‘ Vouf language from those

         may also encourage potential hooligans to act in a disorderly way.

            4.52 The fact that there is som e legislation governing; foul                                       fhaTco^sideration should

          included in the offences o f disorderly conduct or breach o f the peace.

            4.53 I note that a number o f clubs have as p a r t o f theirground regulations provision for precisely this
          type o f offence. For instance, Bristol Rovers’ F ootball Club Regulations read^------------------- ;----------------------
           'Interim Report: Provisional Recom m endation 8


                                                                             35
     “The Club reserves the right to prosecute or to eject or cause to be ejected any person who within the
     Club premises is considered by the Club, its employees or agents (hereinafter called ‘the Club’) to their
     absolute discretion to be or have been behaving in any o f the following ways:
         (i) entering upon the field of play during the course o f a game
        (ii) using obscene language or swearing
        (iii) making vulgar gestures
        (iv) using terms o f racial abuse
         (v) taunting opposing team supporters
        (vi) entering areas o f the terraces designed for use by opposing team supporters.
     The Club may, in its absolute discretion, bar from entry to the Ground, for any period up to F I \ E
     YEARS, any person prosecuted or ejected in accordance with this Regulation and may take such steps,
     including informing the parents or guardians o f the person concerned, necessary or desirable for the
     implementation o f this bar.”

   4.54 The naxt question which arises is whether the present legislation or amendments to the legislation
proposed by the Law Commission or by the Review o f Public Order Law are sufficient to cover either o f
the three canvassed offences o f missile throwing, running onto the pitch or chanting obscene or racialist
abuse. In 1936 the Public Order A ct was enacted. It was introduced following the public disorders involving
the Black Shirts in the East End o f London. Section 5 o f the A ct reads as follows: “ Any person who in any
public place . . . uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to provoke a breach o f
the peace or whereby a breach o f the peace is likely to be occasioned; shall be guilty o f an offence.” Thus it
is not enough to use threatening, abusive o f insulting words or behaviour— an intent to cause a breach o f
the peace or the likelihood o f a breach o f the peace occurring has to be proved.

   4.55 So far as missile throwing is concerned, if it can be proved that a missile hit som ebody, then the
offence o f assault is committed. But throwing a missile in a football ground is conduct which ought to be
stopped. It is the trigger for disorder. It is difficult to think o f a legitimate reason for throwing a missile at
a sports ground. It is often impossible to show where the missile landed, particularly when some o f the
missiles which are com monly used are coins o f the realm. Section 5 is often inapplicable because it may
not be possible to show .that the behaviour was intended to provoke a breach o f the peace. It is even more
difficult to show that a breach o f the peace is likely to be occasioned when it may be impossible to
demonstrate where a missile fell. The offence o f possessing an offensive weapon may not cover this problem.

   4.56 Likewise, running onto the pitch or chanting obscene or racialist abuse at a sports ground o f itself
is unlikely to be covered by the provisions o f Section 5. The Law Comm ission points out that Section 5
may not cover intimidatory conduct if the victim is, for example, a policeman or an old lady because they
are not likely to be provoked into violence by the defendant’s behaviour.

   4.57 The limit o f Section 5 is further shown by the case o f Cozens against Brutus 1973 A C 854: during '
an international tennis match the appellant went onto the court and disrupted the game. H e was charged
under Section 5. It was held that his conduct did not com e within the terms o f the Section. Lord Reed
said: “ Parliament had to solve the difficult question o f how far freedom of speech or behaviour must be limited
in the general public interest. It would be going much too far to prohibit all speech or conduct likely to occasion
a breach o f the peace because determined opponents may not shrink from at least threatening a breach o f the
peace in order to silence a speaker whose views they detest. Therefore vigorous and it may be distasteful or
unmannerly speech or behaviour is permitted so long as it does uot go beyond any one o f the three limits. It
must not be threatening, it must not be abusive, it must not be insulting. I see no reason why any o f these
should be construed as having a specially wide or specially narrow meaning. They are all limits easily
recognisable by the ordinary man. Free speech is not impaired by ruling them out. Before a man can be
convicted it must be clearly shown that one or more of them have been disregarded.”

  4.58 It is also clear that on occasions magistrates have taken the view that, having regard to the
background o f the Public Order Act, Section 5 is inappropriate for minor acts o f hooliganism . In your
Review o f Public Order Law, at paragraph 3.24, there appears: “The police have sometimes been reluctant
to use section 5 o f the 1936 Act to deal with minor acts o f hooliganism. They do not wish to o>er-react to
such incidents by charging too serious an offence with a disproportionately high maximum penalty and the
courts have on occasion deprecated the use o f section 5 in cases where it was doubtful whether the conduct in
question amounted to “threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour” .”


                                                        36
        4.59 Accordingly, your Review o f Public Order Law proposes an amendment to Section 5 o f the Public
      Order A ct 1936 so that it reads: “ Any person who whether in a public or private place, uses threatening,
      abusive or insulting words or behaviour which is intended or likely— (a) to cause another person to fear
      unlawful violence or (b) to provoke the use of unlawful violence by another shall be guilty o f an offence.”
      (paragraph'3.7).

         4.60 This revised offence clearly will not cover running onto the pitch nor chanting obscene or racialist
      abuse. It was, however, hoped that it would cover missile throwing. Y our Review says, at paragraph 3.12:
      “Missile throwing: Under the Law Commission’s proposals, unlawful violence will include violent conduct
      towards property as well as towards persons, and will not be restricted to conduct causing or intending to
      cause injury or damage” . . . In one respect the Law C om m ission’s definition o f unlawful violence may prove
      particularly useful: the police have suggested that at football matches and on similar occasions, it can
      sometimes be difficult to find appropriate offences with which to charge those picking up and throwing
      missiles in circumstances where the injury or damage caused by particular missiles cannot be identified.
      The Law Commission gives as an example o f unlawful violence: “throwing at or towards a person a missile
      of a kind capable o f causing injury which does not hit or fall short” .

         4.61 This, says the Review, should remove evidential difficulties related to intent or recklessness; and in
       cases o f group violence the police should be able to charge missile throwers with violent disorder, thus
       exposing them to a maximum penalty on indictment o f five years imprisonment.

         4.62 This proposed amendment in my view may still leave a gap in the legislation. Som ebody who throws
       a missile may not intend to cause another person to fear unlawful violence} he may be seen simply to be
       throwing a missile and it may not be possible to say where it went or what it was aimed at. It will often
       not be possible to show that it is likely to cause another person to fear unlawful violence because it is not
       known where it lands. It may also require the evidence o f another person to say that he feared unlawful
       violence. It seems to me that there is very real difficulty in applying Section 5 o f the Public Order Act 1936,
       even as amended, to a missile thrower at a football ground where the evidence is merely o f a fan throwing
       something.

         4.63 If, as I believe, there is a gap in the legislation and missile throwing, running onto the pitch and
_     .chanting.obscene or racialist abuse at sports grounds are not covered by the present or by the proposed
       legislation, what then is to be done?

          4.64 The Review o f Public Order Law, paragraph 3.25, recognizes the problem o f dealing with those
       who create a disturbance. It reads as follows: “ Even if it amounts to threatening, abusive or insulting
       behaviour, disorderly conduct o f this sort may not be caught by section 5 at present because it may not be
       intended, or likely to occasion a breach of the peace; or when the section is amended, because it may not be
       likely to cause fear of violence to people or property. This may be because the fear engendered is not directed
       to any specific result likely to follow from the conduct but instead consists o f a more general state o f anxiety
       or alarm. Alternatively the apprehension may be directed at a consequence o f this behaviour, such as a
ttk   stampede by a crowd or an accident being caused by the articles used to blockade an entrance, which is not in
       itself unlawful violence. But behaviour o f this kind does constitute a real nuisance to the public which would
       seem to justify invoking the protection of the criminal law.” In order to deal with it the Review suggests a
       new offence. At paragraph 3.26 it says: “The main elements o f a new offence intended to cover disorderly
       conduct which falls outside the scope o f section 5 as amended might be as follows: (a) threatening, abusive,
       insulting or disorderly words or behaviour in or within view o f a public place; (b) which causes substantial
       alarm, harassment or distress.

         4.65 The addition o f the clause “ which causes substantial alarm, harassment or distress” has apparently
       been inserted in order to provide a safeguard so that merely to be annoyed or disturbed will not suffice.
       The legislation is designed, according to the Review, to protect the weak and vulnerable, and therefore the
       proposed definition requires evidence that the victim suffered substantial alarm, harassment, or distress.

         4.66 N o one would want to criticise that as a proposal covering the sort o f behaviour which your Review
       had in mind; namely groups o f youths persistently shouting abuse and obscenities, or pestering people
       waiting to catch public transport, or to enter a hall or cinema, or rowdy behaviour in the streets late at
       mghi which alarms local residents.

        4.67 Unfortunately it is insufficient for the unacceptable behaviour with which I am concerned at football
       matches. Somebody running onto the pitch does not substantially alarm , harass or distress anyone, but it


                                                              37
is often the trigger for disorder. Somebody throwing a missile or chanting obscenities does not necessarily
cause substantial alarm, harassment or distress. Spectators on occasions start shaking a perimeter fence in
concert as a preliminary to breaking it down. But under the proposals o f the White Paper, because this
would not cause substantial alarm, harassment or distress it would not amount to an offence.

  4.6S    T he matter is dealt with efficiently in Scotland by the com m on law offence o f “ breach o f the peace” .
This covers a very wide range o f circumstances. Originally constituted to cover the situation when one or
more persons conducted themselves in riotous or disorderly manner to the alarm and annoyance or
disturbance o f the lieges, it has now been extended to cover those w ho provoke a disturbance. The offence
may be com m itted in a public or private place and although evidence o f alarm is normally produced such
evidence is not essential.

  4.69 There is a wide interpretation placed on the type and nature o f disorder which m ay am ount to a
breach o f the peace. It has been com m on practice for the police in Scotland to use the offence for such
behaviour as chanting obscene or abusive slogans, running onto the pitch, throwing objects at spectators
or onto the pitch, climbing flood-light pylons and assaulting or attempting to assault spectators or players.
              t
   4.70 T he list is not exhaustive and police bring a charge o f breach o f the peace in circumstances o f
disorder at a football match. The use o f this charge has been o f great value in Scotland in dealing with a
wide range o f unacceptable conduct at a football match. Actual violence or disorder does not need to have
occurred, nor is it necessary for a complaint to be received about the actions o f the individuals before the
police can intervene. Power o f arrest is without warrant and the offences -are normally dealt with within
the minor courts although in very serious cases they can become an indictable offence triable in the Sheriff
court or the High Court.

   4.71 I have paid three visits to Scotland and have spoken to the football and police authorities. I have
also observed, for example, how well the crowd behaved at a Celtic/Rangers match where there was no
perimeter fencing. The offence o f breach o f the peace is widely regarded as a very successful pieventive
measure. It is a com m on law power. It is not difficult to recognise at a football ground som ebody who is
disturbing the peace at that football ground.

   4.72 A t present there is statutory provision in England and Wales for binding over a person for breach
o f the peace pursuant to the Justice o f the Peace A ct 1361. He is brought before the court and bound over
to keep the peace or to be o f good behaviour, but the preventive nature o f the bind over means that no
immediate penalty can be imposed. Thus in England and Wales binding over for breach o f the peace which
is appropriate for “ peeping tom” cases is wholly inappropriate for football-related offences.

   4.73 A s an alternative to the introduction o f an offence o f breach o f the peace in England and Wales,
similar to the Scottish offence, the offence o f disorderly conduct which the Review o f Public Order Law
proposes should be considered applicable in the context o f a football ground, but without the clause which
causes substantial alarm, harassment or distress.” It is argued that disorderly conduct ought to be defined.
But nobody finds it necessary to define it in the well-known offence o f being drunk and disorderly. There
is no reason why som ebody who is sober but disorderly should not be equally guilty o f an offence. In
paragraph 3.24 o f your Review o f Public Order Law there appears “If a person who causes this type o f
disturbance is drunk, he may be charged with the offence o f being drunk and disorderly; but there is no
corresponding offence to cover similar conduct by a person who is not drunk even though the nuisance caused
is no less, and may be thought more culpable in someone who is sober.”

   4.74 Quite clearly a new offence in England and Wales o f disorderly conduct or breach o f the peace on
the lines o f the Scottish com m on law offence, would be o f substantial assistance in dealing with hooliganism.
It would avoid the problem o f trying to define all the different types o f behaviour which give rise to disorder
at football matches and would undoubtedly enable the police to take action much earlier than they can
under the present law. This offence should be confined to sports grounds where the disorderly conduct is
likely to have such a devastating effect on crowd safety. Disorderly conduct would clearly include throwing
a missile, running on to the pitch, seeking to climb over or to pull down a perimeter fence, shining a mirror
towards a batsman, throwing bottles or cans onto the field o f play, or interfering with a greyhound or
horse race. I suggest that it should be triable summarily and there should be a power o f arrest. I recommend,
therefore, that consideration should be given to creating an off ence o f disorderly conduct at a sports ground.

   4.75 I make these suggestions about legislation with som e diffidence, because I am conscious that it is
 for the Legislature to make the laws and for the Judiciary to interpret them. I am naturally anxious not to
trespass on Parliament’s function. But as these matters have been fully canvassed in evidence before me I
hope I may be forgiven for expressing my own views.
                                                                    f
(iv) Powers o f Arrest
  4.76 I made a Provisional Recomm endation in my Interim Report that the police should be given the
power to arrest a hooligan subsequent to the offence under Section 5 o f the Public Order A ct 1936.1 At
present he can only arrest when the hooligan is actually committing the offence. If he is subsequently
identified on Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) there is no power under the Public Order Act 1936 to arrest
him. I do not believe that Section 24(5) and Section 25(1) o f the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984
cover the matter. With the proposed future use o f CCTV it is important that this gap in police power
should be closed and the.power to arrest be given even in amended legislation. I recommend that the power
to arrest under Section 5 o f the Public Order Act 1936 should be widened.

(v) Alcohol
   4.77 A lcohol plays a part in som e o f the outbreaks o f violence which occur at sports grounds. Even if
it does not give Vise to violence, it gives rise to disorderly behaviour; if fans could be prevented from coming
into the ground without having drunk excessive quantities o f alcohol, there can be no doubt but that the
standards o f behaviour w ould improve. T o ban a fan from physically bringing drink into the ground, and
from obtaining a drink when in the ground, does not unfortunately prevent him from com ing into the
ground with drink inside him.

  4.78 The introduction o f the Sporting Events (Control o f A lcohol etc) Act 1985 has been generally
welcomed, subject to two reservations; firstly, whether drink should be available at all in the ground and
secondly, whether there should be an automatic exclusion o f alcohol from boxes within view o f the ground.

  4.79 In my Interim R eport I observed (paragraph 6.17) that by reason o f the introduction o f the Sporting
Events (Control o f A lcohol etc) A ct 1985, the question o f spectators being able to obtain drink in the
ground was no longer a problem for me to consider. Nevertheless there was, and still is, a considerable
divergence o f opinion about the question o f spectators being able to obtain drink in the ground and o f the
extent, if any, to which it should be available. Considerable feeling also has been expressed to me about
preventing people in private boxes, who have paid substantial sums o f m oney for the privilege (and who
contribute nothing to hooliganism) from obtaining drink in those boxes, while drink may be available to
those who go onto the terraces, albeit not in the sight o f the field o f play.

  '4.80 The effect o f the Sporting Events (Control o f A lcohol etc) Act 1985 is to allow the Magistrates, on
application by a club, and after hearing evidence from any objectors (usually the police) to decide whether
any part o f the premises shall be licensed to sell drink. By Section 3(3) “ an order under this section shall
net apply to any part o f the premises from which designated sporting events, at the designated sports ground,
may be directly viewed.”

   4.81 Thus a bar beneath a terrace, at which a notional hooligan can obtain drink, may be licensed, but
 the Directors’ Box which is so placed that the event may be directly viewed from it, may not.

   4.82 Each Licensing Bench is perfectly entitled to adopt whatever view it feels in its judicial wisdom is
proper in respect o f a particular licence sought. The Act was intended to bestow upon the Licensing Justices
a complete discretion. Som e criticism has been made that in some way the exercise o f that discretion makes
a loop-hole through the A ct. It does not, because it was always intended that magistrates should have the
discretion.

   4.83 There is a division o f views as to whether drink available in the ground contributes in any way to
 hooliganism. Those who contend that it does point out that if it is not available, however much has been
 drunk before the game starts, there will be at least a 1£ hour period o f drying out; nor will there have been
 an opportunity to top up; the peak moment o f potential violence is often when the opposing fans nieet
 after the game, by which time it may well be two hours since the potential hooligan last had his drink.
 Thus there is some measure o f protection by forbidding it in the ground altogether.

   4.84 Those who favour allowing drink to be sold on the ground, certainly before the game starts, point
 to the fact that if there is no drink available in the ground, those who want to drink simply go into the

        vf       Can n § 1 Unt'^ kick-off time. Thus the potential hooligan arrives at the ground full o f
      nsiderably more drink than he would otherwise consume; more particularly because he has spent the
   time up to the kick-off drinking in a bar. He arrives late, and that o f itself may cause d f s o r d e r b e c a ^

had to be erected, between the seats which look out onto the pitch and the bar area, an opaque glass panel
so as to Prevent those having a drink from w atching the game. A s a de te rren t to hooliganism it has no
purpose at all. Its effect may be to deter much needed finance from being injected into the game.

  4.89      Bristol Rovers have what it called a President’s Club. There were 115 members. Because there was
a view o f the field .from the Clob,- drink was banned. Membership has already dropped and no doubt will
continue to drop. N ext year’s membership could be in doubt. The loss o f revenue to the Club though
modest compared with that o f Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester U nited, is a serious one for this Club.

   4 90 Crystal Palace have 25 executive boxes. The absence o f alcohol in the boxes has resulted not only
m the immediate loss o f revenue but also in the loss o f sponsorship and programme advertising, which was’
S.enuera , ° y those using the boxes. These are only a few examples. I have been shown a list o f some 30
c ubs m the four Divisions in England and Wales who have already suffered financial loss and will continue
so to do.

   4.91   N o w that the Act has been in force for a short time, and its effects can be seen, it must be sensible
to have another look at Section 3(3) to see whether it really is a necessary provision. / therefore recommend
that tne provisions o f Section 3 (3 ) be reviewed in relation to executive boxes.

(vi) Closed Circuit Television
   4.92    The introduction o f CCTV as a weapon a g a i n s t hooliganism seems to.h ave mel: w i t h u™ e r sal
aDDroval It is essential that the equipment which is installed is o f a high quality. This is a matter tor the
individual choice o f the police authority and the football management. But nothing could be worse than
to waste a considerable amount o f money on equipment, if it is o f no
so that they can be prosecuted and convicted. It is important too to recognise that the operator needs to
 be properly trained and that maintenance o f that equipment is vital to the success o f its operation.

  4       93 Its use a t Huddersfield Tow n Football Club, for instance, has proved its value. During 1984 there

 C o t m , w t o e t h e t i n evidence has been the v id e o -h o r d in g o f themselves com m tm ng offences o f assault
 on police, threatening behaviour, criminal damage and assault.

   4.95    It is clear that the m ost beneficial factors are firstly, the effect on offenders who

 film with him on it.

    4.101 The Football Trust has made a substantial contribution towards the purchase o f this equipment
  as they and the Football Grounds Improvement Trust have done in respect o f other facilities at football
  grounds. This is much to be commended and they play a very important part in ensuring the welfare o f
  the game. -

  (vii) Radios
    4.102 I had occasion in my Interim Report, to make som e observations about the way that the police
  radios had operated at Bradford (paragraphs 3.27—3.33). I recommended that early attention should be
  given by the H om e Office Directorate o f Telecommunications to consider the practicality o f producing a
  more suitable personal radio for the police.1

     4.103 Subsequently, at one ground I went to I was able to observe the relative efficiency o f the police .
  radio operated by a police officer and a commercial type o f radio o f similar construction and appearance,
  operated by a steward employed by the club. Messages from both were received in the police control room
  situated in the ground, by an experienced controller. The reception from the steward’s commercial radio
  was markedly better than from the police radio.

     4.104 One police force expressed confidence in their equipment. They had been able to purchase their
  equipment on the commercial market and had found no operational difficulty in its use. However, I
  observed at one ground a Police Sergeant being asked by a C hief Superintendent to send a message on his
  police radio. H e was unable to do so, to general embarrassment, apparently due to the batteries having
  worn out. The point has also been made by the Fire Brigades’ U nion that their radios are not as good as
  they would like because the batteries, if used for any length o f time, tend to wear out. I see no reason,
  therefore, to alter my view that the quality o f both the police and the fire service radios (though each are
  different) still needs to be reviewed and the importance o f regular maintenance emphasised. I am pleased
  to learn that a detailed study is being commissioned by the H om e Office Directorate o f Telecom m unications
  into the problem o f personal radios.

  (viii) Police Manpower
     4.105 In m y Interim Report (paragraphs 6.9 and 6.10) I drew attention to the large number o f police
— officers it is necessary to deploy for the purpose o f controlling crowds at a football match. It is a matter
  o f some concern that such a large proportion o f police resources should be devoted to. the task o f controlling
  a football crowd, when there are so many other aspects o f law and order to which they ought to be devoting
  their time. The police are the first to recognise this.

    4.106 A t a recent Millwall/Portsmouth match over 500 police officers were required to be deployed in
  and outside the ground (and properly so required) to control a crowd o f under 7,000 spectators. Any steps
  which can be taken to reduce the necessity for a police presence at a football ground are to be encouraged.
  A successful membership scheme may well have this effect.

  B. The Clubs       .


  (i) Membership Cards and the Football League Scheme
     4.107 I recommended in m y Interim Report that urgent consideration.be given by football clubs in
  England and Wales to introducing a membership system .2 N o other Recom m endation has given rise to
  such discussion or indeed criticism. There were three criticisms o f the idea o f a membership system. Firstly,
  that I was advocating an identity card system. I was not, nor did I so suggest in my Report. Secondly, that
  a membership pass was the equivalent o f an identity card. It is not any more than a driving licence, work
  pass, season ticket, credit card, bus pass, library ticket or the many thousands o f membership cards o f
  different clubs, both football and others, which presently exist.-Thirdly, there was the suggestion that to
  require a card or pass at a football ground was interfering in som e way with the liberty o f the subject. This
  I have to say is simply emotional nonsense.

     4.108 There are, however, two much more serious objections which have real validity. Firstly, that any
  system o f membership cards is likely to prove impractical at the turnstiles because theie would not be
  enough time to check the card presented, given the tendency o f football spectators to arrive at the very
  last m om ent.                                                                  ■    ____________________
  'In terim R eport: Recom m endation 3.
  1 Interim R eport: Recom m endation 20.
        4.109 T he figures for Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, for instance, support this objection. On 17
      August 1985 when they played W atford, the final attendance figure was 29,884. A t 2.45i pm there were
      19,217 in the ground, at 3 pm there were 27,785. The figures for Liverpool this season for five games show
      that on average only 65 per cent o f total attendance were in the ground 15 minutes before kick-ott and yz
      per cent at kick-off. Thus, on average, som e 9,000 spectators were still trying to get into the ground 15
      minutes before kick-off and 2,500 were still outside when play began.

        4.110 The second objection is that it would prevent a casual spectator, who wanted to go and visit his
      own club on occasions, from so doing; and also that the spectator, who supported a number o f clubs would
      be prevented from attending matches. It was also pointed out that if away supporters were banned some
      clubs would lose large revenues. In the lower Divisions, except for local derbies, away fans are only a small
      proportion o f the crowd, but in the First and Second D ivisions they may be very substantial.

        4.111 These were, and still remain, very strong arguments, more particularly as they com e from a large
      number o f the more responsible and reputable clubs. They have been repeated m any times to me, both
      orally and in writing, since my Interim Report. On the other hand, the Football A ssociation, the Footba
      League, the Professional Footballers’ Association and the Sports Council all favour some form of
      membership scheme. So too do many supporters’ clubs, and a number o f clubs w ho are introducing their
      own scheme. A partial membership scheme has much to commend it and, in fact, exists at many clu s
|     already.

         4.112 A number o f matches this season have shown that the casual supporter cannot, in fact, just go to
      any game as he pleases. One example is what happened in the Watford versus Chelsea game in September
      It was played at 12 noon. It was all-ticket. I wanted to go on to the terraces. As a Watford supporter I
      needed to be in possession o f a voucher from a previous programme. As a Chelsea supporter I needed to
      be a member o f the Supporters’ Club and to go and get a ticket from Chelsea during the week. Watford,
      in fact, held 1,000 tickets for Chelsea supporters available at the ground on the day, though this was not
      made public. Thus, if on the Saturday morning I. had as a casual decided I would like to go to the game, I
      would not have got in and thus I was no better off than I would have been under a membership scheme.

         4.113 All-ticket games in England and Wales involve a severe limitation o f those w ho can attend. A
       number o f big games are all-ticket. The usual method o f distribution o f the tickets to the away team is to
       channel them to members o f their supporters’ club or to season ticket holders. In those cases it is clear
       that the casual supporter will not get a ticket. This year all Leeds United matches, when t ey p ay away
       from home, have been designated by the Football Association to be all-ticket games; thus the casual
       supporter o f Leeds United is unlikely to be able to get a ticket to see his team when they are playing away.

         4.114 The system which Leeds United has adopted is to allocate their away tickets first to season ticket
       holders and shareholders: the remainder are distributed to the Supporters’ Club. I was told that to be a
 „     member o f Leeds United Supporters’ Club you need to be proposed, interviewed a n d -approved by a
( 9    particular branch. Unless you are so approved you cannot join the Club; at som e branches unless you are
       personally known you will not be approved; if you cannot join the Club you cannot get into an away
       match. It appears to be a membership scheme with vety strict membership control. However, the alleged
       misbehaviour o f Leeds United fans at a recent match has caused the F A temporarily to ban all Leeds
       United supporters at away games.

         4.115 The Football League have set up a working party to consider the whole question o f membership
       cards. This reported on 9 September 1985. Because o f its importance, it is worth setting out som e or the
       details o f that Report.
             “ 14. Many football clubs have in recent years carefully considered how to attract desirable groups o f
             spectators, such as families and children, to attend their matches . ...
             15. To this end accommodation has been set aside for these groups, and often admission to them is
             controlled by the use o f membership cards . . .
             16. In addition numerous clubs have established supporters’ membership schemes* open to individuals o f
             good character who are not eligible for membership o f family or children’s schemes and for season ticket
             holders.
             17. Safety of Sports Grounds Act regulations lay down strict guidelines for segregation o f rival supporters,
             and these structures greatly facilitate the creation o f reserved areas for members o f particular schemes.


                                                               43
At many clubs, facilities have been specially improved to cater for these groups particularly refreshment
kiosks, lavatories, additional seating and so on.
18. A particular benefit o f schemes o f this sort is that the club and its supporters can be confident that
in those areas o f the ground where admission is controlled by membership, the likelihood o f disorder is
minimal. If offences do occur, membership is withdrawn and the individual banned from the ground.
23..It is thus necessary to consider how a membership system could help solve the away travel problem.
The answer clearly lies in building on the success o f the individual club schemes and extending the
privileges, which membership confers at home matches to away games. To achieve this will require a
high degree o f compatability between one club’s scheme and another’s.
24. The first step, therefore will be for all clubs to have a membership scheme the basic principles o f
which will be common to all. In our view these should cover:
   (a) the categories o f membership (eg the season ticket holders, families, young people and/or children,
   accredited supporters, etc).
   (b) TJie specification o f the membership card.
   (c) A photograph on the card and a duplicate held by the club (except for season ticket holders for
   whom this may not be necessary).
   (d) The length o f time for which a card is valid. We recommend that they should be renewed each
   season.
   (e) The information about the applicant to be supplied on the form requesting membership (eg, full
   name, address, date o f birth).
   (f) Agreement with the clubs on the proportion o f ground capacity to be covered by membership
   arrangements. W e recommend that this should normally be not less than 50 per cent.
   (g) In view o f the fact that some clubs are contemplating the introduction o f electronic readers at
   turnstiles, it will be important to see that the electronic data on cards (presumably in the form o f a
   magnetic strip) also conforms to a common standard.

25. T o ensure that these criteria are complied with, we recommend that the Football League issue
guidelines to all clubs to be included in the arrangements, thus establishing the concept o f a “ Football
League approved membership scheme.” Clubs should be encouraged to provide reserved and safe
accommodaton at their ground for away supporters who are members o f approved schemes.
26. Whilst we do not recommend that every match should be ‘members only* for reasons we explain
below, we believe it would be possible through the use o f reciprocal membership arrangements to reduce
the likelihood o f crowd disorder at difficult games by insisting that not only are these ‘all ticket but also
that tickets are to be sold to members only. We envisage that in due course, as membership schemes
gain increasing acceptance, more and more areas in football grounds become reserved enclosures, to
which only ‘home’ members or ‘away’ members are admitted.
28. . . . We hope, however, that it will never be necessary to refuse admission to persons o f good
character, who for whatever reason, are not members o f the home or away team s scheme (the so called
‘casual’ supporter, who perhaps only attends a handful o f games in a season, or likes to visit a number
o f clubs or who has a conscientious objection to being in a membership scheme).
37. The Working Party concludes that it is possible to establish a national membership card scheme *or
Football League clubs which does not require extremely expensive computer-based electronic equipment
at each ground, or which totally excludes away supporters or decent football fans who are not members
o f schemes from the great majority o f matches which are expected to be trouble free.
38. W e recommend that the Football League urgently draws up guidelines for ‘inclusive’ membership
schemes (following the advice given in paragraph 24 o f this report) with a view to ensuring their
compatability with one another and at the same time providing guidance with the help o f the Central
Computer and Telecommunications Agency to clubs wishing to install electronic equipment to check
^cards.
 39. We recommend that the Football League, in full, introduce regulations requiring clubs to establish
 areas o f their grounds for the use o f members, with normally at least 50 per cent o f the ground s capacity'
 reserved for this purpose.


                                                     44
     40. We recommend that the Government includes in its proposed Public Order Bill a provision for
     exclusion orders on football offenders, to back up membership schemes, and for clubs and police to
     double their efforts to prevent undesirable non-members from entering their grounds, including the
     circulation by clubs o f black lists o f banned persons.
     41. The Working Party believe that if these recommendations are followed the system introduced will
     comply with the agreement reached between the Government, the Football Association and the Football
     League at the Downing Street meeting on 30 July, The national membership card scheme should impose
     little financial burden on clubs, and indeed provide some commercial opportunities for them as a result
     of their obtaining more information about their customers. The successful operation of the scheme will,
     in addition, provide a measure o f security and reassurance for the decent supporters who continue to be
     the backbone o f English professional football, as well as a demonstration to UEFA and H r A that
     English football is determined to put its house in order.”

   4.116 Reading propose to introduce a computerised system, with cards, which would exclude non­
members. It has not yet been implemented. It is, however, one type o f scheme. So too have Brentford.
Under their scheme they issue a form which asks for name and address and employer. A person is issued
with a card with* the type o f membership he requires. It costs £1. The cost o f producing the card was
substantially covered by advertising. Armed with this card, which the member presents at the turnstile, he
is admitted to that part o f the ground where his ticket allows him to go. T h o s e without tickets go throug \
the non-members’ turnstiles thus allowing the casual in, but he pays more for his ticket. Police need only
patrol the non-members’ areas.

 4.117 So far this season Brentford have sold about 5,000 membership cards'. They find that the list o f
members has important commercial potential and are optimistic that there will be considerable spin-otts
from the scheme.

  4.118 In the 1984-85 season Crystal Palace operated a limited membership card system in which 25 per
cent o f the ground had been for “ members only” . In April 1985 they announced that 50 per cent of the
ground would be so organised. There was an initial fee o f £3, but members paid 50 pence less for standi g
accom modation and £1 less for a seat. There were som e 3,800 members. The membership scheme led o a
reduction o f one third in the level o f police manning at the ground.

  4.119 Leicester City have introduced a similar scheme. They have 3,000 members, nearly 5,000 season
and family ticket holders and 1,000 members o f the Supporters’ Club. Because o f the success o f the scheme
which has led to improved behaviour, they have been able to reduce the amount o f perimeter lencinB a
hope, as membership rises, to reduce the fencing further. Millwall have an a w a y trave c u . pp ica 1
require the name and address, date o f birth and description o f the applicant and require e app ican
say whether he has been convicted o f any football-related offence. The card contains a p o ograp
applicant. A number o f other football clubs have supporters’ associations or clubs which require a
membership card including a photograph.

   4.120 An example o f a match containing substantially only hom e spectators was the Milwall versus
 Portsmouth game on 26 October 1985. Because o f previous troubles, it was an all-ticket game. Portsmouth
 Football Club did not accept any tickets and dissuaded their supporters from going to the game, in
 result only about thirty Portsmouth supporters watched the match which was trouble-tree.

    4.121 Another proposal, which has found favour with some witnesses, is that admission for away
 supporters should be limited to a person holding membership ot the visiting c u s suppor ers       .
 it is hoped that a football club would be made responsible for the behaviour o f its supporters when ey
 are visiting another ground.

    4.122 It has to be remembered that all clubs at present have a structure for membership in t h e s h a p e o f
' season ticket holders, family membership and so on. There is no re^ s°n w^y f ese           P               for
  should not be encouraged at the expense o f the potential hooligan. Thus, by im provm 0           ;nvnlvino
  members, by offering discounts on away travel, by offering tickets at preferential prices and by invo         e
  members in the general well-being o f the club, there will be two particular benefits.

 4.123 Firstly, the club will gain from all the commercial benefits o f a membership scheme and the■reduction
 in the cost o f maintaining law and order in the ground. Secondly, the members will benefit from reduced
 contact with the hooligan. Thus, gradually, a club with a membership scheme may start to win back
 families and children as well as other supporters who now stay away.'


                                                        45
     4.124   The Football Trust and the Department o f the Environment recently commissioned the Sociology
  Department at the University o f Leicester (who are very experienced in investigation o f football problems)
  to examine and report on Leicester City’s membership scheme.

   4.125 The Leicester sociologists conclude that the most practical strategy would be to encourage the co ­
  ordinated introduction o f club-based schemes. “Such an approach” , they say, “ would enable each club to
  become familiar with the operation of its own scheme and, following that, it might be possible to establish and
  to monitor a pilot project involving reciprocal arrangements.”

    4.126 In my Interim Report I set out the various problems o f a membership scheme and said that despite
 the problems, these could be overcome with goodwill and effort. I did not pretend that any membership
 scheme would necessarily be successful, or that I could guarantee that it would cure football hooliganism.
 I suggested that clubs could keep away fans away if they were so minded. I did not then recommend this
 as the only scheme, nor do I do so now. It is to be hoped that a partial membership scheme which still
 allows casuals to enter the ground will be the first step in trying to secure greater peace and harmony at a
 football match. In the end, it must be for the football clubs to take whatever steps they think necessary to
 ensure crowd control at football matches. Membership schemes are one, but certainly not the only step.
       Football League have taken an important step in this direction and their efforts are much to be
 commended.

    4.127 Clubs in the Football League have reacted to the Football League's proposal with varying decrees ^
 o f enthusiasm ranging from downright opposition to warm acceptance. Given the history o f the'Foo'tball
 League clubs no one should be surprised that there is no agreement on this suggestion anymore than on
 any other suggestion.

    4.128 The fact that this season, as I write, trouble on the terraces has been appreciably less than last
 season, is no ground for complacency. I recognise that the great majority o f football matches are trouble-
 free, but any practical step which can be taken to lessen the risk is to be applauded. The Working Party’s
 Report is but a first step. So too are the experiments which I have recorded. N o doubt there are other
 promising schemes elsewhere. It will have to be seen how successful they are and adjusted in the light o f
 experience. For my part, I recommend that consideration should continue to be given to some form o f
 membership scheme fo r Football League clubs in England and Wales.

 (ii) Stewards

   4.129 I have already expressed my view about the responsibility o f the clubs, as private organisations
inviting spectators into their grounds for profit, to bear the responsibility for ensuring the reasonable safety
o f those spectators. T o that end, I have already recommended that stewards should be properly selected
and properly trained. The days when all they are required to do is to act like an usherette at a cinema to
show people to their seats should have gone. They have a very important public responsibility to ensure
the safety o f the spectators, as do the cabin staff o f an aeroplane. I have been impressed at a number
grounds which I have visited, by the steps which have now been taken (albeit belatedly) to ensure thzU
there are competent stewards who are properly briefed. N o doubt the presence o f a large number o f police,
which is now the accepted practice on a ground, had led som e clubs to be less energetic than they otherwise
would be in looking after their own property and the safety o f spectators.

(iii) Community Affairs-

   4.1 j 0 Clubs like Aberdeen and Watford (no doubt there are: other shining examples) have involved
 themselves n comm unity affairs. They have provided a place were families and children can attend. They
have encouraged a relationship between the club and the local com m unity which can only result in greater
harmony at the ground. The current financial problems affecting a number o f clubs will no doubt result in
a rethink as to whether a football ground, often used only for football once a fortnight, is being put to its
best practical use. Some 40 hours use in a year scarcely seems an econom ic use o f an expensive ground.
On the Continent, the sharing o f grounds and their facilities, not only for spectators and players, but for
members o f the public, has much to comm end it. This, o f course, cannot happen overnight. A number o f
forward looking clubs already involve the community. M any do not and there can be no doubt that it is
to everyone's advantage that they should.

(iv) Behaviour O f Players

  4.131   The behaviour o f som e players on the field o f play undoubtedly contributes on occasion to bad
behaviour on the terraces. This is not confined to football. Indeed some o f the antics o f cricketers and


                                                     46
tennis players are substantially worse than those o f football players. The public conduct o f professional
golfers and snooker players, who are subject to pressures and tension, certainly no less than other sports
players, has much to commend it. A number o f football.clubs take a much firmer view about the behaviour
o f their players than som e o f the other sporting authorities. It is a fact, however, that in some cases the
play-acting when a player goes down, the childish kicking away o f the ball when a free-kick is awarded to
the opposition, and the throwing away o f the ball when it is the opposition’s throw-in, all cause upset on
the terraces, and play a part in contributing to disorder. Worse still is the so-called professional foul which
in ordinary language is plain cheating. In some games it might call for a ban for life. It seriously increases
tension am ong the crowd.

(v) Supporters’ Clubs
  4.132 It might be thought that with falling attendances supporters’ clubs would be positively encouraged
and welcomed by football clubs. Far from it. Some football clubs have no supporters’ clubs. Some who
do treat them as if they were a rival organisation. The result is that instead o f harnessing the goodwill o f
those who provide some o f the livelihood to the club (and are often their keenest supporters) some clubs
take active steps to discourage them. In some football clubs “ the customer knows best” has a hollow ring.

(vi) Facilities at Football Grounds
  4.133 I have little doubt but that the provision o f good facilities at football grounds is likely to result in
better behaviour from the fans. A number o f clubs do provide first-class facilities. At others the facilities
can at best be described as woeful, at worst non-existent. There is a tradition o f standing on the terraces
and even a modern ground like Ibrox Park has one side o f the stadium which has all standing. But it is
possible to provide comfortable facilities. There is a strong view that while better facilities will not necessarily
prevent people from behaving like hooligans, they are likely to lessen the chance. There is no reason why
clubs should continue to provide facilities no better then were available a hundred years ago. Clubs must
be encouraged to improve their facilities.

  4.134 Professor Canter o f Surrey University was invited to carry out some research for me into the
problems o f crowd behaviour. He interviewed a selected number o f people living near grounds as diverse
as Celtic and Millwall; Coventry and Preston North End. They were asked a general open question about
the reason why people d o not go regularly to football matches and what would encourage people to go
more frequently. The largest percentage (29%) said that improved comfort would encourage people to go
more frequently. That figure varied from as little as 8% at Coventry to 44% at Southampton.

 4.135 This view is not wholly supported by the findings o f the Dunfermline College o f Physical Education,
who carried out a survey o f crowd behaviour at football matches in Scotland. In particular they looked at
Rangers, Aberdeen and Hibernian Football Clubs. Their conclusion was:
      “ Fans rated the quality o f the football and the trouble-free crowd as being more important than the
      quality o f facilities. Further, entertaining football was valued more highly than a winning team. However
      the relative importance placed on the importance o f facilities appeared to depend on the experience of
      the fans. For example at Easter Road (the Hibernian Football Club Ground) a predominantly terraced
      ground, where there have been few ground improvements, concern was centred on improvements to the
      stadia such as covering the terracing and more seating. However, at Ibrox (Rangers Football Ground)
      and Pittodrie (Aberdeen Football Club Ground) where the fans feel there is little room for improvement
      of the facilities, the concern was focussed on the quality o f the football and additional types of
      entertainment.”

  4.136 It would be splendid if perimeter-fencing and segregation barriers could be removed. They are in
England and Wales, o f comparatively recent origin. In the past we looked with superior amusement at
countries elsewhere where it was thought necessary to introduce them. It is, however, quite clear that in
England and Wales, at any rate, a very great deal o f trouble w'ould exist without them, although they are
not universal. In Scotland they are almost non-existent. The grounds at Pittodrie and Ibrox are a model.
One advantage o f introducing successful membership schemes could be to reduce the number o f perimeter
fences.

   4.137 In my Interim Report I recommended1 that consideration be given to the design o f a standard
efficient perimeter fence with proper exits. That was understood in som e quarters to mean that I had
recommended that perimeter fences should be installed as a matter o f routine at all grounds. That was not

m y intention. W hat I was saying was that if perimeter fencing was to be installed at a particular ground,
it would be sensible that the design o f it should be standardised. I have seen a number o f perimeter fences
in various parts o f the country. They varied in quality and design enormously and I suspect also in cost.
Some were efficient, som e not particularly so. A t one ground there was a perimeter fence which could not
possibly be criticised on grounds o f efficiency. However, because o f the nature o f its construction, those
inside the stand had very great difficulty in watching the football. Thus while they were physically controlled,
their enjoyment was exceedingly limited. N or are perimeter fences the only m ethod o f preventing spectators
from getting on to the pitch. There are very efficient methods adopted at som e Continental grounds like
double fencing and dry moats.

   4.138     It would, in my view, be o f immense help to those clubs w ho are intending to put perimeter fencing
in, or are minded to alter their existing fences, to have a standard specification, so that an efficient perimeter
fence, if one is required, can be installed. I would like to have persuaded the F ootball Association to set
up a small working party to help the clubs develop a standard design. They declined the invitation pointing
out that if their design was unsuccessful and the fence surmounted, this would undermine their disciplinary
power. I still think they are the proper organisation to look at this problem.

                                                      Hooliganism

      5.1 I do not believe that my Report would be complete without an examination o f som e o f the current
    theories about hooliganism.

      5.2 There are three popular fallacies about hooliganism. Firstly, that it is something comparatively new.
    Secondly, that it is only found at soccer matches and thirdly, that it is an English disease.

    (i) Hooliganism is not a new phenomenon
       5.3 Seneca (who died in A D . 65) devoted the last three years o f his life to philosophy and to writing
    letters to Lucilius a native o f Pompeii. In one o f them he wrote (Penguin Classics translation): “You asked
    me to say what you should consider it particolarly important to avoid. M y answer is this: the mass crowd. It
    is something to which you cannot entrust yourself yet without risk . . . Associating with people in large numbers
    is actually harmful. There is not one o f them that will not make some vice or other attractive to us or leave
    us carrying the imprint o f it or be daubed all unawares with it. And inevitably enough, the larger the size o f
    the crowd we mingle with the greater the danger.”

      5.4 . . . “ I happened to go to one o f these shows at the time o f the lunch hour interlude, expecting there to
    be some light and'witty entertainment then, some respite for the purpose o f affording people’s eyes a rest from
    human blood. Far from it. All the earlier contests were charity in comparison . . . What we have now is murder
    pure and simple . . . In the morning men are thrown to the lions and the bears but it is the spectators they are
    thrown to in the lunch hour. The spectators insist that each, on killing his man should be thrown against
    another, to be killed in his turn; and the eventual victor is reserved by them for some other form of butchery;
    the only exit for the contestants is death. Fire and steel keep the slaughter going. And all this happens whilst
    the Arena is virtually empty. . . . And when there is an interval in the show there is a cry ‘let’s have some
    throats cut in the mean-time so that there is something happening’.”

       5.5 Writing in 1788 from D ow ning Street, Edward Gibbon described in his History o f the Decline and
    Fall o f the Roman Empire the factions o f the circus in Rome in A D . 548 thus: “The race in its first
    institution was a simple contest o f two chariots whose drivers were distinguished by white and red liveries; two
    additional colours, a light green and cerulean blue were afterwards introduced; and as the races were repeated
    25 times, 100 chariots contributed in the same day to the pomp o f the circus . . . The bloody and tumultuous
    contest continued to disturb the public festivity till the last age of the spectacles o f Rom e” . . .

      5.6 “ Constantinople adopted the follies though not the virtues of ancient Rome; and the same factions which
    had agitated the circus, raged with redoubled fury in the hippodrome. Under the reign of Anastasius, this
    popular frenzy was inflamed by religious zeal; and the greens who had treacherously concealed stones and
    daggers under baskets o f fruit massacred at a solemn festival 3,000 o f their blue adversaries” . . .
m
       5.7 “The blues affected to strike terror by a peculiar and barbaric dress, the long hair of the Huns, their
    close sleeves and ample garments, a lofted step and a sonorous voice. In the day they concealed their two-
    edged poinards but in the night they boldly assembled in arms and in numerous bands, prepared for every act
    of violence and rapine. Their adversaries o f the green faction or even inoffensive citizens were stripped and
    often murdered by these nocturnal robbers, and it became dangerous to wear any gold buttons or girdles or to
    appear at a late hour in the street o f the peaceful capital.”

       5.8 Gibbon then describes the sedition which occurred and continued: “ It is computed that about 30,000
    persons were slain in the merciless and promiscuous carnage o f the day . . . the Hippodrome itself was
    condemned during several years to a mournful silence; with the restoration o f the games, the same disorders
    revived and the blue and green factions continued to afflict the reign o f Justinian and to disturb the tranquility
    of the eastern empire.”

      5.9 Antonia Fraser reports in her book “ Cromwell Our Chief o f M en” that in 1655 in the Midlands, in
    order to preserve the Peace it was considered necessary to ban football matches and race meetings.

       5.10 The Leicester Daily Mercury records a disgraceful scene at the match between Burnley and Blackburn
    in 1890 when: “the Referee was mobbed at the close, the official had to be protected by the Committee and
    so demonstrative were the spectators that the Police could not clear the field. He had to take refuge under the


                                                            49
 grandstand and subsequently in a neighbouring house. The police force was increased and eventually the
 Referee was hurried into a cab and driven away followed by a howling stone-throwing mob.”

    5.11 There are more recent examples o f football hooliganism . In 1909 at Hampden Park some 6,000
 spectators pulled up goalposts, fences and pay-boxes, set fire to them and danced rouhd them in the middle
 o f the pitch. Police, firemen and ambulancemen were stoned, fire engines damaged and hoses slashed.
 Police, after throwing the stones back at the rioters, finally cleared the ground at seven o ’clock at a cost
 o f fifty-four Constables injured and the destruction o f virtually every street round Hampden. Sixty other
 people were also injured.
       #

     5.12 Neither o f the N e w Year’s D ay matches at Parkhead in 1898 or Ibrox in 1905, between Rangers
 and Celtic, were finished because o f pitch invasions. There were serious outbreaks o f disorder in Scottish
 Football in 1941, 1949, 1953, 1955, 1957, 1958 and on into the 1960s. The disorder consisted o f fighting, '
 bottle-throwing and pitch invasions in addition to ritual chanting, obscenities and jeering. The Glasgow
 Herald wrote in 1952: “This hooliganism on the sports field cannot be allowed to go on. The sport of football
 must be cleared up.”
               *
 (ii) Hooliganism is only a football problem
    5.13 This is not wholly true. 1954 saw the M CC in the West Indies playing the third Test Match at
 Georgetown, British Guyana. The West Indians were about to put on 100 when one o f their batsmen was
 run-out. Scuffling broke out in the stand behind square-leg. D ozens o f bottles were hurled towards the
 square-leg umpire who had given the batsman out and mounted police had to be moved onto the scene o f
 disorder.

   5.14 Six years later in the second Test at Queens Park, Port o f Spain, there was a similar occurrence.
 Again a W est Indian was run-out. Again bottles were thrown onto the field by the crowd. Beer cans, fruit
 and anything else which came to hand was also thrown. Then the crowd came onto the field o f play; finally
 the game had to be abandoned for the day.

    5.15 In N ovem ber 1963 there was a riot at a horse race track in the N ew York area. There were fifteen
-arrests an d fifteen taken to hospital. Booths were set on fire and cars damaged.

   5.16 In 1955 at an ice hockey match between M ontreal Canadians and D etroit Redskins there was a
 major riot. A smoke bom b was thrown. Cars were overturned, stores were looted and there were one
 hundred arrests.

 (lii) Football hooliganism only occurs in this country
    5.17 This is not the case. In Brazil, in September 1950, one person was shot dead and several others
 injured, four seriously, when an angry crowd tried to drag a football referee from inside a police car at
 Rio de Janeiro. In Italy, in March 1951, police used tear gas to disperse thousands o f angry football
 spectators w ho broke into a visiting football team’s dressing room at Bari, Southern Italy, injured a player
 and the trainer and chased the referee four miles to a farm house.

    5 .IS The official communist newspaper, Bauber, described a gam e near Belgrade in 1955 in this way:
 “ Fans rushed on to the field carrying knives, knocked down the Referee and put him out o f action for at least
 six months.”

    5.19 The St Louis Post Despatch, in December 1976, described a football game in this way: “ At a
 National Football League game at Foxborough, Massachusetts between the New York Jets and the New
 England Patriots, rowdy fans continually ran out onto the field, stopping play a dozen times. By the time the
 game ended two fans had died of heart attacks, 30 were taken to hospital with cuts and bruises, 49 were
 arrested, a policeman’s jaw was broken and a spectator had been stabbed. In the parking lot a policeman was
 giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to a heart-attack victim when a drunken fan urinated on the officer’s
 back.”

 The extent o f hooliganism
   5.20 There is then considerable evidence about the age and generality o f the problem. It is less easy
 however to measure its extent and development. One o f the problems confronting anyone enquiring into
 the problems o f hooliganism is the total lack o f any reliable statistics. It is possible to ascertain from the


                                                          50
    police the number o f arrests during a season at a particular ground. By comparing these figures with the
    previous year or years, some sort o f conclusion can be drawn, particularly if the number o f spectators is
    also known. Thus arrests as a percentage o f spectators can be calculated.

      5.21 Unfortunately this is an unreliable approach. Firstly, the data often do not distinguish b^ w een
    those arrested inside and those arrested outside the ground. Secontily the offences are not defined; they
    mav be, for example, pick-pocketing, drunkenness or violence. Thirdly, the number o f arrests may not
    indicate the extent o f violence because when a riot takes place police may have to spend more time defending
    themselves than arresting people; on other occasions which are less violent they may be more able to arrest
    the trouble-makers.

        5.22 It might have been thought that this violence has been a problem for football clubs for many years
    the first thing the football authorities would have done would have been to seek to establish the extent o f
    it. Far from it.

       5.23 Presently at every Football League match in England and Wales there is an observer appointed by
    the Football League to assess and report on the performance o f the referee. In European and International
    matches there is an assessor who reports on the game, including crowd problems. When I suggested to the
    Football League that their observers at domestic matches might also observe and report on any crowd
    problems they were not enthusiastic. N or it appears are there any official plans for the central collection


•
    o f statistics on this important subject. The result is that any student o f the problem has to make do wit
    inadequate statistics and a good deal o f folklore because the authorities are unable to provide the assistance
    so that the necessary lessons may be learned.

       5.24 In July 1976, a panel established jointly by the Sports Council and the Social Science Research
    Council reported on the problems o f anti-social behaviour at sporting events.1 In its recommendations for
    research the Report said this: “ During its discussion the Panel was constantly hindered by a lack of y351*-
    statistical information about hooligans and hooliganism. As a result it cannot be claimed that it has achieved
    a thorough understanding o f the nature o f the problem or o f its extent. It appears that much of the data needed
    might already be available in police records, but not in a readily accessible or systematised form. While this
    is not a recommendation for research as such, the Panel feels that a routine system of collecting information
    from police forces in England and Wales about football hooliganism should be established.”

        5.25 Although that recommendation was made in 1977 no serious attention appears to have been paid
     to it. Recently, however, the Football Association wrote to all Football League Clubs in England and
     Wales: “ We at The Football Association are monitoring the problems of various Clubs and trying to ensure
     that where potential problems exist a Club is forewarned. Some form of information service is therefore
     necessary to enable us to provide meaningful help to Clubs and, for this reason, we would ask \o u to give us
     a report on your home matches equally with reference to the visiting supporters.” Albeit late in the day, this
     is a helpful approach and to be encouraged. It is still vitally important that the police and the clubs should


•
     get together so that henceforth it is possible for the clubs to obtain statistics on the number o arrests an
     the nature o f the offences which occur on their property.

       5.26 The figures o f arrest at the twelve London clubs, over the last ten years are interesting. In 1975-76
     there were just under three arrests per 10,000 spectators. They went up to four in 1976-77, down to three
     again in 1978-79, up to five in 1980-81, down to four in 1982-83 and is now on the way up again. Professor
     Canter, a consultant to my Inquiry says: “The general trend is clearly upwards. Overall the ratio is increasing
     but what is aiso noticeable is that there appears to be a 4 to 5 year cycle, the troughs o w ic       o seem o
     coincide with World Cup years.”

       5.27 Professor Canter has also looked at the casaulties at a ground to see whether their number is in
     [yoportion to the arrests and ejections; he concludes that there is a direct relationship between t e num er
     of incidents and the number o f casualties.

        5.28 His conclusion is: “Taken altogether, the figures show an increasing trend towards violence necessitating
     arrest or ejection. They also show that the violence linked to these arrests appears to be linked to casualties.
     Those Clubs, especially in the major cities that attract larger followings, appear to have more violent incidents
     associated with their matches and these appear to be typically, although not solely, at games that attrac
     larger crowds” .    ________                                                                    — -------------------

                                                                     51
      5.29 “ The thesis that some clubs and special matches are the prime focus o f acts o f violence is supported
    by these figures. Discussions with police and other researchers argue this too. Our figures do corroborate these
    generally held views to some extent.”                                                          ^

       5.30 “ But there is an important caveat. Few Clubs are without incident during a season, so to ‘blame’ a few
    clubs is to ignore the widespread pattern. Further, whatever the threat o f ‘away’ supporters, ‘home’ supporters
    are not completely innocent.” Professor Canter says: “Two other comments follow from these findings. The
    first is that it is possible to identity patterns to incidents from available data provided that enough data is
    collated together. Secondly, this being the case, the football authorities (as well as the Police) can tackle the
    clubs directly whose supporters are frequently associated.”

       5.31 The point is made however that differences between clubs are enorm ous. Professor Canter says: “ It
    is clear that each club has its own ethos. The question is thus raised whether this might relate to aggressive
    acts as indicated in arrests.” The arrest levels at the Tottenham Hotspur and Millwall grounds have
    remained fairly constant over this time, at between three and four arrests per 10,000 spectators while at
    Chelsea it has fluctuated from two or three per 10,000 from 1975-79 to between seven and eight per 10,000
    today.      t

       5.32 A team o f sociologists at the University o f Leicester who have made a'special study o f hooliganism ,
    say: “ It is not our contention that, because hooliganism at football matches can be shown to be deeply rooted
    in the British past, it has therefore been entirely unchanging in its forms, contents and consequences. Among
    the factors at work shaping the specific character o f the ‘football hooligan-phenomenon’ since the late 1950s
    have been:

       1. the structural changes that have occurred in the ‘rough’ and ‘respectable’ sections of the working class,
          and in relationships between them;
      2. the rise o f a specifically teenage leisure market;
      3. the increased ability and desire o f young fans to travel to away matches on a regular basis;
      4. changes in the structure o f the game itself;
      5. specific attempts by the Football Authorities to curb hooliganism and, above all, the involvement o f
         centra).government in this process;                                                   t
      6. changes in the mass media, above all the advent o f television and emergence o f the ‘tabloid’ press with
         its competition-generated and commercially-orientated concept o f newsworthiness;
           and
      7. finally, the recent virtual collapse o f the youth labour-market.”

       5.33 In our view, these features, which are all in some sense at least historically specific have made a
    significant contribution to the form, content and extent of football hooliganism since the 1950s.

      5.34 A lm ost everyone to w hom I have spoken both in the football world, in the press and the media
    generally, in the police and in the academic world, agrees that the am ount o f violence which is related to
    soccer, has increased; the statistics also tend to support this view. A distinction needs to be made, however,
    between violence which occurs inside the ground and violence which occurs outside the ground. There is a
    good deal o f evidence that as the art o f controlling a crowd within the ground increases and the physical
    constraints are improved, so the problem is simply transported from inside to outside the ground.

   5.35 This may be a matter o f congratulation and pleasure to the football clubs and.to those who have
inside the ground but it is not much consolation to spectators when going to or from the ground.or to the
ordinary citizen going about his lawful business in the streets o f the town where the football match is being
piayed.

    Characteristics o f the hooligan

   5.36 W ho then are these hooligans and why do they behave as they do? A good deal o f work has been
done by sociologists and others in an attempt to answer this question. T h e Sports Council R eport1 says:
“There is a substantial body o f literature describing and analysing the sub-culture of violence which is followed
by young men in the lower classes o f many societies . . . It is a culture which values additional masculine
virtues of courage and skill in fighting, o f heavy drinking and exploitative sex; of loyalty to other members o f
—      -                                ,                               .




                                                               52
    the group and control over local territory. It would appear that the core members o f fan groups are drawn
    from communities where those values still hold and these values are reaffirmed and given a new location in
    football hooliganism. These values have not only been challenged by alternative values held by other classes
    in Britain but by the emergence of new youth cultures with which they come into conflict.

      5.37 “The sub-cultural violence has found a new location in football. Football has created new heroes who
    exemplify its values and extend its territories well beyond the local street, cafes and public houses.

      5.38 The Report goes on: “ Whatever the experts are likely to say about the natural1 aggressivity o f young
    males and the way this is released in crowd situations, those who have to deal with the problem o f football
    hooliganism, whether the police or the management o f the clubs, believe that in s o m e w a y it reflects on
    breakdown o f authority in modern Britain, and the ineffectiveness o f home, school and churches in bnn0mg
    up children.”

      5     39 “ They believe it is society’s problem and represents the consequences o f a permissive society. There is
    a sense in which it may be society’s problem but a different explanation might be offered. We ha\e already
    drawn attention to the nourishment which football hooliganism draws from certain elements in ^ i t . o n a l
    workino class culture; the value it places on masculinity, violence and loyalty. These elements far from bein
    the result o f social change are extremely resistant to it. There are however '"VPoriani changes taking pi
    British society which may bear upon any long term solution to the problems of football hooli0amsm.

       5    40 The Sports Council Report points out that there is nothing new about violence m the young: “ Ga"gs
    of young adolescents who are alienated or in direct revolt against society are not^a_new phenomenon.           §
    post-war years have seen the rock and roll riots o f the Teddy Boys, the Mods and Rockers, the Skinheads
    and the B ow er Boys. All seem to be seeking a distinct identity for themselves by special clothes, a feeling of
    solidarity by concerted actions and a sense of being wanted through companionship. Football f a n s a r e i n a
    similar mould They seek ‘male bonding’ because they are in a critical gap between the stage of detachment
    from famHy dependence— i f they ever enjoyed this fu lly -a n d the stage o f marriage This . s a s , # r
    explanation than the claim that they retain vestigial traces o f instinctive hunting behaviour from
    evolutionary forebears, although the latter is as difficult to falsify as it is to prove.

        5    41 “They not only seek each other’s company, but are pressed into it by a society whose structure does
     not offer them much in the way o f alternative affiliations. So we see young m a l e s ‘moving around together in
     S n g deoreeJ o f mutual dependance from the occasional ‘meeting up’ to the closely knit g a n g If masculinity
     and aggression (let us not forget spontaneous wit and mutual loyalty) are values adopted by these groups it
     is the understandable consequence o f a socialisation which shapes the need to acquire these qualities as a mark
     of manhood.”
         5      42 “The football match turns out to be a natural arena for the rehearsal o f these q u a lit y and for the
      strengthening o f bonds with each other. It offers an acknowledged meeting place, a carnival atmosphere and
                             t o f h . drabness o f the workaday week. But principally it offers scope for be o n |in g to a
      loosely constructed group, a gang or a clique; for assuming a role and taking part ln fhe action. For a t
    . group h a s a n e x p lic it shared aim although it may not be held with the same degree o f conviction by all
      members. It is that the team should win. The aim is victory. This o b j e c n v e t o s u p p o r t a t e a m and in g
      help it to win, far from being reprehensible in our society is generally regarded as desirable.

       5     43 One o f the Leeds United supporters to whom I spoke expressed it in this way. H e said he would
     rather see his side win a boring game by 1-0 than see an exciting game which his team lost 5-4. Winning is
     everything. Losing is nothing.

      Why football particularly?   '
3
*       5.44 The report continues:
|    “ We still have to ask, however, why football support to a m u c h greater degree than other sports provides a
j    situation that is so primed that it sometimes erupts into disorder.

\       5 45 “ Som e o f the differences between football and other sports can be spelt out in greater detail. It is
      important to emphasise that no single feature but only a combination will suffice to portray the football ma
      as a situation with a potential for extreme behaviour.

        5    46 “ 1. There is a very strong belief that the presence o f large numbers o f supporters spurs; a team to
      greater effort. It is also widely felt that if this presence can be made explicit by shouting and chantin0


                                                             53
   effect will be that much greater. It is partly for this reason that organised supporters and fan clubs are strongly
   encouraged by management and why teams are expected to perform better on their home territory.. . . The
   belief in clamourous support does not obtain in all games and the differences are not merely accidental. Football
   is a continuous physical activity that proceeds so rapidly that each action seems almost a reflex. It does not
   require the concentration or ‘cerebration’ o f a chess match or a golf tournament, where the players’ moves are
   invariably accompanied by a hush on the part o f the spectators and not by shouting. It is in general accord
   with research on social facilitation and ‘audiences’ that support can induce ‘arousal’ and hence more physical
   effort but that for tasks requiring careful thought at the time when the action is carried out, audiences are
   distracting and counterproductive.”

           “ 2. There are only two parties to a football match, for the entire event. The competition is completely
   polarised; if one team wins, the other loses and there is no fine gradation o f awards. The same applies to the
   supporters. They are in direct and simple opposition and this implies also that each side is united within itself
   into a huge collectivity for the purposes of direct competition with the other side. This competition does not
   end with the match - there are traditional enemies, old scores to settle and reputations to attack or defend and
   the frequency o f the meetings reinforces the partisanship.”

           “ 3. The game itself includes a fast moving series o f direct physical confrontations as well as cooperative
   movements between team members. The spectators can readily identify with these movements, both individually
   and collectively because all the action can be seen by the whole of the audience at the same time. They can
   follow and respond to the shifting fortunes and experience vicariously the often aggressive encounters. Quite
   often the outcome is unpredictable up till the closing minutes.”

             “ 4. A strong sense o f ‘involvement’ or identification with what is happening on the field o f play, whether
   it is a clash of individuals or a team movement, arises from the fact (relatively unique to football) that a high
   proportion o f the spectators have played the game themselves through the early years o f their lives or are still
   playing.” I have to say that I question this view. I am by no means sure that such a high proportion o f
   football supporters have in fact played the game to the extent suggested and I am equally doubtful that in
   other games like rugby union and cricket the proportion o f spectators who themselves have played or are
   playing is necessarily less than at football.

          “ 5. An additional factor to combine with the preceding ones to further delineate football is its strong
— basis in working class culture. Football is still an institution that is distinctly working class. The terraces at
  big matches have become obvious and prominent places for proudly displaying and emphasising class values
  and this process is o f course mutually re-inforcing. It is readily observed not only at the cultural but also at
  the individual levels. Som e social scientists say that aggression is more encouraged in the social upbringing o f
  working class children but more heavily punished when it is employed and that punishment further reinforces
  its use because it is itself aggression and administered by a revered model ie the parent. In middle class
  upbringing, physical forms o f aggression are less encouraged as acceptable social behaviour and they also
  receive less punishment when they are deployed.”

            “ 6. The alignment o f football teams is territorial . . . the large majority o f supporters are drawn from
   a fairly localised territory. Unlike middle class people, whose attachment is more likely to be temporary and
   whose lives are more mobile, working class youths and adults have a very strong attachment to place” . . .

      5.47 The report continues: “It may be noted that we have not so far referred to the possibility o f frustration
   which in one o f the main theories o f aggression is regarded as a main instigator. In football hooliganism, it is
   doubtful if it adds much strength to the explanation. If some young people are frustrated by unemployment
   and the many social deprivations to which they are exposed, this is a chronic condition and not something that
   is acutely experienced at football matches. Indeed, the reverse is more likely. It may, however, be argued that
   the fan groups’ major aim is frustrated if its'team is defeated or one of its members unfairly treated, and that
   this frustration intensifies if the fans are prevented by the police and by the layout o f the Ends from correcting
   the injustice o f humiliation.”

      5.48 Finally the Report says: “ It must be re-emphasised that none o f the conditions we have outlined are
   enough by themselves to distinguish football from similar spectator sports such as rugby union and league,
   American baseball and football and ice hockey and so on. However, when taken in combination they amount
   to a formidable set of predisposing characteristics. It must follow that if action is to be taken to minimise the
   undesirable consequences o f football, it must be taken at many points. There cannot be a single panacea.”

     5.49 The reference to Rugby League points a contrast between the atm osphere at that sport and at
   association football. I was able to watch a Rugby League club game attended by 12,500 spectators. There


                                                             54
were no perimeter fences. There was no form o f segregation. There were no incidents. Only some 20 police
officers were on hand. There were large numbers o f women and children present; the afternoon was an
enjoyable day out for everyone. On the previous day when England played N ew Zealand, however,
policemen had had to go onto the pitch to sort out players who were fighting am ong themselves.

  5.50 Professor Canter in his Report to me said: “The genera! concern with violence, at and around football
matches, has been the reason for a great many official and technical reports and a number of studies. From
these examinations some general explanations of violence at football matches have been put forward. These
explanations do carry implications for crowd safety and control.”

  5.51 “The following hypotheses have been put forward to explain violence at and around football matches.
As will be apparent the different hypotheses are not necessarily competitive or mutually exclusive, although
they do carry differing implications for control.”

   5.52 The various explanations identified by Professor Canter are these:
 “ 1. Violence is a conscious deliberate activity sought after by particular organised groups.
   2. Particular football clubs have attracted a membership that contains small numbers of supporters groups
      that are especially prone to violent behaviour.
   3. Watching football can be an intensely rowdy activity. Under given physical or emotional circumstances
      notably on the terraces and at important major matches, this rowdyism will burst into violence.
   4. Violence is'a direct product of uncontrolled confrontation between rival groups o f fans.
   5. Football hooliganism is a quasi-political reaction by unemployed disaffected youth against an uncaring
      society and against Clubs more interested in their players than in their supporters.
   6. Most aggressive behaviour among football supporters is essentially ritual not intended to lead to actual
      acts of violence. It only evolves hito violence when the ritual breaks down say due to misunderstanding
      by the supporters or the police.”

The “ new” hooligan
  5.53 Many responsible organisations and individuals I have spoken to in the course o f my Inquiry
expressed serious concern about the rise o f what they saw as a new breed o f football hooligan. The Leicester
sociologists say:’
“ In our research we have been particularly interested in what the football hooligans themselves and other
young fans call ‘fighting crews’ specially those of the ‘super hooligan groups’ which have evolved in recent
years at some of the larger clubs. . . . One of their main distinguishing marks is the fact that they do not
travel to matches on ‘football specials’ and official coaches but tend instead to use regular coach or rail services
or cars and hired vans. They also eschew the forms of dress, the scarves and favours (also the club banners)
that slill tend to be widely associated with football hooligans in popular opinion. One of their main objectives
in attending matches is to confront and fight opposing fans and to ‘take their end’. Fans of this kind travel
without identifying colours in order to avoid advertising themselves too soon to rival fans and the police.”

  5.54'The way they operate was graphically described in a recent trial at the Old Bailey before Judge
Hilliard.

  5.55 On the day o f the offence Chelsea were due to play Cambridge United Football Club at Cambridge.
A large police operation had been mounted involving over 400 officers. Chelsea supporters had. apparently,
on a previous visit to Cambridge caused damage to property and possibly to other persons. A number o f
Cambridge supporters, about 60-80 young men, gathered at a public house. There was no trouble in the
public house because police officers visited from time to time. It is clear, however, that look-outs had been
posted so that they could give warning not only o f the approach o f Chelsea supporters but also o f the
police.

  5.56 The leader o f the group was known as the “ General” . He had been subject to a life ban from
Cambridge United Football Club from November 1983.

  5.57 Some time about midday, a group o f about 50 youths were seen running from the direction o f the
public house. They were carrying weapons in the forms o f bottles or stones. A local resident realised they
’ D u n n i n g , M urphy a n d Williams: "S pectator Violence at Football Matches: tow ards a sociological e x p l a n a t i o n " . British Journal of
Sociology, forlhcom ing 1986.
 were hunting or hounding Chelsea supporters. He could hear the sound o f bottles being broken and glasses
 being trampled into the ground. The Cambridge supporters proceeded to ambush and then attack the
 Chelsea supporters.

    5.58 One o f the accused was asked what he had against Chelsea supporters. He said: “ They’re animals.”
 And when asked what he got out o f it he said: “It’s a bit o f excitement. What is there in Cambridge for
• young people. . . . The bastards give you a good hiding up there anyway. What Cambridge needs is something
 like a M ecca.” One o f the other youths said: “ I have been depressed for some time now and I formed the
 opinion that if I was going to take my aggression out on anybody I may as well have one with football
 supporters. I knew the people in there— {the public house}— would be looking for trouble.”

   5.59 One o f the accused said: “ I knew there would be      trouble because other years when that many people
 meet, it always leads to trouble, and it was obvious from     the talk in the pub that some people were intent on
 getting Chelsea fans on their way to the ground.” And          another said: “It was obvious what was going to
 happen . . . when those teams are in town a lot o f kids go   out looking for trouble.”

    5.60 The Judge said this: “Now in this case a group o f youths and young adults at different times and
 varying, according to estimates, between 30 and 150 took part in attacks on Chelsea supporters between noon
 and 2 pm . . . The final exit from [the public house], about 2 pm was a determined and cunning attack by
 about 80 people. At a nearby road junction the mob split into two parts and each part then approached the
 main Newmarket Road by separate side roads, thus trapping Chelsea supporters and ordinary members of the
 public going to the football ground. The site for this was carefully chosen to permit o f no escape, the main
 road at that point having iron railings upon the entire length of the centre reservation. Sticks, pool cues, bottles
'and glasses were carried as weapons by some o f those in both groups, and were used on those caught in the
 pineer movement. Some Chelsea fans escaped by jumping over the railings. One who failed to make it was hit
 over the head with a bottle and jabbed in the neck with a broken end, severing an artery, and might well have
 died but for skillful first-aid by a police officer and good medical attention. Another young man had his jaw
 broken in three places, merely for being in the way, and was kicked and beaten to the ground in front of
 ordinary men and women who were helpless to intervene.”

   5.61 “This was organised, pre-planned violence which endangered life. An experienced policeman said it was
 the w orst series of indicents he had seen in ten years, and there were a number o f other incidents involving
 groups of youths attacking single youths with feet and fists and weapons— too many to mention.”

    5.62 O f the leader, who was sentenced to five years imprisonment, the Judge said: “ An intelligent and
 reasoned letter which I have read shows that you have some insight . . . It also shows that you are articulate,
 fluent and persuasive in a high degree.”

    5.63 M any o f the accused did not fall into the so-called “ rough” working class category. One, who was
 sentenced to ten months imprisonment, was described by the Judge as having a good work record and
 attractive references. Another who had no previous convictions was described by a probation officer as
 being a very decent young man. O f another it was said by his employers, that he had worked well for them
 and that his behaviour was out o f character. Yet another, was a computer engineer; he was buying his own
 home and he was engaged to be married. Another had previous exemplary character and had glowing and
 unsolicited testimonials from neighbours. A nother was a hard-working apprentice from a secure home
 background. Others were described as being well-employed with good references, com ing from good homes;
 yet another was described as having an exemplary lifestyle, a committed Christian.

   5.64 An example o f the ingenuity o f the modern hooligan was given to me by one police force. One
 group o f hooligans in order to avoid detection by the police on a visit to an away-match, hired morning
 suits and travelled by British Rail having persuaded the authorities that they were going to a wedding.

    5.65 The evidence given to me also shows that one characteristic o f today s hooligan is that often he
 quite deliberately does not take alcohol in order better to carry out his part in the planned operation and
 to keep his mind clear.

 The Scottish experience
   5.66 A study, sponsored by the Football Trust on crowd behaviour at football matches, was carried out
 by a research team from the Centre for Leisure Research, Dunfermline College o f Physical Education (then
 part o f Edinburgh University) between 1982 and 1984, and was published in January 1984.


                                                          56
      5.67 It is clear from that Report, from my discussions with Mr Coalter (who was a leader o f the research
    team) and from evidence which I received, both from the Scottish police and the football authorities, that
    there are a number o f significant differences between what happens in Scotland and in England.

       5.68 The Dunfermline study investigated three football clubs, namely, Glasgow Rangers, Glasgow Celtic
    and Aberdeen Football Club. Overall they drew a number o f conclusions. They found: “Scottish Clubs and
    their supporters [were] distinct from those south of the border and as such [merited] study in their own right.”
    They concluded that both Aberdeen and Rangers retained more traditional com m unity links and further,
    that: “The relatively low level o f commercialism and the rather more traditional, even populist, links between
    the Clubs and their supporters mean that the various theories developed largely on the basis of English evidence
    to explain the meaning and significance of the game to supporters (and in particular the roots of football
    hooliganism) appear less applicable in Scotland.” The study continues: “ In addition, soccer related violence
    in Scotland is also distinct from that in England in that it tends to be fuelled by sectarian antagonism. Some
    o f the forces which tend to promote and encourage violence therefore are well outside professional football
    and have long historical roots” .

       5.69 One o f th& significant developments in Scottish football has been the emergence o f the so-called
    “ Casuals” . They were originally so named because o f their clothing. They originated in Aberdeen probably
    from copying the style o f som e English supporters and have now spread to a large number o f clubs. They
    attach themselves to a club and adopt its name. They are bent on fighting the opposition fans in order to
    enhance their own prestige.

      5.70 When I talked to Mr Coalter he was somewhat sceptical about the significance o f the “ Casuals’".
    Mr Coalter’s view was that they were comparatively unimportant, that the label was simply attached to
    them by the media and that they represented no more than a very small minority o f football supporters.
    The Casuals are however, in the view o f the police, a very real problem. They are well organised, appear
    to have money and cause a great deal o f trouble, particularly outside the football grounds.

      5.71 Other evidence I have received from responsible people tends to suggest that under whatever name
    they use, the Casuals are a greater problem than hitherto. They travel more widely, are very much better
    organised and tend to seek out their opponents in areas away from football grounds like city centres where
    the police are less prepared for them.

       5.72 The Dunfermline report goes on: “Surveys at the three Clubs demonstrate that the popular stereotype
    of football supporters as male working class adults is only partly true. Although still predominantly male the
    survey has revealed that the supporters at three Stadiums were predominantly in the younger age group (under
    30) in the skilled occupational groups, whether white-collar or blue-collar but with a significant proportion
    from the professional and intermediate white-collar occupations.” The Report points out a difference between
    Rangers, which attracts a high proportion o f the traditional or working class supporters, while at Aberdeen
    there is a significantly larger proportion o f white-collar workers.

I      5.73 The Report continues: “The analysis o f the data on arrests for football related offences confirms the
    conclusions o f the McEIhone Report that the number o f arrested per thousand spectators is extremely low.
    Moreover a small number of matches account for a large proportion of the total arrests and a large number
    of the arrests occur at games in which tensions are heightened by sectarian rivalries. The majority of offenders
    are arrested for forms of vocal aggression and the types o f offences commonly associated in the public mind
    with hooliganism - physical violence, damage to property, pitch invasions - form a relative small proportion
    of ,he total. As such it is argued that much of the disorder which does occur might more aptly be labelled
    rowdyism than hooliganism.” The Report continues: “Seating and segregation have in combination contributed
    to the reduction in level of crowd disorder within stadiums. The segregation of opposing fans within the ground
    is regarded by the police as perhaps the biggest single contribution in the reduction in crowd disorder.”

    • 5.74 The Dunfermline Study goes on to say that while the problem o f crowd disorder within stadia is
    largely contained, “if crowd disorder occurs it is more likely to occur outside the stadium after the game.
     Furthermore the offences committed outside the stadiums are more likely to be violent in nature than those
    inside. Ironically while solving crowd problems within stadiums, an unintended consequence o f the segregation
     of large crowds may be to provide the potential conditions for disorder outside the grounds. Segregated and
     coherent groups may provide the basis for the continuation of forms o f behaviour which while tolerated inside
     the ground, quickly become defined as unacceptable outside. Many o f the officers interviewed saw the major
    issue of football related crowd disorder as being the inconvenience to local residents and damage to property
     outside stadiums; however there was a recognition that given the random nature and geographical spread of
     many o f these incidents they pose a difficult problem to combat”.


                                                           57
Experience elsewhere
   5.75 The experience in America and elsewhere is not substantially different. Dr Goldstein, o f the
Department o f Psychology o f Temple University, Philadelphia, reviews (in “ Sports V iolence” 1), a series o f
articles by distinguished international experts, indicating that aggressive sports tend to increase not only
the aggression o f those who participate but o f also som e o f those who watch. The argument is that fans
who get caught up in outright violence do not seem to be psychologically different from m ost other fans,
but the one difference is that they are almost universally young men, some o f whom com e to sports events
in the hope o f a battle.

   5.76 On the question o f the relationship between aggression on the field and aggression o ff the field, the
emerging view was that the particularly brutal and angry aggression that is virtually an integral part o f
some forms o f competitive sport increases the likelihood o f imitative violence am ong crow ds dominated
by young adult males. One o f the articles suggests, for example, that anonymity and excitement allows fans
to put aside more readily the inhibitions that would keep them from being openly aggressive in other
situations. Violence on the playing field then holds out to them an example they are more likely to follow.
Drinking adds to that likelihood.

  5.77 In the articles there is also a good deal o f support for the view that “ perceived injustice” is an
important cause o f much violence am ong spectators. Put another way a spectator who thinks his team has
been unjustly treated will react violently and aggressively. Certainly, anyone who has been present at a
football match is well aware that the referee’s decision can give rise to considerable controversy, not only
among players on the field, but am ong spectators in the stands and on the terraces. Bad refereeing has
always led to problems on the field because players are only too ready to take advantage o f any weakness
they perceive, or alternatively to redress the balance o f what they perceive was an injustice by taking the
law into their own hands.

  5.78 There are, o f course, a great number o f well-documented outbreaks o f violence at sports grounds
which have resulted from a disputed decision by an official. For example on 24 May 1964 there was a
soccer match between Peru and Argentina. With two minutes left in the contest, Argentina was leading
1-0. Peru then scored. However, the goal was disallowed by the referee because o f rough play. Fans broke
onto the'field, the match was suspended, more fans crashed onto the field, the police fired revolvers and
tear gas and the crowd panicked. As a result o f the riot, som e 300 spectators were killed.

  5.79 The various types o f disorders are classified in “Sports Violence” into five major categories. They
are:
      1. Frustration disorders They occur when spectators’ expectations o f access to the game and the way it
         will be played or adjudicated are thwarted. Included in this is “ perceived injustice” when a source of
         frustration occurs as when fans believe that an incompetent or biased official has cost their team
         victory.
      2. Outlawry disorders They occur when groups of violence-prone spectators use sports events to act out
         their anti-social activities by attacking officials, fighting with rival fans and destroying property. Such
        • crowd violence is seen as the work of a delinquent or criminal element.
      3. Remonstrance disorders They occur when a section of a crowd uses a sports event as an arena for
         the expression of political grievances.
      4. Confrontation disorders They break out when spectators frojn rival religious, geographic, ethnic or
         national groups come into conflict. Given the appropriate circumstances, smouldering resentment can
         easily spark into open hostility, so that local Derby games where regional supremacy is at stake are
         an ideal setting for confrontation riots.
      5. Finally, there is what is called an expressive riot, which is the intense emotional arousal which
         accompanies victory or defeat, particularly if it is exciting or unexpected and uninhibited behaviour
         is then triggered.

  What is apparent from the above categorisation, it'is said, is that no single control measure could cope
with all the triggers o f disorder and that action which might be suitable for one situation could be
inappropriate in another.                                         .____________________________________ __

                                                                 58
Extreme Political Activity
   5.80 There is a substantial body o f evidence that political activists are present at football grounds in
England although it seems not to be a problem in Scotland. Football grounds are used in order to recruit
new members and leaflets are passed out. There is no doubt that at football grounds there are a number
o f people who belong to extreme political parties and they are there often in a group. Equally it is evident
that som e o f them take part in the disorders which occur.

   5.81 There is also widespread evidence o f the presence o f small groups o f National Front and similar
supporters at football matches, o f the giving o f Nazi salutes, o f the distribution o f literature and o f the
chanting o f racist slogans. They boast in their publications o f these activities. Further, a number o f their
supporters have been convicted o f criminal offences arising from the use o f violence at football grounds.
But that does not prove the assertion that it is they who are responsible for violence on the terraces. The
evidence which is available to me, from football clubs generally and from the police in all parts o f the
country, is that while they constitute a presence at a number o f football grounds where they recruit and
cause trouble by racist chanting, there is little to connect them with organised violence. The considered
view o f the police w £o spoke to me seems to be that their importance at football grounds is a self importance
and that they are not a significant factor in the problems with which I am dealing.

  5.82 That is not to say that anyone, particularly those with memories o f events since 1936, should take
a complacent attitude towards their activities. N or is it necessary to approve o f the contents o f their
magazines. However in the search for answers to trouble at football grounds, it is right that too much
importance should not be attached to their activities.

   5.83 This view is confirmed by the statistics in the report to my Inquiry prepared by Professor Canter.
He said: “ Where terracing is seen as the physical basis o f violence, political activities are seen as the social
cause. As with terraces, removing political activity would not solve the problem of football hooliganism.
However it is important to identify the extent o f any conscious involvement by such groups as the National
Front in crowd violence. We therefore asked a question carefully phrased to see if there were any direct
evidence for the involvement o f political groups as seen by our respondents and if there was any difference
between the clubs in this. After a general question on people’s thoughts we asked for any concrete evidence
that th ey m ig h t have ‘in their own experience.’ In effect we were asking almost one thousand witnesses
throughout the country whether they could give any first hand evidence to support the view that political groups
are involved in crowd trouble.” The question was: “ Do you think that organised political groups such as the
National Front are involved in crowd trouble?” The answers were:

                                                          Yes         No
                       Celtic                             39          61
                       Manchester United                  44          56
                       Tottenham Hotspur                  43          57
                       Chelsea                            65          35
                       Sunderland                         11          89
                       Millwall                           43          57
                       Fulham                             48 '        52
                       Southampton                        55          45
                       Preston                            49          51
                       Coventry                           38          62

   5.84 Professor Canter continues: “ W'hen it comes to actual evidence the picture becomes more hazy.
Although 162 of our respondents said they had direct evidence o f National Front involvement, closer examination
reveals that a number o f those based that on media reports. AH in all, about 10% o f our respondents appear
to have first hand knowledge o f National Front activities.”

  5.85 It is interesting to see what this “ political” group was actually doiag. Professor Canter's figures
show that 194 respondents had witnessed involvement and that 34 incidents involved either starting a fight
or fighting. However, Professor Canter reports that m ost o f those who said they saw fights were in fact
quoting media reports. The evidence o f these respondent makes it clear that the majority o f those involved
were distributing literature, chanting or making gestures or displaying or wearing signs or symbols.

  5.86 This sample accords with the other evidence which has been presented to me.
 Unemployment
     5.87      There have been a number o f suggestions that unemploym ent is the cause o f people being violent
  at football matches. One might certainly expect it to be so. T hose w ho have nothing to do to absorb their
' time and interest are those most likely to get up to mischief; they have not the dignity o f labour and the
  discipline o f the workplace. Historically, however, there is little evidence to support that view, nor is the
  statistical evidence clear. Surprisingly, such evidence as there is, is to the contrary— viz the absence o f any
  obvious increase o f violence in the 1930s when there was widespread unemployment; the increase o f football
  violence in the 1960s when there was little unemployment; the ability o f large numbers o f troublemakers
  to travel long distances at considerable expense; the recent use o f £1 coins as weapons; the wearing o f
  fashionable and expensive clothing; and the evidence relating to the employment o f those convicted. N or
 do any o f the football clubs or authorities, or the police, or the fans to w hom I have spoken give support
  to the theory. That a number o f unemployed behave like hooligans is undeniable— that they are hooligans
 simply because they are unemployed is not by any means clear.

M y own conclusions
 * 5.88 I must have read som e thirty or forty reports, studies or books, where an attempt has been made
to analyse the problem. I am certainly more knowledgeable on the subject o f football hooliganism. Whether
I am any wiser I doubt.                                                                      ^ ||

   5.89 I have had the opportunity m yself o f attending a number o f football matches incognito. I have
talked to fans on the terraces and observed their behaviour. I have discussed the problem with Professor
Canter, with Mr Coalter, with the Leicester sociologists, with groups o f football supporters, with the police
and football authorities and many other experienced observers.

   5.90 I am o f the view:
        I   (a) That there has always been a group, albeit a small group who find violence attractive; who
                currently find the football ground a convenient theatre for their violence and the football match
                the occasion for display o f their aggressive tendencies which on other days and at other times
                they will be exhibiting in public houses, the city centre or elsewhere. Their main target at
             »' football grounds is opposing fans. They choose to exercise that violence at a football match
                for a number of simple reasons. The date and place o f a match are fixed; the nature o f the
                opposition is known; its presence is certain, so is that o f the police. Their own support is
                known. Its presence too is certain. The battle lines can be drawn. Thus plans can be made well
                in advance for the particular acts of violence that they intend to create.
            (b) And while there is a good deal o f academic support for the view that violence was at one time
                the prerogative of the so called “ rough” working class that is no longer the complete picture
                today. A majority of today’s hooligans no doubt do fit into that category, but some do i^ t.
                They come from a variety o f backgrounds, many have reasonable jobs and earn a proper l i ^ | .
            (c) Whether they are motivated by the same reasons as their predecessors can only be a matter
                o f conjecture; there seems little reason however to believe otherwise.
       II   (a) A second group imitates the first element I have identified. Thus those not particularly given
                to violence witness violence in others and see it being exercised, without let or hinderance.
                People expect the spectators on the terraces to behave in an aggressive way and to use foul
                language. It then becomes accepted and the norm and thus becomes a part of the pattern o f
                life which would not be tolerated elsewhere. This knock-on effect can be seen in violence in
                the streets o f our cities, unconnected with football.
            (b) The feeling o f anonymity in the crowd gives rise to a loss o f inhibition and self-discipline. The
                association with those o f similar disposition, the enthusiasm and the partisan support for the
                team, which itself causes an atmosphere, all create a situation which can readily give rise to
                violence.

      III       Then there is a third group (not always separate from the other two groups) who cause violence
                for a reason, either real or supposed. It may be an inability quickly to get into the ground; it
                may be the presence o f rival spectators in a part o f the' ground to which the fans think they
                have a claim.

      IV        Finally there are those, the vast majority o f spectators, who abhor violence and wish only for
                an afternoon o f pleasure at a football match.


                                                       60
      5.91 Whether it is ever possible, by altering in som e way the structure o f society, so that there are not
    people to w hom violence is 'o f itself attractive, has given rise to considerable debate. There are, o f course,
    very many factors which cause a person to have an aggressive disposition. Heredity and environment are
    such uncertain barometers o f interaction that it is too simple to say, improve the environment and violence
    will disappear. Neither o f course should be ignored.-

      5.92 I have therefore sadly to conclude that there has always been violence in the world and that there
    always will be violence; and that however close social scientists get to determining the true cause o f violence
    on the football terraces, no complete cure can be prescribed, even for the very long term.

       5.93 It is clear however that there are a considerable number o f preventive measures at sports grounds
    which can properly and reasonably be taken. These I have set out in Chapter 4 o f this Report. By taking
    proper preventive measures it may be possible to stop violence inside a sports ground. So far as violence
    generally is concerned, I w ould like to be able to say there is a simple cure. There is not. It would be doing
    a grave disservice to suggest otherwise.

    Postscript         t
      5.94 I do not pretend that my Report can be all embracing or provide a simple solution to a complex
    problem. There is no panacea. There is no one solution to the problem o f violence. M ore particularly it is
    to be hoped that if violence within the football ground is contained, it will not re-emerge elsewhere. I
    confess I do not feel sanguine about that.

      5.95 I trust that by publicly canvassing the problems which affect the game, -both in my Reports and
    during the course o f the Inquiry and also by stimulating discussions, at all levels, both inside and outside
    the game, it may be possible for solutions to emerge so that the national game can regain som e o f its
    former glory. N o r should we ever forget the tragic events which gave rise to my Reports.

       5.96 Although this is my Final Report, the problems o f football will continue long after I have returned
    to the more familiar and less turbulent routine o f my judicial duties. I therefore leave my task adopting
    the words o f Matthew Arnold:

_                                  .. “ Peace, Peace is what I seek and public calm;
                                          Endless extinction o f unhappy hates.”

    page 73* It should be emphasised from the outset that it was the British supporters who mounted the
             disastrous charge into Section Z. They bear the main responsibility for the terrible events that
             followed and this must remain the case whatever blame might be attributed to others for having
             aggravated the matter.

             There is absolutely no doubt but that the organisers, the R B F A and U E F A were familiar with
             the usual behaviour o f the English supporters. This is all the more clear from the fact that people
             were sufficiently concerned for the Brussels Police to send a representative to Liverpool to assess
             the situation. The gendarmerie, who were also invited, did not consider it necessary to send a
             representative.

             The Board o f Liverpool FC has made known that it took a number o f precautions . . . The Club
             made reassuring statements confirming that its supporters were amongst the most placid in Great
             Britain and that, moreover, the Club could identify all the ticket holders.

             The British Transport Police representatives gave the same kind o f reassurance . . . Moreover,
             the R B F A the evening before the match made statements to the same effect and confirmed that
             the match had been perfectly well organised.

             It is nevertheless true that despite the reassuring statements made by U E F A , who should have
             been and perhaps were better informed o f the realities o f the matter and despite the precautions
             taken . . . som e English supporters or so called supporters (a limited number, it is true) became
0           a murderous rabble.


             T H E O R G A N IS E R S O F T H E M ATCH

             (a)   Organisation o f the match '                                         -

            It is important to recall that the duty placed on the R B F A and, beyond them U E F A , was to
            guarantee the safety o f spectators and in this context it was their responsibility to take the
            necessary precautions and in particular apply the U E F A rules. H ow ever, both the R B FA
            and U E F A seemed m ore concerned with financial and commercial considerations than safety
            precautions.

page 74     The ticket sales . . . got completely out o f hand. It has been established that a large number o f
            tickets for Section Z (a neutral zone where there should under no circumstances have been any
            Italian supporters) were sold to Italians . . . large quantities o f tickets were sold to travel agents,
            football clubs and others without their having been asked to give any written guarantee whatever
            that they would not sell tickets to Italians. The sale o f tickets at Heysel Stadium (theoretically
            restricted to five tickets per person) was organised in such a way that anyone, including Italians,
            could get tickets for Section Z without any problems at all. This is in contravention not only o f
            U E F A directives but also contrary to the arrangements agreed before the match. Such a procedure
‘ References to pages are to pages in the House of Representative document 1232 (1984-5),'1-2


                                                                71
         was bound to create a black market.

         The next point is the requirement to separate opposing supporters within the stadium. There is
         a specific U E F A ruling on this.

         It is clear that natural animosity developed into altercations, fights and charges; the third o f these
         had tragic consequences and could no doubt have been avoided had there not been so many
         Italian supporters in Section Z. It is clear that the ticket sales organised by the R B F A were a
         decisive element in this and they are to blame in that respect.

         This, together with the absence o f an adequate buffer zone . . . as well as the weakness o f the
         fencing separating Sections Z and X - Y , meant that the safety precautions were even less effective.

         It is amazing that knowing about the significance o f the black market, the organisers did not
         warn the forces o f law and order o f the potential danger.

             .*It was decided to create an enclosed area around the outside o f the stadium using Heras
          fencing. The idea was in fact to operate a kind o f filtering procedure which would allow spectators
          to be searched as soon as they went through into the enclosures. In fact the fencing proved totally
          inadequate and in so far as it could be considered as much a psychological as a physical barrier,
          the fact was that it could not fulfill this function. It would have been more helpful to have
          passageways or gangways which could have allowed spectators to be shepherded.

          The way in which the match was organised testifies to routine and a lack o f seriousness. A number
          o f ambiguous decisions were taken . . . the R F B A preparations for the match were too informal,
          no prior agenda for meetings; no regular membership; no minutes. Even if it was only some o f
          the decisions which were ambiguous, it remains the case that, for example, failure to decide clearly
          how the gangways between the sections should have been set up and manned was one o f the
          causes o f the tragedy.

          (b) Lessors and owners o f the stadium
page 75 . . . The condition o f the stadium appeared dilapidated on the occasion o f our v is it . . . structures
          were deteriorating, columns, crash-barriers and steps. It is also clear that the terracing itself had
          been neglected and had not been the subject o f the kind o f normal maintenance work which is
          required in a stadium o f this size. This made it easy for the supporters to obtain missiles.
          M oreover, the narrowness o f the gangways and o f the few entrances ait the top o f the stadium,
          as well as the fact that there were only three exits at the bottom , caused problems when it came
          to evacuation.

          These problems were exacerbated by the fact that the lower gates could only be opened from the
          pitch side. According to the organisers and the forces o f law and order, the intention was to
          make it possible for evacuation to take place in the event o f trouble while allowing the forces o f
          law and order to intervene as necessary. . . .

          It seems surprising that the general regulations relating to safety at work should not be applicable
          in this instance. I f this is the case, then they should be applied . . . certain basic facilities were
          lacking. There were only a few fixed telephones, which is inexcusable. It is essential' that it
          gatherings on this scale are to be organised there should be an on-the-spot com m and post where
          the organisers and forces o f law and order can meet. . . .

           It is reasonable to emphasise the responsibilities o f U E F A in this respect. In February 1985, the
           organisation was content to devote less than an hour to the inspection o f the stadium and di
           not comment on its condition.

          The Authorities
           A. The local police
           Precautions made
           It is part o f the duty o f the police to implement the provisions o f the docum ent “Crowd Violence


                                                        72
          at Sports G rounds” . . . . This document, drawn up at the suggestion o f the R B F A , in consultation
          with the police was issued by the Ministry o f the Interior in the form o f guidance on the 17th
          February 1974. It would not appear that the police took any measures to implement the provisions
          o f this document. . . .

page 77   Specific preparations
          The police took part in preparatory meetings. . . . On the occasion o f these meetings, those
          involved apparently discussed all the measures to be taken at the ground as well as transport,
          the arrival o f the supporters, the sale o f tickets, liaison and co-ordination o f the activities o f the
          police and the gendarmerie, all organisation o f parking facilities, organisation o f emergency
          services and sale o f alcoholic drinks.

          . . . the emergency services were not specifically invited to these meetings, nothing was said about
          the condition o f the stadium and again no minutes were taken setting out the decisions which
          had been reached during the meetings.

          . . . the reports on these meetings were drawn up in retrospect: there is no way to be sure o f the
          number o f participants, their rank, their precise identity or what they said . . .

          The day o f the 29th May 1985
page 78   . . ' There was fighting in the streets from the morning onwards. This fighting was caused by
          persons under the influence o f alcohol. The police decided to limit their interventions in order to
          avoid more serious trouble. . . . N othing was done to curb the consum ption o f alcoholic drinks
          on the public highway or the sale o f the same.

          One is entitled to question whether everything necessary was done to prevent the troubles which
          occurred later.

          Heras fencing had been erected around the stadium but this perimeter fence was not sufficiently
          well supervised . . .

  -—• The police arrived at the stadium in good time, they were nonetheless unable to carry out a
         complete search o f the spectators because o f a shortage o f men (only forty available). Confiscated
         items could not be kept away from the supporters because o f a lack o f containers. Efforts were
         made to compensate for this by collecting confiscated items by van.

          Fifty men were placed between Sections M, N - 0 but they were forced to retreat at about 6.30
          pm because o f the agression o f the Italian supporters. The gangways were so structured that it
          was not possible to keep officers on the steps.

          The police could not prevent supporters from invading the pitch. Lumps o f concrete torn from
          the structure o f the stadium and missiles caused enormous problems. (27 police were injured).

          The police com m unications system worked well. The police did what was necessary to maintain
          adequate liaison with the gendarmerie.

          B. The Burghermaster
          The Burghermaster has a general responsibility to maintain law and order in his area and he is
          also chief o f the local police . . . This applied as much in the city on the 28 and 29 M ay as in the
          stadium when the events took'place.'

          A s to the condition o f the stadium, this being the property o f Brussels City Council, it was for
          the City Council to deal with its maintenance and also to ensure that all the fencing provided
          was strong enough to serve the required purpose.

          C. The Gendarmerie
          1.   The so-called advance measures
page 79   . . . So far as the docum ent entitled “ Crowd Violence at Sports Grounds* which the gendarmerie
          adapted as a General Order, it appears that three points were not dealt with:
          Examination o f the ground,


                                                        73
               It should be pointed out that Captain Mahieu had not been invited to any o f the meetings in
               question.

               4. Action within the stadium
     page 81   . . . no member o f the gendarmerie v/ho participated in the preparatory meeting was present at
               the Heysel Stadium on the day o f the match . . . the Commission considered whether it would
               be appropriate to establish a command post at the stadium or even two, one inside one outside.
               A lthough the Commission did not feel qualified to form a judgment on this, it considers that the
               point should be made.

               5.   Divisions of tasks within the squadron
               The Com m ission regrets that within A lpha Squadron there was no precise division o f tasks
               between the Commander and his deputy. It was obvious that at certain times both officers were
               together inside the stadium and at other times they were together outside the stadium.

               This was all the more unacceptable because o f the inadequacy o f the radio communications.

               The provisions o f messengers seems to have made up in some degree for the radio communication
               problems referred to below but according to the witness, these messengers could not in any event
               fulfill their purpose because o f the density o f the crowd.




     page 82   6.   Communications arrangements and equipment
               . . . numerous means o f communicating information were provided.

               There were communication links between the Special Branch and the com m and post, and between
               the police and the gendarmerie both inside and outside the stadium. In addition to these, radio
               contact between police and gendarmerie was assured by liaison officers at HQ, the com m and post
               and at the ground. In the end, this adds up to an unwieldy system. Perhaps this is the price to
               be paid for trying to ensure that two separate forces, the police and the gendarmerie, worked
               together w ithout losing their separate identities.

               Com m unications between the Special Branch and the command post did not operate well . . .
               the poor condition o f the equipment was mainly to blame. But it is also probable that the Special
               Branch was not properly briefed.

               A t the gendarmerie headquarters, messages are recorded by a shorthand writer, who typed the
               messages as they were received. It would appear that the messages were recorded only selectively.

               Com m unications between the platoons and their commanding officer did not take place under
               ideal conditions; the Captain commanding in the stadium went outside. N o com m unication was
               possible with him thereafter and this at the very time when the tragedy occurred.

               Even when the radios were working, their effectiveness was reduced by the ambient noise level.
               The gendarmerie must have known this would happen. One must ask why messengers were not
               used for these communications.

               It is clear from witness statements that communications between the com m and post and the
               stadium w»re not operating properly . . . this means that at a time when it would have been
               useful to call in reserves, the command post was not receiving sufficiently precise information
               from the stadium.

               There are several statements about the state o f the equipment. General Bernaert said that the
               sets were good quality ones but that there was trouble with th; cadmium nickel batteries. The
               batteries were old and, moreover, were not properly used.

               . . . insufficient attention was paid to checking whether those using the equipment were doing so
               in the correct manner.

Chairman

W O R K IN G G R O U P O N T H E G R E E N G U ID E
   E i. Shortly after publication o f your Interim Report you asked me to establish a Working Group o f
appropriately qualified scientifical and technical persons w ho had practical experience o f safety at sports
grounds to assist the Inquiry in its task o f reviewing the H om e Office Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
(the “ Green G uide”). A s you know, and with the kind cooperation o f the H om e Office, Scottish Office,
Department o f Environment, local authority associations and technical consultants to the Inquiry, I was
able to form such a group and this met for a full week (23-28 September) under my Chairmanship.

  E2. Our terms o f reference were: “To review the H om e Office Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
(Football) - “ the Green G uide” - and to make recommendations to the Committee o f Inquiry on Crowd
Safety and Control at Sports Grounds as to amendments or additions considered necessary to the Green
Guide published in 1976.” A record o f the membership o f the Group appears later in this appendix.

   E 3.1 am pleased to be able to report that the Working G roup completed its work satisfactorily and that
it was found possible on the final day o f the G roup’s week to reach general agreement on the various
recommendations for changes which we wished to see made to the Guide. I have since prepared a self-
contained note o f these points and have put the G roup’s deliberations into ih e form o f recommendations
for you. This note is set out below for your consideration. I support these recommendations.

   E4. A s you will see there are, in total, some 63 recommendations. This should not be taken in any way,
however, as an adverse judgment upon the current Guide. The substantive advice in the Guide stood up
remarkably well to a week o f detailed scrutiny by experts and fully justifies the high esteem and confidence
in which it is generally - and internationally - held.

   E5. It remains only for me to record my gratitude to the members o f the G roup who gave up so much
o f their valuable time to assist the Committee in its task; to my fellow Assessor, Mr Alan G oodson, for
his encouragement, support and practical advice throughout the week; and to Mr Mark de Pulford for his
excellent work as Secretary.

                                                                                     M A R T IN K IL L O R A N
                                                                                Fire Assessor to the Inquiry


                                     R EPORT A N D R E C O M M E N D A T IO N S

         S T R U C T U R E O F THE G R E E N G U ID E

             E6. The Working Group was dissatisfied with the structure o f the current Guide and recom­
Rec 1     mends that the Green Guide should be reorganised so as to reflect more closely the needs of its
          target audience. (The Group agreed that the target audience o f the Guide comprises: (a) sports
          ground management in designated and undesignated grounds; (b) engineers, designers and others
         engaged in the improvement, design appraisal or refurbishment o f sports stadia to certificable
         standards; and (c) local authorities responsible for enforcing the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act
          1975.) The Group considered that, following a general introduction which describes the scope o f
         the Guide, sets the scene and briefly discusses the nature, and extent o f risks to the public at
         sports grounds, the guidance should be re-arranged so as to deal first with general management
         responsibilities and major planning and design matters. (Guidance on these matters should, where
         practicable, include methods for assessing the general safety condition o f a ground and. the need
         for detailed drawings and plans.) The succeeding categories o f detailed guidance should each be
         preceded by a statement o f the general functional requirement or aim and should include as much
         appraisal, flow and other diagrams as may conveniently be arranged. The Group considered that
         a possible scheme for the categories o f advice in the Green G uide was: Fire (to include a checklist
         and appraisal flow diagram and reference to the need for professional advice). Structural Appraisal
         (to include a method for appraising existing structures and reference to the need for professional
         advice). Ground Control and Ground Management (to identify responsibilities and duties), and
         Inspections, Tests and Maintenance.


                                                      77
Rec 2     E7. The Group also recommends that consideration should be given to the production by the
        Home Office, or other appropriate body, of summary documents, training aids and seminars for
        sports ground management explaining the provisions o f the Green Guide and their application.

        IN T R O D U C T IO N
          E8. The current Guide is aimed at soccer and rugby grounds (G G (Green Guide. 1976 Edition,
        paragraph): 1:1).


            The Group decided that many o f the recommendations in the Green Guide are relevant to
Rec 3     outdoor sports other than football and recommends that the Introduction should say that the
        . Guide is applicable as a code of good practice for all sports grounds. The Green Guide should
Rec 4     make it clear, however, that it does not cover measures to ensure the safety of spectators from
        hazards presented by the sport itself.

           E9. The Group noted that the references in the Guide to the Building Regulations for England
        and Wales would need to be revised and brought up to date. It was further noted that in Scotland,
        the Building Standards (Scotland) Regulations gave requirements fo r the construction, alteration,
        extension and change o f use o f buildings, and included standards in respect o f means o f escape
        from fire including emergency lighting, access for fire-fighters as well as structural fire precautions.
        The Group recommends that full account should be taken o f national Building Regulations in
        the Green Guide.

        ID E N T IF IC A T IO N O F PROBLEM S
          E10. The current Guide discerns three particular types o f safety problem to be considered
        within a football ground and its immediate surroundings (GG: 2.1 to 2.4): (a) those physical
        hazards which may cause individuals to trip, slip or fall; (b) crowd pressures which may be built
        up in normal circumstances (particularly on terraces and exit routes); and (c) crowd pressures
        which may be built up under abnormal conditions. The Group considered that this analysis was
        correct. However, it felt that the need to tackle these problems should be covered in a new self-
        contained section defining, in general terms, good safety design in sports stadia and enumerating
        other important needs such as managing and controlling crowds, maintaining effective fire
        precautions, making proper provision for the disabled and achieving a reasonable standard o f
Rec 5   comfort and convenience for spectators. Accordingly, the G roup recommends the incorporation
        of a new self-contained section on good safety design in sports stadia.

        G E N E R A L C O N ST R U C T IO N
           E l 1. The current Guide recommends that all com ponents and installations should be designed,
        constructed, installed and maintained so as “ to perform safely their required functions ’ and that
        they should be in accordance with good engineering and building practice, especially as set out
        in all revelant British Standards and Codes o f Practice (GG: 3.1).

          The Group approved this recommendation but felt that the reference to British Standards
        might be improved so as to identify those parts o f British Standards which are wholly applicable
Rec 6   in the circumstances o f the case. The Group recommends that references in the Guide to British
        Standards should be improved accordingly.
          E l 2. The current Guide recommends that all electrical installations should comply with the
        current edition o f the regulations o f the Institution o f Electrical Engineers (GG: 3.2). The Group
Rec 7   considered that it would be reasonable in som e circumstances for the enforcing authority to accept
        a certificate of satisfaction from a chartered electrical engineer in lieu offull compliance with current
        IEE Regulations and recommends that the Guide so advises. The Group also recommends a
Rec S   reference to BS 5266: Pt 1 in respect o f emergency lighting.
          E l 3. The current Guide recommends that all parts o f the ground used by the general public
        should have a minimum headroom o f 2.4 metres (GG: 3.5).

           The Group could find no clear foundation for this advice and, accordingly, recommends that
Rec 9    in respect o f headroom the Guide should simply advise conformity to appropriate building regulations.

                                                      78
               INSPECTIONS A N D TESTS
                 E l 4. The current Guide recommends:
                 (i) A detailed annual inspection to ensure compliance with the Green Guide (GG: 4.1);
                (ii) A general visual inspection following each event for damage which might create a potential
                     hazard (GG: 4.2); and,
                (iii) Testing o f crush barriers in accordance with the Guide on installation and subsequently,
                      normally, at intervals o f several years (GG: 4.3).

   Rec 10        The Group recommends that the routine general visual inspection by management advised in the
               Guide should also cover features which might reduce the degree o f fire protection offered and that
   Rec 11      there should also be a warning in the Guide against storing hazardous materials under or near stands.
   Rec 12      The Group also recommends that consideration should be given to the inclusion o f additional
               guidance to certifying authorities as to the frequency and content o f inspections.
   Rec 13        E l 5. The Group recommends that        regular emergency evacuation drills for members of staff
               shoidd be recommended in the Guide.
                  E16. On the testing o f crush barriers (GG: 4.3 and Appendix C o f the Guide) the Group had
               before it no evidence that the current guidance had permitted dangerous or defective crush
               barriers. However, it seemed to a minority o f the Group that certain anomalies exist in the current
               recommendations in the Green Guide as to load factors and testing (for example the table o f
               strengths for new crush barriers permitted a different design strength for the bars and posts than
               for the foundations); and there was som e evidence that enforcing authorities were unclear as to
   Rec 14      the correct procedures. The Group recommends that representatives of the local authorities, the
               Home Office and appropriately qualified advisers should, together, review the Guide's recommenda­
               tions on the design and testing o f crush barriers in more detail with a view to clarifying the guidance
               in future editions o f the Guide (see also paragraph 28 below).

   Rec 15       E17. The Group further recommends that the Guide should advise that                any automatic fire
   _________ protection equipment or emergency lighting system should be tested regularly          in accordance with
               relevant British Standard codes o f practice.-

               IN G R ESS TO TH E G R O U N D
                 E l 8. The Guide currently recommends that the number and location o f turnstiles should be
               planned to achieve the smallest crowd waiting for admission that is consistent with the rate at
               which spectators can be distributed inside the ground (GG: 5.1). The Group recommends that
   Rec 16      more detailed guidance to management as to contingency planning in the event o f unusual pressures
               and frustrations (including a reference to the value o f centralised computer-based monitoring)
^ ^ t e c 17   should be given. The Group further recommends that the Guide emphasise that turnstiles are not
               acceptable as a means o f escape from a ground.
                                                                                                               9

                  E l 9. The Group considered it desirable that the Guide should specify a notional maximum
   Rec 18      free flow rate past a turnstile. The Group recommends that further consideration be given to
               defining a maximum notional flow rate past turnstiles for incorporation in a future edition o f the
               Green Guide.
                 E20. The Guide currently recommends that fences forming the boundary to a ground should
               be o f “ appropriate height and strength” to avoid spectators gatecrashing (GG: 5.2). The Group
   Rec 19      recommends that boundary walls and gates and any other structure forming part of the boundary
               should also be of appropriate height and strength to avoid gatecrashing.

               EGRESS FRO M T H E G R O U N D
                 E21. Currently, Section 6 o f the Guide makes a number o f general recommendations as to
               egress from a sports grounds (GG: 6.1 to 6.13). The Group was generally content with these but
               recommends that the wording in paragraph 6.13 o f the Guide should be revised to piake it clear
   Rec 20,     that escape routes are not to be regarded as an alternative provision only for use in emergency. The
   Rec 21      Group further recommends that guidance should be included to the effect that doors on exit



                                                            79
Rec 22    routes should always open outwards; and that, where practicable, exit gates should be sited adjacent
          to entrances.

Rec 23       E22. The Group recommends Thai a study should be undertaken of the current use and effectiveness
          o f the exit route signposting and exit marking systems recommended in the Green Guide ( GG: 6.6),
          and that consideration should be given to commissioning further research in this area.

          TERRACES A N D STANDS

          Safe capacity o f terraces
              E23. The Guide currently suggests that the exits from each areas o f spectator accom m odation
           should be so designed that the spectator can leave that area in eight minutes or less (GG: 6.5).
Rec 24     The G roup concluded that this so-called "eight minute rule" was concerned solely with the effect
           o f crowd turbulence (arising from delays in evacuating specator accom m odation) on the rate of
          flow. It was not related to emergency evacuation time criteria (see paragraph 32 below) and the
           G roup recommends that the Guide should make this clear.
                s

          Terrace packing densities
           - E24. The Guide recommends packing densities between the limits o f 27 and 54 persons per
          10m2 depending on the condition o f the terrace or slope and on the extent to which crush barriers
          conform to the Green Guide guidelines on spacing (GG: 15.4). Recom m ended flow rates from
          the terraces are given at paragraph 16 o f the Guide.

            The Group concluded that the flow rates and permissible spectator densities in the Guide were
          satisfactory and reasonable when taken as a whole and that they accorded with experience.
Rec 25    However, the Group recommends that flow rate and packing criteria and their relationship (if
          any) with those criteria given in respect of emergency evacuation and crowd turbulences should be
          set out and explained more clearly in the Guide and that further advice should be given as to how
          interpolation between the wide limits suggested in respect o f terrace packing densities may properly
Rec 26    be carried out. The Group further recommends that consideration be given to the possibility of a
          separate detailed study of the possible casualties which might be attributable to high packing
          densities.

          Terrace steps and viewing slopes
             E25. The G roup was content with the G uide’s recommendations in respect o f terrace steps and
Rec 27    viewing slopes (GG: 7.4). The Group recommends, however, that the surfaces of terrace steps and
Rec 28    viewing slopes should be even as well as non-slip and that the way in which the maximum desirable
          gradient is specified in the Guide should be improved.

          Terrace gangways
            E26. The Guide states that the aim in respect o f terrace gangways should be to ensure that
          every spectator on a terrace is within 12 metres o f a gangway or o f an exit. (GG: 7.5). The Guide
          further indicates that gangways should be sunk.
            The G roup felt that although these recommendations were generally satisfactory', reasons
          should be given for the basic aim stated in paragraph 7.5 o f the Guide. Furthermore, it would
Rec 29    be preferable to state the safety objective behind the current recommendation to sink gangways so
          that it could be met in other ways. The Group recommends accordingly.

          Division o f spectator accommodation
            E27. The Guide currently recommends the division o f a ground into sections to prevent major
          migrations by spectators, and into sub-sections to minimise the sway and surge o f spectators
          (GG: 7.6). T he Group recommends that the Guide should limit the application o f its guidance on
          segregation to terraces at football grounds (See recommendation 57 below).

          Crush barriers and other physical restraints on movements
Rec 30,     E28. The Group recommends that the Guide should should explain that         brick walls and similar

                                                      80
                     structures lacking mass or tensile strength are poorly suited to withstand horizontal pressures and
          Rec 31     that the Guide should strongly recommend regular structural appraisal by appropriately qualified
          Rec 32     personnel. The G roup also recommends that consideration should be given to mounting a more
                     detailed review o f current literature on the strength o f crush barriers and the effects o f the various
                     types of loading that might be applied to them (see also paragraph 16 above).
          Rec 33       The Group further recommends that the aim of the guidance on migrations be restated as "to
                     prevent potentially hazardous migrations” rather than mass migrations as currently indicated in
                     the Guide. (See also paragraph 43 below).

                     PITCH PE R IM ET ER FENCES
                       E29. The advice on pitch perimeter fences in the current Guide deals mainly with the crush
                     barrier aspects (GG: 7.9). Access to playing pitches and the need for “ anti-hooligan” or other
                     protective devices is however, referred to in the section on crowd behaviour (GG: 18).

          Rec 34        Th% Group recommends that the Guide should explain more clearly, preferably by reference to
                     standardised specifications, the different functions perimeter fencing may serve and that appropriate
                     cross referencing is incorporated in any future edition o f the Guide. The Group further recom­
          Rec 35     mends that the importance of allowing full access to the pitch where this is likely to be used as a
                     place of safety in emergency should be made plain. (It was noted that Scottish Building Regulations
                     required that protected zones such as stairways led to a place o f safety, ie a unenclosed space in
                     the open air at ground level or an enclosed space in the open air at ground level with access (of
                     defined widths) to an unenclosed space. A pitch could be accepted as a place o f safety only if it
                     met that requirement. If, however, it was subsequently fenced off, circumstances could arise,
                     under Scottish Building Regulations, where a change o f use would be deemed to have taken
                     place.)

                     ST A IR W A Y S A N D R A M PS
         Rec 36        E30. The Group recommends that the current guidance on stairways and ramps (GG: 9) should
                     contain appropriate cross references to advice on egress from the ground (GG: 6). The Group
-   -   ' Rec 37-    further recommends that the Guide should advise that, ideally, the rising and going of steps should
                     be uniform throughout an entire escape system. A minority o f the Group felt that the method o f
                     calculation for access to stairways (GG: 9.4.5) o f the Guide was anom alous and should be
                     reviewed.

                     FIR E PR E C A U T IO N S
                       E31. Guidance on fire precautions is currently contained in section 10 o f the Green Guide. It
                     covers a variety o f important matters including fire resistance, emergency lighting and fire-fighting
                     equipment.

                       The Group was not wholly satisfied with the general advice on fire precautions offered by the
         Rec 38,    Guide. So far as existing structures were concerned, the Group recommends that detailed advice
                    should be given on means of reducing the rate of fire growth in existing stands. The Group believes
                    that consideration should be given to incorporating appropriate references to recent work in this
                    area commissioned by the Inquiry from the Fire Research Station. In particular, the Group
         Rec 39     recommends that the Guide should emphasise the hazards o f developedfires breaking into spectator
                    accommodation and the consequent need for fire separation under stands to be imperforate. In
         Rec 40     addition, the dangers of fire spread across adjoining stands should be emphasised and half-hour fire
                    resistance might need to apply to vertical sections dividing spectator accom m odation from other
                    areas.

                    Evacuation times

                        E32. On notional emergency evacuation times, the Guide currently recommends interpolation
                     between 2} and 8 minutes, with the higher figure applying where a stand is o f non-combustible
                    'fire resisting structure and presents generally a low fire risk (GG: 8.3).

                       The Group was satisfied that there was no case for reducing the 2\ minutes lower evacuation
                    time as recommended in the Guide. The lesson o f Bradford was the need for adequate measures
                    to inhibit the rate o f fire development and spread and to improve the efficiency o f fire procedures


                                                                 81
          rather than to stipulate more stringent criteria in respect o f notional values. However, represen­
          tatives o f the Fire Research Station felt that the 2+ minutes should be regarded as a maximum;
          they believed that although individual circumstances might conceivably justify increasing the
          figure, it was not currently possible to assign quantitative values to active or passive fire protection
          measures with sufficient precision to enable specific relaxations to be advocated in the Guide with
          any degree o f confidence. A majority o f the Group believed that the notional 8 minutes upper
          limit indicated in the Guide, although lacking any very clear or relevant technical rationale, was
          reasonable and should be retained. Nevertheless, it was the firm view o f a minority including Mr
          Platt that 8 minutes is too long a period to allow for the evacuation o f any stand under emergency
          conditions and that, although relaxation o f the 2£ minutes figure might be reasonable in individual
          circumstances, it would be misleading to specify an upper limit in the Green Guide.


            T he consensus was that the enforcing authority should decide on relaxations in the light o f
          professional experience and individual safety circumstances o f a particular ground, but that the
Rec 4 f   Green Guide should offer more guidance as to what latitude was permissible on evacuation times
          and the circumstances to take into account. In particular, the Green Guide should emphasise that
          escape routes should be designed or chosen so that they provide progressive reduction in difficulty
          or danger to people using them and regard should be had to the likely accumulation o f smoke and
Rec 42    combustion products in those routes. The Group recommends that consideration should be given
          to devising a more scientific method for assessing the evacuation o f a stand under emergency
          conditions.
          Fire protection and fire-fighting equipment

Rec 43      E33. The Group considered that there was currently insufficient evidence as to the value for life
          safety o f automatic fire protection equipment for the Green Guide to encourage trade-offs between
          such equipment and structural fire protection measures. A n y implications that such trade-offs
          were permissible should be removed from the current Guide (eg GG: 10.2). A majority o f the
          G roup rejected also the idea that the Green Guide should suggest similar relaxations where
          management expertise and vigilance were at a high level.


Rec 44      On fire detection and fire-fighting equipment, the G roup recommends that reference should be
          made to relevant British Standards such as BS 5839: Part 1, BS 5306: Parts I and 3 and BS 5423.
          T he Group considered that it was an inefficient and undesirable use o f resources for manned fire
          appliances to attend all matches.


             E34. On roof venting, the Group felt that with som e stand roof configurations, appropriate
          venting and curtaining arrangements might offer a means o f reducing the spread o f fire. It was
          agreed however that the science o f fire and sm oke venting was highly complex and that it uMfc
          not appropriate for the G uide.to offer more than a general reference to the issue. However, M P
Rec 45    G roup felt that some advice on roof venting should be offered in the Green Guide along the lines
          o f that proposed by the Fire Research Station in work com m issioned by the Inquiry. It was
          agreed that the priority in the Guide was to recommend effective fire precautions relating to the
          early stages o f a fire.

          Access for emergency vehicles

            E35. The Group agreed that the Guide’s recom m endations as to access for emergency vehicles
          (GG: 11.30) Were soundly based. It was noted that the Interim Report recommendation that
          vehicular parking be banned within quarter o f a mile o f a sports ground (when it was in. use) had
Rcc 46    been made on a “where practicable” basis. The Group recommends that the qualification “where
          necessary” should be added to the current Guide s recommendations on access for emegency vehicles.

          Hazardous materials

             E36. The consensus was that it was not practicable for the Guide*to offer detailed a.dvice on
          fire spread hazards associated with particular materials. Nevertheless, the G roup recommends
Rec 47    that consultation with expert fire advisers should be indicated in the Guide where substantial use
          of, for example, polymer seating is contemplated or o f artificial pitches where forward escape onto
          the pitch might be necessary. (See also recom m endation 35 above).

                                                        82
           C O M M U N IC A T IO N S
           E37. The Green Guide currently recommends that precise requirements for communications
         within a particular ground be determined after consultation with the police (GG: 17). The Guide
         goes on to give examples o f the arrangements likely to be needed at larger grounds. The Group
         considered that this advice and the way in which it was expressed was generally satisfactory.
 Rec 48, However, the Group recommends that the advice as to central control points should not be confined
 Rec 49 to the largest grounds and that the Guide should emphasise the need for ground management and
 Rec 50 responsibility to be centralised accordingly. The Group also believed that it would be desirable in
           larger grounds if public address systems permitted messages to be directed towards specific zones
           o f the ground. The Group recommends, accordingly.

               E38. On emergency audible alarms, the use o f coded messages found little support in the
            Group. The need was rather to communicate essential information effectively to the crowd. For
 Rec 51    that purpose, a clear system of communications covering all the various conceivable crises, including
            the facility to stop the event, should be devised in consultation with the emergency services. The
            Group recommends that guidance to this effect should be incorporated in the Green Guide.
            Further study was required before pre-set formulae messages could be recommended in the Guide.
            However, it was clear that such messages should be in the active mode, that they should be
            directed towards persons from whom a response is required, and that they should be delivered
 Rec 52    authoritatively by trained controllers. The Group considered that there was a need for standard
           guidance covering the use o f public address systems for emergency purposes. The Group recommends
           that consideration be given to this.

              E39. The Group considered that the development and operational experience o f closed circuit
           television (CCTV) facilities was too little advanced to enable the Guide to be prescriptive as to
           particular systems. However, it was noted that CCTV appeared to have significant value in crime
           prevention and detection and that it had a considerable role to play in aiding emergency
           evacuations, police management information and crowd control. The Group therefore recom-
 Rec 53    mends that the provision o f CCTV systems should be encouraged in the Guide.

__________ C R O W D B E H A V IO U R
               E40. Advice on crowd behaviour is currently set out in the Green Guide in the form o f
          . recommendations o f an earlier working party on crowd behaviour (GG: 18). The Group recom-
 Rec 54    mends that the advice for management currently presented at paragraph 18 o f the Guide should
            be re-organised and expanded so as to explain more fully the major problems and principles o f
            crowd control and then go on to elaborate the various methods available which may be relevant
            in certain situations at sports grounds and o f the circumstances under which these might be
            appropriate (see also recommendation (1) above).

 Rec 55      E41. The Group also recommends that the Guide should emphasise the value of effective planning
           before events, debriefing exercises and full liaison with the police, in order to predict and prevent
           trouble. In particular, the Guide should stress the desirability o f identifying in advance, against
           the local historical background and known travel arrangements, the likely size and nature o f the
           crowd.

Rec 56       E42. The Group further recommends that the Guide makes it clear that the responsibility for
           pre-planning and liaison lies with club management subject only to the point that the disposition
           o f operational police resources is the sole responsibility o f individual chief constables.

            . E43. There was considerable discussion in the Group o f the segregation issue which, it was
          agreed, had major implications for planning. The consensus was that clear differentiation o f
          opposing fans (with ancillary facilities) remained the only viable and prudent course so long as
          crowd violence remained at current levels; and that the best way to achieve such differentiation
          was by spatial separation and physical containment o f opposing groups. The Group was anxious,
          however, that segregation should not be encouraged other than where local circumstances made
Rec 57. - it absolutely necessary. In particular, at the present time segregation should not be advocated for
          sports other than soccer. The Group recommends accordingly. (See also paragraph 27 above).

Rec 58       E44. The Group agreed that       certain fire precautions measures, for example plasterboard fire


                                                        83
r




              separation and fire protection equipment, might be vulnerable to vandalism and that certificating
              authorities should be-advised to take this into account where appropriate. The Group recommends
              accordingly.

                E45. On ticketing, the Group agreed that this was not an effective means o f crowd control
    Rec 59    unless clubs ensured that their arrangements for the issue and allocation of tickets were as efficient
              and effective as possible. The Group recommends that this latter point be strongly emphasised in
              the Green Guide.

    Rec 60      E46. On alcohol, the Group recommends that the guidance on alcohol (GG: 18.4) should be
              reworded to make clear that an important objective was to reduce potential missiles and also that
              the police should be consulted over arrangements for the sale o f alcohol at grounds. A reference
              to the Sporting Events (Control o f Alcohol etc) Act 1985 was also needed.

                E47. The Group were content with the materia! on police facilities given in the Green Guide
    Rec 61         17.8) but considered that the Guide should advise adequate vehicular accessfor the unobrusive
             i( G G :
              removal o f detainees and secure detention rooms at appropriate grounds. The Group recommends
              accordingly.

              OTH ER M A N A G E M E N T RESPONSIBILITIES
    Rec 62      E48. The Group was strongly in favour o f the creation o f a new section in the Green Guide on
              management responsibilities and recommends that consideration should be given to this. The
              Group considered that it would be helpful if such a section could incorporate a form o f
              checklist o f necessary tasks organised under broad headings such as: Pre-planning for Emergency
              Procedures, Training o f Stewards and First-aid Facilities/Other M edical Provisions. A reference
              to the need for management structure to reflect such responsibilities, preferably including the
              designation o f a named individual to take responsibility for the proper execution o f such duties,
              was also highly desirable.

                E49. On the question o f the relative responsibilities o f the police and stewards, the Group felt
    Rec 63    that the G uide ought to make it plain that it was the club's responsibility to control and manage
              spectators in normal circumstances and that the police presence (if there was one) was to deal with
              the law and order problems and provide support and leadership in emergencies. The Group
              recommends accordingly. It was noted that there now existed considerable material on the training
              and deployment o f stewards and staff likely to be involved in emergency situations.

alternative             ends    of    the    ground         to    the     1 9 8 8 Semi       Final.          In    relation

to    this    approaches             to    the K o p a n d t h e          South      Stand       are    from       the    South,

the a r e a    where          the    vast    majority            of N o t t i n g h a m s h i r e    supporters           would

travel,       and       the W e s t       Stand    and Terrace,               and North Stand                are

approached          from       the N o r t h ,     the a r e a         from which          the      v ast    majority          of

Liverpool          supporters             would    t rav el.           These     areas       were      therefore

allocated          on    this       basis    and       any al te ra tion            would     h ave     resulted          in

opposing       fans       crossing          each       other,       therefore,          increasing            the

likelihood          of    disorder          and,       in a d d i t i o n ,     excessive           disruption           to    the

event.

This    decision was                accepted       by the FA,             the C l u b s      and     other        interested

consequence            a separate                plan        is      prepared          for       dealing        with       c ity      cen t r e

An    example         of    the       flexibility                 of    the       p la n    can be        drawn       from          the    fact

that      in the       D Division                Order          officers           are      allocated           to    escort          duties

the H i l l s b o r o u g h          ground and              the       contingency               plan     is    t h at     when       t h ese

for      re-deployment                at       the     g r o u n d as        an additional                resource             at    the

ground       gymnasium.                   On    completion              of     the     match        the      officers           are       again

To   ensure        the     football          supporters                 were       made       aware     of    the

At   08.45 am         on S a t u r d a y ,         13 A p r i l         1989,       as     senior       officer          on w e e k e n d

I updated myself                 about       the      previous               nights        work     and      dealt       with    the

morning        mail       and    correspondence.

about     1.00       pm    to    go    to    the      football               ground.

About     1 . 00     pm    I went       into        the       incident             r o o m at      Force     Headquarters

Everything           seemed       to    be     going          well        - the         traffic        flow was          busy w h ic h

was      to    be       expected          on    such an        occasion.

About         h alf      an    hour       after       that     Chief         Superintendent                   Nesbit            a r r i v e d at

Police         Headquarters                 and      took    me    to H i l l s b o r o u g h           Football           Stadium           via

Penistone               Road.        This       road w a s        s t ill     b u s y at          t his      t ime    and       we    stopped

so    that      Chief          Superintendent                Nesbit          could        encourage             vehicles             to    use

two      lanes          inwards        to      the    ground.           We    then          continued           our       journey          and

he    dropped            me    off     at      the    Directors            car        park       entrance          on P e n i s t o n e

Road.          I walked             through          the    Directors             car       park       to     the      far e n d       of the

ground         and       went       through          the    gate      up     to    the       Police           C o n t r o l Room.

There         was       nothing        unusual         and     I t o ok       the       view       everything              was       g o in g      to

In the         Control          Room        I met      Chief       Inspector              McRobbie            and     the       officers

manning         the           video       and     radios.         There          was     a     cordial         e x c h a n g e and

little         else           when     I noticed Chief                Superintendent                    D u c k e n f i e l d the

officer         in       charge        of      the    operation            and     Superintendent                    Murray          come       up

after         2.00       pm.        Mr.     Ducksnfield            said       that          he    had       been     to    see       the

referee         to       discuss          police       procedures             and       a general             discussion              took

pl ace        about       the       operation          which       w as      progressing                satisfactorily.

I recall            a    comment          being       made     about         the       Notts       Forest          f ans     com i n g

early         and       there       was     stil l     a    lot    of      people         to     enter        the N o r t h          Stand

for      Liverpool             Supporters.                 It w a s      considered               t ha t     there        was p l e n t y       of

ti m e    to    get           the    s u p p o r t e r s in.        I left            the C o n t r o l       Room        an d went          to

the      Directors             lobby        where      I saw       the       Club       Secretary,              Mr.       Mackrell.                I

made      comment             about       the     Liverpool         fans          coming          lat e r     than        the     Notts

Forest         fans       and         he s a i d     that the         gates           had    been       opened        at 12 m i d d a y

to    let      them       in.           I then went          to     the      Directors              box      and     sat in the             seat

reserved            for       the    po lice.

The      North          Standseemed             to   be      filling             up    v e r y well          t o w a r d s the       start

players        ran     out       on       to    the       field          prior        to      the     commencement                of    the       game

Just     after        the       game       started             I had        occasion             to      look        towards       the       West

Terrace        and     saw       a number                of    fans        had      come       out       on     to    the    pitch.           More

fans     came     on a n d           I immediately                    went       to      the     Police          Control          Room where

saw     Chief     Superintendent                         Duckenfield.                    He    was       unable        to    say w h a t          had

happened         at    that          stage          and       I recollect                the     g ame        had     been    stopped.

I decided         to       go    down          on    to       the     pitch         to     see      what        the    p r o b l e m was          and

on    getting         there          I saw S u p e r i n t e n d e n t                Greenwood               wh o    i n f o r m e d me      that

crowd      had    got       bigger             on    the       pitch and              I ran         b ack       up    to    the    Control

Room     to m a k e        use       of    communications                      - a fleet              of a m b u l a n c e s       had       been

requested         (3.07          pm).           Because             of     the      seriousness                 of    the    situation             and

together         with       Chief          Superintendent                      Duckenfield                 we    g ave      instructions

to    the C o n t r o l         Room       Staff          for       implementation                    of      the     major       disaster

plan.         There        would          be    considerable                   pressure             on     our       controller          at       this

time     - but        I knew          we       were       being          monitored             by     our       Force       Incident          Room

dealing        with        the       match          to    link        to    the       major         incident           and    I remember

being      asked       to       confirm             operation              support            (3.10        pm).

In the        meantime           rescue             operations              were         taking          place        on    the    pitch and

I specifically                  requested                t hat      Superintendent                    Torr       be    requested             to

incident         could          be    investigated.                        Mr.      D u c k e n f i e l d w as         continuing             to

deal     with     other          matters             with        our       radio         controller              a n d we     requested

that     he    broadcast              for       people           to      l e a ve     the      pitch and              keep    calm       so       that

we    could      deal       with          the       in j u r e d .

A    request      was       made          l a ter        for     Mr.       Duckenfield                to a t t e n d        the    Board          Room

and     something           was       mentioned                about        the       g ame      being          abandoned          -    it was

important         not       to       make       any       announcement                   u n til      we      dealt        with    the

casualties            so    that          we    could          get       them       to     hospital             whilst       it w a s        clear

I went         to    the       Board        Room and          Superintendent                 Murray          was     left     in c h a r g e

of    the C o n t r o l         Room.           Mr.     Duckenfield              spoke       to     them -         I reinforced

the    need         to    get       the        casualties           away        before      any announce me nt                 was m a d e

a n d we       returned             to      the      Police Control              R o om.

At    about         3.35       pm D e t e c t i v e       Chief       Superintendent                 Addis         made      contact

via    telephone               at    th e      Control        Room        and    I briefed           him       regarding         the

situation            at    the       football           ground and              requested           him      to a t t e n d a n d       see

me .

We w er e       made       aware          that        there       were     fatalities             and     a temporary

mortuary            was    arranged             in the        gymnasium.

The    managers            of       Notts         Forest            Mr.     Clough         and Liverpool               - Mr.

Dalglish            came       into       the     Police           Control        Box      and asked           whether          the g ame

was     postponed.                  They       were     told       it w o u l d     be,      but a n         announcement

should         not       be made,,             Mr.     Dalglish           asked     if      there        was    anything         he

could      do       and    he w a s         requested             to m a k e     an a n n o u n c e m e n t        for    the

Liverpool            fans       to       keep     c alm      so    the     police        could       deal       with      the

situation.                He    did       so    and     both manag ers              left       the C o n t r o l         Room.

Some     time        after          t his      1 went        to    the      pitch and          s p o k e to C h i e f

Superintendent                  Nesbit          who     had       been      involved          in the      rescue         operation.

At    t ha t    time       there         was      a    lot    of    shouting          at     the L e p p i n g s         Lane    end     and

restlessness               creeping             round        the    ground.           We     decided           t hat     it w o u l d    be

helpful         to       calm       everyone          by m a k i n g       an a n n o u n c e m e n t        t hat     the   game       had

been     abandoned              and      ask      the     f ans     to     remain        where      they were             until       all

the    casualties               wEre        taken away             from     the     gro u n d .         We     then made         a

request         v ia      the       Police        Control          Room     for     this       to   be       done,

I then         returned             to   the      Police          Control        Room.        Detective              Chief

Superintendent                  Addis          arrived and            I     briefed         him r eg ar di n g         the      enquiry

and    casualty            bureau           were      functioning.

             All    the      casualties             were       cleared and             then       at    approximately               4.43       pm

             Chief     Superintendent                    Mole       came       to    the    Control        Roo m .       I briefed             him

             regarding            the    situation and                   requested          him    to     control        and     co-ordinate

             remaining            matters       at       the    ground          so    that    I could           go    to P o l i c e

             I left       the      Police       Control             Box     with      Chief       Superintendent               Duckenfield

             and Superintendent                     Marshall             who    had    joined          us a n d w a l k e d      across         the

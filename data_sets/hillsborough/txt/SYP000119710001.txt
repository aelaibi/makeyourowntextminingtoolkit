               I N S PECTOR - S OPTH Y O R K S H I R E      POLICE   (HOW RETIRED)



 Inspector WHITE was the officer directly in charge of the concourse area

behind turnstiles 9 - 1 6 and A - G.                 None of his evidence is recorded in the

form of a C.J.A. Statement.

This officer retired from the force on a medical pension as a direct result

of his involvement in the tragedy and because of the effects on him he was

not required to give evidence to either LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR or the RESUMED

INQUEST.

  yank     gate open but I anticipate and held firm.                              I slammed it shut.           Repeat

and elevated section.                    No problems.

Approximately           2.40       pm.      Young Police       Constable with            'stupid and legless'

drunk wandering about in concourse at rear A-G turnstiles.                                          Did not know

where     to    go.         Took     him    to Police       Room.        Had     to support     drunk    all way.

(Police Constable 1719 or 1715 or similar).

2.45 pm                Checked       watch      leaving     police       room,    radio message,        "Get some

more     horses        up    here"        (or   similar).         Auto     - assumed      Leppings      Lane    end.

Unknown       officer        said,       "Sounds     like   its     getting busy         at your    end Harry".

Returned       to Leppings Lane end via route under North Stand.                                  Getting busy.

Concourse rear              11-16.        Climbing over wall             above gate      'B'.     Joined Police

Constables        at        'B'    gate     entice    down.         Fans    distrustful.           Waving      their

tickets.        Inspector John Bennett had climbed onto turnstile roof to deal.
 Aware          the crush outside 11 — 16 turnstiles.                      Coming through very slowly.

 Stepped       away    from turnstiles         to watch Inspector Bennett                 but    two or three

 times     I    was     pulled     by   Liverpool      people        who    had    got     inside    who    were

 complaining about the crush outside.                    "You should be out there.                  People are

 gonna get killed".

 Through the gate in the wall between the two concourses at the rear of two

 sets of turnstiles.              I became aware of a movement of people.                        From previous

 experience I knew it was too much for turnstile flow and there were too many

 for waiting friends responding to a kick off or crowd cheer or similar.                                       I

 stepped       through      into the concourse         behind A-G.           (Not sure whether pulled

 again by fans).

Twice called on radio using allocated call sign 'India 7'.

I seemed to recall that all the turnstiles had stopped.                                  Men were screaming

 trapped        in them.         Gate   'C* was open and       people were coming through.                  The

terror          in the       turnstiles communicated            itself        to me       and    brought    the

seriousness of the situation to mind.

I went out through gate 'C*.

I remember       standing alongside            Inspectors Graham Delaney and Bob Purdy and

Sergeant John Morgan pulling people out of the crush on turnstiles A-G.                                       I

feared some would be killed.                Some were reluctant to come.                   I think they had

got   so   close       tothe     turnstiles     they    had     the single intention              of passing

through.         I shouted at some, and as many as possible I pulled under the iron

bar that is a continuation of the wall housing gate                               'C* .     The crush quite

suddenly       eased.        I    saw   gate    ’B'    had    been    opened.         The       queues   became

controllable          and   containable     again.      The    two turnstiles             nearest    gate   'C*

appeared to function again.                Sergeant Barry Sorsby on his police horse came

up to railing and using the horse as a barrier we were able to filter out of
 this agitated crowd fans who produced tickets.                    I told the stewards on gate

 ’C* to take the stubs.

 By now I have no idea of time or what                  is happening outside.

 By word of mouth information passed,                   "Inside - Pitch invasion".Went to             the

 pitch via rear of police control box                   and down the first steps             in theSouth

 Stand.     I saw no players or officials               on the pitch.

 The invasion appeared to have spread as far as the penalty spot.                               I got on

 to the pitch and had got near to the goal post when I noticed those on the

 pitch were not running towards opponents end or away from Police Officers.

 Some were holding themselves, others lying down.                      I looked towards the fence

 holding    back    fans       in   the    Leppings   Lane   terraces.         Police    Officers    were

 standing on the fence              and    leaning over.     Through the        gaps     in the legs I

 could see the faces of fans pressed against the fence.                         I realised they were

stood up dead.            The gate to this pen was opened.               I think it was number 3

gate.

Automatically (or it seemed) Police Officers formed a double line up to the

gate and formed a chain gang to pass out casualties.                       When there was no one

at your end of the line to pass on the casualty, you carried it on to the

pitch.      Police Constable              2417   Pete Rotchel and I carried           the    unconscious

body of a 14 years old boy, dressed in a blue tee-shirt and blue jeans, on

to the     pitch.        I felt his        heart beat but his breathing was                 so extremely

shallow that I thought he was dead.                   We prepared to do mouth-to-mouth when I

realised    he     was    in    fact      breathing   himself.    We     did    not     interrupt   this

natural breathing and monitored his condition very closely, keeping him warm

and protected.           I remember as I was kneeling over him that I was kicked in

the back.    I seemed surrounded by the click-whizz, click-whizz of cameramen.
                                                            - 6 -



       people      came with a board and this boy was carried away.                         More came with

       another board to carry away the young woman being attended to next to us.                               I

      remember intervening as they were going to place her on the board nails up.

      I turned and          saw behind me a fireman apply cardiac massage                     to a male    in

      early       thirties.           He   then gave    oral   resuscitation       and I knelt beside     the

      casualty to do cardiac massage.                   As the fireman sat back he signalled me not

      to continue.          We checked for vital life signs, there were none.                      I covered

      the casualty's face with the front of his sweater.

€'    I heard someone say, "They're charging".                      I looked towards the Spion Kop and

      saw    people    on       the    field moving     towards     it.    They    were not running.      It

      looked as though a confrontation was imminent.                        I went beyond the half way

      line and made uniformed officers form up in a line.                          There was a line across

      the width of          the pitch.          This halted the progress of the Liverpool              fans.

      Some of them were crying.                 Some were frustrated.        Some    were angry.     It did

      not help to hear the mass                 of Notts fans behind chanting and goading.             They

     seemed unaware of the tragedy.

     4.20    pm            This was the first lull in the sequence of events since I left

g    the police room.             I looked at my watch, it was 4.20 pm.               I became aware that

     my radio was still working.                  There were public address announcements and the

     ground slowly emptied.

     5-00 pm           Given hot drinks.               Mustered serials in North Stand and spoke

     to officers distressed by experiences.

     About    5-30    pm    I    went      to   gymnasium   which    was   being    used   as a   temporary

     mortuary and I assisted in the collation of details of the dead.

     11.00   pm        Went off duty from the gymnasium.

 No ticket - no entry.

 All aware their positions allocated by club.

All wearing proper identification.

 12 noon              Turnstiles open.          Officers and stewards in position.             Build up

 gradual and friendly.               Well behaved.       Made constant checks of snack bars,

programme     sellers         re   security.       Supervision       of pen     filling    unnecessary.

Officers, stewards and turnstile progress okay.

Between 1.30 pm and 2.00 pm.                   Approximately six men with Liverpool accents

at Gate      'C'.        Steward on      gate    called men.         Produced small wallets with

dynatape     claiming         'Official      Liverpool    stewards'.       No    tickets    attempt     to

 yank      gate open but I anticipate and held firm.                   I slammed it shut.           Repeat

performance ten minutes later.                  No entry.

two Police Constables to programme sellers not in porta-cabins.                              Check pens

and elevated section.              No problems.

Approximately 2.40 pm.                Young Police Constable with               'stupid and legless'

drunk wandering about              in concourse at rear A-G turnstiles.                   Did not know

where     to go.        Took him      to Police Room.           Had to support drunk          all way.

(Police Constable 1719 or 1715 or similar).

2.45 pm               Checked watch       leaving police room,          radio message,       "Get some

more    horses     up    here"     (or   similar).       Auto    - assumed       Leppings    Lane    end.

Unknown    officer said,           'Sounds     like    its getting busy       at your end Harry".

Returned to Leppings Lane end via route under North Stand.                             Getting busy.

Concourse rear 11-16.                Climbing over wall above gate              'B'.   Joined Police

Constables       at     'B'   gate    entice     down.        Fans   distrustful.         Waving    their

tickets.     Inspector John Bennett had climbed onto turnstile roof to deal.

 Aware of the crush outside 11—16 turnstiles.                       Craning through very slowly.

 Stepped away from turnstiles to watch Inspector Bennett but two or three

 times    I     was    pulled    by   Liverpool     people    who     had   got      inside    who   were

 complaining about the crush outside.                "You should be out there.                People are

 gonna get killed".

Through the gate in the wall between the two concourses at the rear of two

 sets of turnstiles.            I became aware of a movement of people.                    From previous

experience I knew it was too much for turnstile flow and there were too many

 for waiting friends responding to a kick off or crowd cheer or similar.                                I

stepped       through into the concourse behind A-G.                   (Not sure whether pulled

again by fans).

Twice called on radio using allocated call sign 'India 7'.

I seemed to recall that all the turnstiles had stopped.                           Men were screaming

trapped in        them.        Gate   'C' was open and      people were coming through.               The

terror     in     the     turnstilescommunicated             itself     to me       and    brought    the

seriousness of the situation to mind.

I went out through gate 'C '.

I remember standing alongside Inspectors Graham Delaney and Bob Purdy and

Sergeant John Morgan pulling people out of the crush on turnstiles A-G.                                 I

feared some would be killed.              Some were reluctant to come.               I think they had

got   so close        to the    turnstiles they had          the single intention of passing

through.      I   shouted at some, and as many as possible I pulled under the iron

bar that is a continuation of the wall housing gate                         'C' .     The crush quite

suddenly      eased.       I    saw   gate   'B'   had     been   opened.       The       queues   became

controllable      and containable         again.     The    two turnstiles nearest gate               'C'

appeared to function again.              Sergeant Barry Sorsby on his police horse came

up to railing and using the horse as a barrier we were able to filter out of
 this agitated crowd fans who produced tickets.                  I told the stewards on gate

 'C' to take the stubs.

By now I have no idea of time or what is happening outside.

By word of mouth information passed,                 "Inside - Pitch invasion".Went to             the

pitch via rear of police control box and down the first steps                            in theSouth

Stand.      I saw no players or officials on the pitch.

The invasion appeared to have spread as far as the penalty spot.                             I got on

to the pitch and had got near to the goal post when I noticed those on the

pitch were not running towards opponents end or away from Police Officers.

Some were holding themselves, others lying down.                     I looked towards the fence

holding back      fans       in   the    Leppings   Lane   terraces.         Police    Officers   were

standing on the fence and leaning over.                    Through the gaps            in the legs I

could see the faces of fans pressed against the fence.                        I realised they were

stood up dead.         The gate to this pen was opened.                I think it was number 3

gate.

Automatically (or it seemed) Police Officers formed a double line up to the

gate and formed a chain gang to pass out casualties.                     When there was no one

at your end of the line to pass on the casualty, you carried it on to the

pitch.      Police Constable 2417 Pete Rotchel and I carried the unconscious

body of a 14 years old boy, dressed in a blue tee-shirt and blue jeans, on

to the pitch.          I felt his heart beat but his breathing was                      so extremely

shallow that I thought he was dead.                 We prepared to do mouth-to-mouth when I

realised    he   was    in    fact      breathing   himself.    We     did    not     interrupt   this

natural breathing and monitored his condition very closely, keeping him warm

and protected.         I remember as I was kneeling over him that I was kicked in

the back.     I seemed surrounded by the click-whizz, click-whizz of cameramen.

People came with a board and this boy was carried away.                     More came with

 another board to carry away the young woman being attended to next to us.                I

 remember intervening as they were going to place her on the board nails up.

I turned and saw behind me a fireman apply cardiac massage to a male in

early     thirties.         He then gave oral resuscitation and       I knelt beside   the

casualty to do cardiac massage. As the fireman sat back he signalled                 me not

to continue.        We checked for vital life signs, there were none.            I covered

the casualty's face with the front of his sweater.

I heard someone say, "They're charging".             I looked towards the Spion Kop and

saw people     on     the    field moving towards    it.     They were not running.     It

looked as though a confrontation was imminent.                I went beyond the half way

line and made uniformed officers form up in a line.              There was a line across

the width of the pitch.              This halted the progress of the Liverpool fans.

Some of them were crying.            Some were frustrated.      Some were angry.    It did

not help to hear            the mass of Notts fans behind chanting and goading.They

seemed unaware of           the tragedy.

4.20 pm             This was the first lull in the sequence of events since I left

the police room.        I looked at my watch, it was 4.20 pm.         I became aware that

my radio was still working.            There were public address announcements and the

ground slowly emptied.

5.00 pm         Given hot drinks.          Mustered serials in North Stand and spoke

to officers distressed by experiences.

About   5-30   pm     I went    to   gymnasium which   was   being   used   as a temporary

mortuary and I assisted in the collation of details of the dead.

11.00 pm        Went off duty from the gymnasium.

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY




INTRODUCTION

1     The Scottish Sports Council has no locus so far as the
     events at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground on 15 April
     1989 are concerned.

2    The purpose of this submission is to summarise the
     Council's views on crowd control and safety at sports
     grounds.


CROWD CONTROL & CROWD SAFETY

General

3   The Council recognises that considerable improvements have
     been made in crowd control in sgtadia at a management level
     and by stadia design modifications.   Much of the
     management success, the Council believes, is because of
     the introduction and implementation of the Criminal
     Justice (Scotland) Act 1980 on which actions to control
     the use and consumption of alcohol are based.

4   This success within stadia may be transferring problems of
     crowding, hooliganism and vandalism to the approaches to
     stadia.


SPORTS GROUNDS   (STADIA)

5   Council submits the following observations on stadia
    design or modification.

Stadia:   Externals

6   Stadia with large crowd capacities clearly require large,
     well-defined parking areas for cars and buses.

7   Also the thoroughfares from the approaches and the parking
     areas to the stadia should be clearly defined, wide and
     straight with no funnelling or narrowing.  There should be
     no crowd movement obstructions such as steps or congestion
     points such as toilets or shops off.

8   Parking areas and thoroughfares should be segregated if
     the event is one characterised by rival supporters.

Turnstiles

9   The approaches to turnstiles should be fenced to provide
     pends.
                                 2


10   The number of turnstiles should be sufficient to allow
     crowds rapid and easy ingress to and egress from the
     stadia.

11   The type of turnstile installed should:

     11.1      Allow controlled rotation or be collapsible in
                either direction in cases of emergency.

     11.2      Prevent people slipping under or over it.

        11.3   Be housed in the perimeter fencing in such a way
                that climbing over is not possible.

Passageways

12   The passageways or thoroughfares between the turnstiles
     and stadia internals should be:

        12.1   Wide and numerous and lead to numerous segregated
                areas within the stadia;

        12.2   Well sign-posted and well-lit with good public
                address system;
                                        .
        12.3   Free from entrances to toilets and shops;

        12.4   If stairways are necessary they should be free from
                all toilets and shops.

        12.5   Deflection barriers might be introduced to deflect
                surging crowds sideways when surging through the
                passageways to the terraces.

Terraces

13      Terraces should be divided into segments by front-to-back
        and side-to-side fencing.  Any perimeter fencing next to
        the pitch should be of a type which collapses:

        13.1   Automatically under a pre-determined pressure; or

        13.2   Under the control of a supervisor.

Moats

14      On balance, the Council does not favour perimeter moats
        because of the possibility of people falling into them
        becoming trapped if there is a forward crowd surge.

Emergency Services

15      All stadia should be equipped to handle minor emergencies
        on the s p o t .

                   16   Major emergencies should be dealt with by the emergency
                        services which should have unobstructed access points and
                        thoroughfares to the stadia and within them.

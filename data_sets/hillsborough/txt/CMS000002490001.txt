               The Home Secretary has asked for a meeting at 10.45 on Thursday 7
      ^       September to discuss post-Hillsborough developments.    Your copies
               of two* submissions which are likely to provide a basis for
X I           discussion are attached.     You and I should attend.     Mr Turney
               will be in Birmingham. I do not think Mr Stickley'spresence is
Ojfrku        necessary.
              2.   Lord Justice Taylor is likely to ask for a "meeting” with
              Home Office officials in connection with part 2 of his Inquiry
              during the last week in September. Mr Whalley will be making the
              arrangements. It is intended that this side of the office should
              be represented by Mr Turney, me, you and Mr Stickley. The police
              side will probably be Mr Goddard and Mr Smith.     I hope you and
              Mr Stickley will be available.

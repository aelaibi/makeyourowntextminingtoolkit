RE: PREPARATIONS OF STATEMENTS FOLLOWING THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

Thank you for copying to me the letter from Lord Justice Stuart Smith to Peter Metcalfe of
Hammond Suddards Solicitors relating to the above.

I believe that my letter of 5 November 1997 with its attached schedule and documents, read in
conjunction with the schedule and documents I provided to you on the 24 September 1997
covers the majority of the points you raise at paragraphs 2,3 and 4 in the above letter.

There are just two further points I would wish to add, one for clarification regarding the actual
amending of statements referred to in paragraph 3 of the letter and the second in relation to
Police Officers refusing to sign amended statements referred to in paragraph 4.

Amendments to statements/recollection were not carried out by Peter Metcalfe nor anyone
working at Hammond Suddards, copies of Officers self prepared recollections were forwarded to
Peter Metcalfe and his comments were returned by fax. Amended recollections were prepared by
a small South Yorkshire Police team, headed by Detective Chief Inspector Alan Foster and
Detective Inspector Phillip Jones. (Both officers are now Superintendents and are still serving).
These recollections were not in Criminal Justice Act form. They were then taken to their original
author and agreed with them before they signed them. They were passed to West Midlands
Police in this format.

South Yorkshire Police entered the officers recollections onto the HOLMES computer system as
reports and the computer gave them R            reference numbers. The West Midlands Police
entered these same recollections onto their HOLMES computer system as statements and the
computer gave them S         reference numbers. Thereafter when West Midlands Police printed
them out they automatically appeared as if they were a statement on CJA forms.

Whilst searching the files to try and identify whether any officers had refused to sign their
amended recollections I came across a note which indicated that a small minority of officers had
initially objected to their recollections being forwarded to West Midlands Police. Five such officers
were named in the files and they were:

PC 2076 Cerrone               19 05   1989
PC 1285 Smith                 05 06   1989
PC 446 Groome                 06 06   1989
PC 1842 Brookes               15 06   1989
PC 1834 Scholey               05 06   1989

However the officers all withdrew their objections and the date alongside their name indicates
when their recollections were forwarded to West Midlands Police. I would however ask you to
note that officers were informed that their reports would not be released unless the officer
concerned gave their consent. (Memo DD2 of Chief Superintendent Denton dated 12 05 1989 -
forwarded to you with my letter of 5 November 1997 refers.)

Moving now to paragraph 4 of your letter it is quite clear that some officers expressed concern
about alterations and editing of their original recollection prior to submission to West Midlands
Police. This resulted in a letter being sent to Hammond Suddards and the circulation of a note to
all commanders in South Yorkshire Police on 23 May 1989 explaining why editing was taking
place and requesting that the note be brought to the attention of all officers. ( A copy of this letter
and note were provided to you on 24 September 1997 reference D62).

I am unable to trace from our files details of any officer who actually refused to sign their
amended recollections. It is not surprising though that in an organisation as large as South
Yorkshire Police, where individual officers gather and present their own evidence in statement
form and subsequently at court, that some individuals would express concern or even challenge
the right of a third party to amend their recollections.

If I can be of any further assistance in this matter please contact me.

Dear Lord Justice Stuart-Smith

P R E P A R A T IO N O F S T A T E M E N T S F O L L O W IN G T H E H IL L S B O R O U G H D IS A S T E R

Thank you for your letter o f 28 October 1997 which as you know did not in fact reach me until 7
N ovem ber 1997.

The follow ing response is made with my clients’ permission but the factual material is derived from
my files and any view s expressed are my own. The clients’ permission extends to disclosing to you
the attached docum ents but this disclosure is in confidence to the Hillsborough Scrutiny.

H ere are my answers to the points raised under paragraph 4 o f your letter.                                                                 I have grouped under
item 1 comment on each o f the points made in paragraph 3.

 1.1.        I understand that the decision to ask all officers present to provide se lf taken statements was
             made at a meeting at Police Headquarters on M onday 17 April 1989. I w as not present at
             this meeting. I cannot therefore say whether officers w ere specifically asked to include
             comment and impression.

 1.2.         It is correct that when the W est Midlands Police asked for statements from particular officers
              the se lf taken statements for those officers w ere forwarded to me. I read through the
              statements and made comments by fax to C hief Superintendent Denton. I did not amend any
              statements. Where my comments suggested changes, these were principally removal o f
              comment and impression.          They also included suggestions to re-address apparent
              contradictions or ambiguities, to consider removal o f evidence about events after the officers
              had gon e o ff duty and, on occasions, to reconsider intemperate language.

 1.3.         The statements were intended to be used for the purpose o f Lord Justice Taylor’s enquiry
              but they w ere not, so far as I am aware, intended to form Criminal Justice A ct statements.
              There is a letter dated 7 M ay 1989 from Mervyn Jones to Peter Wright which refers to

         officers providing ‘recollections in writing’ and ‘written subm issions’. I w ould have
         expected this letter to refer explicitly to CJA statements if that w as the intention.

    2.   With the passage o f tim e it is difficult to say precisely w hy this approach w as adopted. R e­
         reading the file I think that it follow ed on from the procedure adopted with the senior
         officers and in particular the officers w ho had borne the brunt o f the press criticism following
         the disaster. At an early stage these officers were asked by the W est M idlands Police to
*        provide se lf taken statements. I attach a copy o f my attendance note o f discussions on 29/30
         April 1989 at which the provision o f these statements w as discussed between m yself and
         Peter H ayes, the then Deputy C hief Constable. This states - at the top o f page 2:-

                    “It was agreed, however, that it would be sensible fo r me to see these
                   statements before they went to the West M idlands Enquiry and to have
                   some time to go through them with the men involved”.

          Again I cannot really say whether this w as my idea or Peter H ayes’ idea but it does seem,
          now as then, entirely appropriate. Although there w as no suggestion o f criminal proceedings
          at that time, these men had been the subject o f severe criticism and might w ell expect to be
*        further criticised at the enquiry. I attach a copy o f my attendance note dated 2 M ay which
          details the m eeting with the senior officers on that day. The note indicates that changes w ere
          suggested but the comment in relation to A C C Jackson does tend to indicate that these
          changes were not major.

         When the letter o f 7 May, referred to in 1.3. above, w as received by the South Yorkshire
^        Police, C hief Superintendent Denton spoke to me on 9 M ay and a copy o f my attendance
          note o f that conversation is enclosed. Y ou will note the final paragraph which effectively
          records the decision to scrutinise these statements without stating whether this w as my idea
          or C hief Superintendent D enton’s. It does how ever record that the intention w as to remove
          “comment or matters o f speculation

    3.   A s indicated at item 1.1. above I am not aware that anyone specifically asked for officers’
          comm ents and impressions. The only record o f the request will be in C hief Inspector
          B ettison’s note o f the meeting o f 17 April which I have not seen. There is no doubt that the
          se lf taken statements did include comment and impression.

    4.   Without wishing in any way to be flippant about such an awful tragedy I am afraid that the
         reference to “usual procedure would not have found an echo in the m eetings which w e had
                                          ”


         at that time. Ninety five people had died. Officers w ho had given a lifetime o f public service
         suddenly found them selves objects o f public vilification and accused o f negligence leading to
         mass slaughter. I do not think that anybody really knew what w ould be usual procedure in
         those circumstances. I would say how ever that by then the enquiry into the events - whether
         it w as eventually to turn into a criminal enquiry or not - w as firmly in the hands o f the W est
         Midlands Police w ho had the authority to im pose whatever procedure they thought
         appropriate.

        A s a matter o f additional personal comment, it seem s to m e that the W est M idlands Police
        had little practical choice, because o f the constraint im posed by the political requirement that
        the Taylor Enquiry should produce an interim report before the comm encement o f the next
        football season. To conduct the enquiry on the basis o f W est M idlands officers taking CJA
        statements from individual South Yorkshire Police officers w ould probably have rendered
        that goal impossible to achieve.

5.      I do not know precisely what procedure w as adopted after I had provided faxed comment on
        statements presented to me. I am not in a position to say whether any officer refused to sign
        an amended statement and indeed I am not aware as to whether officers w ere presented with
        amended statements as opposed to reviewing their ow n statements in the light o f the
        comm ents I had made. It may be that the former w as the practice adopted because o f the
        time pressure. Whether or not that w as the case I cannot recall any instance when the matter
        w as referred back to m e and I must assume either that the officers signed amended
        statements, or that i f they did not, the statements went to W est M idlands in their original
        form.

I hope this is helpful. Please let m e know if I can be o f any further assistance.

Yours sincerely

attendance    note



DATE:     29th/30th April, 1989


RE:       HILLSBOROUGH




(1)     Attending Terry Wain on telephone 29/4.

        He read to me the contents of a letter received
        from the West Midlands Force, asking for Senior
        Officers to prepare what would effectively be
        self-taken statements to present to the West
        Midlands inquiry.  This had given rise to some
        concern.  He and Belinda had drafted a form of
        holding response to be sent by the Deputy, but
        the latter had amended this to tone it down
        somewhat.  I approved it in its amended form,
        which effectively said that the Police would be
        doing everything they could to co-operate but
        asked what was the specific purpose of these
        statements and whether they would be the only
        statements likely to be required.

        He told me that the Deputy would be seeing the
        Officers concerned on Sunday and would like to
        speak to me afterwards.  I said that I would be
        available.


(2)     I spoke to Peter Hayes at Sunday lunchtime.   The
        Officers had now all seen the videos and were       /
        fairly relaxed about giving factual statements.
        They were not particularly concerned that these
        would be self-taken rather than CJA.  I raised
        with him the points which had concerned me,
        namely, that the inquiry was supposed to be
        fulfilling some statutory functions in terms of
        disciplinary proceedings and in terms of
        supporting H.M. Coroner.  I said that it might
        not be fair on the Officers if these self-taken
        statements were to be used for those purposes,
        as opposed to the purposes of the inquiry.  He
        discussed this with the Chief Constable, who was
        also present and said that the Chief Constable
        was satisfied that the West Midlands inquiry had
        a duty to report only to the Judge.  Moreover,
        it seemed that there was no practical difficulty
        because there was not going to be anything in the
        self-taken statements which would not have been
        in CJA statements if taken.


                                             /... contd.
                              - 2 -



       It was agreed, however, that it would be sensible
       for me to see these statements before they went
       out to the West Midlands inquiry and to have some
       time to go through them with the men involved.
       I said that I would make myself available on the
       Bank holiday, if need be, but otherwise could be
       in Sheffield on Tuesday.  He said that he would
       be considering the position and would contact me
       again later in the day.


(3)    Later on, he telephoned back and said that the
       sensible course would be for me to come down to
       Sheffield on Tuesday to discuss progress with
       Stuart Anderson and then to see the Officers in
       the afternoon.

       I said that it might also be helpful at that
       stage to have a meeting with Terry Wain to
       discuss format and presentation of the report
       with reference to indexing and perhaps cutting
       down the appendix.

        I also asked   if I could take away   with me a copy
        of the video   or videos which were   relevant to the
      . case and indeed any relevant still    photographs.
        He said that   he would arrange for   this.

       He said that   he would be going away for a few
       days break, but could be contacted if need be.

ATTENDANCE NOTE


DATE:     2nd M a y r 1989


RE:       HILLSBOROUGH




Attending at Sheffield Police Headquarters.

(1)     I had a meeting with the Chief Constable at which
        he asked how things were going and I reviewed
        progress.

        He raised the point that Mr. Hayes appeared to
        have left instructions for the self-taken
        statements to deal only with the events of the
        match:  he felt that they should go rather wider
        and deal with the planning and history.   I said
        that this depended very much on what had actually
        been asked for, but if the request for statements
        was general, then the statements themselves;.should
        be general.

        He indicated that he would make himself available
        for consultations or meetings at any time in
        connection with this matter.


(2)   I then spoke with Stuart Anderson and we discussed
      what needed doing in the afternoon.  Essentially,
      this was to go through the self-taken statements
      which had been prepared and I asked then to have a
      discussion with Terry Wain about the format of the
      report.  At this stage, I was able to have a look
      at the letter which had been received from the West
      Midlands Force and I noted that it was somewhat
      ambiguous.  The request was for a recollection of
      events prior to, during and after the match.  My
      reading of this would have limited it to the day
      in question but, on the whole, I felt it
      preferable to deal with the case as fully as
      possible.


(3)   During the course of the afternoon, I went through
      statements with A.C.C. Jackson (Operations),
      Superintendent Roger Greenwood (Ground Commander),
      Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield (Overall
      Commander), Superintendent Roger Marshall
      (Liverpool Sector Commander), Superintendent
      Bernard Murray (Operations, Second in Command),


                                             /. . . contd.
                         - 2 -



      Superintendent David Chapman (Nottingham Forest
      Sector Commander) and Chief Inspector Bob Creaser
      who was effectively a Sector Commander under
      Superintendent Marshall.

      I made various suggestions for alterations to
      their statements, the principal change being that
      in respect of A.C.C. Jackson, who had not included
      any of the details of the planning of the match.
      It was agreed that he would be dealing with this
      overnight and that I would attend at Sheffield
      again on Wednesday to go through this.


(4)   I looked through the statement of Inspector Hans
      Davis, in charge of mounted Officers.  Although
      there were one or two minor changes which I would
      have suggested, he was away on leave and it was
      felt appropriate that his statement should be
      handed over.


(5)   I then had further discussions with Terry Wain
      and with Stuart Anderson.   The team have assembled
      two sets of photographs dealing, respectively,
      with the situation on both sides of the Leppings
      Lane turnstiles and inside the Leppings Lane
      terracing.   The latter photographs were
      particularly instructive because, in a time
      sequence, they appeared to show various people
      standing at or around the mouth of the tunnel
      during the whole period from 2.45 p.m. to 3.05 p.m.,
      which would bast serious doubt on the suggestions
      that there was some sort of a surge through the
      tunnel as the result of a gate or gates being
      opened.   I was not able to take away copies of
      these photographs but I was supplied with a set
      of copies of Police videos.   Later that evening,
      I watched video number 14 which, interalia, shows
      the situation inside and outside the Leppings Lane
      turnstiles.   The film goes into what is referred
      to as elapsed time mode during the critical
      period, so that there are effectively a series of
      single shots with a gap of one to five seconds
      between them.   This is not particularly helpful
      but, insofar as anything can be made out, there
      again does not appear to be a surge towards the
      outside entrance of the tunnel, which has been
      implicated in the disaster.


(6)   I asked various of the Officers about leave
      commitments.   Superintendent Murray indicated
      that he had leave booked from 11th to 26th June
      and Superintendent Greenwood from 19th May to
      2nd June.   I promised to bring these matters to
      the attention of the Treasury Solicitor, although

      o   I could give no promise that they might not be
          called during indicated periods.

Attending     (1)   K. S. Anderson on telephone.

              (2)   K. G. Holmes on telephone.

              (3)   Don Denton on telephone.


(1)     He telephoned in response to my fax and said that
        they understood there may be a need for editing.
        He was concerned as to whether he would actually
        be called into the meeting this afternoon and I
        said that he should proceed with his existing
        arrangements and that we would fit in if-we---
        needed to consult him.  He said that he would be
        providing some sandwiches at 5.00 p.m.

        So far as the report/proof is concerned, the
        basic version is about 2" thick, but there are
        a very large "amount of appendices. I said that
        this was not too bad and that if we could cut it
        down to 1" thick, with just a few crucial
        documents included as appendices to the report
        itself, then I would be really quite satisfied.

        He was a little concerned as to whether the work
        would be done by ourselves or by the Police and
        I said that we would wait and see the size of the
        task before going any further.


(2)     He telephoned to mention his concern about the
        overall financial cost of the operation.  He was
        referring to the MMI involvement on behalf of all
        parties and wanted to send out a letter suggesting
        that it should not be necessary for Leading and
        Junior Counsel, a Partner and Assistant Solicitor
        to be present all the way through the hearing.
        I reassured him that I already had this point on
        board and, whilst it may be difficult to cut down

               on the representation as regards Counsel, our
               intention was that there should only be one
               representative from Hammonds at any given time,
               which might be myself, Belinda or      [ I said
               that, nevertheless, there would be no harm in
               putting the position on record.

               I mentioned that we had a conference this
               afternoon and also there was the conference on
               Friday, which he knew about.  He said that he did
               not require to attend either of these conferences.

               We discussed the question of Counsel's fees.  It
               was agreed that I would try and do some research,
               by way of telephoning up people who had been
               concerned in the Cleveland inquiry, with a view
               to discovering what Brief fees had been paid.   In
               this particular instance, we both agreed that he
     *         ought to specifically approve the Brief fee before
               it was agreed and that this, in turn, might need
               the approval of


         (3)   He told me that they had now received the formal
               request from the West Midlands for self-taken
               statements for some 120 Officers, of whom they
               already had Minutes or accounts of events in
               respect of 100.

               Obviously, no problem was presented in relation
               to those who had not provided an account of events,
               because they could be asked to do one specifically
               for the West Midlands request.   As for the others,
               there would need to be some scrutiny of the
               existing documents.  Many of them might be suitable
               to be handed on without further ado, but those
               which included comment or matters of speculation
               would probably have to be redone.   I said that we
               might be able to deal with something of this this
               afternoon, depending on the extent to which time
               was taken up with other matters.

        Dear Lord Justice Stuart-Smith

         P R E P A R A T IO N O F ST A T E M E N T S FO L L O W IN G T H E H IL L SB O R O U G H D ISA ST E R

        Thank you for your letter o f 28 October 1997 which as you know did not in fact reach me until 7
        November 1997,

        The following response is made with my clients’ permission but the factual material is derived from
        my files and" any view s expressed are my own. The clients* permission extends to disclosing to you
        the attached documents but this disclosure is in confidence to the Hillsborough Scrutiny.

         Here are my answers to the points raised under paragraph 4 o f your letter. I have grouped under
         item 1 comment on each o f the points made in paragraph 3.

         1.1.         I understand that the decision to ask all officers present to provide self taken statements was
                      made at a meeting at Police Headquarters on Monday 17 April 1989. I was not present at
                      this meeting. I cannot therefore say whether officers were specifically asked to include
                      comment and impression

         1.2.         It is correct that when the West Midlands Police asked for statements from particular officers
                      the self taken statements for those officers were forwarded to me. I read through the
                      statements and made comments by fax to Chief Superintendent Denton. I did not amend any
                      statements. Where my comments suggested changes, these were principally removal o f
                      comment and impression.         They also included suggestions to re-address apparent
                      contradictions or ambiguities, to consider removal o f evidence about events after the officers
                      had gone o ff duty and. on occasions, to reconsider intemperate language.

         1.3.         The statements were intended to be used for the purpose o f Lord Justice Taylor’s enquiry
                      but they were not, so far as I am aware, intended to form Criminal Justice Act statements.

  officers providing ‘recollections in writing’ and ‘written submissions’. I would have
  expected this letter to refer explicitly to CJA statements if that was the intention.

  With the passage o f time it is difficult to say precisely why this approach was adopted. Re­
  reading the file I think that it followed on from the procedure adopted with the senior
  officers and in particular the officers who had borne the brunt o f the press criticism following
  the disaster. At an early stage these officers were asked by the West Midlands Police to
  provide se lf taken statements. 1 attach a copy o f my attendance note o f discussions on 29/30
  April 1989 at which the provision o f these statements was discussed between myself and
  Peter Hayes, the then Deputy Chief Constable. This states - at the top o f page 2>

            "It was agreed, however, that it would he sensible fo r me to see these
           statements before they went lo the West Midlands Enquiry and to have
           some time to go through them with the men involved’'.

  Again I cannot really say whether this was my idea or Peter H ayes’ idea but it does seem,
  now as then, entirely appropriate, Although there was no suggestion o f criminal proceedings
  at that time, these men had been the subject o f severe criticism and might well expect to be
  further criticised at the enquiry. I attach a copy o f my attendance note dated 2 May which
  details the meeting with the senior officers on that day. The note indicates that changes were
  suggested but the comment in relation to A C C Jackson does tend to indicate that these
  changes were not major.

  When the letter o f 7 May, referred to in 1.3. above, was received by the South Yorkshire
  Police, C hief Superintendent Denton spoke to me on 9 May and a copy o f my attendance
  note o f that conversation is enclosed. You will note the final paragraph which effectively
  records the decision to scrutinise these statements without stating whether this was my idea
  or Chief Superintendent D enton’s. It does however record that the intention was to remove
  "comment or matters o f speculation ”

  As indicated at item 1.1. above I am not aware that anyone specifically asked for officers’
  comments and impressions. The only record o f the request will be in Chief Inspector
  Bettison’s note o f the meeting o f 17 April which 1 have not seen. There is no doubt that the
  self taken statements did include comment and impression.

  Without wishing in any way to be flippant about such an awful tragedy I am afraid that the
  reference to "usual procedure" would not have found an echo in the meetings which w e had
  at that time. Ninety five people had died. Officers who had given a lifetime o f public service
  suddenly found themselves objects o f public vilification and accused o f negligence leading to
  mass slaughter. 1 do not think that anybody really knew what would be usual procedure in
  those circumstances. I would say however that by then the enquif^ into the events - whether
  it was eventually to turn into a criminal enquiry or not - was firmly in the hands o f the West
  Midlands Police who had the authority to impose whatever procedure they thought
  appropriate.

                As a matter o f additional personal comment, it seems to me that the West Midlands Policc
                had little practical choice, because o f the constraint imposed by the political requirement that
                the Taylor Enquiry should produce an interim report before the commencement o f the next
                football season. To conduct the enquiry on the basis o f W est Midlands officers taking CJA
                statements from individual South Yorkshire Police officers would probably have rendered
                that goal impossible to achieve.

        5.      1 do not know precisely what procedure was adopted after I had provided faxed comment on
                statements presented to me. I am not in a position to say whether any officer refused to sign
                an amended statement and indeed T. am nor. aware as to whether officers w ere presented with
                amended statements as opposed to reviewing their own statements in the light o f the
                comments I had made. Ii inay be that the former was the practice adopted because o f the
                time pressure. Whether or not that was the case I cannot recall any instance when the matter
                was referred back to me and I must assume either that the officers signed amended
                statements, or that if they did not, the statements went to West Midlands in their original
                form,

        I hope this is helpful. Please let me know if I can be o f any further assistance.

        Yours sincerely

             DATE:     29th/30th April, 1989


             RE:       HILLSBOROUGH




              (1)    Attending Terry Wain on telephone 29/4.

                     He read to me the contents of a letter received
                     from the West Midlands Force, asking for Senior
                     Officers to prepare what would effectively be
                     self-taken statements to present to the West
                     Midlands inquiry. This had given rise to some
                     concern.   He and Belinda had drafted a form of
                     holding response to be sent by -the Deputy, but
                     the latter had amended this to tone it down
                     somewhat.   I approved it in its amended form,
                     which effectively said that the Police would be
                   ' doing.everything they could to co-operate but
                 .....asked what was the specific purpose of these... _
                     statements and whether they would be the only
                     statements likely to be required.

                     He told me that the Deputy would be seeing the
                     Officers concerned on Sunday and would like to
                     speak to me afterwards.  I said that I would be
                     available.


              (2)    I spoke to Peter Hayes at Sunday lu.nchtime. The
                     Officers had now all seen the videos and were
                     faxtly relaxed about giving tactual statements.
                     They were not particularly concerned that these
                     would be self-taken rather than CJA.   I raised
                     with him the points which had concerned me,
                     namely, that the inquiry was supposed to be
                     fulfilling some statutory functions in terms of
                     disciplinary proceedings and in terms of
                     supporting H.M. Coroner.  X said that it might
                     not be fair on the Officers if these self-taken
                     statements were to be used for those purposes,
                     as opposed to the purposes of the inquiry.   He
                     discussed this with the Chief Constable, who was
                     also present and said that the Chief Constable
                     was satisfied that the West Midlands inquiry had
                     a duty to report only to the Judge.   Moreover,
                     it seemed that there was no practical difficulty
                     because there was not going to be anything in the
                     self“taken statements which would not have been
                     in CJA statements if taken.


                                                                : contd.

                      It was agreed, however, that it would be sensible
                      for me to see these statements before they went
                      out to the West Midlands inquiry and to have some
                      time to go through them with the men involved.
                      I said that I would make myself available on the
                      Bank holiday, if need be, but otherwise could be
                      in Sheffield on Tuesday.  He said that he would
                      be considering the position and would contact me
                      again later in the day.


                      Later on, he telephoned back and said that the
                      sensible course would be for me to come down to
                      Sheffield on Tuesday to discuss progress with
                      Stuart Anderson and then to see the Officers in
                      the afternoon.

                      I said that it might also be helpful at that
                      stage to have a meeting with Terry Wain to
                      discuss format and presentation of the report
                      with reference to indexing and perhaps cutting
                      down the appendix.

                      I also asked   if I could take away with me   a copy
                      of the video   or videos which were relevant tothe
                      case and indeed any relevant still photographs.
                      He said that   he would arrange for this.

                      He said that   he would be going away for a    few
                      days break, but could be contacted if need be.

                  ATTENDANCE NOTE


                   DATE:      2nd May, 1989


                  RE:        HILLSBOROUGH




                  Attending at Sheffield Police Headquarters.

                   (i)     I had a meeting with the Chief Constable at which
                           he asked how things were going and I reviewed
                           progress.

                             He raised the point that Mr. Hayes appeared to
                             have left instructions for the self-taken
                             statements to deal only with the events of the
                             match;    he felt that they should go rather wider
                             and deal with the planning and history.     I said
                             that this depended very much on what had actually
                             been asked for, but if the request for statements
                         .....was. general, then the statements themselves..should
                             be general.

                           He indicated that he would make himself available
                           for consultations or meetings at any time in
                           connection with this matter.


                    2}     I then spoke with Stuart Anderson and we discussed
                           what needed doing in the afternoon.  Essentially,
O                          this was to go through the self-taken statements
                           which had been prepared and I asked then to have a
                           discussion with Terry Wain about the format of the
                           report.  At this stage, X was able to have alook
                           at the letter which had been received    from theWest
                           Midlands Force and I noted that it was somewhat
                           ambiguous.  The request was for a recollection of
                           events prior to, during and after the match.   My
                           reading of this would have limited it to the day
                           in question but, on the whole, I felt    it
                           preferable to deal with the case as fully as
                           possible.


                   (3)     During the course of the afternoon, I went through
                           statements with A.C.C. Jackson {Operations),
                           Superintendent Roger Greenwood (Ground Commander),
                           Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield (Overall
                           Commander), Superintendent Roger Marshall
                           (Liverpool Sector Commander), Superintendent
                           Bernard Murray (Operations, Second in Command),


                                                                     /...   contd.
    12/11   '97   10:45   FAX 0113 284 7001     HAMMOND SUDDARDS                          @0




                          Superintendent David Chapman (Nottingham Forest
                          Sector Commander) and Chief Inspector Bob Creaser
                          who was effectively a Sector Commander under
                          Superintendent Marshall.

                          I made various suggestions for alterations to
                          their statements, the principal change being that
                          in respect of A.C.C. Jackson, who had not included
                          any of the details of the planning of the match.
                          It was agreed that he would be dealing with this
                          overnight and that I would attend at Sheffield
                          again on Wednesday to go through this.


                    4)    I looked through the statement of Inspector Hans
                          Davis, in charge of mounted Officers.  Although
                          there were one or two minor changes which I would
                          have suggested, he was away on leave and it was
                          felt appropriate that his statement should be
                          handed over.


                   (5      I then had further discussions with Terry Wain
                           and with Stuart Anderson.   The team have assembled
                           two sets of photographs dealing, respectively,
                           with the situation on both sides'of the Leppings
                           Lane turnstiles and inside the Leppings Lane
                          'tertacing.  The latter photographs were
                           particularly instructive because, in a time
                           sequence, they appeared to show various people
                           standing at or around the mouth of the tunnel
                           during the whole period from 2.45 p.m. to 3.05 p.m.,
                           which would cast serious doubt on the suggestions
                           that there was some sort of a surge through the
                           tunnel as the result of a gate or gates being
                           opened.  I was not able to take away copies of
^                         these photographs but I was supplied with a set
                           of copies of Police videos.   Later that evening,
                           I watched video number 14 which, interaliar shows
                          the situation inside and outside, the Leppings Lane
                          turnstiles.   The film goes into what is referred
                          to as elapsed time mode during the critical
                          period, so that there are effectively a series of
                           single shots with a gap of one to five seconds
                          between them.   This is not particularly helpful
                          but, insofar as anything can be made out, there
                          again does not appear to be a surge towards the
                          outside entrance of the tunnel, which has been
                           implicated in the disaster.


                  (6)     I asked various of the Officers about leave
                          commitments.   Superintendent Murray indicated
                          that he had leave booked from 11th to 26th June
                          and Superintendent Greenwood from 19th May to
                          2nd June.   I promised to bring these matters to
                          the attention of the Treasury Solicitor, although


                                                                   / . . . 1c o n t d .

                          I could give no promise that they might not be
                          called during indicated periods.

                     DATE;        9th May, 1989


                     RE:          HILLSBOROUGH




                     Attending (15            K. S. Anderson on telephone.

C)                                     (2 !   K. G. Holmes on telephone.

                                       (3)    Don Denton on telephone.


                         (1)     He telephoned in response to my fax and said that
                                 they understood there may be a need for editing.
                                 He was concerned as to whether he would actually
                                 be called .into the meeting this afternoon and I
                                 said that he should proceed with his existing
                               • arrangements and that we would fit in if' we---
                                 needed to consult him.   He said that he would be
                                 providing some sandwiches at 5-00 p.m.

                                So far as the report/proof is concerned, the
                                basic version is about 2" thick, but there are
                                a very large'"amount of appendices. I said that
                                this was not too bad and that if we could cut it
                                down to 1" thick, with just a few crucial
                                documents included as appendices to the report
                                itself, then I would be really quite satisfied.

                                He was a little concerned as to whether the work
                                would be done by ourselves or by the Police and
                                I said that- we would wait and see the size of the
                                task before going any further.


                         (2)    He telephoned to mention his concern about the
                                overall financial cost of the operation.  He was
                                referring to the MMI involvement on behalf of all
                                parties and wanted to send out a letter suggesting
                                that it should not be necessary for Leading and
                                Junior Counsel, a Partner and Assistant Solicitor
                                to be present all the way through the hearing.
                                I reassured him that I already had this point on

                          on the representation as regards Counsel, our
                          intention was that there should only be one
                          representative from Hammonds at any given time,
                          which might be myself, Belinda or Kate.  I said
                          that, nevertheless, there would be no harm in
                          putting the position on record.

                          I mentioned that we had a conference this
                          afternoon and also there was the conference on
                          Friday, which he knew about.  He said that he did
                          not require to attend either of these conferences.

                          We discussed the question of Counsel’s fees.  It
                          was agreed that I would try and do some research,
                          by way of telephoning up people who had been
                          concerned in the Cleveland inquiry, with a view
                          to discovering what Brief fees had been paid.   In
                          this particular instance, we both agreed that he
I)                        ought to specifically approve the Brief fee before
                          it was agreed and that this, in turn, might need
                          the approval of Steve Walker.


                   (3)     He told me that they had now received the formal
                           request from the West Midlands for self-taken
                           statements for .some 120 Officers, of whom they
                           already had Minutes or accounts of events■in
                         ■"respect of 100.

                          Obviously, no problem was presented in relation
                          to those who had not provided an account of events,
                          because they could be asked to do one specifically
                          for the West Midlands request.   As for the others,
                          there would need to be some scrutiny of the
                          existing documents.  Many of them might be suitable
                          to be handed on without further ado, but those
                          which included comment or matters of speculation
                          would probably have to be redone.   I said that we
                          might be able to deal with something of this this
                          afternoon, depending on the extent to which time
                          was taken up with other matters.

RE:   AUDIT TRIAL OF POLICE OFFICERS SELF TAKEN STATEMENTS,
      OR "OFFICERS RECOLLECTIONS"

Following on from my initial examination of the South Yorkshire Police Document Files from
which I prepared a schedule, a copy of which I gave to you when you visited Sheffield on
24 September 1997,1have now completed a further examination of non-indexed document files
within the Hillsborough archives.      In particular I have examined the personal files of
Chief Inspector Norman Bettison and Chief Superintendent Donald Denton and within these files
are a number of documents relating to the above.

I have produced a second schedule and copies of the appropriate parts of the documents
referred to which together with the first schedule show how in date order from 17 April 1989 to
8 June 1989:-

a)    The decision that officers should make records of their recollections was arrived a t (NB1)

b)    Solicitors acting for South Yorkshire Police were consulted. (D2)

c)    The officer leading the investigation for West Midlands Police was aware. (DIO)

d)    How South Yorkshire Police officers were made aware of what should be included in their
      statements. (D18)

e)    The discussion with Counsel which shows he was aware of "Self-service" statements. (D28
      and NB2)

f)   That Counsel for Lord Justice Taylor was aware of self-service statements. (D46)

g)   That statements would be vetted by South Yorkshire Police legal representatives prior to
     them being forwarded to West Midlands Police, (D48, DD1)

h)   That Counsel for Lord Justice Taylor requested statements be made by officers from other
     forces to the criteria adopted by South Yorkshire. (D51)

i)   That it was made clear to officers when statements were requested from them that they
     would be subjected to vetting by solicitors prior to being forwarded to West Midlands Police.
     (DD2, DD5).

j)   That requests from West Midlands Police for officers' statements were recorded, that
     arrangements were made for the statements to be obtained, they were forwarded to
     solicitors for vetting and the solicitors comments were retained. (DD3, DD4, DD5, DD6 and
      DD7)

k)    That the requests for statements, the forwarding of them for vetting and returned comments
      can be married together. (DD2 and DD3 with DD4; DD6 with DD7)

I)   That on 23 May 1989 therefore was circulated about amendments to statements, following
     concerns expressed by some officers. (D62)

m)    That updated guidance on statement content was given to officers along with the request
      for their statement. (DD8)

n)   That Treasury Solicitors acting for Lord Justice Taylor were aware of police officers initial
      submissions, amendments to them and the production of signed final versions and
      therefore by implication Lord Justice Taylor was also aware. (D90 and D91)

Once again I do not feel I can take this subject any further forward without actually interviewing
people involved in the process.

                 officers named in schedules
All the material was in the Hillsborough archives in the personal files of Chief Inspector
Norman Bettison (NB1 and NB2), now Assistant Chief Constable, West Yorkshire Police
and Chief Superintendent Donald Denton (DD1 to DD8), now retired.

The reference numbers are ones that I have given each document for ease of identification.
The documents from Chief Superintendent Denton’s fife are merely a sample from a section
of the file marked "Original Copies of Requests for Recollections WMP." The file also
contains handwritten lists of statements sent to Peter Metcalf for vetting and handwritten
lists of statements sent to the West Midlands Police Enquiry Team. In addition the
responses from Peter Metcalf, Solicitor at Hammond Suddards are only a sample from a 3
inch thick file of responses regarding statements of officers.

I assume we will get the video and the other documents back.    Any

briefs, accounts etc will remain privilege.   You ought to note that

pocket notebook entries can be called for and must be produced.       I

 suggest at this stage that we don't call this present investigation

 inquiry as such but that we look upon it as a gathering of evidence.

 You should be careful not to use the word inquiry.

               mean feat m        tne time that was available to ycu,

               I asx you to cast your nee as widely as you can,

               gather what you think myself.or Mr. Metcalfe, in

               our most perverse mood may require of you, and get

               it together for whenever you can.

DCC
               As to the scope of the enquiry, we focussed on a

               time up to about 3-15 or 3-30, do we need at this

               stage to focus on consequences?

MR. WOODWARD
               Yes, I think so, why did somebody not do something

               might be a question?              Why did someone die when

               they needn’t have done?                I t ’s those sorts of

               questions that we need to be aware of.

DCC
               As an example then, Ch. Supt. Duckenfield would

               need to- relate his account from the time of coming

               on duty up to the time that he eventually left

               duty, is that right?              (From Ch. Supt. Wain -

               reinforce this point at briefings)

MR. WOODWARD   Y es.

DCC            So we need all of this that has already been pre­

               pared, plus a summary of what happened thereafter?

MR. WOODWARD   Because there are these writs expected, we ought to

               have the information that is available now, to

               answer these ir. the Icr.s tern.
CH. SUPT. MOLE   Bur when does the incident finish?

MR. WOODWARD     I would suggest that your account, for      example,

                 .should be the tine you attended the ground to the

                  time ycu actually go home.      That would act as a

                  core for us to work from.    We would choose what we

                  want to leave in and what we want to leave out, and

                  where the emphasis should lie.

CH. SUPT. MOLE    But time scales go out of the window, I was there

                  all that time and can't remember what I was doing

                  at any given time.

DCC              You can only really do what you can do.

MR. WOODWARD     Yes, that   doesn't matter, do the best you      can.

                 Identification, for example, may not be relevant,

                 but put it- in, and get one or two others who may

                 want to put all their thoughts and experiences of

                 that day down on paper, as a sort of catharsis^ to

                 do the same.

DCC              So   who should be interview"?     For example, there are

                 Specials, there were thousands of officers on duty

                 in total.   What we have done so far is ask for

                 accounts from all Inspectors and above who were on

                 duty that day, ana also those officers of those

                 ranks who attended in response to Operations

                 Support (Action this)   Then for the PC's and

                 Sergeants, we have only actioned those who were at

                 the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

MR. WOODWARD     Yes, that's fine, we have to be sensible.
DCC


The main players in this are doing their own accounts is that O.K. or

would ycu rather someone take their statement.




Mr Woodward




It couldn't be better.   They can put all the things in thac they want

and we will sort them out.




DCC




So as far as the   aftermath is concerned a few of the major players

involved if they provided full accounts that would suffice?




Mr Metcalfe




Yes.   That would be fine.




There then followed a discussion about the trading of minutes with

Miss Nortcliffe.   This was agreed.




Mr Woodward




What are the terms of reference for the tribunal?




Mr Metcalfe




I know but I haven't got them with me.
Chief Supt Wain




What about a deadline for this inquiry?




Mr Woodward




Your heading in the right direction.   Don't let up now.




Mr Metcalfe




We could be asked to submit papers by the 5 May.




Mr Woodward




Lets see what happens on Friday.   If I said the 10 May what would you

say?




Chief Supt Wain




We would have to work to the 10 May.




Mr Woodward         ;




Right lets go for the 10 May, dependant on what happens on Friday.   I

would rather have the matter conducted properly rather than quickly, and

this will be stressed at the preliminary hearing on Friday.
Mr Metcalfe




Even if a couple of officers could give an account of afterwards that

would be something to work on.




Chief Supt Wain




Is there any special format for presenting the information?




Mr Woodward




As is this is more than acceptable.




DCC




What about indexing?




Mr Woodward




Don't worry about indexing yet.   It would help however if this was

transposed onto a word processor so that the thing could be moved

around.




Chief Supt Wain



It will be going onto the computer from tomorrow so we can do anything

we want with it then.
Mr Woodward




As a final point I would like it to be passed to your officers that

anycr.e can tell Mr Metcalfe in confidence anything they want.     Any

observations on how or why the incident happened.     They can place this

information in a sealed envelope and send it to Mr Hetcalfe or sent it

through you or telephone Mr Metcalfe and tell him.     (Raise at

brief ings).




DCC




And is this privileged information?




Mr Woodward




Yes, I wouldn't want to inhibit officers from feeling able to answer the

question of how and why the event occurred so confidentiality is a vital

ingredient.




Mr Metcalfe




We must start then with self served statements and I can follow up on

any questions that I have that arise as a result of those.




The meeting closed with exchanged compliments at 6 30 pm.

Appendices 1 - 2 1   except for Appendix 16 were then handed to

           involved at the Leppings Lane end of the football ground on

           No doubt you will advise me on the, propriety of supplying these
           internal statements to the West Midlands Police.

                   A request has been rec ei v e d today from the West Midlands
                   Enquiry Team for signed statements from the undermentioned
                   members of the Mounted Branch.      All these officers have
                   previously submitted reports for the i nformation of the
                   Chief Constable regarding their actions at Hillsborough.
                   It is the intention to submit those reports for vett ing by
                   the Solicitors acting for the Chief Constable prior to release
                   to the West Midlands Enquiry Team but they will not be so
                   released unless the officer concerned gives his consent.     It
                   may be that after v etting the Solicitors will recommend
                   certain clarifications and the removal of matters of opinion
                   which are not strictly evidence for the purpose of the Public
                   Inquiry.  If the officers consent to release it is intended to
                   produce the statements in typed'form for scrutiny and
                   signature by the officer concerned.
                   Would you please, as soon as possible, ensure that each officer
                   is seen individually and consent or otherwise to release
                   obtained, if possible before 9am Monday 15 May, 1989.

Ilis perceptions of the crowd position at page 5   do seem at odds with
moot other Officers;but, obviously, this should    not be altered if it
is his clear recollection.   I wonder what other   Officers he saw on
his walk down Leppings Lane and perhaps details    could be included.

20.7     C.I. Sumner

I would suggest substitution of the words "extreme urgency’1 for
"panic11 on page 4. As a personal matter, he may wish to consider
whether he wishes tp include the comment made to Mr. Lock on page 6.
Other Officers have;commented unfavourably on fans who asked whether
the gcune was going to re-start.

20.8     C.I; Creaser!

l believe that T hai'e already been through a statement with Mr
Creaser, but 1 do not know whether this is the original or an
amended version.    At all. events, I fee], that the comment about the
packing of pens on page 4 should either be expanded to include
detail of when (in his experience) this had been done, or the entire
section dealing with this should be deleted.      On page 7, there is a
reference to a request to delay the kick-off.      It is indicated that
this request was not acted upon, but can he say, with certainty,
that it was received.     If this is not within his own knowledge, then
J think this comment should be deleted.      Comments on page 8/9 re: Mr,
Greenwood could eit ier be expanded to indicate the nature of the
difficulties or omitted after the factual. comment that P ,C. Goodwill
was., deployed as Communications Officer to Mr. Greenwood.

20.9     C.I. Beal

This has been used s the basis for much of the background material
on planning for the match.   I do not think that this should be
duplicated in the s :atement and, accordingly, would suggest the
statement should ac :ually start at page 21, beginning with the words
"On 29th March ...

20.10    C.I. Boal (2!)

20 -u                 fcms   i
J think that the comment on page 5 to the effect that messages on
the air did not indicate the nature of the incident should either be
expanded on or deleted.

 20.12    P.l. Bennett.I
                                 dv A                                V

 He may wish to reconsider the use of the word "louts*1 at page 3.

Whi 1  they probab)*/ were louts, some of them may claim to have been
trying to escape serious injury - a claim which will be difficult to
disprove.

           SUBJECT:                   HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY



           The West Midlands Inquiry team have now requested that officers of your
           Division who are named in the attached schedules be asked to provide
           written accounts of their duties and activities relating to the FA Cup
           Semi-Final at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989*

           The written accounts, when obtained, will be subjected to the usual
           vetting procedures carried out by solicitors acting on behalf of the
           Chief Constable, prior to their submission to the West Midlands Police.

           Officers are being asked to co-operate    in providing their individual
           written accounts, but the wishes of       any officer who objects to
           disclosure will be respected.

           It is requested that the officers' accounts are:-

           1.   Handwritten in clear, legible writing.

           2.   Written on plain paper (not statement forms).

           3•   To include full name, age and date of birth,       rankandnumber,       and
                station.

                To be factual accounts only - expressions of feelings, opinions,
                hearsay evidence, etc, are not required.

           5*   To include Serial Numbers, where applicable,          and     details     of
                specific duties, times and locations.

           6.   To be signed at the end of each page.     Corrections, alterations,
                etc, must be clearly marked and initialled.

           Officers should take a copy of their written accounts which they should
           retain for any future reference.

           There is an urgent requirement for the submission of these accounts,'and
           it is therefore requested that they be prepared, collated and submitted
           on a 'section' basis to Detective Inspector Gunn, Hillsborough Incident
           Room, Force Headquarters, as soon as possible, and no later than Friday
           9 June 1989.

           Submissions  should not be delayed due to the unavailability of
           individual officers through Annual Leave, Sickness, etc.       Separate
           arrangements will be made to obtain written accounts from such officers
           as soon as it is possible to do so.

           Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

RE:     AUDIT TRIAL OF POLICE OFFICERS SELF TAKEN STATEMENTS,
        OR "OFFICERS RECOLLECTIONS"

Following on from my initial examination of the South Yorkshire Police Document Files from
which I prepared a schedule, a copy of which I gave to you when you visited Sheffield on
24 September 1997,1have now completed a further examination of non-indexed document files
within the Hillsborough archives.      In particular I have examined the personal files of
Chief Inspector Norman Bettison and Chief Superintendent Donald Denton and within these files
are a number of documents relating to the above.

I have produced a second schedule and copies of the appropriate parts of the documents
referred to which together with the first schedule show how in date order from 17 April 1989 to
8 June 1989:-

a)    The decision that officers should make records of their recollections was arrived at. (NB1)

b)    Solicitors acting for South Yorkshire Police were consulted. (D2)

c)    The officer leading the investigation for West Midlands Police was aware. (D10)

d)    How South Yorkshire Police officers were made aware of what should be included in their
       statements. (D18)

e)    The discussion with Counsel which shows he was aware of "Self-service" statements. (D28
       and NB2)




                                                  The person dealing with this correspondence is:
                                                  Superintendent Hepworth
                                                  Tel (0114) 296 3084     Fax (0114) 2963113
Page 2

f)   That Counsel for Lord Justice Taylor was aware of self-service statements. (D46)

g)   That statements would be vetted by South Yorkshire Police legal representativesprior       to
     them being forwarded to West Midlands Police. (D48, DD1)

h)   That Counsel for Lord Justice Taylor requested statements be made by officers fromother
     forces to the criteria adopted by South Yorkshire. (D51)

i)   That it was made clear to officers when statements were requested from them that they
     would be subjected to vetting by solicitors prior to being forwarded to West Midlands Police.
     (DD2, DD5).

j)   That requests from West Midlands Police for officers' statements were recorded, that
     arrangements were made for the statements to be obtained, they were forwarded to
     solicitors for vetting and the solicitors comments were retained. (DD3, DD4, DD5, DD6 and
     DD7)

k)   That the requests for statements, the forwarding of them for vetting and returned comments
     can be married together. (DD2 and DD3 with DD4; DD6 with DD7)

I)   That on 23 May 1989 therefore was circulated about amendments to statements, following
     concerns expressed by some officers. (D62)

m)   That updated guidance on statement content was given to officers along with the request
     for their statement. (DD8)

n)   That Treasury Solicitors acting for Lord Justice Taylor were aware of police officers initial
     submissions, amendments to them and the production of signed final versions and
     therefore by implication Lord Justice Taylor was also aware. (D90 and D91)

Once again I do not feel I can take this subject any further forward without actually interviewing
people involved in the process.

           We discussed earlier today the provision, to the West Midlands
           Inquiry Team, of copies of the statements prepared by officers
           involved at the Leppings Lane end of the football ground on
           15 April.  You agreed to vet the initial batch of those
           statements.

           I enclose firstly a copy of the letter received from the West
           Midlands Police giving reasons for the request; a copy of a list
           of officers from whom statements are required; and a bundle of
           statements for Serials 13, 14, 15, 17, 18 and 19 as ticked on
           the list, for your perusal.

           No doubt you will advise me on the_ propriety of supplying these
           internal statements to the West Midlands Police.

                A request has been received; today from the West Midlands
                En q uiry Team for signed statements from the undermentioned
                members of the Mounted Branch.     All these officers have
                previously submitted reports for the inform ation of the
                Chief Constable regarding, their actions at Hillsborough.
                It is the intention to submit those reports for v e t ting by
                the Solicitors acting for the Chief Constable prior to release
                to the West Midlands Enq uiry Team but they will not be so
                released unless the officer concerned gives his consent.      It
                may be that after v e t ting the Solicitors will recommend
                certain clarifications and the removal of matters of opinion
                whic h are not strictly evidence for the purpose of the Public
                Inquiry.    If the officers consent to release it is intended to
                produce the statements in typed'form for scrutiny and
                signature by the officer concerned.
                Would y ou please, as soon as possible, ensure that each officer
                is seen i n d i v i d u a l l y a n d consent or otherwise to release

Ilis perceptions of the crowd position at page 5   do seem at odds with
most other of ficera:but, obviously, this should   not be altered if it
is his clear recollection.   I wonder what other   Officers he saw on
his walk down Leppihgs Lane and perhaps details    could be included.

I would suggest substitution of the words "extreme urgency" for
"panic" on page 4. |As a personal matter, he may wish to consider
whether he wishes tp include the comment made to Mr. Lock on page 6.
Other Officers have;commented unfavourably on fans who asked whether
the game was going to re-start.

20.8    C.I.       C reaserI

1 believe that T have already been through a statement with Mr.
Creaser, but I do not. know whether this is the original or an
amended version.   At all events, I feel, that the comment- about the
packing of pens on Jjage 4 should either be expanded to include
detail of when (in bis experience) this had been done, or the entire
section dealing with this should be deleted.    On page 7, there is a
reference to a request to delay the kick-off.    It is indicated that
this request was not acted upon, but can he say, with certainty,
that it was received.   If this is not within his own knowledge, then
l think this comment should be deleted.    Comments on page 8/9 re: Mr,
Greenwood could either be expanded to indicate the nature of the
difficulties or omitted after the factual, comment that P.C. Goodwill
was. deployed as Communications Of.ficer to Mr. Greenwood.

20.9    C.I. Beal

This has been used     the basis for much of the background material
on planning for the;match.   I do not think that this should be
duplicated in the statement and, accordingly, would suggest the
statement should actually start at page 21, beginning with the words
"On 2 9th March ... j'

20.10    C.I.       Boal (21)        k. 'S*"fPr

20.11    P.T. Athorn j ^

J think that the comment on page 5 to the effect that messages on
the air did not indicate the nature of the incident should either be
expanded on or deleted.

20.12    P . 1.     Bennett-1

He may wish to reconsider the use of the word "louts" at page 3.



                                                                   contd.
H a m m o n d Su d d a r d s                                      NO




Whilst they probably were ^louts, some of them may claim to have been
trying to escape s e r o u s injury - a claim which will, be difficult to
disprove.



Yours sincerely,

FROM:   Chief Superintendent Denton

                                                           DATE:         2 June 1989

           SUBJECT:                   HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY


           The West Midlands Inquiry team have now requested that officers of your
           Division who are named in the attached schedules be asked to provide
           written accounts of their duties and activities relating to the FA Cup
           Semi-Final at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989-

           The written accounts, when obtained, will be subjected to the usual
           vetting procedures carried out by solicitors acting on behalf of the
           Chief Constable, prior to their submission to the West Midlands Police.

           Officers are being asked to co-operate    in providing     their individual
           written accounts, but the wishes of       any officer      who objects to
           disclosure will be respected.

           It is requested that the officers' accounts are:-

           1.   Handwritten in clear, legible writing.

           2.   Written on plain paper (not statement forms).

           3.   To include full name, age and date of birth,       rankandnumber,     and
                station.

                To be factual accounts only - expressions of feelings,        opinions,
                hearsay evidence, etc, are not required.

           5.   To include Serial Numbers, where applicable,          and   details    of
                specific duties, times and locations.

           6.   To be signed at the end of each page.     Corrections, alterations,
                etc, must be clearly marked and initialled.

           Officers should take a copy'of their written accounts which they should
           retain for any future reference.

           There is an urgent requirement for the submission of these accounts,'and
           it is therefore requested that they be prepared, collated and submitted
           on a ’section’ basis to Detective Inspector Gunn, Hillsborough Incident
           Room, Force Headquarters, as soon as possible, and no later than Friday
           9 June 1989-

           Submissions  should not be delayed due to the unavailability of
           individual officers through Annual Leave, Sickness, etc.       Separate
           arrangements will be made to obtain written accounts from such officers
           as soon as it is possible to do so.

           Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S INQUIRY INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

        I have now been asked by Counsel appointed by Lord Justice Taylor to request
        from a selected number of police officers their recollections, In writing,
        of what happened at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989. The reason for my
        request is that I understand that a number of your officers performed duty
        on a mutual aid basis. Counsel are keen to obtain a cross section of
        accounts as soon as possible.

        I would like to make                    arrangements as soon as convenient, through a Liaison
        Officer whom you may                    care to appoint, to receive these written submissions
        as soon as possible.                     There will be no need for ray officers to see yours
        personally, although                    a proof of continuity will be necessary, but I would
        hope that this could                    easily be achieved through your Liaison Officer.

        The invitation to submit written recollections is based on criteria that I
        have already adopted with South Yorkshire Police officers. That is,
        there will be no interviews Just simple requests to which the officer will
        be free to decide what he or she wishes to say. When supplying any written
        submission the officer will be free to keep a copy.  I have also been asked
        by Mr P Wright, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, if a copy of
        any submission can be made available; I have no objections nor have Counsel
        appointed by Lord Justice Taylor.

        In this respect copies of any written submissions can be forwarded direct
        by you to Mr Wright at his Sheffield Police Headquarters.

        It would be helpful if I could arrange for one of my senior officers to
        contact your Liaison Officer in the next few days.

        Attached to this letter is the list of officers who I understand were
        seconded from your Force.

                        SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE RECOLLECTIONS

     Thank you for your letter of today's date, which we have already discussed.

    The main difference between the initial and final versions of the South
    shire Police Officers1 statements is that any expressions of opinion we e
;as“i understand it, on the advice of Mr. Woodward) removed from the final
-Vrsion   As I understand it, Andrew Collins' view is that there is absolu e y
no reason for excluding such expressions of opinion when they touch on matters
relevant to the Public Inquiry and that, in the circumstances, there is no
objection in principle to written statements containing such opinions being
submitted to the Inquiry.
      nearly in view of the personal undertaking which you have given to the
 Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, Andrew Collins agrees that it would not be
 appropriate to use the original statement for the purposes of the Inquiry when
 Thi- has been superseded by a subsequent statement. However, what I understand
 raav’have happened in the case of the Officer who gave his evidence yesterday is
 that the original unamended statement was circulated because of the need to
 circulate statements to all parties as iruch in advance of the calling of the
 S ^ m t wKne SS s as possible and because at the time of circulation of the
  relevant batch of witness statements the revised, f i n a l ™ r s w n ofthe
  statement in question had not ^e1:   e h            I understand thatintotai^

  ■here a r e three eases where this has been necessary. P.C.s Best Huckstepp ana
  m l ^ r t h . However, in such cases only the final, revised version of the
  statement was given to the press.
        I trust that this problem will not recur in the future.

        I have not copied this letter to the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire
          . but am naturally happy for you to do so.

SUBJECT:          HILLSBOROUGH


Thank you very much for your "note for file" arising from the meeting of the Senior Command
Team on Monday 28 July 1997.

I note that it is confidential and not part of the SCT minutes, as such.

The following points arise:

1.     The note records the feeling of the meeting that there is a need, from the point of view of
       South Yorkshire Police, to scope the assertion which has been made by Inspector Calvert
       that there was material (potentially evidence) which might have been available, but was not
       presented to the Taylor Inquiry, DPP, AG, or Chief Constable, because it was expunged
       from draft statements.

2.     Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's terms of reference are to ascertain whether any evidence exists
       relating to the Hillsborough Disaster, which was not available, and to advise upon its
       significance and relevance to the enquiry or to the role of the respective officers, mentioned
       above. A copy of the terms of reference is attached. I advise that the utmost care must be
       given to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith making the judgement whether the material is new, its
       relevance and significance in accordance with the terms of reference. Where there is any
       doubt, the material referred to in para. 1 (above) must be placed before him.




                                                                           -5. •

Mole - Significant to know when the perimeter gates were closed.

DCC - 2.^5 pn Roger asking for the gates to be opened.

CC. - Understand the business about the log bat it is
going-to:make something of. Noe criticising (Murray).

CC - For Leppings Lane we have a series of photographs which in themselves are
good enough for the log as to what is happening. Whilst    the north stand
problem was recognised, the problem associated with gateC and the    opening of
gate C and the control of^movement of people ones they were going^ through gate




Marshall - Inspector White was believed in difficulties through the
turnstiles.  Inspector Bennett climbed over the top of the parapit. Inspector
Bennett asked for additional serials because he could see the problem.

Eight serials deployed at 2.50 pm.

CC - It does not mean that we should not be seeking to find the evidence and.
direct the encuiry team to it. difficulties seem to be the Club - seeing the
gatemen - people without tickets trying to get into the ground etc.

CC -   How   do   we   proceed   from   here?


McKay - Have concentrated on securing evidence and setting up the machinery
ready to go, Although we have interviewed one :r two people we haven't taken
statements.  So far.as the enquiry team is concerned - set down your
recollections over the next few days. We should be doing that with officers
at the game.  Prepared a proforma to all officers.

CC - Very good point - ail officers at the game to make records of their
recollections.

McKay - Any other area I should be taking action?

CC - Paint the picture of what was taking place in the first instance -
identify those officers in the area - ask the officers to pull together .their
recollections not only in terms of what they did but what they saw,

Mole - Value cf stewards being seen.

McKay - Need to be doing  house-to-house enquiries, pubs,ambulance   men etc.
Should get early contact with whoever is running the enquiry.

CC - Identify the persons who were on that turnstile and ask the question what
were your perceptions of it, capture that, and direct the attention of the
enquiry team.
                                                                        ■           -V/ '

McKay - Should we be circulating Merseyside asking for officers who were at
the club?

CC - The enquiry team will clearly do that (see the injured persons.) . Rati
let the enquiry team see the injured people.  Need to pull out the evidence

    RE: REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM HILLSBOROUGH ARCHIVES

    During the visit of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, Chris Catherall and yourself to the
    Hillsborough Archives at Heeley on Wednesday 24 September 1997, you made a number of
    requests to us for information, which you agreed to put in writing. To date we have not received
    these.

   Of the two requests we have already responded to, one on 24 September 1997 was to supply
 , transcripts of the main and mini inquests and the other was the provision of copies of the plans of
6 the Leppings Lane terrace reference C275 and C276, which we forwarded on
   30 September 1997.

    If my memory serves me correctly the other requests were:-

/ Report on continued research into amendment of officers' recollections;

   Research and report on the suggestion that officers were coached to give evidence to
-2 Lord Justice Taylor's enquiry;

3    R e s e a rc h   and report on the provision of video tapes to Yorkshire Television;

*    Examine the copy video tape provided by yourself via Trevor Hicks and identify where the
^    various shots are from;




                                                                                                    i
                                                    -2-




    Research any breach of the law by Granada Television                     in the approach       to   a
    Hillsborough Inquest Jury Member;

 y Prepare a report on policy and procedure for the release of Hillsborough Documentation to
    interested parties;

/ q Report to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith on a number of outcomes from the civil actions.
    Incidentally, neither Ken Greenway nor myself has sufficient knowledge, nor the information to
    supply the details which you are likely to request about the civil actions, particularly as most of
    them were confidential. The outcomes are not within the knowledge of the force solicitor,
    Alan Walker either. I therefore have in mind to write to Peter Metcalf of Hammond Suddards
    Solicitors at Empire House, 10 Piccadilly, Bradford BD1 3LR, who acted for
    South Yorkshire Police and our Insurers in these hearings, asking him if he will respond to your
    request once we receive it, unless of course you wish to write to him directly. I will not action this
    further until I hear from you.

    Work is progressing on the other requests and I shall soon be in a position to start responding.

    Finally, I believe there was a suggestion that Chris Catherall should revisit Heeley to examine the
    police officers' statements and the amendments made to them. Can you inform me if this is to
    take place and a likely date, please.

roof of evidence.  Chief Supt Wain asked DCC to contact Mervyn Jones (ACC(O),
est Midlands Police) re. the following points:-

    a.     to inform Mr Jones that SYP completing self-serving statements
           covering officers down to inspectors per se and also all
           officers at the Leppings Lane end of the ground;

    d.     ask if we could have sight again of our:-

              i)   videos
             ii)   photographs
            iii)   any logs, notes or briefing reports West Midlands have seized
             iv)   completed location questionnaires
              v)   copy of the Force Control RACAL 15 tape




                               CLIPBOARD 11 - INSURERS


            Suggest to Mr Jones the benefit of him appointing a liaison
            officer with regard to Chief Supt Wain's task thereby
            avoiding the need to contact Mr Jones unnecessarily.


12.45 pm      DCC spoke with Mr Jones re. the above.

He said that Mr Dear is currently with the Judge considering our request which
will include everything in which the South Yorkshire Police have property and
certainly include all the items referred to above at (b - 25.4.89} which I
read out in detail.

Concerning the intention to obtain self-serving statements down to the rank of
inspector and from all officers involved at the Leppings Lane end of the
ground, he saw no problem with that whatsoever, understands that we need to be
getting on with this quickly, has no worries over this'but thanked us for
informing him of our intended action.

Forgot to mention liaison officer arrangement - Chief Supt Wain to arrange
this himself.                                                     &

 Your task

 Various documents have been scrutinised to extract details of officers on
 duty at Leppings Lane end of the ground.   Other officers who have relevant
 information have also been included.

 The present list runs to some 120 - 140 names.     These are all entered on
 a Holmes computer which is supporting this enquiry.     You will be issued -
 after this enquiry - with a list of officers who you are to see.
 Chief Inspector Betti son will hand each of you a proforma sheet.

 There may be some officers who have already made statements to the West
 Midlands team or for some other reason. We are negotiating with West Midlands
 tor copies of any statements - In the meantime the officers should be required
 to provide the self-written account that is sought. They should aim to be
 accurate, and consistent with any previous statements with the proviso that
 our cut-off point is the game being brought to a halt.

(On this Point either Inspector Ensor or Cleverly will be allocated Inspector
Woodward F2 - Chief Inspector Bettison has a copy of a previous self-prepared
statement of Woodwards submitted in a de-briefing exercise - whichever of
you is allocated Woodward please see Chief Inspector Bettison).

 A further        document which you should    hand to each officer is a copy of the
 map being        circulated now.   In order    to assist the officers to be accurate
     i j Y'      accounts " and 1:0 achieve    some consistency in description - they
 should be       encouraged to refer to this   map.

It clearly shows some important features, namely the three gates at the
Leppings Lane turnstiles - A, B and C. We believe that Gate C is the qate
that was opened to relieve the crush outside.

The map also denotes the various enclosures, so that we know which enclosure
the officers are referring to.

    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S INQUIRY INTO THE Hlf.i .SBO^OUGH DISASTER

    I have now been asked by Counsel appointed by Lord Justice Taylor to request
    from a selected number of your officers their recollections in writing, of
    what happened at Hillsborough on 15th April 1989. The criterion for
    selection is based on an examination of your operation order which identifies
    those police officers who were likely to be at Leppings Lane end, both
    inside arid outside the ground. Counsel are keen to obtain a
    cross-section of accounts well before 15th May 1989 when the Hearings begin.

    I would like to make arrangements with your liaison officer to receive as
    many written submissions as possible. There will be no need for my officers
    to see yours personally, although a proof of continuity will be necessary
    but I would hope this could be easily achieved through your liaison officer,

    I am also aware that some of your officers are still off duty sick, which
    might present pr&tical difficulties.    I would like to stress that
    Counsel's request through me is not intended to add to any distress that
    some may be suffering.  Consequently, I leave it to your discretion to
    manage this aspect as you see fit". The Police Federation will also have
    an interest and may be contemplating obtaining legal advice on an individual
    or collective basis, or both. To save time, therefore, I have taken the
    liberty of copying this letter to the:?! for their information.

    The Invitation to submit written recollections follows the same criteria as
    for the senior officers before; in that there will be no interview’s, just
    requests to which the officer will be free to decide what he or she wishes
    to do. In supplying any written*submission the officer will be free to
    keep a copy.

    I hope this is of assistance to you.   If there is anything further you
    need to know please do not hesitate to contact me, .In order to progress,
    and in anticipation of your support, I have asked my Superintendent Taylor
    at Furniva.l House to contact Chief Superintendent Don Denton on the
    morning of Monday 8 th May 1989 to discuss arrangements.

    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR’S INQUIRY INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

   I have now been asked by Counsel appointed by Lord Justice Taylor to request
   from a selected number of police officers their recollections, in writing,
   of what happened at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.  The reason for my
   request is that I understand that a number of your officers performed duty
   on a mutual aid basis.  Counsel are keen to obtain a cross section of
   accounts as soon as possible.

   I would like to make              arrangements as soon as convenient, through a Liaison
   Officer whom you may              care to appoint, to receive these written submissions
   as soon as possible.               There will be no need for my officers to see yours
   personally, although              a proof of continuity will be necessary, but I would
   hope that this could              easily be achieved through your Liaison Officer.

   The invitation to submit written recollections is based on criteria that I
   have already adopted with South Yorkshire Police officers.  That is,
   there will be no interviews just simple requests to which the officer will
   be free to decide what he or she wishes to say.  When supplying any written
   submission the officer will be free to keep a copy.  I have also been asked
   by Mr P Wright, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, if a copy of
   any submission can be made available; I have no objections nor have Counsel
   appointed by Lord Justice Taylor.

   In this respect copies of any written submissions can be forwarded direct
   by you to Mr Wright at his Sheffield Police Headquarters.

   It would be helpful if I could arrange for one of my senior officers to
   contact your Liaison Officer in the next few days.

   Attached to this letter is the list of officers who I understand were
   seconded from your Force.

                       On the 22 May an update in respect of the Hillsborough Inquiry was
                       forwarded for your information and in order that it may be brought
                       to the attention of all other members of the force.

                       In particular, reference was made to officers who, for one reason
                       or another, may be people the Inquiry would wish to hear from,
                       their names being appended on a schedule.

                       I wish to affirm that the update was for the Information of every­
                       one, and the comments contained therein should be disseminated to
                       all officers on your division not merely those named in the
                       appendices.

                       I am advised that some officers have expressed concern regarding
                       the editing of their original statements prior to submission to
                       the West Midlands Police. The attached circular explains fully
                       the reasons for this course of action and should be brought to
                       the attention of all your officers.

                  I wish to affirm that the update was for the information of every­
                  one, and the comments contained therein should be disseminated to
                  all officers on your division not merely those named in the
                  appendices.

                  I am advised that some officers have expressed concern regarding
                  the editing of their original statements prior to submission to
                  the West Midlands Police. The attached circular explains fully
                  the reasons for this course of action and should be brought to
                  the attention of all your officers.

         written and despatched to Treasury Solicitors. (Second copy attached).

         I am most concerned that when I make an undertaking with you or your
         senior officers that it is observed. It would appear yesterday in the
         hearings that that agreement was compromised as a result of the way in
         which Counsel interviewed one of your officers.  It may be, of course,
         that Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police have already agreed with
         Mr Andrew Collins QC that the initial submissions could be referred to
         in the hearing. However, I am not at this time privy to such an
         agreement. No doubt, in due course, when Treasury Solicitors reply to my

             SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE RECOLLECTIONS

            You will recall in the early stages, because of the slowness of the
            supply of written recollections from South Yorkshire Police Officers, it
            was agreed that we would take from them their initial submissions which
            would be later superseded by their signed final versions, after they had
            been checked by their appropriate legal advice. I personally made an
            undertaking with the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police that only
            the final versions would be the ones used in the Public Inquiry and this
            was after discussion with you.

            I am concerned that yesterday an officer was referred to his initial

            You will recall in the early stages, becauseof the slowness of the
            supply of written recollections from South Yorkshire Police Officers, it
            was agreed that we would take from them their initial submissions which
            would be later superseded by their signed final versions, after they had
            been checked by their appropriate legal advice.  I personally made an
            undertaking with the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police that only
            the final versions would be the ones used in the Public Inquiry and this
            was after discussion with you.

            I am concerned that yesterday an officer was referred to his initial
            submission which contained opinion that had subsequently been removed
            from his final account.    Given the undertaking I made to South Yorkshire
            Police I would hope thatthis would not happen in the future because it

                      SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE RECOLLECTIONS

    Thank you for your letter of today's date, which we have already discussed.

    The main difference between the initial and final versions of the South
Yorkshire Police Officers' statements is that any expressions of opinion were
(as I understand it, on the advice of Mr. Woodward) removed from the final
version. As I understand it, Andrew Collins' view is that there is absolutely
no reason for excluding such expressions of opinion when they touch on matters
relevant to the Public Inquiry and that, in the circumstances, there is no
objection in principle to written statements containing such opinions being
submitted to the Inquiry.

    Clearly, in view of the personal undertaking which you have given to the
Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, Andrew Collins agrees that it would not be
appropriate to use the original statement for the purposes of the Inquiry when
this has been superseded by a subsequent statement. However, what I understand
may have happened in the case of the Officer who gave his evidence yesterday is
that the original unamended statement was circulated because of the need to
circulate statements to all parties as nouch in advance of the calling of the
relevant witnesses as possible and because at the time of circulation of the
relevant batch of witness statements the revised, final version of the
statement in question had not yet been received. I understand that in total
there are three cases where this has been necessary: P.C.s Best, Huckstepp and
Illingworth. However, in such cases only the final, revised version of the
statement was given to the press.

    I trust that this problem will not recur in the future.

    I have not copied this letter to the Chief Constable of Soi
Police, but am naturally happy for you to do so.

                      SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE RECOLLECTIONS

   Thank you for your letter of today's date, which we have already discussed.

    The main difference between the initial and final versions of the South
Yorkshire Police Officers' statements is that any expressions of opinion were
(as I understand it, on the advice of Mr. Woodward) removed from the final
version. As I understand it, Andrew Collins' view is that there is absolutely
no reason for excluding such expressions of opinion when they touch on matters
relevant to the Public Inquiry and that, in the circumstances, there is no
objection in principle to written statements containing such opinions being
submitted to the Inquiry.

    Clearly, in view of the personal undertaking which you have given to the
Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, Andrew Collins agrees that it would not be
appropriate to use the original statement for the purposes of the Inquiry when
this has been superseded by a subsequent statement. However, what I understand
may have happened in the case of the Officer who gave his evidence yesterday is
that the original unamended statement was circulated because of the need to
circulate statements to all parties as rnuch in advance of the calling of the
relevant witnesses as possible and because at the time of circulation of the
relevant batch of witness statements the revised, final version of the
statement in question had not yet been received. I understand that in total
there are three cases where this has been necessary: P.C.s Best, Huckstepp and
Illingworth. However, in such cases only the final, revised version of the
statement was given to the press.

    I trust that this problem will not recur in the future.

    I have not copied this letter to the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire
Police, but am naturally happy for you to do so.

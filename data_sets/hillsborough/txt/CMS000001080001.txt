SUBMISSION OF H.E. WRIGHT, QFSM,MIFireE,FBIM, CHIEF FIRE OFFICER, SOUTH
YORKSHIRE COUNTY FIRE SERVICE, TO THE COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO THE
DISASTER AT THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM. SHEFFIELD, ON 15TH APRIL, 19897




1.      Introduction



        I feel sure that all the members of the Safety of               Sports   Grounds

        Working     Party, including myself, never believed that the disaster

        at    the   Hillsborough      Stadium,    Sheffield,    could     ever    occur.

        However,     it   did,    and having given positive thought as to why it

        happened and what steps might be taken to obviate the               possibility

        of , repetition          at   any   stadium,      I    submit     thefollowing

        recommendations for consideration.           In making these I am conscious

        of    the need to put forward practical suggestions capable of being

        implemented quickly and relatively easily.



2.      Recommendations



2.1     Ingress

        To prevent any unduly large crowd           from being     kept    waiting    for

        admission     and   at the same time minimising the consequent dangers

        of crushing and illegal entry:-



2.1.1   Separate turnstiles should be provided topermit             access       to each

        stand, terrace and pen within the stadium.



2.1.2   The    turnstiles    providingthe        access mentioned in 2.1.1           above

        should be in sufficient number to           be   capable   of     admitting the

        capacity     calculated using       Chapter      16 of the Guide to Safety at

        Sports Grounds in not more than 1 hour, using the notional rate of

        750 persons/turnstile/hour.
Where       there    are     insufficient turnstiles to satisfy 2.1.2 above,

either:

 (i)    additional turnstiles must be provided, or



(ii)    the capacity             of   each    stand,   terrace       or    pen   should be

        restricted          to    the number        of spectators that the existing

        turnstiles will admit using the notional rate mentioned                            in

        2.1.2 above.



Chapter       5     of    the     Guide      to   Safety at Sports Grounds should be

amended to satisfy the above and cross referenced to Chapter 16.



In effect the capacity of each stand, terrace and pen will be                             the

lowest figure produced based on exit capacity, standing or seating

area and the capacity of the turnstiles.



The factor which determines the capacity should be recorded on the

General Safety Certificate for each stand, terrace and pen.



Control of Numbers



There       has     never been a legal stipulation in the Safety of Sports

Grounds Act 1975, that required the capacity of                           individual     parts

of      a     sports       ground to be            specified    in    a General        Safety

Certificate.



Section 2(2) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act,                          which   did     set

out     matters          which    had     to be included, was replaced by Section

19(2) (a) of the Fire Safety and Safety of                     Places      of    Sport    Act,

1987, with effect from 1st January, 1988.
        The   present position is that the Secretary of State now has power

        to    issue   Regulations     detailing     the     matters   to be     covered,

        including     capacities,     but    has    not   yet done so, therefore each

        authority is free to        apply whatever        conditions    it wishes      to,

        therefore:-



2.2.1   The    Secretary of State should urgently make Regulations regarding

        the terms and conditions as may be included in the General                   Safety

        Certificate.       This    should include a requirement for the capacity

        of each stand, terrace and pen to be specified.



2.3     Perimeter Fences



        Planned means designed to allow for the              quick    release   of    crowd

        pressure need to be clearly specified in guidance to authorities.



        Chapter 15, paragraph 215 of the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds

        provides guidance on the width but            not    the   frequency    at which

        gates should be provided in perimeter fences.



        The    provision    of    perimeter fences goes against all professional

        training of Fire Service Officers and it is hoped                that   a better

        solution might be found.



2.3.1   Perimeter     fences      should    only be required where it can be shown

        that they are absolutely necessary and the continuing provision of

        all existing fences should be reviewed in this light.




                                            - 3 -
An    accepted      professional body should be requested as a matter of

urgency to produce a standard specification for a perimeter                 fence

for    use    at    sports grounds.     I recommend that this specification

provide for sections to be quickly and              easily   removed    from     the

perimeter track side by authorised personnel in an emergency.



When    available,          this standard should be satisfied at allgrounds

where perimeter            fences are considered necessary.



Where perimeter            fences are required then gates, not less than           1.1

metre in width,must be provided to allow spectators to be                 quickly

evacuated      onto     the    pitch   perimeter.     Such   gates     should     be

sufficient         in   number   to provide for the evacuation of each area

within 3 minutes, with a minimum provision for each area of 2 such

gates.       Chapter 15, paragraph 215 of the Guide to Safety at Sports

Grounds should be amended accordingly.



A level stepping arrangement should be provided through                  gates    to

avoid    tripping hazards and wherever possible such gates should be

in line with radial gangways.            Gate-release fastenings        should    be

capable       of    easy    and immediate release from the pitch side only,

especially under crowd pressure.



Stewards



It is vital that the number of stewards on duty are sufficient                     £n

number, adequately trained and effective in their duties.



I     recommend that in broad terms a syllabus to enable satisfactory

training for stewards, together with            examination     standards        with

regard to their duties, be established on a national basis.
2.4.2   The   Police should be the examining authority for stewards and the

        passing of the examination will enable those so              qualified      to    be

        employed if so capable as stewards at sports grounds.



2.4.3   The   standard     of    examination should reflect the responsibilities

        and duties of each steward.



2.4.4   A Chief   Steward       should    be     appointed   to   take   charge    of    all

        stewards.



2.4.5   Senior Stewards should be appointed to take charge of the stewards

        in a defined area of the ground.



2.4.6   All stewards should be readily identifiable when undertaking their

        duties    and I suggest that this be in the form of coloured jerkins

        each separately numbered to enable each steward to                be    identified

        from a distance.



2.5     Communication



2.5.1   The use of the public address system to provide advice to stewards

        and Police should be fully realised, especially when                noise       seems

        to    apparently    reduce       the    overall   effectiveness    of     hand held

        radios.   Training in the use of this equipment should be                 provided

        for   those   who       use the equipment to instigate messages and those

        who are expected to react to them.




                                               - 5 -
2.5.2   Should any decision be made to evacuate any part of a stadium                               for

        whatever         reason, I suggest that each emergency service be alerted

        even if their attendance may not be required at that                       time.           This

        will       provide     a pre-warning during which basic requirements as to

        the correct address to which a                response may        be    needed     can be

        satisfied, together with the need for a likely rendezvous point.



        Should       the     situation      develop to the point of needing a response

        from another or all emergency services a much                     briefer      call        will

        ensure this.



2.5.3   I    understand        that    the    Police    have made recommendations to the

        Inquiry which suggest either



            (i)    A senior officer of each of the                 emergency    services      be     in

                   attendance at the Police control box at a stadium, or



        (ii)       the     Police     control   box     at the stadium is provided with a

                   private wire         connection      to    the    Control    room     of        each

                   emergency service.



        My        opinions     regarding these         suggestions are not supportive.                I

        understand that at Hillsborough on 15th April the                       Police        in    the

        control box were not aware of the difficulties that existed on the

        West Terrace.          Should this be so then I would assume that                  a       Fire

        Service Officer             would    have     equal   difficulty but even when the

        problem was identified he would                 be    of    little     use without          the

        manpower         and   equipment      that     he would undoubtedly request. The

        advantage would, therefore seem to                    be    related to      knowing         the

        abilities of the Service.



                                                - 6 -
The provision of a senior Fire Service Officer to achieve this on,

hopefully, the extremely infrequent               occasions        when   it       will   be

required      would       seem to    be   an     over-provision which              could be

achieved more easily by close liaison between the Services.



I also understand that the Police were in communication with their

own main        control      room    at Police Headquarters which already has

private      wire     connection     to   each    of the          emergency    services.

Private wire connections from each of the stadiums provided with a

safety certificate, or likely to require such in the                          future,     to

each    of    the     emergency      services     control rooms would also be an

extremely expensive way of providing good information to the other

Services which good training and liaison should satisfy.



Liaison



Regular liaison between all those responsible for implementing the

requirements         of    the   Safety    of    Sports      Grounds Act        and       the

respective          clubs     should      take    place      to    provide     a    greater

understanding of the problems being met.



The arrangements proposed by the                Club   and    Police,     where       these

differ       from    those    specified       in the General Safety Certificate,

should be considered by the appropriate                 local       authority       working

party      to       ensure    that    these     will   not    affect      other      safety

precautions.
2.7     Other Matters



2.7.1   The Club managements of each ground           requiring    a    General       Safety

        Certificate     should   be    required     to    audit the safety provisions

        within their ground considering the different uses to which                    they

        are    put.    A full written report should be presented to the local

        authority for consideration.          The full satisfaction of         the    Guide

        to Safety at Sports Grounds should be used for such audit.



        Any    proposed changes to the ground which would affect any part of

        the safety precautions should be accompanied              by    a   safety     audit

        report    identifying    the    effects     of    the proposals and the steps

        proposed to compensate for them.            The   proposals     and   the     report

        should    be   submitted to the local authority for consideration and

        approval under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act prior to any other

        submission for approval.



2.7.2     In   order to undertake such duties effectively it must be realised

        that manpower resources are needed and this should be catered                    for

          in   the     departments     of     local       authorities       holding     such

          responsibilities.

Dear Sir,

HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST

Thank you for your letter of 1st May, 1991, which I note you have copied to
the Home Secretary     and Dr. Helen Muir.   I have noted your observations and
shall of course be pleased to assist in any way I can any initiatives to find
solutions which are reasonably likely to improve spectator safety at sports
grounds.

To a very large extent I believe that the major issues of safety arising from
Hillsborough have been addressed by Lord Justice Taylor in his Interim and
Final Reports. The 76 recommendations in the Report covered all the major
issues which arose during the Inquiry. Apart from the move to all-seated
accommodation which should naturally create better control over crowd numbers
and improve the comfort of spectators, it was recommended that an Advisory
Design Council be set up, together with a National Inspectorate and Review
Body, and that the Green Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds be reviewed.

The recommendations have been accepted by the Government and steps have been
put in hand to ensure their implementation. My experience in South Yorkshire
is that the recommendations provided in the reports are being treated as
requirements and you will be aware that the Green Guide has been revised by
the Home Office inaccordance with the Report and the recommendations of the
Technical Working Party (see Appendix 3 of the Report).
I believe that the safe organisation of any match is achieved jointly by the
Police and the Club Management, both of whom ideally require the co-operation
of spectators which sadly is not always the case. They, unlike the Fire
Service and other     members of the Advisory Group who do not as a matter of
course attend matches, are in attendance/control on match days.    I consider
effective ground management to be an absolutely essential feature in achieving
safety in full realisation that good management can compensate for some less
than ideal aspects resulting from the existing nature of grounds, whereas poor
management can make an otherwise ideal situation unsafe.        I am pleased
therefore to note the increased emphasis upon management responsibilities in
Section 2 of the revised Green Guide.

As you may realise, in the aftermath of the disaster I gave positive thought
as to how it happened and what steps might be taken to prevent any repetition.
In so doing I was conscious of the need to put forward practical suggestions
capable of being implemented    quickly and relatively easily. I therefore
enclose for your information a copy of my submission to Lord Justice Taylor.

I have copied this letter to the Home Secretary and Dr. Muir for their
information.   Should you wish to discuss any aspect further please do not
hesitate to contact me again.

Yours faithfully,



(Sgd.)   H.E. Wright

Chief Fire Officer.

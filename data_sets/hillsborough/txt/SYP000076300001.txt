from Garesway                   coaches                  they     had t o      hire      other      coaches             there     was      that

many g o i n g .                The       seat       cost       me £ 7 . 3 0 .



I   did        travel          on my own a l t h o u g h                there      were      some f a m i l i a r         faces       on t h e

We l e f t          Ashton          in    Ma k e r f i e l d      at    1140hrs          (1140)     we w e r e          supposed t o

ors was f u l l            -• I         think       it    was a        32     seater«



We we nt            on t h e        M6 motc^/way arid                  then       onto    the     M56       it     was a t     the    end o f

roundabout                at    about         1300hrs           (1300)        then     the      flow     along          the    r o a d was

off     and on.                 I       would       say    that        this    was       because       of        the    vol ume      of    fans

going          to    the       match.               We f o l l o w e d      signs      for    Barnsley             and    crossed          the

Already             there       was       people          at    the     back      of   the      c oa ch mo a n i n g          that    we w e r e

In     my       opinion             the       driver        knew              where         he    was          going        there          was       another

Garesway              coach           behind         us.              I       knew      we       were          getting           near       to       the       ground

as     there          were          fans       walking           down            both        sides             of    the        road       on    the

pavement.                      On     the      right        of        the        dual        carriageway                    going          the       other          way

were        a    number             of    coaches           already                 parked            up       and     empty.




Our       coach         stopped               and    the      driver'               asked         a    policeman                 where          to    park,          I

was       sittin g             at     the      front        at        the        side        of       the       driver           -    we    were          directed

down        the       dual          carriageway               to          a    roundabout                  we       then        doubled          back          on    the

dual        carriageway                   we     pulled          in           about         1/2       mile          from        this       roundabout

behind           the       parked             coaches.                    We     a ll       then       got          off    and        began          to    walk

Everybody               was         walking          fast        --       there         were          Liverpool                 fans       everywhere.

Everyone              was       in       good       sp ir its             singing            away          I    was       looking           forward             to       a

I    just       followed                 the     stream          of           fans      round          the          roundabout             and        into

She was        saying       that    she       couldn't    breathe       — I told her to            put her head

up and to take              small       breaths    she    told me       she   c o u l d n ’t.



I then        put my    left arm ar o u n d            her waist     I was     trying       to    pull    her up

for air.          I tried          to    pull    her    up but    I couldn't         the    crush was       too

much.

                      my grip on this             girl    she    had her      head    leaning       on a man to

her    left with her eyes                 closed,        I'm not    sure if       she was         still alive at

this    stage.          We were all             in this     position      for     about another 3 minute

nothing m o v e d except                for    people    still    climbing       over      our    heads.        I

could now see that                 the    gate at        the    front   ofthis      pen,    pen 4,        was   now

open    people were              trying       to get     through five at a time                  it was jammed

up.          Others    were       leaning        over    the     fences at     the front and trying               to

lift    people        the       crush was        still     too    great and      I didn't see anyone

This    open gate was about 6 or 7 yards                          directly       in front         of me.



After    about        3 minutes          the    crush eased       very sligh t l y the girl               to my

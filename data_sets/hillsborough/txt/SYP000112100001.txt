cowcerfted t^ere were no unusual                problems with traffic it went very

well. Th« motorcyclists asd all officers engaged in g*tti ng people to

the ground did a first class job.                    There was never ari^ suggestion

that fans .Were held up because of pr^ferfems on the roads.

All the, time We had t s e s r r m o n U o ^ g Hillsborough Qround Control on

channel 25 via a repeater s-^t in the Incident Room.                         I recognised

PS G o d d a r d .44 the main operator at the ground and ori occasions

Supt. Murray used             Te radio.     Up to 2.15 pm the reception was good

and there were/no u                                       Then for the next 20-25 minutes

the radio was very poor it broke up and there was 4T loud whi'stli                                        It

sai/S they were present and trying to fix it.f ^Mt^r^VTaj^Jtime it was

much improved ^ k ^ t o         the good reception we had heard earlier that

day.     This wo/ld be about 2.40 pm and after that the reception was

clear,      I he&rd Supiei^iV^ndeg^Jl^i^ill saying to match control that

he had a large crowd sutside the Leppings Lane end of the ground.                                         I

think he asked for more horses but I ’m not sure whether the match

control got in touch with any*                  I do know that they asked us via XS

for a vehicle with a PA system to go to Leppings Lane because there

was a lar^e crowd pushing and they feared"someone wouid b» hurt,                                        We

did sen<y a car but when he got there he radioed back that there was a

car wiVh PA already there.

 Recollections of major incident at Hillsborough on the 1 5 A

 written on the 16th April 1989*


 On duty Incident Room at 10am re semi-final, P.C.3ones and Waugh working with me

 in incident room wanning radio. On my arrival they were busy booking traffic

 vehicles on duty and there were no problems at that stage* On my instructions

 they created an extended incident on the C&C so that we could put on any matters

 relating to the semi-final and analyse it afterwards. This was done by transfering

 a message put on by F division earlier that weeko F1 were informed the incident

 became EL 2 on the extended incident*
 By 1330hours there was a lot of congestion on the roads and the motorway but by

  1*f15hrs this was cleared and all the motorway routes had very little football
  traffic. I remember everyone commenting that things were going well and that

  traffic seemed to have arrived much earlier than last year. Most of the routes

  to the ground were clear by 2.30pm there was certainly no hold up for Liverpool

   supporters the only hold ups had been through Attercliffe and City where the

   Notts Forest supporters had come* X rerarfflber Supt Brougham coming over the
   radio about 2.Jt0pm saying that all the routes to the ground were clear and

   the motorcyclist wanting to go in for meal early. They were told to stay out

   mainly because it was said that meals would not be ready. In any case they

   carried on checking their own sections until about 2.55pm* As far as I am

   concerned there were no unusual problems with traffic it went very well. The

   motor cyclists and all officers engaged in getting people to the ground did

   a first class job. There was never any suggestion that fans were held up

   bpc»»usp of problems on the ro»ds.
   All the time we had been monitoring Hillsborough Ground Control on channel 25

   ▼ia a repeater set in the Incident Room. I recognised PS Goddard t>s the main

   operator at the ground end and on occasions Supt Murray used the radio. Up
   to         2.15pm the reception was good and there were no unusual problems

   Then for the next 20 25 minutes the radio was very poor it broke up and there
   was a loud whistle. It was obvious they were having problems with the radio

   infact I remember them saying they were having problems over XS radio and we
   asked if they needed communications people to help. Ground control said they
were present and trying to fix it. After that time it m s much improved back to
th«- good reception we had heard e*rli**r that d«y. This would be about 2,kO jm
and after that the reception was clear* I heard Superintendent Marshall saying

to match control that he had a large crowd outside the Lappings Lane end of the

ground* I think he asked for more horses but I'm not sure whether the match control

got intouch with any* I do know that they asked us via XS for a vehicle with a

PA system to go to Leppings Lane because there was a large crowd pushing and they
feared someone would be hurt. We did send a car but when he goh there he radiod

back that there was a car with PA already there*

It was more and more apparent listening to the match control radio that the crowd
at Leppings Lane were causing extreme problems for the officers, I remrmber them

asking Inspector Sewell to send more men and I remember someone asking for the

kick off to be delayed* I don't know who that was but the reply from match control
was that there was no chance as one of the teams was already out* It must have been

about 2,50pm by this time. Supt Marshall then asked for the gates to be open as he

feared for the safety of all the people at Leppings Lane. He said they were being
crushed and he thought a wall w as going to go. Supt Murray himself replied to this

and said there was a need to check tickets. Supt Marshall t|»n repeated his plea and

I could hear the crowd in the background who were obviously very noisey and unruly.

I think other persons asked for the gate opening but I cant say who. I was convinced

by what I heard that people would be hurt so I asked my staff to contact match
control and ask them if they needed any ambulances. They said not at that stage
but we were to keep on monitoring the radio. This was about 3p® “ id the time

and I heard PS Goddard in ground control say 'open the gate we do not want anyone

killed.' I am sure these were more or less his exact words. This was done and after

» minute Supt Marshall told Match gontrol that the situation outside had eased and
that the gate was closed*

I could then hear the officers at the ground saying persons were injured and I told

PC Rook in the Ops Room to ring the ambulance service and warn them of possible

major casualties* Within a minute we were requested to get a fleet of ambulances

ftr»d we did via the ambulance service who were still on the phone to PC Rook. I

then activated the Major incident plan and we started to activate the casualty

bureau etc*

Further to the previous reports I have submitted regarding
the Major Incident at Hillsborough on the 15 April 1989.


At 1513hrs that day I was in the incident room when ground
control requested that the Fire Service attend at Hillsborough
with cutting equipment. I immediately went to the main Operations
Room to give that instruction to one of the operators.

At the time I did so Mrs Webster a temporary Control Room
Assidstant was on the phone to the Fire Service over another
matter. I told her that she was to tell them that we wanted
cutting equipment at Hillsborough and she did so in my presence.

I was standing nearby and it was obvious by the conversation that
the Fire Control did not fully understand what was required. I
then took the telephone from Mrs Webster and explained to the
Operator what I believed had occurred at Hillsborough at that time.
I spoke with some urgency in my voice and I was satisfied that
the Operator fully understood what was required and she rang off.

          broadcast        responded giving their call signs and were told to go

          immediately to the ground.



          I instructed Inspector Jackson to implement Operation Support to the

          rest of the Force and he completed a set format on the Command and

          Control       computer.        He asked whether              it had been authorised by thg ft££

         The computer message switch was sent via the command and control

         system to all Sub-Divisions of the Force at 1510hrs„       This was done

         on a priority message which generates a visual and audible warning in

         the Sub-Divisional   controls.   This   is an indication to them that

         there is a priority message which requires immediate attention.



         After the message had been sent it was established from ground

         control that the rendesvous point was the police room at the ground.

         This was sent at 1513hrs by Inspector Jackson on a separate message

         switch.



         Sub-Divisional   controls are asked on the format to enter on the

         incident log details of officers attending the rendezvous      point and

         this was done by numerous controls which entered details on the

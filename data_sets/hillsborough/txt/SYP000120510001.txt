            I am a Police Constable           in the South Yorkshire Police         currently

            serving in the Traffic Operations West,               Main S t r e e t , Rotherham.

            when I went to the secure           cabinet which is situated in the Road

            Traffic office and took possession of a number of video tapes.                         These

            included number 23 which is a "180 minute VHS tape and number A3 which

            is a 30 minute VHS t a p e .

            At 12.46pm <1246)        that same day/date       I commenced patrol      in company

            with PC 2490 Holden who was the driver of the unmarked Jaguar                     patrol

            c a r , registered number                    This vehicle        is equipped with a

            Panasonic     camera,    a colour television monitor screen and a VHS video

            tape    reco rde r which is housed in the boot of the J a g u a r .          The system

            At 1.16pm (1316)        I inserted the VHS tape number 23 into the VHS

            recorder when we were on the A628 road at Crowden, Derbyshire and

            commenced to record the nearside grass verge.                    At 1.22pm (1322)      I

            observed a number of empty beer cans which had been thrown onto tJae

            grass verge.

            At   1.24pm   (1324)    I attended at the big lay-by situated aiy woo antra a i

where   I operated the camera to show the debris strewn about-                  At the

rear of the public telephone box PC 22490 Holden pulled out a number of

plastic carrier bags which on examination were found to contain empty

beer    cans and a number of empty spirit bottles.            PC Holden and 1 then

climbed over a small embankment which leads down into a gulley.                      In

this gulley I saw a large number of empty beer and lager                cans?     empty

bottles of wine and spirits.            I assisted PC Holden to collect these

in the plastic: carrier bags, which were then placed onto the road

surface.     I returned to the car and operated the camera and saw PC

Holden obtain a document from within one of the carrier bags.                     I can

identify this document to the Court            if required.     PC Holden and I

then made certain enquiries at

   and the re I spoke to a

           South Yorkshire,

stated that he was on the site on Saturday             15 April,   1989 (150489)

The entire              smelt strongly of stale alcohol and urine.              At

2 . 15pm (1415)   in a lay-by I found a plastic carrier bag dumped in a

field behind the lay-by and on examination it was found to contain

empty beer and lager c a n s .       These   cans as were the cans at the

Woodhead lay-by were        in good repair and appeared new.          At 2.21pm

<1 4 S 1 ) and 2 . 2 4 pm (1424)   in two other   lay-bys I operated the camera

to record the empty beer cans strewn about.               At 2.26pm   (1426) at the

front of The Dog and Partridge Publie House              I recorded that the waste

bin was full of empty beer and lager cans along with other debris.

At 2.31 pm (1431)      I recorded that the waste bin situated outside the

floor Cafe contained an amount of empty beer and lager cans which were

in a good condition.         We then turned right at the crossroads onto the

A616 where in a lay-by I saw a small amount of empty beer                 cans,      one

of which had been thrown into a branch of a tree.

We continued along the A616,           the Stocks bridge by— pass and r e c o /deVJ— a—

bag containing empty beer cans.

AT 3.01pm    (1501)    I recorded on video a number of beer cans and an

empty beer bottle       (Newcastle Brown)      on the grass verge of the lay­

by.   PC Holden and I then continued our journey onto the A61 where                      in

a lay-by I saw some empty cardboard boxes              containing empty beer        cans,,

There was also a number of empty beer cans which were                 in a good

condition strewn about on the grass and bushes.                Further along the A61

street light and this bag contained a number of empty beer                  cans.

At 3.28pm    (1528)    on Penistone Road next to the Hi 1 Ifoot Steelworks

the pavement.        At 3.34pm    (1534)   I attended at the C 1a y w h e e 1s Lane

Road Traffic Office where          I liaised with Chief      Inspector Lax.

recorded on video.

At 5.00pm the same day and date at a bus lay-by on the A61 at

Tankersley which is just prior to the Pi 1 ley turn off I went to a bus

shelter and there       I saw a black plastic bin bag which had been left

at the right side of the bus shelter.               I made a serach of this bin

bag and found that       it contained empty beer cans and other plastic

carrier bags also       containing empty beer cans.          I also saw in this

plastic bag a number of white tickets.              On examination of these

tickets,    serial    numbers 6372, 6373,      6374, 6375 and 6383.       These

tickets were; stamped OUTWARD with a pick up point Woodsicle Hotel and

returned with the bin bag which I placed on the pavement near to the

Police    car and at 5.04pm (1704)       I inserted virgin tape number A5 into

the V.T.R. and operated the camera as PC 2490 Holden displayed the

c ont en t s.    I had explained to PC Holden and showed him the coach

tickets.        During the video recording       I called PC Holden back to the

Police vehicle and handed to him the tickets in question and

requested him to show where the tickets had been found,                PC Holden

did this and shortly after he handed these back to m e .               I can identify

these tickets by means of a label            signed and attached by me and can

produce them in evidence          if required.

           On Saturday,      the 15th A p r i 1, 1989 (150489)   I commenced duty at 0800

           hours at the Road Traffic Office,          Main Street, Rotherham.          From there

           I drove an unmarked van which was           identified as number 4 to

           Brightside Lane Driving School where Superintendent Brougham held a

           parade and issued instructions.

           My duties for that day M/ere the transportation of P C ’s to various

           point duties at the Parkway and Wicker area.                I returned to

           Brightside Lane on stand by and then conveyed other officers to

           Commercial Street due to traffic           congestion.

           I then returned to the above points,            collected the officers and

           returned them to Brightside Lane for meal.

           As they were waiting       in line for their meal        1 heard over a Police

           radio "Operation Support".

           As a result of this I attended at my vehicle and attended in convoy

           to the Hillsborough F o o t b a l 1 Ground with the officers who had been on

           point d u t y .

           On arrival at the ground the officers went            in and I parked the

           vehicle outside.        I returned to the ground and went to the stand

           where   I saw that officers were assisting at the Leppings Lane end._

           went onto the       pitch where   I assisted in first aid to an injured ma
                                                                          PAGE
                                                                          R412A

   and went arid directed an ambulance onto the pitch as it was apparent

   that he was seriously injured.        This man was   conveyed off the pitch

   by ambulance.       1 then assisted with the injured people that had been

   carried across the pitch to the side near to the Police Office.          A

   number of these men were dead and their friends and relatives were

  abusive and very upset.        Someone said that all the bodies which were

  all over the ground were to be carried into the gymnasium and I

  assisted with this.

  In the gymnasium 1 assisted handing out body bags and for one of the

  deceased,       I obtained a Priest who stated he was from Rotherham who

  said a prayer over the deceased who was unidentified.

  I returned      to the ground where   I assisted by giving first aid where

  requi r e d .

  Shortly after      I collected the officers that I had transported and

  conveyed them to their relevant       points but they were not   required as

  the traffic flow was quiet.       I returned with these men to Brightside

  Lane where we were stood down.        I transported these officers to the

  Attercliffe Police Station and then       returned to Main Street and off

  duty.

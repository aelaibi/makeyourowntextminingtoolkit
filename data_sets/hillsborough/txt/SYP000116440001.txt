My    first,      impression              was       the    number       of' p e o p l e    between         the      slipway         to

the    p i t c h at       the       side       of    the N o r t h      Stand      and     the     gymnasium             are a.

Ambulances           were          present          and    injured       supporters           were       being        treated.

The    source        of      this        activity          was    the    pit c h .        1 asked a uniform Officer

(male)       what       the        situation               was    and    1 r e c e i v e d s o me       m u m b l e d reply w hich

1 could        not      understand.                  The    Officer        started           to     cry a n d       my     next

recollection              is       being       on    the    pitch and          seeing        literally           hundreds           of

supporters           and       Police          Officers          either      carrying         injured          or     dead

suppti rte rs .

One    of m y      first           thoughts          was    the    fact      that      the    majority           of      Police

Officers          would        probably             not    recognise         the     Officers           w i t h me       and     myself

clue to      our     mode          of    dress       and    the? f a c t     that      Officers          f r o m -all       over       the

Force     were       on d u t y at             the    ground,.

DC    J o n e s , Take         and       myself            were    quickly         d r a w n to     assistingsupporters

and Police           Officers             who       were    carrying         casualties            from     the       pitch.           i'he

majority          in h i n d s i g h t         were       dead.

Rather       than       be     drawn        further         onto     the     pitch        I decided         to      visit        the

gymnasium with                 a     view      to    locating        and     gathering            all    the     Officers

under     my      command.               I entered          the    g y m n a s i u m w i t h DC         Jones       and Tuke           and

saw    the     enormity             of    the       situation.            1 believe          there       were       at     lea st      20

bodies       on    the       floor        at    t hat      time.        Numerous          Officers         were       inside        the

room    and       had     obviously             been       tasked       with    specific           responsibilities.                        I

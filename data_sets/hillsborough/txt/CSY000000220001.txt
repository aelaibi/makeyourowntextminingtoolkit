                    Designation of the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield
                    under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975


1.      T his paper has been p rep ared to subm it to the Home Office on the case fo r
        designating the Hillsborough Stadium under the Act.

2   .   Grounds c u rren tly designated a re confined to those of F ir s t Division Clubs
        and c e rta in so called "international" grounds. Included in the la tte r a re the
        Twickenham Rugby Union Ground of the Rugby Football Union, the National
        Ground, Cardiff of the Welsh Rugby Union, the E m pire Stadium, Wembley,
        Ninian P ark , Cardiff, and the R acecourse Ground, W rexham .

3.1     It is the d eclared intention of the Home Office that when th e re has been tim e
        to a s s e s s the im pact of the f ir s t round of designations, consideration will
        then be given to the possible extension of designation to the grounds of
        Second Division d u b s .

3 .2    In Sheffield, th e re is also the B ram all Lane ground of the Sheffield United
        Football Club Ltd. (currently in the Second D ivision of the Football League).
        The p resen t capacity of this ground (49, 000) is low er than that of the Hillsborough
        Stadium (55, 000). The respectiv e average league attendances fo r the la s t
        five com plete seasons a re se t out below

                             Sheffield United             Sheffield Wednesday

        1972/73                  23, 509                           17,600
        1973/74                  22, 917                           14,645

        As will be seen, since the demotion of Sheffield United to the Second Division
        in the 1976/77 Season, attendances have not been d iss im ila r.

4.      S tatistics show th at the low est average attendances in the F ir s t and Second
        D ivisions of the Football League over the la s t five seasons have been as
        follows when com pared to the average league attendances at Hill s boro ugh

                   Sw itzerland v Spain

The Hillsborough Stadium has also consistently staged F .A . Cup S em i-F inals
since the W ar, as w ell as a League Cup Final Replay, as follows (with only
two exceptions since 1962):-

                    1946                       1965
                    1948                       1967
                    1949                       1969
                    1951                       1970

Maximum capacity crow ds w ere a ttra c te d to th e se m atches, the ground
capacity of 65, 000 in the fifties being reduced to 55, 000 in the m id six tie s .

The experience of those County A uthorities with designated grounds in th e ir
a re a s show that in many c a se s it has been n e c e ssa ry to reduce ground
capacities to a figure below the ceiling figures previously reg ard ed as
acceptable. T h e ir experiences also show th at alm o st without exception it
has been n e c e ssa ry to strengthen, o r add to, existing c rx sh b a r r ie r
arran g em en ts, to give attention to s ta irc a s e s and h an d rails, and to a lte r
en tran ces and ex its. In som e c a se s, w hilst the w orks req u ired w ere quite

       The County Council recognises that it is able under Section 10 of the Act to
       apply to a court fo r an o rd e r prohibiting o r re stric tin g the adm ission of
       sp e ctato rs to any p a rt of a ground if the cou rt is satisfied th at the ris k to
       sp e ctato rs is so g re a t as to justify re stric tio n of num bers to any o r all p a rts
       of the ground.

8.2    However, the experiences of o ther County A uthorities suggest that, in the
       absence of a p ro p er survey, the only way convincing proof would become
       apparent would be following an incident^ a tragedy o r a d is a s te r.

       The Sheffield Wednesday Football d u b Ltd. has declined to subm it a
       voluntary and inform al application to the County Council which would enable
       them to c a rry out such a survey.

9.     As w ill be apparent, the County Council is concerned on public safety grounds
       that the Hillsborough Stadium is being u tilised virtually as an "international"
       ground without any independent body (even the Home Office) being aw are of
       p re c ise ly what conditions obtain at the Stadium.

10.1   (a)       It is perhaps significant th at the designation of the R acecourse Ground,
                 W rexham (also in the T h ird Division of the Football League) as an
                 ’’in ternation al1' ground, w as evidently at the req u est of the W elsh
                 Football A ssociation and with the agreem ent of the W rexham

10.2   The English Football A ssociation has stated th at it has n e v e r made a decision
        not to in s is t th at Sheffield Wednesday seek a licence under the Safety of Sports
        Grounds Act, but points out th at the Home Office has decided, quite independ­
        ently, th at they would not, fo r the tim e being, issu e a designation o rd e r in
        re sp e c t of the Hillsborough Stadium . The responsibility fo r preventing a
        p ro p e r exam ination of the Stadium has, th erefo re, been p assed to the Home
        Office.

10.3   The A ssociation has also stated th at they a re mindful of the problem s asso ciated
       with the staging of an F . A. S em i-F inal Match, and would obviously expect
        Sheffield Wednesday, if chosen to stage a S em i-F inal in the future, to abide by the
        various recom m endations of the Football A ssociation and the M inister of
        S p o rt's W orking P a rty . An a ssu ran ce is given th at the A ssociation would act
        in close co -operation with the South Y orkshire P olice, and would c a r ry out any
        special in stru ctio n s relativ e to the staging of such a gam e. The County Council
        would also be consulted on any special m e a su re s which it feels th at the
        A ssociation should take.

10.4   While consultation and a ssu ran ces a re welcom e, these (of n ecessity in the
       im m ediate period before a m atch) a re no adequate substitute fo r designation,
       p a rtic u la rly as a p ro p e r survey cannot be c a r rie d out a t the Stadium (paragraph
       8 .2 above). Designation would be the only effective m eans of ensuring that
       any n e c e ssa ry action in relation to stru c tu ra l m a tte rs in the in te re sts of public
       safety w as taken (attention is again drawn to the experience a t o th er grounds
       su m m arise d in parag rap h 7 above).                                                          "

10.5   The County Council w onders what significance should be drawn from the fact
       th at no F .A . o r League Cup S em i-F inal (or Final replay) has been held at
       the H illsborough Stadium in 1978 since the County Council's concern has been
        e x p re sse d .

11.1   The case fo r designation, as se t out in th is p aper, can be su m m arised as
        being:-

        (a)      the level of attendance in com parison with those grounds already
                  designated o r proposed to be designated - su re ly the only logical
                  te s t ra th e r than the Division of the Football League in which the
                  T eam plays (paragraphs 3 and 4);

        (b)      statu s as an "intern atio nal" ground (paragraphs 2 and 5);



                                           4   .
         (c)       statu s as a reg u lar venue fo r F .A . Cup S em i-F inal m atches
                   (paragraph 6);

         (d)       experience a t those grounds designated which have
                    req u ired w orks in the in te re st of public safety to be c a rrie d out
                    and, in som e instances, ground cap acities to be reduced
                    (paragraph 7);

         (e)       unw illingness of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. to ag ree
                   to an "inform al" application under the Act which would enable a
                   p ro p e r survey to be c a rrie d out (paragraph 8.2);

         (f)       the preced en t which has been se t by the designation of the R ace­
                    co u rse Ground, W rexham (paragraph 10.1);

         (g)       a ground of sm a lle r capacity and not d iss im ila r average league
                    attendance figures in the sam e City will be designated when the
                    Second Division grounds a re designated (paragraph 3).

11.2     The County Council believes m ost strongly that it has shown th at th e re is
         m o re than sufficient justification fo r the designation of the Stadium, and
         req u ests the Home Office to do so without any fu rth e r delay. The County
         Council a re supported by the Sheffield City Council and the Chief Constable
         of the South Y orksh ire P olice in th is req u est.

                                                     PARTY
                                                     30TH MARCH, 1978


                                   VANDALISM

1.   B ased on the R eport of the P olice Committee Vandalism Sem inar, your officers
     have endeavoured to identify a re a s which the W orking P a rty m ight w ish to keep
     under review .

2.   It is suggested th at the W orking P a rty might w ish to consider the following
      points :-

      (a)    Building Design, E state Layout, M anagement

             (i)       the possibility of reintroducing the policy of employing
                        w atch m en /caretak ers on building site s and in tow er
                        blocks;

             (ii)      the tem p orary landscaping of "cleared " site s to rem ove
                        tem pting rubble, etc;

             (iii)     the identification of an a re a in which to run a cam paign
                        to c re a te feeling fo r the a re a , tied to the creatio n of a
                        defensible space "concept" (possibly run on s im ila r
                        lin es to the Hoyland L itte r Campaign).

      (b)    Involvem ent of the Community

              (i)      publicity can be a useful tool, and "Contact" m agazine
                        is a well established vehicle;

              (ii)     the possibility of arran gin g an "anti-vandal" p o ste r
                        com petition to involve the younger m em bers of the
                        com munity.

      (c )   P o lice Approach

             The Community R elations D epartm ent of the South Y orkshire
             P o lice is considering ways of prom oting in te re s t within the
             com m unity to contact the police about any ac t of vandalism in
             o rd e r th at the police may take action, always advising the


                                         -   1   -
               public not to d isre g a rd personal safety but, if unable to
               approach the offender, to be an inform ant, anonomously
               should anyone d e sire th is.

       (d)     Attitude of the Courts

               A rranging a m eeting with rep resen tativ es of the South
               Y orkshire M agistrates to discuss a re a s of common in te re st.

               (Note - M em bers will recall the attitude of the Clerk to the
               Ju s tic e s , Sheffield, to the effect that the M ag istrates a re
               w illing to discuss the m a tte r with the Joint Working P a rty ,
               but do not wish to duplicate m a tte rs by having sep arate
               discussions with both City and County Council re p re s e n ta tiv e s .)

3.     Your officers hope to be able to re p o rt fu rth e r to the Working P a rty
       sh ortly on the provision of recreatio n al facilities to counteract the incidence
       of vandalism , e .g . g rassin g over of cle a re d sites fo r use as play a re a s and
       definition of a re a s fo r casual skateboarding.

1.     This paper has been prepared to submit to the Home Office on the ca se for
       designating the Hillsborough Stadium under the Act.

2.     Grounds currently designated are confined to those of F irst Division Clubs
       and certain so called ’’international" grounds. Included in the latter are the
       Twickenham Rugby Union Ground of the Rugby Football Union, the National
       Ground, Cardiff of the Welsh Rugby Union, the Empire Stadium, Wembley,
       Ninian Park, Cardiff, and the R acecourse Ground, Wrexham.

3 .1   It is the declared intention of the Home Office that when there has been tim e
        l.o a s s e s s the impact of the first round of designations, consideration will
        then be given to the possible extension of designation to the grounds of
        Second Division Clubs.

3 .2   In Sheffield, there is also the Bramall Lane ground of the Sheffield United
        Football Club Ltd. (currently in the Second Division of the Football League).
        The present capacity of this ground (49, 000) is low er than that of the Hillsborough
        Stadium (55, 000). The respective average league attendances for the la st
        five complete seasons are set out below

       1972/73                  23, 509                          17, 600
       1973/74                  22, 917                          14, 645

       As will be seen, since the demotion of Sheffield United to tl
       in the 1976/77 Season, attendances have not been d issim ila r.

       D ivisions of the Football League over the la st five seasons have been as
       follows when compared to the average league attendances at Hillsborough

                                          1.
Since 1950, the Hillsborough Stadium has staged the following ten international
m atches:-

England "B" International, England v Switzerland 1950 (43, 053)
Inter League, England v Scotland 1951 (49, 075)
Football League v Scotland 1955 (37, 788)
England Under 23’s v Scotland Under 23’s 1956 (40, 000)
England Youth v Belgium 1957 (7, 801)
England Under 23’s v Poland Under 23’s 1958 (38,525)
England Under 23's v Holland Under 23's i960 (21,163)
World Cup 1966 -
                 Switzerland v West Germany
                 Switzerland v Argentina
                 Switzerland v Spain

The Hillsborough Stadium has also consistently staged F .A . Cup Sem i-Finals
since the War, as well as a League Cup Final Replay, as follows (with only
two exceptions since 1962):-

                   1946                      1965
                   1948                      1967
                   1949                      1969
                   1951                      1970
                   1952                      1971
                   1955                      1972
                   1956                      1973
                   1957                      1974
                   1959                      1975
                   1962                      1976
                   1963                      1977
                   1964                      1977 (League Cup Final Replay)

Maximum capacity crowds were attracted to these matches, the ground
capacity of 65, 000 in the fifties being reduced to 55, 000 in the mid s ix tie s.

The experience of those County Authorities with designated grounds in their
areas show that in many c a se s it has been n ecessary to reduce ground
capacities to a figure below the ceiling figures previously regarded as
acceptable. Their experiences also show that alm ost without exception it
has been n ecessa ry to strengthen, or add to, existing crush barrier
arrangements, to give attention to sta irca ses and handrails, and to alter
entrances and e x its. In som e c a se s, w hilst the works required w ere quite
extensive in area, they w ere relatively minor in nature. Examples of
reduced ground capacities are:-

0   8. 1   The County Council recognises that it is able under Section 10 of the Act to
           apply to a court for an order prohibiting or restricting the adm ission of
           spectators to any part of a ground if the court is satisfied that the risk to
           spectators is so great as to justify restriction of numbers to any or all parts
           of the ground.

    8.2    However, the experiences of other County Authorities suggest that, in the
           absence of a proper survey, the only way convincing proof would become
           apparent would be following an incident a tragedy or a d isaster.

           The Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. has declined to submit a
           voluntary and informal application to the County Council which would enable
           them to carry out such a survey.

    9.     As will be apparent, the County Council is concerned on public safety grounds
           that the Hillsborough Stadium is being utilised virtually as an "international"
           ground without any independent body (even the Home Office) being aware of
           p recisely what conditions obtain at the Stadium.

    10.1   (a)     It is perhaps significant that the designation of the R acecourse Ground,
                    Wrexham (also in the Third Division of the Football League) as an
                    "international" ground, was evidently at the request of the Welsh
                    Football Association and with the agreement of the Wrexham
                    A ssociation Football Club.

    10.1   (b)     The average attendance figures for the R acecourse ground set out
                   overleaf make an interesting comparison with those at the Hillsborough
                    Stadium set out in paragraphs 4 and 6:-

         1972/73      4,   546    3, 021            4, 846           18,601
         1973/74      5,   957   10,141                -                -

10.2     The English Football Association has stated that it has never made a decision
         not to in sist that Sheffield Wednesday seek a licence under the Safety of Sports
         Grounds Act, but points out that the Home Office has decided, quite independ­
         ently, that they would not, for the tim e being, issu e a designation order in
         respect of the Hillsborough Stadium. The responsibility for preventing a
         proper examination of the Stadium has, therefore, been passed to the Home
         Office.

10.3     The A ssociation has also stated that they are mindful of the probl ems associated
         with the staging of an F .A . Sem i-Final Match, and would obviously expect
         Sheffield Wednesday, if chosen to stage a Sem i-Final in the future, to abide by the
         various recommendations of the Football A ssociation and the Minister of
         Sport's Working Party. An assurance is given that the Association would act
         in clo se co-operation with the South Yorkshire P olice, and would carry out any
         special instructions relative to the staging of such a gam e. The County Council
         would also be consulted on any special m easures which it feels that the
         Association should take.

10.4     While consultation and assurances are welcom e, these (of n ecessity in the
         immediate period before a match) are no adequate substitute for designation,
         particularly as a proper survey cannot be carried out at the Stadium (paragraph
         8. 2 above). Designation would be the only effective means of ensuring that
         any n ecessa ry action in relation to structural matters in the interests of public
         safety was taken (attention is again drawn to the experience at other grounds
         sum m arised in paragraph 7 above).

10.5     The County Council wonders what significance should be drawn from the fact
         that no F .A . or League Cup Sem i-Final (or Final replay) has been held at
         the Hillsborough Stadium in 1978 since the County Council's concern has been
         expressed.

11 . 1   The ca se for designation, as set out in this paper, can be summarised as
         being

         (a)       the level of attendance in comparison with those grounds already
                    designated or proposed to be designated - surely the only logical
                    te st rather than the Division of the Football League in which the
                    Team plays (paragraphs 3 and 4);

         (b)       status as an "international" ground (paragraphs 2 and 5);



                                           4   .
         (C)      status as a regular venue for F .A . Cup Sem i-Final matched
                  (paragraph 6);                                             /   h
                                                                         , I^

         (cl)     experience at those grounds designated which havefhtvrxTfs^^)
                  required works in the interest of public safety to be carried out
                  and, in som e instances, ground capacities to be reduced
                  (paragraph 7);

         (e)     unwillingness of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. to agree
                 to an "informal" application under the Act which would enahle a
                 proper survey to be carried out (paragraph 8.2);

         (f)     the precedent which has been set by the designation of the R ace­
                 course Ground, Wrexham (paragraph 10.1);

         (g)     a ground of sm aller capacity and not d issim ilar average league
                 attendance figures in the same City will be designated when the
                 Second Division grounds are designated (paragraph 3).

         The County Council believes m ost strongly that it has shown that there is
         more than sufficient justification for the designation of the Stadium, and
         requests the Home Office to do so without any further delay. The County
         Council are supported by the Sheffield City Council and the Chief Constable
         of the South Yorkshire P olice in this request.

D ear S ir,

Hooliganism /Vandalism

I thank you fo r your le tte r of 15th March.

The County Council's Working P arly looking into Hooliganism /Vandalism has
never made any recom m endation to enforce the com pulsory closure of bu sinesses.
It has recom m ended, through the A ssociation of M etropolitan A uthorities, that
legislation should be sought to give all County A uthorities the power to ban any
proposed sporting event where the Authority, having considered a ll the
inform ation and evidence available to them , consider there to be a re a l danger
that p ersons attending o r attem pting to attend the event will cause injury or
damage to p erso ns and property o r cause fe a r o r a larm to the residents in the
vicinily w here the proposed event is to take place.

The County Council sees a m ore re a listic police establishm ent as a necessity,
but Government re stric tio n s on local authority expenditure imposed through the
Home Office m ean that this cannot be achieved a t the moment.

So fa r a s Increased powers fo r the police a re concerned, this is a m atter for
P arliam en t, as is the question of m ore sev ere penalties if they a re not already
available. If they a re available, it i s , of c o u rse , a m atter fo r the m agistracy.

                                                 Yours faithfully,

   D e a r Mr. Mallett,

        F u r t h e r to y o u r l et te r dated 9th March, I note y o u r comments about
   the desi gna ti on of the H i l l s b o r o u g h Stadium.       I w o u l d be in te r e s t e d to
   know why you pi ck the H il lsb o r o u g h S t a d i u m p a rt icu la rly out of all the
   grounds outside the First Division.                 I can only assume it is because it
   has, in the past, been o c c a sio na lly used f o r Se mi -F i n a l matches.

         We have a Government, p res um abl y s upp or ted by County Authorities,
   intent on t ak ing money out of sport and re turning only a fraction.                  It
   seems d is gr ac efu l that f o r a m a j o r s t a d i u m in a place like Sheffield,
   when p u tt in g for war d requests tha t Clubs should be forced to spend more
   money on t h e i r stadia there is no suggestion where it should come from.
   Poss ib ly y o u r A u t h o r i t y has no s ub si dis ed sports halls, or sw imming
   pools, or o t h e r facilities, but if that is so it wo ul d be a rare exception.
   The Go ve rn m e n t receives 80 mill ion pounds p e r a nn um fro m the football
   pools and a n o t h e r 32 million pounds in V.A.T. and Corpor ati on Tax from
   sports, w hi lst off er ing wit h the o th er hand a massive 12 million pounds
   to T h e Sports Council.

        As y o u pro ba b l y know, w h e n they need a new s t a d i u m in F ran kfurt or
   Cologne or San Diego, or most o the r m a j o r cities, the Local Au tho ri ty
   provide it and charge a rental.

             The last thi ng I wa nt to see is any ground being used to ac commodate
   spectators that is not one hun dr ed p e r cent safe and it is f o r this reason
   that I have w i l l i n g l y given time and effort to'the M i n i s t e r of S p o r t ’s
   W o r k i n g Party that w o r k e d to im ple me nt the Safety of Sports Grounds Bill.

         Yo u r e f e r to W r e x h a m ’s ground, but I believe this is irrelev an t as
   it is the top int er n a t i o n a l gr ound now in Wales and could only be compared
   wi th Wembley, or any of the 22 First Division grounds already designated.



                                                                                                                                              C o n t d . ..-

                Poss ib ly w h a t y ou are saying is that you w o u l d like the ground
                d e sig na ted before it is used for ma jor matches and that may be a
                different request fro m the one you put forward at present as I see
                no reason why that ground should be d es ig nat ed any more than any o ther
                of the 70 Football League Club grounds outside the First Division.
                Why not R o t h e r h a m and S h e f fi eld United?       S urely the average crowd
                at H i l l s b o r o u g h is f a r s af er than any w he re else in the country.
                If wha t y ou are saying is a t h r o w - b a c k of the problems that existed
                at the Sem i- F i n a l held there last year, I do not believe de signating
                the ground w o u l d have made a scrap of difference to the problems that
                arose on that occasion.

                                                     Yours sincerely,

Dear Sir,

Hooliganism/Vandalism Working Party

Further to my letter of 9th March, 1978, I have passed to you by hand a copy
of the draft case for the designation of the Hillsborough Stadium. As it is
intended that this should be considered by the Working Parly towards the end
erf ttie month (along with other Item s, I hope), I would appreciate your letting
me have any comments you may have as a matter of urgency.

I regret that I am unable to be more specific about the date for the Working
Party m eeting, but it appears that a clash of dates is likely to occur and the
Chairman is not available until next Monday.

I am endeavouring to contact your A ssistant Chief Constable, Mr. I, Mead,
a s obviously the Working Party value his advice at their m eetings.

                                           Yours faithfully,




                                           Chief Executive.

The County Council recognises that it is able under Section 10 of the Act to
apply to a court for an o rd e r prohibiting o r re stric tin g the adm ission of spectators
to any p art of a ground if the co urt is satisfied that the r is k to sp ectators is so
g re a t as to justify re stric tio n of num bers to any or all p arts of the ground.

However, the experience^ of other County A uthorities suggest that, in the
absence of a proper survey, the only^vayj convincing proof would become
                               9.          As will be apparent, the County Council is concerned on public safety grounds
                                           that the Hillsborough Stadium is being utilised virtually as an "international"
                                           ground without any independent body (even the Home Office) being aw are of
                                           p recisely what conditions obtain a t the Stadium.

                               10.1        It is perhaps significant that the designation of the Racecourse Ground,
                                           Wrexham (also in the Third Division of the Football League) as an "international"
                                           ground, was evidently a t the req u est of the Welsh Football A ssociation and
                                           with the ag reem en t of the Wrexham Association Football Club.

                               10.2        The English Football A ssociation has stated that it has never m ade a decision
                                           not to in sist thatSheffield Wednesday seek a licence under the Safety of Sports
                                           Grounds Act, but points out that the Home Office has decided, quite
                                           independently, that they would not, for the tim e being, issue a designatior
                                           o rd er in resp ect of the H illsborougfo Stadium. m

                                           associated with the staging of a^ ern i?F in al Match, and would obviously expect
                                           Sheffield Wednesday, if chosen to stage a Sem i-Final in the future, to abide
                                           by the various recom m endations of the Football A ssociation and the Minister
                                           of Sport's Working P arty ,      assurance is given that the A ssociation would

                                           relative to the staging of such a gam e. The County Council would also be

       Chief Executive,
       South Yorkshire County Council,

       BARNSLEY,
       South Yorkshire S70.2TN.


       Dear Sir,
                She Council of this Chamber has approved the following statement,
       which is sent for the attention of South Yorkshire County Council

             "This Chamber strongly opposes any suggestion of Local Authorities
              enforcing the compulsory closure of businesses or the banning of
              any sporting event as a deterrent to soccer hooliganism.

              It is our firm opinion that any consideration of such action is
              undemocratic and shows a decided weakness towards criminal
              violence.   We recommend that the only safeguard of the freedom
              and liberty of the community is by a stronger police force with
              increased authority to deal with those who physically oppose law
              and order, to the danger and inconvenience of the general public.
              Also, that the courts should impose more severe penalties upon
              convicted offenders.”

                Ve should be pleased to receive your comments, and advice of
       any action which you may decide to take.


                                                            Yours faithfully,



                                                            E.J./. Laffoley,
                                                            Secretary.

    D ear S ir,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975 .

    I thank you fo r your le tte r of Qfli Mar oh, 1978.

    Whilst the A ssociation's a ssu ra n ces a re m ost welcome, the County Council still
    se es the designation of the H illsborough Stadium as a necessity .

    The County Council Intends to p re s s tihe Home Office on tills point, and would
    obviously p re fe r to do so with the support of both / m r A ssociation and of the .
    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

    According to my Inform ation, the designation of the R acecourse Ground, W rexham,
    (also in the T hird Division) a s an "international ground was a t the re q u e s t of the
    Welsh Football A ssociation and with the agreem ent of the W rexham A ssociation
    Football Club. W hilst only a p ro p er survey would prove the point o r otherw ise It
    doeatseem reasonable to assum e th at the am ount and co st of the work to m eet the
    requirem ents of the A ct would be f a r le ss a t H illsborough than a t W rexham.

                                                                                                    Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir,

Hooliganism/Vandalism Working Party

I thank you for your letter dated 23rd February, 1978.

Following useful discussions which Mr. D. Vaughan of my staff has had with
your A ssistant Chief Constable, Mr. I. Mead, various avenues are being
explored, and I am hopeful that a good case for the designation of the
Hillsborough Stadium under the Safety of Sports Ground w ill be able to be
put together shortly.

You may have seen an article In the Sheffield Star on 7th February on the
designation question which attributed various statements to the Football
Association.

I took these up with the Association, and you may be interested to see the
attached copy of their reply dated 6th March, 1978.

                                     Yours faithfully,




                                     Chief Executive

                Dear, Sir

                Safety of Sports Graands Act 1975

                Thank you for your letter of 22nd February.

              I have not had the opportunity to see the article
              referred to, but I can inform you that The Football
              Association has never made a decision not to insist
              that Sheffield Wednesday seek a licence under the
              Safety of Sports Grounds Act.

              The Heme Office has given consideration to designating
              Sheffield Wednesday's ground as it is used for Sani-
              Finals in the EA Cup, and has decided, quite independently,
              that they would not, for the time being, issue a desig­
              nation order in respect of Hillsborough Stadium.

              The Football Association retains its view that it vrould
              not be in the interest q£ ; ^                   the general
              freedom of action enjoyed by the citizens of this Country,
              for County Councils to be empowered to close down football
              grounds.
              We are mindful of the problems associated with the staging
              of a Semi-Final iratch, and will obviously expect Sheffield
              Wednesday F.C., if chosentostage a Semi-Final match in
              the future, to abide by the various reccmnendations of The
              Football Association a n d M i n i s t e r of Sport1s Working
              Party. We voold alk>            close co-operation with the
              Police, and carry out any special instructions relative to
              the staging of such a game.


                                                                                                                               /2

       Should Hillsborough be chosen for a Soni-Final in this Season's
       Competition, The Football Association would, naturally, consult
       your Council on any special measures which you m y feel it necessary
       for us to take. :


                                Yours faithfully

Thank yon for your letter of 22nd February about hooliganism . I am
pleased you contacted me bem use we did specifically check out the position
on the discretionary power.

The Chief Executive took a Counsel's Opinion on the use of the 2p rate
provision (section 137) and he advised strongly against it - he said, and I
quote:

         "the police authority is not a local authority . . . and
         accordingly neither section III nor section 137 has any
         application to them

         in my opinion the (County) Council has no power to make
         payments to victim s of hooliganism . ”

The County Council has a sited the Association of Metropolitan Authorities
to take up a number of m atters with the Government and the Working Party
referred to and the payment of compensation is one of them.

With best w ishes,

Dear Sir,

Hoollga pis m/Va ndallsm

I thank you for your letter of 15th March.

The County Council's Working Party looking Into Hooliganism/Vandalism has
never made any recommendation to enforce the compulsory closure of b usinesses.
It has recommended, through the A ssociation of Metropolitan Authorities, that
legislation should be sought to give a ll County Authorities the power to ban any
proposed sporting event where the Authority, having considered all the
information and evidence available to them , consider there to be a real danger
that p erso n s attending or attem pting to attend the event w ill cause injury or
damage to persons and property or cause fear or alarm to the residents in the
vicinity where the proposed event is to take place.

The County Council se e s a m ore re a listic police establishm ent as a n ecessity,
but Government restrictions on local authority expenditure Imposed through the
Home Office mean that this cannot be achieved at the moment.

So far as in creased powers for the police are concerned, this is a matter for
Parliam ent, as is the question of more severe penalties if they a re not already
available. If they are available, it i s , of cou rse, a matter for the m agistracy.

                                                Yours faithfully,




                                                Chief Executive.

  Dear Mr. Mallett,

       Fu r t h e r to y o u r letter dated 9th March, I note yo ur comments about
 the d e sign ati on of the Hil lsb o r o u g h Stadium.       I would be intcrestnd to
 know why you pick the H i l l s b o r o u g h S t a dium par ticularly out of all the
 grounds outside the First Division.                 I can only assume it is because it
 has, in the past, been occa sio nal ly used for Semi-Final matches.

       We have a Government, presuma bly s upported by County Authorities,
 intent on ta king money out of sport and re turning only a fraction.         It
 seems d isgraceful that f o r a m a j o r stadium in a place like Sheffield,
 when p u tt ing forward requests that Clubs should be forced to spend more
 money on t h e i r stadia there is no suggestion w here it should come from.
 Possi bly y o u r Aut hor ity has no s ubsidised sports halls, or swimming
 pools, or o ther facilities, but if that is so it w ou ld be a rare exception.
 The G ove rnm ent receives 80 million pounds per annum from the football
 pools and a n o t h e r 32 million pounds in V.A.T. and Cor poration Tax from
 sports, whilst offering with the other hand a m a s s i v e il12 million pounds
 to The Sports Council.

      As y o u p r o b ably know, when they need a new s t a d i u m in Frankfurt or
 Cologne or San Diego, or mos t o t h e r m a j o r cities, the Local Authority
 provide it and charge a rental.

           The last thing I want to see is any gr ound being used to accommodate
 spectat ors that is not one hundr ed per cent safe 'and it is for this reason
 that I have w i l l i ngl y given tirrs and effort t o ’ the M i n ist er of S p o r t ’s
 W o r k i n g Party that w o r k e d to imp lem ent the Safe ty of Sports Grounds Bill.

      You r e f e r to W r e x h a m ’s ground, but I believe this is irrelevant as
 it is the top i n t e rn atio nal gr ound now in Wales and could only be compared
 with Wembley, or any of the 22 First Division grounds already designated.




                                                                                         -V;-/' V 7              -       '        '          Contd..

             Possi bly w h a t y ou are saying is that you would like the ground
             de sign ate d before it is used for m a j o r matches and that may be a
             different request from the one you put forward at present as I see
             no reason w hy that ground should be designated any more than any other
             of the 70 Football League Club grounds outside the First Division.
             Why not R o t h e r h a m and S h e f fi eld United? Surely the average crowd
             at H i l l s b o r o u g h is far safer than any where else in the country.
             If what you are saying is a t h row -ba ck of the problems that existed
             at the S emi -Fin al held there last year,'I do not believe designating
             the ground w o u l d have made a scrap of difference to the problems that
             arose on that occasion.

                                               Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr. Corner,

Ya*4ali»ffi,

Thank you for your letter dated le t March, 1978,

So far a s vandalism Is concerned, you w ill no doubt have noted Item No. 208 on
Page A. 19 of the Council Summons for 28th January, 1978. That proposal to
establish a Joint Working Party with th® City of Sheffield Metropolitan D istrict
Council to consider a ll aspects of hooliganism and vandalism associated with
         and entertainment events which involve the attendance of numbers
of people was agreed.

Despite efforts made by the County Council to make progress on the
establishm ent of the Joix* Working Party, the Sheffield Ctty Council has not yet
signified its approval to this course of action.

However, the County Council's Working Party is to m eet at the end of the
month, and I w ill make your Panel's views known to them.

                                          Yours sin cerely,




                                          Chief Executive.

      Dear Mr Mallett,
      Thank you for your letters of January 6 and 10 on the
      Job Creation Programme and Vandalism.
      Job Creation :
      fhis is'no longer relevant as it has been dealt with at a
      purely Sheffield level and the supply and fitting is
      going ahead - thanks to local efforts.
      Vandalism:
      My committee are still not too happy.   The seminar was on
      31.3 .77, the report on 14«H«77 and your answer to the
      worry of my committee says you are ’hopeful* that a working
      party will be created "shortly".
      Our complaint is two-fold:
      A.                       We still seem to be in a state of constant
                               excuse and delay.
      B.                       the working party sounds like yet more talk
                               and vexy little action.
      However, on the positive side - we would be delighted to
      take a place on your working party, the better to urge
      some action.   May we look forward to an invitation?

      Yours sincerely,



     M. Corner,

Dear Mr. Pensam ,

Hooliganism/Vandalism Working Party

Referrtgg to my letter of 19th January, the County Council has
expressed concern that no conflr nation has been received from
the City Council of the proposed joint working arrangem ents.

In the circum stances, I have been requested to approach the
City Council to ask whether the City Council are to enter into
joint working arrangements on hooliganism /vandalism .

Perhaps you would let me have the comments.

                                   Yours sincerely,

 Dear S i r

 I refer to the report of the Hooliganism/Vandalism Working Party meeting
 held on 6 February 1978, and the note for the file prepared by Mr Harris.
 I hope that the following information will be useful.

 In 1974, 1975, 1976 and 1977 Football Association'Cujr Finals were held at
 Hillsborough. All of these matches were played in the afternoon.    In 1977
 the League Cup Final was re-played at Hillsborough, this game being played
 in the evening. At all of the matches mentioned there were capacity gates
 (55,000) and in all of the cases people turned up without tickets, adding
 to the problems. I am afraid that, with the exception of the current
 season, I can not give you accurate figures for the gates. This season so
 far, the average gate is just over 11§ thousand. The gate has exceeded
 15 thousand on only three occasions, against Walsall in the League Cup
 (18,350); against Everton in the League Cup (36,079) and against Rotherham
 in the League (18,803). There have been few crowd problems at Hillsborough
 thus far this season, for example in respect of the three matches with the
 highest gates, two people were ejected from the ground in the Walsall game,
 three were ejected and two arrested in the Everton game and there were no
 arrests or ejections in the Rotherham match.

 I do not have complete statistics for the years 1975 and 1976. The average
 gate for the 1975/1976 season was probably something like 13 thousand and
 for the 1976/1977 season the gate was 11,721. Discounting semi-finals, in
 the 1975/1976 season I have no note of a gate exceeding 15 thousand. In
 the 1976/1977 season I have a note of five matches where the gate exceeded
 15 thousand.

 I would stress that the information which I have provided may not in every
 case be accurate and should, therefore, be used carefully. I should also
 add that I have no record of real safety problems caused within the ground.
 No doubt Mr Harris will be contacting the Chief Constable, as mentioned in
 9(v) of his note.




                                                                                                 Continued/........



THE OFFICER DEALING WITH THIS CORRESPONDENCE IS                           EXTENSION.
Mr F A Mallett LL.B                 -   2   -            23 February 1978




As a general comment, I would mention that when the South Yorkshire Police
first raised the question of the designation of the Hillsborough Stadium
under the Safety of Sports Ground Act, the approach was on the basis of
treating Hillsborough in the same way as stadia where international matches
were held, for example Wrexham. My own personal view is that that is a
better approach than to deal with Hillsborough as purely and simply a
League Cup ground with probably rather more than average attendances for
a club in the Third Division in the Football League.

Y6urs faithfully




^hief Constable

      I have received your letter of tha 16th Vebruaxy
and of oourae, was awaro that the question of Laada
Unitad.f.C. could not halp ua on the fundamental isaua
of hooliganiam in Sheffield. I wrote to you after tha
quaation had baan takan up with me at a raoant *surgery*
and of course, if Laada played in Shaffiald and extra
police were needed^ it would coat tha rata payara in thia
area money which Leeds rata patera would have paid if tha
matohea wara playad in Laada; that waa tha aola reason for
sqt writing to you.

       However, aa a result of a raoant programme on ladio
 Sheffield,with tha journalist               I found it
 neoeaaary to again taka up tha general iaaua of compensation
 to auffarara from hooliganiam and vandaliam. I am sanding you
 a oopy of tha Miniates** answer before I lot \             para
 it,beoause it aeema to ma that it naeda oareful interpretation;
 and the Miniater aaama to be implying that a discretionary araa
far a 2p rata axiata whioh would enable tha Counter Council to
cempenaate these individuala*
      Thia ia,af oourae, news to maraud wanting to da what la
 right,anA also to halp my awn County Counoil.I would welcome your
 interpretation of thia bafara I - aa I will have ta - aend the

consulted my Department's legal advisors and I attach a note
based on their advice, I do not think this really gets us much
further on this problem - clearly it would be inappropriate for
the Department to give advice on the propriety of authorities?
exercising Section 111 or 137 of the Local Government Act in any
particular circumstances.
You will know, of course, that Courts can order persons convicted
of criminal offences, and this includes offences like causing
criminal damage, to compensate their victims m respect of
any personal injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence.
In such cases I believe the Court j& take into account the ability of
the offender to pay compensation; and there is always the difficulty


I am not sure that any of this is of comfort to those people who
live near professional football grounds. I, and my Working Party as
a whole, share your concern over the effects of hooliganism on

have developed methods of controlling large groups of supporters
entering and leaving grounds and the Working Party will be discussing
the difficult problems of transport, in detail, at its next meeting.
We are continuing to develop an integrated strategy for preventing
and containing crowd violence in consultation with the football
authorities, police, transport operators and other interests and
I think this approach offers the best chance of success in the
campaign against football crowd disorders.

There are no obvious powers which would enable an authority to
make compensatory payments in the circumstances which you
describe. Section 137 of the Local Government Act 1972 enables
an authority to spend ^up to the product of a value of 2p in any
financial year for purposes which in their opinions are in the
interests of their area or any part of it or all or some of its
inhabitants.


In this respect it would appear that each local authority is the
only arbiter as to what they consider to be in the interests of
their area. The use of the powers conferred by the section are
wholly independent of any of the powers expressed in section 111
and are only available where no other powers exist. The power
cannot be used to fill what are considered to be ’gaps’ in other
                                                                                                 A _ JL

common law rule that an authority may do anything which is
calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the
discharge of any of its functions. In other words a local
authority must first define a function on which to hang the

these powers can be used in the type of situation discussed.

Dear Sir,

Hoollganlsm/Vandalls m

Your letter of 5th January was submitted to a recent meeting of the
County Council 's Working Party, when they were pleased to note your
assurance o f co-operation.

In particular, fee Working Party asked that you be asked to say what
level of payment B ritish Bail has in mind for the maintenance of fee
Wadsley Bridge Station to a minimum standard to enable tt to be used
for football sp ecials.

H ie Working Party were also pleased to hear of your offer made at fee
O fficers’ Working Group held on 26th January to participate in discussions
on hooliganism. This w ill certainly be borne in mind as soon a s fee
proposal to estab lish a Joint Working P arty w ife fee Sheffield City Council
has been clarified.

If you think it would be u seM to have an Informal discussion on the
Wadstey Bridge Station minimum maintenance standards payment question,
Mr. D. Vaughan (Ext. 422) of my staff would be happy to m eet you on a
mutually convenient date.

                                     Yours faithfully,

    Dear Sir,

    Working Party on Football Ground Behaviour

    In reply to your letter of 9th February, the County Council has, of course,
    already forwarded Its views on tills subject to the A ssociation on 3rd October,
    1977. These views (contained In a Report dated 28th September, 1977) were
    considered by your P olice and F ire Committee on 9th November, 1977.

    As you w ill see from the attached further copy of the Report, the County Council's
    view s are closely allied with those of your Public P assenger Transport Sub­
    com m ittee. Points additional to those mentioned by your Sub-Committee are:-

    1.      The County Council feels that legislation should be sought to give
            all County Authorities the power to ban any proposed sporting event
            where the Authority, having considered all the information and
            evidence available to them, consider there to be a real danger that
            persons attending or attempting to attend the event will cause Injury
            or damage to persons and property or cause fear or alarm to the
            residents in the vicinity where the proposed event is to take place.

    2.      That payment should be made by the relevant club (possibly covered
            by Insurance) for all police, ambulance, medical and hospital costs,
            and compensation for all personal Injury and damage to property.

    3.      That rail and coach operators should be requested to ensure compliance
            with the recommendation of the M inister of Sport that arrivals should
            be timed as close as ^pssible to the commencement of matches and
            departures as soon as possible after the cessation of matches.

    4.      That stric t control of ticket allocation should be sought, especially
            at a ll advance ticket events, with tickets being Issued only to bona
            fide club supporters, coopled with the exclusion from special coaches
            and trains of those without tickets.

5.       That clubs should give guarantees of full compliance within the
         grounds of a ll antl-hoollganism m easures Ijpoposed by the P o lice.

6.       That Clubs should arrange for gates to be opened as early as
         possible before a match so that the fans do not have any reason to
         congregate in the vicinity of stadia.

As I am sure you will have gathered, the County Council Is very much concerned as
  the problem s of this subject, and rwoul&.’ be Interested to se e what positive action

  actually recommended to the Government Working Party by the A ssociation.

     Dear Sir

     WORKING PARTY ON FOOTBALL GROUND BEHAVIOUR

     The Association is represented on the forking Party set up by l*lr Denis Howell
     MP, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment.

     Member authorities will be concerned with the problems created by bad behaviour
     and vandalism associated with football matches to varying degreee and particular
     attention is drawn to the police» public passenger transport, and building
     regulation functions of local government.

     The subject was debated at a recent meeting of the Public Paeeengsr Transport
     Sub-Committee of the Association whsn it urns suggested that the problems could
     be lessened by

                (a)   stiffer penalties of a less acceptable type for those
                      caueing damage or bodily harm;
                (b)   a review of the arrangemente for the consumption of alcohol
                      in and around football grounds as well as on public transport;
                (c)   encouraging the provieion of all seat accommodation at grounds
                      if necessary withdJtos assistance of grante and loans;
                (d)   a review of the certification procedure   under the Safety of
                      Sport Grounds Act 1975 to eneure that a   reasonable degree of
                      coneistence ie in evidence and that the   resource of dietrict
                      council building control staff is fully   exploited;
                (e)   the inclusion of a representative of a public transport authority
                      and a building regulation officer at future meetings of the
                      Working Party;
                (f)   consideration of compensation payments to bus operators undertaking
                      special responsibilities-by operating vehicles to assist the
                      police or the public in the event of their vehicles being damaged
                      byppapparfcers.

    The Committee felt that before reaching any conclusion as to positivs action
    which should be recotnmendsd to the Government Working Party the views of all


                                                       1.

reply by the end of the month.

Dear Eon,

     The arguments about Cup Tie Semi-Finals are still
with ae very ouch. At ay *•tttsgeiy* last Saturday I had
a constituent who lives at the side of Wednesday G-round
who raised with me what seems to be a very important
point about Leeds United. He said that other cities
where Cup Rounds were played by Leeds, as a result of the
F.A. Disciplinary Committee decision*would incur the risk
of hooliganism and vandalism and also have to pay the
police force out of their own local rates i.e. Leeds would
get away soot free and other cities would have to pay for
having potential vandals from Leeds and other cities in
their midst.

     What do you think about this?    I would appreciate
your vieira*

Dear Sir,

atfety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

The Chief Constable was kind enough to let m e know of the contents of the Department’s
letter to him dated 24th August, 1977.

Whilst the County Council appreciate the joints made, the fact remains that the
Hillsborough Stadium has In recent years consistently staged sem i-finals of the
F.A* Cup, as well as such other events a s League Cup Final Replays on occasions.

The residents of South Yorkshire, and Sheffield In particular, feel m ost strongly
that action must be taken to combat the vandalism and violence which has unfortunately
become a feature of many football m atches, especially those Involving certain clufes.
A s a fir st step, the County Council Intends to Initiate discussions with all In terested
parties In an effort to reach a voluntary code of practice,

la the longer term , It Intends to seek legislation to give It (and all County Authorities)
the power to ban any proposed sporting event where they, having considered all the
Information and evidence available to them, consider there to be a real danger feat
persons attending or attempting to attend the event will cause Injury or damage to
persons and property or cause fear or alarm to the residents In the vicinity where the
proposed event Is to take place.

& the m eantime, the County Council consider that even though the Safety of Sports
Grounds A ct, 1975 has little relevance to Hooliganism and no relevance to events
taking place outside the ground, all stadia (and the Hillsborough stadium in par tissular)
where large crowds could be attracted should be automatically and properly brought
under the A ct, Only In this way can County Authorities be satisfied that proper
action has been taken within the grounds.

 I am instructed, therefore, to request feat the Hillsborough Stadium should be
 specifically designated by the Secretary of State under Section 1 of the Safety of
 Sports Grounds Act, 1975.

1.   At M inisterial level, being dealt with by |                        ]- check on H ansard
     Vol. 918 No. 171 for 25th October 1976 page 163 for statem ent of M inisterial policy.........

2.   Policy related to firs t division club grounds and international grounds - then to review
     in light of experience. Note that some County Councils had still not acted on the p resent
     o rd e r:
                  Tyne & W ear              -    Newcastle
                                                 Sunderland

                  D erbyshire               -    Derby County

     M r. H a r r is to check with Tyne and W ear and GMC at meeting next week whether action
     im m inent.
     To an extent this was holding up review p r o c e s s ....................

3.   New Designation O rd ers

     a)   will have to be an O rd er to take c a re of any clubs prom oted to F ir s t Division not
          already covered - at end of cu rren t season.

     b)   the next o rd e r covering Second Division clubs Is not to be expected at end of this
          season and it did net seem likely to be this y e a r ...........

     Note that timing of County Council p re s s u re should be related to timing of new O rd ers
     (Home Office will not make one for Hillsborough only - u nless some m ajor accident)
     so submit case if m em b ers wish as soon a s possible to make point well before:end
     of c u rre n t season.

4.   Home Office adopting a pragm atic approach - accept that this is something of a blunt
     in strum ent. A rising out of discussion, following conclusions em erged:

     i)   w arn m em b ers not to em phasise the 'hooliganism ' asp ects nor the concern about
          activity outside the ground - while there a r e connections with what goes on inside
          ground Home Office a r e firm that Act deals with safety inside the ground and a re
          only likely to ag ree the case if based on that (too easy to defeat argum ent about
          connections-a weak argum ent can spoil a strong case) - Miss Owen not too im p re ssed
          by my argum ents which s tre s s e d en try /e x it points as A ct (she rightly argued) related
     to   to safety inside the ground only...........
                                           -2 -



       ii)   Home Office do accept that Hillsborough case is properly raised - information, would
             be useful as follows to have case re-exam ined;
             a)      how many Cup etc. gam es over la s t five y e a rs
             b)     what w ere crowds p resen t

             c)     what was average gates over la s t four y e a rs - how d d /d o e s this com pare
                    with F irst/S eco n d division gates.

             d)     what w ere la rg e st gates over la s t few seasons - say list all those over 15,000?

             e)     any police evidence re safety difficulties within the ground.

       iii) B ase the case, if facts support it, on

             a)      past use of ground for "big occasions" with la rg e gates on a reg u lar basis       A '   '



                     and supplement it with

             b)      evidence that average gates a re com parable with Second Division clubs
                     and, th erefo re, crowd levels ra th e r than Division justify action (how does
                     Hillsborough com pare with B ram hall Lane for exam ple a s It could be
                     ridiculous if two com parable grounds in the sam e City w ere treated differently).

4.    If early su ccess not achieved, repeat ex ercise a fte r a period - a s both F .A . and Club
      a r e against designation, is th ere evidence that F .A . etc. not giving Hillsborough ’big
      gam es' in o rd e r to avoid designation r isk (so again, check reco rd over last 5 y e a r s and
      see if pattern c h a n g e s .. . . )

5.     Check with County Councils affected by existing O rder - what was th e ir exp erience? In
       b rie f, was much work n ecessary on safety grounds, were lim its on capacity reduced
       (cf Cardiff) what w ere average g ates. Could produce evidence to support Hillsborough
       action.

6. Need to explain why County Councils hand would be strengthened and why d esirab le - in
   brief County Council does not know what position is (nor does Home Office),they should do
   o n public policy grounds experience of oth er County Councils is that action was n ecessary ,
   yet on reg u lar basis larg e crowds a re attracted - application under slO to a m ag istrates
 ^ court is little use as County Council would need evidence that something was wrong (without
   inspections etc. how is this to be established) .

7.     Support for designation fro m Sheffield City Council and Chief Constable.

8>     Conclusion . My im pressio n is that the Home Office have not closed th e ir minds on th is.
       If a strong case can be put together based on facts not g en eralities, then I think th ere is a
       fair chance.

9.     A ction
       i) R eport to M embers Working P a r t y . If they decided to p r e s s the m a tte r then
      ii)    consult Police and find out w here the evidence about crowd levels can be obtained
              and work up the case a s indicated in this note,
     iil)    w rite to County Councils covered by the firs t Designation O rd er to obtain basic inform ation
    iv)     Mr. H a rris to ask Tyne & W ear ( |                  and GMC ('
            if th eir certificate s a r e to be issued shortly.

     v)     aim to c le a r case with m em bers by end of F e b ru a ry /e a rly March and submit to
            Home Office - decision required as to whether a deputation is thought likely to
            a s s i s t / an alternative is for Mr. H a rris/C h ie f Constable to see Miss Owen (she
            seem s influential and this would probably be sufficient at least in the firs t in stan c e
            b etter to hold the political approach in re se rv e and see |
            la te r in the light of the f irs t discussion?)

 12. Soccer Hooliganism - At our last meeting we
 decided to consider whether there is need to obtain
 further powers of control over "football hooliganism".
 South Yorkshire have made a study of the problem and
 they recommend that powers should be sought for local
 authorities to ban any proposed sporting event where
 they consider danger exists of injury or damage to
 persons or property. They also consider that the
 Secretary of State should use his powers to designate
 grounds for safety precautions (under the Safety of
 Sports Grounds Act 1975) much more freely.

 13. We intend to resume consideration of the matter
 when we have information as to proceedings in the
 Working Party on Football Crowd Behaviour (chaired by
 the Rt Hon Denis Howell WP) and upon which we have
 just been invited to appoint representatives; we have
 appointed our Chairman as one of the Association's 3
 representatives.

    Dear Mr.

    Hooliganism at Football Matches

    Following our correspondence ea rlier this year, the County Council's


«   Working Party on Football Hooliganism met and considered what action
    they could recommend.               *

    As you w ill se e from the attached copy of their Report, they have made
    six specific recommendations, a ll of which have been accepted by the
    County Council. At this stage I would especially draw your attention to
    recommendation 4.

    In particular, I understand that Junior Attendance Centres have now been
    s e t up In the four main centres of the County for the reception of boys
    aged 10-16 years, and are available as a sanction for offenders found
    guilty of offences committed at football m atches. I further understand
    that Senior Attendance Centres for youths aged 17 and under 21 are not
    yet available In the county.

    Accordingly, I have to request that recommendation 4 be drawn to the
    attention of your Bench.

    So far as recommendation 3 is concerned, would your Bench be willing to
    be represented at a possible future meeting with Licensed Vttuallers and
    B rew eries, etc, to try to agree a procedure for banning the sale of
    Intoxicating liquor on certain match days?

                                      Yours sincerely,

     Dear Mr. Mallett,

                       Hooliganism at Football Hatches
               *                                          -               >.
                Thank you for your letters of 2nd November and 2nd December.
     I apologise if there would appear to be a misunderstanding here, but I must
     confess to a slight degree of confusion so far as this matter is concerned.
     When I spoke to your rep resentative over the telephone earlier this year I
     repeated my views as stated in my letter of 21st June to you and further
©    indicated that the magistrates would be prepared to join in discus-sions.
     did, however, make it clear that I was well aware that both the County
     Council and the District Council were showing an interest in this matter
     and the only qualification to my comment was that I was sure that the
     magistrates would not wish to duplicate discussions. I was of course aware
     that last June there was talk of a joint approach between the County Council
     and the District Council in tackling football hooliganism in the area.

                Twelve members of the Sheffield Bench representing the various
     Committees and interests on the Bench attended a meeting on 23rd November
     with the City Council Working Party on Hooliganism and Vandalism and there
     fully discussed proposals in that Working Party's first report. I have
     now had on invitation from the local authority to provide magistrate
     representatives for further discussions with a view to preparing specific
     proposals.

                This invitation will be placed before a meeting of the Magistrates'
     Courts Committee on 30th January, 1978. If you wish I will place your
     correspondence before the Magistrates' Courts Committee at the same time but
     as I say I am sure that the Magistrates' Courts Committee would not wish ta t* ;
     duplicate any work they do between two levels of the same authority. I woiM m

    Bear Sir

                                     HOOLIGANISM AT FOOTBALL MATCHES

         Thank you for the sight of the report of the County Council's Working
   Party on the above subject.

         Quite obviously, it is in our own interests to co-operate to the
   maximum extent in combatting hooliganism and the often associated vandalisra
   and I will support the recommendations made in the report with one or two
   provisos.

         In so far as Recommendation 5 is concerned, certainly I am prepared
   to make locax suburban railway stations available for supporters, provided
   this is done in consultation with British Railways. I say this in the
   knowledge that in recent times, police requirements as to the use of
   certain stations for football supporters have not been practical so far as
   railway operations are concerned and it must be appreciated by all parties'
   involved in making arrangements that restrictions do exist in route
   knowledge of train crews and operational limitations when certain events
   and local suburban stations are being considered.

         Nevertheless, you have my assurance that we will co-operate with all
   parties concerned in the effort to separate supporters and combat
   vandalism and hooliganism.
                                                                              m
         As you are aware, we do, in fact, open Wadsley Bridge station
   specially on Saturdays for supporters travelling on scheduled trains from
   the Penistone direction when Sheffield Wednesday are playing at home. This,
   in addition to the special occasions such as Cup replays, Semi-Final matches,
   etc. Wadsley Bridge stations is, in my view, an ideal location for this
   particular ground and I am quite prepared to continue its existence. You
   will appreciate, however, that the South Yorkshire P.T.A. have stated that
   they are not prepared to support the Passenger Service over the route
   through Wadsley Bridge and withdrawal of the Sheffield/Penistone/Huddersfield
   service is a distinct possibility in the future.
        Providing the route remains open, I am quite prepared to continue to
  run services to and from Wadsley Bridge as required for special occasions.
  The area around the station and the station itself is subject to vandalism
  and whilst it only requires to be maintained to a minimum standard, there is
  an ongoing cost to cover this situation and in the light of the Working
  Party report, may I suggest we enter into discussion with you in respect of
  payment towards the continuation of Wadsley Bridge Station in respect of it
  being available to cater for football excursions as recommended by the
  Working Party.

                                                  Yours faithfully

                  For the attention of Mr. J. P. Walshaw.

                  Dear Sir,

                                                                       WADSLEY BRIDGE RAILWAY STATION

                               Thank you for your memo dated 19th January enclosing a
                  copy of a letter which you have received from the Divisional Manager of
                  British Railways.

                               The point made in the penultimate paragraph of his letter
                  is true. At the present time the PTE does not support the Sheffield/
                  Penistone/Huddersfield service and, unless there is a remarkable change
                  in circumstances, it is unlikely that the Executive will ever recommend
                  the support of this service.   On this basis it is quite likely that
                  Wadsley Bridge Station will be closed.   However, from a PTE point of view,
                  I would confirm the remarks made in the Divisional Manager's letter and.
                  of course it would be up to the County to justify any expenditure it considered
                  appropriate to pay to BR for the maintenance of such a facility for football
                  excursions.

                                                                                               Yours faithftilly,

         Dear Sir

         Hooliganism at Football Matches

         Further to recent correspondence, I have to inform you that the
         Crowd Control Committee of the Football Association has now met
         and considered the report submitted by your Council,

         The Committee was able to accept the majority of your report and
         would concur with much of its thinking.

«P       However, the Committee was not able to support your Coun c i l ’s desire
         to obtain powers for the closing of football grounds on particular
         occasions.

         Representatives of the FA will be meeting the Minister of Sport
         fairly shortly and it is hoped that your report can be discussed
         at that meeting.

         Yours faithfully

                Dear Sir

                Hooliganism at Football Matches

                Thank you for your letter of 10th January.

                I apoligise for failing to contact you sooner.

                Following the meeting with the Minister of Sport,
                the Football Assoication could see no reason for
                changing its views, as expressed in our letter of
                8th November 1977.  I think I am right in saying
                also that the Minister of Sport shared our views.

                However, I would not like to put words into the
                Minister's mouth, and I would suggest that you
                contact him direct on this subject.

                Yours faithfully

Dear Mr. Harris,                                                                                         "

HOOLIGANISM AND VANDALISM WORKING PARTY

While it does not go very far towards actually solving the problem,
I enclose for your information and comment, copies of our notes of
three recent meetings; the first was the meeting with various outside
bodies, the second of course with yourselves and the third was with
the various football interests, who generally were unable to attend
our earlier meeting with outside bodies, purely because of other
commitments»

As I say, I should be pleased to receive any specific or general
comments you might care to make and I should mention that Councillor
Wilson, who is of course the Chairman of our Working Party, has
expressed some reluctance at the proposed joint working arrangements
in view of the limited terms of reference of the County Council's
Working Party, Obviously, this point will require some further
consideration, but in the meantime, we are proceeding with the
arrangements which, as you know, we have already made.

I think the best thing we can do is ensure that both sides know what
the other is doing on their respective fronts and I look forward to
hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,




Head of Department

          -MEETING   RE   HOOLIGANISM AND VANDALISM HELD IN THE TOWN HALL
                                 ON 23R D NOVEMBER 1 9 7 7




The meeting was chaired by Councillor Wilson and attended by representatives
of the City Council, the Magistrates (including the Licensing Justices
and the Juvenile Bench), Sheffield and District Licensed Victuallers
Association, South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive, Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club, Sheffield a n d Hallamshire County Football
Association, South Yorkshire Police and Sheffield Recreation Department.

Apologies for absence were received from the Football League and Sheffield
United Football Club.

The Chairman explained that because of the steadily increasing incidence
of acts of vandalism and hooliganism in the City, the Council had formed
a Working Party whose terms of reference include investigating and
making recommendations on all aspects of hooliganism and vandalism
associated with sporting and entertainment, events which involve the
attendance of numbers of people.

The Working Party had now iqet and produced a report containing certain
initial recommendations, which report had been circulated to all interested
parties and was the basis for discussion at this meeting, and members
were invited to put forward their views and suggestions.

The intention was to collate firm recommendations on steps which could
be taken to meet the problem for submission to the Association of
Metropolitan Authorities and through that Association, to the Government
for possible legislative action.

There followed a long and wide ranging discussion and it was finally
agreed that one representative would be nominated by each of the bodies
or organisations which had been invited to attend, together with a
representative from the Education Department. The Head of Administration
and Legal Department would obtain the nominations and arrange an early
meeting of those representatives with a view to considering the Working
Party’s report and making further recommendations.

 The following were the main points which had emerged in the discussions
 and which it was agreed should be examined by the Working Party

   (a)   the possible need lor local authorities to have statutory
         powers to control the staging of certain types of event,
         this and the other matters covered in the Working Party’s
         report to be the initial areas of consideration

   (b) the need for magistrates to have more options open to them
       in dealing with offenders

   (c) the need for a great many more Adult Attendance Centres
        throughout the country

   (d) the need for a more responsible attitude on the part of
        the media in their treatment of the subject of violence generally
          *


                                          1-
(e)   in the case of football matches, the need to be able to influence
      transport operators to ensure that visiting supporters arrive
      as late as possible before kick-off and leave as soon as
      possible after the end of matches

(f)   the need to investigate more closely the hitherto generally
      accepted assumption that alcohol is always a prime factor in
      crowd violence

(g)   the need to impress on patents their responsibilities, e.g.
      by making them pay compensation for acts of vandalism (especially
      in schools) where offenders are positively identified

(h)   the encouragement by the Education and Recreation Departments
      of participation by young children in tree and flower planting
      schemes ■

(i)   the need to investigate other possible educational measures in
      an effort to tackle the problem at its source and to influence
      young children in positive and constructive directions

(j)   the need to investigate existing recreational facilities in the
      10/16 age group and to establish what more could reasonably be
      done and also ascertain what work in this field is already
      being carried out in the City by other bodies and organisations.

Council and the County Council, both pf which ha d produced initial
     •ks  However  the County Council report appeared to be concerned
exclusiiely with hooliganism at football matches, whilst the City
Council's Working Party terms of reference covered a wider field,
 including problems of vandalism.

 Mr H a r r i s    pointed out that in fact the County Council were also concerned

                       9TH JANUARY  1978


                             Present:

  Sheffield City Council:        Councillors G.C.E. Wilson (in the Chair)
                                 P.J. Moscrop, J, Watson

  Sheffield United F.C.          Messrs. K.E. Walker, F. O ’Gorman

  Sheffield Wednesday F.C.    .Messrs.   E. Barron, E. England




After Mr. Pensam had outlined the events leading up to this meeting,
Councillor Wils o n explained the intention to invite each of the
interested bodies (including those represented at this meeting) to
appoint one representative to serve on a working group to consider the
recommendations of the City Council's Working Party and their submissions.

Mr. Wragg stated that the Football League did not accept any assumption
that hooliganism and vandalism were inevitably associated with football
matches and was assured by Councillor Wilson that the City Council was
concerned with the problem over a much wider field and fully accepted
that incidents associated with football matches were only one facet of
that problem.

There followed a general discussion during which & number of points were
raised, e.g. the lack of out of school facilities for young people in the
11-15 age group; the role of local football organisations in providing
coaching for young people; the efforts and limitations of schools in
their approach to problems of violence and vandalism; the need for the
causes of hooliganism and vandalism to be investigated apd dealt with
at Government level; and the need for more responsible reporting by the
media.  On the last point, Councillor Wilson stated that representatives
of the local media would be invited to serve on the Working Group.
Reference was made to papers on the subject produced by other bodies.

He also stated that the conclusions and recommendations o f the Working
Party would, through the City Council, be circulated to the AMA, other
major cities, to the Sheffield Members of Parliament, with a view
to enlisting their support for any representations which may be made
to the Government.

The football representatives gave an assurance of their full support
for the efforts being made and it was noted that Mr. Wragg and Mr. Barron
had been nominated to represent the Football League and Sheffield
Wednesday F.C. respectively on the Working Party and that Sheffield
United F.C. wo uld submit an early nomination.

    Subject
              Joint Working P arty on Hooliganisam                                         25.1.78




              M r. Thwaites has mentioned to me the proposed meeting on 6th F ebruary at 2 p .m .
              to d iscu ss the setting up of the Working P arty on Hooliganism. I understand
              he has had a word with M r. Watson. I shall not be able to attend, as I hope to be
              away that day. I have spoken to M r. P ensara who is s p e a k i n g to Mr, Watson about
              the meeting this afternoon - he will then ring me back.       I have put it toboth
              M r. Thwaites and M r. P en sara that my presence is somewhat superfluous as
              th e re a re only two m atters for discussion -

              a)       te rm s of referen ce of the Working P a rty and

              b)       num ber of M em bers.


              A s fa r as the te rm s of referen ce a re concerned, it seem s to give r is e to little
              difficulty as we have adopted the sam e te rm s of referen ce as the Sheffield Working
              P arty , insofar as these a re to be followed, M r. Thwaites has authority to ag ree.
              A s fa r as num bers a re concerned I think Sheffield suggested 5 on each side and
              we have had 6; but -Mr. Thwaites ag rees that, as inevitably at le a s t one m em ber is
              unavailable w hatever date is fixed for the m eeting, he could safely agree 5 as long
              as it is accepted that there might be some m inor variation in attendance.

              Could you have a word with me in a few days tim e to settle what we do.

              Incidentally I have now fixed to see M iss Owen during the morning of Thursday
              2nd F eb ru ary .

                       For the attention of Mr. J. P. Walshaw.

                       Dear Sir,

                                                                                          WADSLEY BRIDGE RAILWAY STATION

                                    Thank you for your memo dated 19th Januaiy enclosing a
                       copy of a letter which you have received from the Divisional Manager of
                       British Railways.

                                    The point made in the penultimate paragraph of his letter
                       is true. At the present time the PTE does not support the Sheffield/
                       Penistone/Huddersfield service and, unless there is a^ remarkable change
                       in circumstances, it is unlikely that the Executive will ever recommend
                       the support of this service.   On this basis it is quite likely^that
                       Wadsley Bridge Station will be closed.   However, from a PTE point of view,
                       I would confirm the remarks made in the Divisional Manager's letter and
                       of course it would be up to the County to justify any expenditure it considered
                       appropriate to pay to BR for the maintenance of such a facility for football
                       excursions.

                                                                                                                        Yours faithfully,

Dear Mr.

BooUganla n and Vandalism Working Party

Thaak you for your letter ol loth January, and notes of recent meeting.

You x m y wish to note that, following the discussion between the two Working Parties
on 6th January, our Policy Committee has now amended the ter ns of reference ol
Its working party to accord with those of your working party. As previously agreed
County Councillor Thwaites has la any event been authorised to settle a o y matters
relating to the terms of reference or composition of the new Working Party arrangements
with the City Council representative.

I hope this action will alleviate the problems which evidently were being encountered
In relation to the Implementation of proposed Joint working arrangements. I look
forward to receiving confirmation of the City Council's agreement, where upon perhaps
Mr. Harris could contact you on the next practical steps.




                               Yours sincerely.




                                Chief Executive




B. Pensara Esq.,

SHEFFIELD
South Yorkshire.
Not* for Councillor Cornwall


I attach a copy of the letter which I received from Sheffield which I was particularly
asked to treat as '’semi confidential".

You will see that the reason (or excuse) for not oo-operating with the County Is said
to be that the County Council are only Interested In "football" hooliganism whereas
Sheffield are Interested In hooliganism generally.

In your letter to the Sheffield City Council Group Secretary therefore It Is rather
Important that It Is made clear that the County are happy to copoperate in the
Working Party on the matter of hooliganism generally. I thought I should mention
this to you particularly as your Group minute makes a reference to co-operating
on football hooliganism - does your letter to the Sheffield City Group Secretary
need altering at all.

Dear Mr. <


Hooliganism


I refer to Mr. H arris' conversation with you about the question of the Joint Working
Party on Hooliganism between the City Council and the County Council.

I understand that it might be helpful if you as Secretary of the SYCC Labour Group
would write to the Secretary of the Sheffield City Council Labour Group Indicating
thfflt your Group welcom e the establishm ent of such a Joint Working Party to avoid
duplication of effort and to enable joint action to be taken after Ideas have been pooled.

You agreed to raise the matter at your Executive meeting on Monday next - unfortunately
there was no tim e to add this Item to your agenda as suggested; hence this letter In
case a reminder would be helpful.




                                            Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr, Harris,

HOOLIGANISM AND VANDALISM WORKING PARTY

While it does not go very far towards actually solving the problem,
I enclose for your information and comment, copies of our notes of
three recent meetings; the first was the meeting with various outside
bodies, the second of course with yourselves and the third was with
the various football interests, who generally were unable to attend
our earlier meeting with outside bodies, purely because of other
commitments.

As I say, I should be pleased to receive any specific or general
comments you might care to make and I should mention that Councillor
Wilson, who is of course the Chairman of our Working Party, has
expressed some reluctance at the proposed joint working arrangements
in view of the limited terms of reference of the County Council’s
Working Party.  Obviously, this point will require some further
consideration, but in the meantime, we are proceeding with the
arrangements which, as you know, we have already made.

I think the best thing we can do is ensure that both sides know what
the other is doing on their respective fronts and I look forward to
hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,




Head of Department




                        For telephone enquiries on this matter please ring    .7-340-19—                 (STDCode 0742)

          •MEETING RE HOOLIGANISM AND VANDALISM HELD IN THE TOWN HALL
                             ON 23RD NOVEMBER 1 9 7 7




The meeting was chained by Councillor Wilson and attended by representatives
of the City Council, the Magistrates (including the Licensing Justices
and the Juvenile B e n c h ) , Sheffield and District Licensed Victuallers
Association, South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive, Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club, Sheffield and Hallamshire County Football
Association, South Yorkshire Police and Sheffield Recreation Department.

Apologies for absence’ were received from the Football League and Sheffield
United Football Club.

The Chairman explained that because of the steadily increasing incidence
of acts of vandalism and hooliganism in the City, the Council had formed
a Working Party whose terms of reference include investigating and
making recommendations on all aspects of hooliganism and vandalism
associated with sporting and entertainment events which involve the
attendance of numbers of people.

The Working Party had now jqet and produced a report containing certain
initial recommendations, which report had been circulated to all interested
parties anrf was the basis for discussion at this meeting, and members
were invited to put forward their views and suggestions.

The intention was to collate firm recommendations on steps which could
be taken to meet the problem for submission to the Association of
Metropolitan Authorities and through that Association, to the Government
for possible legislative action.

There followed a long and wide ranging discussion and it was finally
agreed that one representative would be nominated by each of the bodies
or organisations which had been invited to attend, together with a
representative from the Education Department.  The Head of Administration
and Legal Department would obtain the nominations and arrange an early
meeting of those representatives with a view to considering the Working
Party's report and making further recommendations.

The following were the main points which had emerged in the discussions
and which it was agreed should be examined by the Working Party

  (a)   the possible need for local authorities to have statutory
        powers to control the staging of certain types of event;
         this and the other matters covered in the Working Party's
        report to be the initial areas of consideration

  (b)   the need for magistrates to have more options open to them
         in dealing with offenders

  (c)   the need for a great many more Adult Attendance Centres
         throughout the country
                                                     6

  (d)   the need for    a more responsible attitude on the part of
         the media in   their treatment of the subject of violence generally
(e)    in the case of football matches, the need to be able to influence
       transport operators to ensure that visiting supporters arrive
       as late as possible before kick-off and leave as soon as
       possible after the end of matches

(f)    the need to investigate more closely the hitherto generally
        accepted assumption that alcohol is always a prime factor in
        crowd violence

(g)    the need to impress on parents their responsibilities, e.g.
       by making them pay compensation for acts of vandalism (especially
        in schools) where offenders are positively identified

(h)    the encouragement by the Education and Recreation Departments
        of participation by young children in tree and flower planting
        schemes

(i)    the need to investigate other possible educational measures in
        an effort to tackle the problem at its source and to influence
        young children in positive and constructive directions

( j)   the need to investigate existing recreational facilities in the
        10/16 age group and to establish what more could reasonably be
        done and also ascertain what work in this field is already
        being carried out in the City by other bodies and organisations.

               JO IN T MEETING RE HOOLIGANISM AND VANDALISM
                HELD AT SHEFFIELD ON 6TH JANUARY, 1 9 7 8


                                   Pr e s e n t :

  Sheffield City Council:               Councillors J. Watson (in the Chair)
                                        D.W. George, P.J. Moscrop
                                        Messrs. R. Pensam, E.G. Burgess,
                                        J. Maim, J. Hetherington

  South Yorkshire County Council:       Councillors Sir Ron Ironmonger, W.Circuit,
                                        R. Thwaites, A. Waugh
                                        Messrs. J.C. Harris, D. Vaughan

  An apology for absence was received from Councillor G.C.E. Wilson




Mr. Pensam outlined the events leading up to this meeting and referred
to the Working Parties which had been set up separately by the City
Council and the County Council, both of which had produced initial
reports.  However, the County Council report appeared to be concerned
exclusively with hooliganism at football matches', whilst the City
Council's Working Party terms of reference covered a wider field,
including problems of vandalism.

Mr Harris pointed out that in fact the County Council were also concerned
with these wider aspects and referred to a Seminar which had been
staged by them last year at which problems over a wide field had been
thoroughly aired and which the County Council wished to follow up.

Reference was also made to the direct responsibility of the County
Council for the police, public transport and traffic control, all of
which were relevant in the context of hooliganism and vandalism.

The County representatives suggested that a fresh approach be made to
the matter by the setting up of a Joint Working Party comprising five
members each from the City and County Councils, together with
appropriate officers, such Working Party to have power to co-opt as may
be necessary from time to time.  It was also suggested that Mr. Harris
and Mr. Pensam should produce draft terms of reference for such
Joint Working Party, whose main concerns should b e the identification
of specific problems and the formulation of proposals for dealing with
these problems.  The Working Party should not attempt to identify or
produce conclusions on either actual or hypothetical causes of
vandalism, which were matters for separate study elsewhere.   It was
agreed that Councillors Watson and Thwaites should discuss these
proposals after consultation with their colleagues.

After Mr. Pensam had outlined the events leading up to this meeting,
Councillor Wilson explained the intention to invite each of the
interested bodies (including those represented at this meeting) to
appoint one representative to serve on a working group to consider the
recommendations of the City C ouncil ’s Working Party and their submissions.

Mr. Wragg stated that the Football League did not accept any assumption
that hooliganism and vandalism were inevitably associated with football
matches and was assured by Councillor Wilson that the City Council was
concerned with the problem over a much wider field and fully accepted
that incidents associated with football matches were only one facet of
that problem.

There followed a general discussion during which a number of points were
raised, e.g. the lack of out of school facilities for young people in the
       age group; the role of local football organisations in providing
coaching for young people; the efforts and limitations of schools in
their approach to problems of violence and vandalism; the need for the
causes of hooliganism and vandalism to be investigated ajid dealt with
at Government level; and the need for more responsible reporting by the
media.   On the last point, Councillor Wilson stated that representatives
of the local media would be invited to serve on the Working Group.
Reference was made to papers on the subject produced by other bodies.

He also stated that the conclusions and recommendations of the Working
Party would, through the City Council, be circulated to the AMA, other
major cities, to the Sheffield Members of Parliament, with a view
to enlisting their support for any representations which may be made
to the Government.

The football representatives gave an assurance of their full support
for the efforts being made and it was noted that Mr. Wragg and Mr. Barron
had been nominated to represent the Football League and Sheffield
Wednesday F.C. respectively on the Working Party and that Sheffield
United F.C. would submit an early nomination.

Dear Mr. Corner,

Vandalism

Thank you for your letter dated 20th Decem ber.

1 regret to say that it Is true tin t numerous difficulties w ere encountered In
the production of the Report on the Vandalism Seminar* ranging from
prologged illn ess of one of the Group Secretaries to Group Leaders amending
texts at a late stage.

I must admit to delaying replying immediately to your letter, pending the
outcome of i n exploratory meeting la st Friday afternoon between representatives
of the City and County Councils which, incidentally, I had been trying to arrange
sin ce last June.

I am now hopeful that a Joint Working Party w ill be created shortly to look
into m easures to combat hooliganism /vandalism . A s ! understand the position,
the proposed Joint Working Party w ill invite interested persons or tod ies to
d iscu ss with them particular aspects which they w ill be considering from time
to tim e.

                                      Yours sin cerely .

   Dear Sir,

                                            HOOLIGANISM AT FOOTBALL MATCHES.

         Thank you for the sight of the report of the County Council's Working
   Party on the above subject.

         Quite obviously, it is in our own interests to co-operate to the
   maximum extent in combatting hooliganism and the often associated vandalism
   and I will support the recommendations made in the report with one or two
   provisos.

         In so far as Recommendation 5 is concerned, certainly I am prepared
   to make local suburban railway stations available for supporters, provided
   this is done in consultation with British Railways. I say this in the
   knowledge that in recent times, police requirements as to the use of
   certain stations for football supporters have not been practical so far as
   railway operations are concerned and it must be appreciated by all parties
   involved in making arrangements that restrictions do exist in route
   knowledge of train crews and operational limitations when certain events
   and local suburban stations are being considered.

         Nevertheless, you have my assurance that we will co-operate with all
   parties concerned in the effort to separate supporters and combat
   vandalism and hooliganism.

         As you are aware, we do, in fact, open Wadsley Bridge station
   specially on Saturdays for supporters travelling on scheduled trains from
   the Penistone direction when Sheffield Wednesday are playing at home. This,
   in addition to the special occasions such as Cup replays, Semi-Final matches,
   etc. Wadsley Bridge stations is, in my view, an ideal location for this
   particular ground and I am quite prepared to continue its existence. You
   will appreciate, however, that the South Yorkshire P.T.A. have stated that
   they are not prepared to support the Passenger Service over the route
   through Wadsley Bridge and withdrawal of the Sheffield/Penistone/Huddersfield
   service is a distinct possibility in the future.
        Providing the route remains open, I am quite prepared to continue to
  run services to and from Wadsley Bridge as required for special occasions.
  The area around the station and the station itself is subject to vandalism
  and whilst it only requires to be maintained to a minimum standard, there is
  an ongoing cost to cover this situation and in the light of the Working
  Party report, may I suggest we enter into discussion with you in respect of
  payment towards the continuation of Wadsley Bridge Station in respect of it
  being available to cater for football excursions as recommended by the
  Working Party.

                                                         Yours faithfully,

                                                                                                               BR 14301/1

D ear M r, Blchm an,

Hooliganism a t Football M atches

Following o u r corresp o nd en ce e a r lie r this y e a r, the County C ouncil's
Working P a r ty on Football H ooliganism m et and considered what action
they could r e c o m m e n d .

As you w ill se e fro m the attached copy o f th e ir R eport, they have made
six specific recom m endations, a ll of which have been accepted by the
County Council* At this stag e I would esp ecially draw your attention to
recom m endation 4*

In p a rtic u la r, I understand th a t Ju n io r Attendance C entres have now been
s e t up In the fo u r m ain c e n tre s of the County fo r the reception of boys
aged 10-16 y e a rs, and a re available as a sanction fo r offenders found
guilty of offences com m itted a t football m atches. I fu rth e r understand
th at Senior Attendance C en tres fo r youths aged 17 and under 21 a r e not
yet available in the county.

A ccordingly, I have to re q u e st th at recom m endation 4 be draw s to the
attention o f your Bench.

So fa r a s recom m endation 3 is concerned, would your Bench be w illing to
be re p re se n te d a t a possible future m eeting with L icensed Victuallers and
B re w e rie s, e tc . to tr y to a g re e a pro ced u re fo r banning the sale of
Intoxicating liqu o r on c e rta in m atch days?

        Dear Hr. Hallett*

                                                          Hooliganism at Football Hatches

                   Thank you for your letters of 2nd November and 2nd December.
        I apologise if there would appear to be a misunderstanding here, but I must
        confess to a slight degree of confusion so far as this matter is concerned.
        When I spoke to your rep resentative over the telephone earlier this year I
•       repeated my views as stated in my letter of 21st June to you and further
        indicated that the magistrates would be prepared to join in discussions. I
        did, however, make it clear that I was well aware that both the County
        Council and the District Council were showing an interest in this matter
        and the only qualification to my comment was that I was sure that the
        magistrates would not wish to duplicate discussions. I was of course aware
        that last June there was talk of a joint approach between the County Council •
        and.the District Council in tackling football hooliganism in the area.

                   Twelve members of the Sheffield Bench representing the various
        Committees and interests on the Bench attended a meeting on 23rd November
        with the City Council Working Party on Hooliganism and Vandalism and there
        fully discussed proposals in that Working Party's first report. I have
        now had an invitation from the local authority to provide magistrate
        representatives for further discussions with a view to preparing specific
        proposals.

                  This invitation will be placed before a meeting of the Hagistrates*
^      Courts Committee on 30th January, 1978. If you wish I will place your
       correspondence before the Magistrates' Courts Committee at the same time but
       as I say I am sure that the Hagistrates1 Courts Committee would not wish to
       duplicate any work they do between two levels of the same authority. I would
       be grateful to have your observations in due course.

                                                                                               Yours sincerely,

H ooliganism fat Football Matches

Thank you for your le tte r of 19th D ecem ber.

It Is quite tru e that the County Council has been endeavouring since June to re ach
agreem ent with the Sheffield C ity Council on joint WorMfog P a rty arran g em en ts to
look into hooliganism a t fodtball m atches.

The reaso n put forw ard la tte rly by the C ity Council for the lack of p ro g re ss on this
point is that the alm s of th e ir W orking P a rty a re ra th e r w ider than Just football m atches.

I felt obliged to point out that the County Council h as, in feet, alread y looked at such
w id er asp ects at the Sem inar on V andalism held back In M arch. T his w as, of co u rse ,
attended by rep resen tativ es of num erous bodies and organisations. Amongst them
w ere 4 M em bers and 15 O fficers of the C ity Council and m em bers of the B arnsley,
R otherham and Sheffield Benches.

Though it is possibly now a case of b ette r late than never, I am pleased to say that
the City Council has agreed to a meeting between the two Working P a rtie s on
6th Ja n u a ry . It may be that following th is m eeting, th ere will not be a need to m eet
m em bers of your Bench.

I will contact you again before the next m eeting of y our M a g istra tes' C ourts C om m ittee
on 30th Ja n u ary .

                                             Yours sin cerely .

M ir Mr* Richman,

Hooliganism Ini Football Matches

Thank you tor your letter o f l 9th December,

It is quite true that the Countyfiounell has been endeavouring since June to reach
agreement with the flheftletd City Council on Joint Worlisg Party arrangements to
look Into hooliganism al football notches.

The reason put forward latterly by the City Council for the lack of progress on this
point is that the alma o f their Working Party are rather wider than just football matches.

I felt obliged to point oat that the County Council has, In bot, already looked at auoh
wider aspects at the Seminar on Vandalism held back in Mateh, This was, of course,
attended by representatives of numerous bodies and organisations. Amongst them
were 4 Members and 16 Officers of the City Council and members of the Barnsley,
Rotherham and Sheffield Benches.

Though It Is possibly now a case of better late than never, 1 am pleased to say that
the City Council has agreed to a meeting between the two Working Parties on
8th January. It may be that following this meeting, there will not be a need to meet
members of your Bench.

I will contact yon again before the next meeting of your Magistrates’ Courts Committee
on 30th January.

                                         Yours sincerely,

  Dear Mr. Mallett,

                                               Hooliganism at Football Matches

             Thank you for your letters of 2nd November and 2nd December.
  I apologise if there would appear to be a misunderstanding here, but I must
  confess to a slight degree of confusion so far as this matter is concerned.
  When I spoke to your rep resentative over the telephone earlier this year I
  repeated my views as stated in my letter of 21st June to you and further
  indicated that the magistrates would be prepared to join in discussions. I
  did, however, make it clear that I was well aware that both the County
  Council and the District Council were showing an interest in this matter
  and the only qualification to ray comment was that I was sure that the
  magistrates would not wish to duplicate discussions. I was of course aware
  that last June there was talk of a joint approach between the County Council
  and the District Council in tackling football hooliganism in the area.

             Twelve members of the Sheffield Bench representing the various
  Committees and interests on the Bench attended a meeting on 23rd November
  with the City Council Working Party on Hooliganism and Vandalism and there
  fully discussed proposals in that Working Party's first report. I have
  now had an invitation from the local authority to provide magistrate
  representatives for further discussions with a view to preparing specific
  proposals.

             This invitation will be placed before a meeting of the Magistrates'
  Courts Committee on 30th January, 1978. If you wish I will place your
  correspondence before the Magistrates' Courts Committee at the same time but
  as I say I am sure that the Magistrates' Courts Committee would not wish to
  duplicate any work they do between two levels of the same authority. I would
  be grateful to have your observations in due course.

                                                                                  Yours sincerely,




                                                                              Clerk          Justices

Hooliganism

F u rth e r to my le tte r of 8th D ecem ber, the m eeting between the two Working P a rtie s will
now be held at 2. 00 p .m . on F riday, 6th January, 1978 at the Town H all, Sheffield.

F o r your inform ation, the background to this m eeting is that the County Council has
been endeavouring since June, 1977, to reach agreem ent with the City Council on Joint
Working P a rty arrangem ents to look into hooliganism at football m atches.

L atterly , the response of the City Council has been that the aim s of th e ir Working P a rty
a re ra th e r w ider than just football m atches.

A fter consulting the Chairm an of the County Council's Working P a rty , it was pointed
out to the City Council that the County Council had already considered these wider
aspects at a Sem inar on Vandalism held e a r lie r in the y ear. It was also pointed out
that th is Sem inar had been attended by 4 M em bers and 15 Officers of the City Council.
However, the City Council w ere informed that if it was felt that it would again be useful
to do so, th e County Council's Working P a rty would no doubt be happy to look at these
w ider aspects.

Attached, for your inform ation, a re copies of:-

(a)     Report of the County Council's Working P a rty dated 28th September and Note
        of an Informal, M eeting held on 24th November, 1977.

(b)     Reports of the City Council's Working P a rty dated 11th October and 23rd November
        1977.

(c)     Reports originally supplied to the delegates attending the Vandalism Sem inar,
        together with Report on the Sem inar.

                      SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL

REPORT OF WORKING PARTY RELATING
TO HOOLIGANISM AT SOCCER MATCHES

1.   The problem of Hooliganism and Vandalism at Soccer M atches has been brought
     to a head in South Y orkshire with the trouble caused during and a fter the F .A .
     Cup Sem i-Final match between M anchester United and Leeds United held a t the
     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ground e a r lie r this year, and in view of that
     trouble, the re should be no m ore S em i-Final m atches in South Y orkshire until the
     hooliganism problem has been beaten.

2.   It m ust be em phasised at the outset that the Police did a magnificent job both
      in the forw ard planning and in policing on the day and no c ritic ism of them is
      intended by this re p o rt. However, a num ber of trouble m akers in the crowd
     attending the m atch caused damage, injury and some alarm to the public and,
     unfortunately, the public have come to expect a certain type of behaviour from
      Soccer m atches of this so rt and, in p a rtic u la r, to expect it from those involving
      certain clubs.

3.   The Working P a rty consider that the m atter m ust be tackled on a National level
     at the root cause of the problem . C entral Government m ust face up to the
     problem and tackle the causes a t the root.

4.   W hilst the problem needs to be tackled on a National level and may take gome
      tim e to solve, the Working P a rty consider that they owe a duly to the people
      of South Y orkshire to take im m ediate action to prevent wanton violence, damage
      etc. associated with football hooliganism which people of South Y orkshire, be they
     football fans o r otherw ise, generally deplore.

5.   On this b asis the South Y orkshire County Council calls fo r legislation to give
      them the power to ban any proposed sporting event within South Y orkshire w here
      they, having considered a ll the inform ation and evidence available to them,
      co n sid er th e re to be a re a l danger that p erso n s attending o r attem pting to attend
     the event will cause injury o r damage to persons and pro p erty o r cause fe ar or
      a larm to the re sid en ts in the vicinity where the proposed event is to take place.

6.   It is considered that the approach coupled with a rea listic use of the power does
      not run away from the root cause n o r does it move the problem onto someone
      e lse s doorstep in that the powers should be available to a ll County A uthorities.

7.   The Working P a rty have considered the effect of the Safety of Sports Grounds
     A ct 1975, in p a rtic u la r Section 10, and feel that the Act has little relevance to
     hooliganism and no relevance to events taking place outside the ground and thus
     consider that this Act does not contain the n e ce ssary legislative powers now
     req u ired . They nonetheless consider that the power of the S ecretary of State to
     designate a stadium under Section 1 should be ex ercised much m o re freely so that
     a ll stad ia w here larg e crowds could be attrac te d are autom atically and properly
     brought into those arran g em en ts, as only in this way can the County Council be
     satisfied that within the ground p ro p e r action has been taken. F u rth e rm o re the
     Working P a rty co nsider that Hillsborough Football Stadium should be specifically
     designated under Section 1 of the 1975 A ct.
The Working P arty went on to consider a num ber of other m atters connected with
so c c e r hooliganism.

(a)   Hie num ber of unruly p erso n s attending so c ce r m atches looking fo r trouble
      is a m inority of the total attendance.           it is likely that these persons a re
      not "su p p o rters" of th e ir declared team but use the so c ce r m atch as an excuse
      fo r violence and vandalism .

(b) Separation of fans before during and a fter the m atch should alleviate problem s,
    in p a rtic u la r the policing.

(c) The co st involved can be m easured in ex tra policing, damage to property both
    public and p riv ate, and p erso n al injuries including ambulance and m edical
    attendances.

(d) Hooliganism and intoxicating drink in many cases go hand in hand.

(e) Many fans tu rn up at m atches without tickets and when unable to obtain tic t^ M
    a re naturally disgruntled. This fru stra tio n may find an outlet in physical
    violence.

The m a tte rs considered in the preceding parag rap h m e rit am plification in
consideration of the pow ers now called fo r by the County Council.

(a) The unruly m inority can be tackled on two fronts. F i r s t th e ir exclusion from
    grounds and special tran sp o rt, secondly th eir identification if they do a rriv e
    a t the ground w hether o r not they gain adm ission.

      (i)    exclusion of the unruly elem ent could be p artially achieved by s tr ic t
              control of tick et allocation especially a t all advance tick et events.
              Tickets to bonafide club su p po rters (on the lines now operated by
              som e clubs) coupled with exclusion from special coaches and train s
              of those without tickets may discourage so c ce r hooligans who a re
              attem pting to get to away m atches.

      (ii)   identification of the unruly elem ent can a s s is t the police in preventing
              trouble arisin g .


(b) Separation of fans during and after the m atches is already p ra c tise d eg.
    coaches of fans arriv in g shortly before kick off a t sep a ra te entrances
    etc. High fences Inside the grounds to se p arate fans can cause problem s
    especially w here coupled with staggered re le a se of fans; the problem s include
    fire and safely factors p a rtic u la rly w here fans wishing to get out push the
    crowd in front, quite a p a rt from the legal considerations of claim s of false
    im prisonm ent. It m ust also be appreciated th at putting people in "cages"
    m ay aggravate the problem s eg. damage caused when fans b reak out. Ticket
    allocation control can a s s is t also with separation of fans but much depends
    upon the stadium layout, in p a rtic u la r the num ber and location of en tran ce s/e x its.
                                 - 3 -


      (c) Policing inside the so c c e r ground is paid fo r by the club but policing outside
          is not. At the M anchester /L e ed s Sem i-Final th e re w ere four tim es as many
          police outside the ground as th ere w ere inside. The costs of these ex tra
          police (many loaned from other forces) falls on public funds. Those p rim a rily
          responsible for the c o st of damaged pro p erly and injury to people a re those
          causing such damage and injury (although the cost of ambulances .hospital and
          m edical treatm en t is usually irreco verab le). However, quite ap art from the
          difficulties involved in identifying the individuals concerned,those suffering
          from acts of violence and vandalism will generally p u rsue any rem edy
          against a guaranteed source of finance ra th e r than the individual p e rp e tra to rs
          who may be "men of straw ". In consequence, fo r pro p erty damage the claim
          is m ade under the provisions relating to rio t and fo r personal injuries under
          the C rim inal Injuries Compensation Scheme,and hence again the burden falls
          on public funds. The Working P arty however, considered that the co st of
          all these m a tte rs should fall upon those responsible fo r attractin g such a
          la rg e crowd in the f ir s t place, although whether this should be the Football
          A ssociation, the Home Ground o r the Teams involved in the m atches may
          need som e fu rth e r investigation.

      (d) Drink should be banned a t Football Grounds, on Special Soccer T rains and
          Coaches, and discussions with M agistrates /L icenced V ictuallers/B rew eries and
          all other in terested parties should be initiated to see whether the closing of public
          houses/off licences in the vicinity of the grounds on the day of special m atches
          could be achieved.

      (e)   To avoid'disgruntled fans who a re unable to obtain tickets re so rtin g to
            hooliganism and vandalism, every effort should be m ade to discourage persons
            attending without tickets. This involves again the C lub/B ritish K ail/Coach
            O perators in a co-ordinated effort to see that ticket allocations and tra n sp o rt
            of ticket holding fans produces the d esire d resu lt.

10.   The pow ers now sought by the County Council should not be ex ercised in an oppressive
      m anner and indeed som e b uilt in checks (eg. appeal to a M agistrates Court) would
      be p erfectly acceptable. In addition th ere should be power to the Council to waive
      any prohibition notice upon rec eip t of satisfacto ry assu ran ces and guarantees
      (breach of which should c a rry sanctions). Such assu ran ces and guarantees would
      vary in accordance with the circum stances but may well include:-

      (a) S trict control of ticket allocation, distribution and sale.

      (b) Code of p ro ced u res and conduct to b e operated by coach firm s.

      (c) F ull com pliance within the grounds of all anti-hooliganism m easu res proposed
          by the Police.

      (d) Paym ent (covered by insurance) by the relev an t club of all police, ambulance,
          m edical,hospital costs and com pensation fo r p erso n al injury and p ro p erty damage

      (e) Control of supply of liquor on the m atch day.

11.    It is appreciated that the m ajority of Football fans a re law abiding citizens and
       may oppose such rad ical powers a s those now suggested, but it is hoped that people
       w ill accept that the County Council m ust deal with all fans according to the sam e
       ru le s and no doubt those who a re law abiding w ill appreciate the necessity for
       the m easu res now proposed and accept the inherent re stric tio n s on personal liberty
       in the realisatio n that if the m easu res a re successful all will accordingly benefit.

12.    The Working P arty also considered the penalties fo r the various offences caused by
       so c c e r hooligans and welcome the in creased penalties now proposed in the C rim inal
       Law Bill a t p rese n t before P arlia m en t.

13.    RECOMMENDATIONS:

       (i)     A continual approach should be made to the Home S ecretary for the
       Hillsborough Stadium to be designated under Section 1 of the Safety of Sports
       Grounds Act, 1975.

       (ii)     The County Council (possibly involving the AMA) should seek the
       legislative powers re fe r r e d to in the re p o rt.

       (iii)    F u rth e r discussions be held with M ag istrates/L icen sed V ic tu a lle rs/
       B rew eries e tc ., to get agreed a procedure for banning the sale of intoxicating
       liquor on certain m atch days.

       (iv)       T hat an im m ediate approach be made to the p ro p er authority
       demanding provisions for stiffer c o u rt sentences to be adm inistered to offenders
       responsible fo r hooliganism at football m atches, e .g . detention and curtailm ent
       of le isu re by the adequate provision of properly staffed attendance ce n tre s.

       (v)      T hat the local suburban railway stations be made available fo r the
       supporters of these events.

       (vi)      T hat the County Council follow through these recom m endations w ith
       positive action a s siste d by a co-ordinating o fficer/m em ber/w orking p arty .

M r. E. B arron (Director)
An apology for absence was received from M r. K. T. Addy, the other D irecto r who had
intended to be p resen t.

JL.     Introduction

The Chairm an welcomed M r. B arron on behalf of the Working P a rty and thanked the Club
for responding so readily to the invitation to m eet the Working P arty . It was understood
th at this p a rtic u lar m eeting was to be on an inform al b asis and could not commit the
Club at th is sta g e to any p a rtic u la r course of action.

2 .____ Working P a rty 's Report

T h e Working P a rty ’s R eport, as approved by the County Council on 28th Septem ber, 1977
was discussed. It was evident that th ere w ere larg e a re a s of agreem ent, but the Club felt
that they would have to re se rv e th e ir position on the questions of the designation of the
Stadium under the Safety of Sports Grounds A ct, 1975 and who should be responsible for
compensation (covered by insurance) for personal injury and damage to property.

The Chairm an stre ssed that the call for legislation to give County Authorities the general
power to ban proposed sporting events was intended to be a re se rv e power to be used as a
la s t r e s o r t to cover exceptional circum stances w here arrangem ents w ere clearly inadequate an<
hopefully would never be required to be ex ercised . The la st thing the County Council wished
to see was the closure of the Stadium.

3 ._____League Cup Match - 29th November, 1977

W hilst it was appreciated that the League Cup Match on 29th November, 1977 with Everton
was not an all-tick et m atch and was unlikley to a ttra c t a maximum capacity crowd, possible
courses of action w ere discussed which could be treated as experim ents for future
capacity m atches.

4.      R e comm end ati on s

T hat, in consultation with the P o lic e and the Club, the following p o ssibilities w here
capacity crowds a re expected be investigated

(a)     the opening of the gates as early as possible before a m atch so that the fans
        do not have any reaso n to congregate in the vicinity of the stadium;

(b)     the ra il and coach o p erators be requested to ensure compliance with the recom m end­
        ation of the M inister of Sport that a rriv a ls should be timed as close as possible
        to the commencement of m atches and d ep artu res as soon as possible after the
        cessation of m atches;

(c)     the clo su re, to both vehicular and ped estrian tra ffic , of stre e ts in "The T riangle"
        (V ere, Fielding and Bickerton Roads) and possibly Leake and Farndale Roads
        (off Leppings Lane) because of consistent complaints by local residents;                JH

(d)     the erection of directional signs (according to ticket num bers) in the vicinity of the
        ground, as well as directions on the tickets them selves.




                           /
               REPORT OF VANDALISM WORKING PARTY


The terms of reference of the Working Party include investigating
and making recommendations on all aspects of hooliganism and
vandalism associated w i th sporting and entertainment events which
involve the attendance of numbers of people.      The Working Party
will have a joint w o rk i ng arrangement with the Working Party set
up by South Yorkshire County Council as necessary.      Discussions
on proposals will also take place with other interested parties.


The Working Party has reviewed the existing controls over such
events and considers these to be:-


    (i)    fragmented between different authorities, and

   (ii)    inadequate to meet modern circumstances.


The one recent control is the Safety of Sportsgrounds Act of 1975
but this deals only with important but limited measures for
crowd safety with in grounds and not with circumstances outside
grounds or relating to other events.   There are not sufficient
methods of ensuring that events are properly controlled, both for
the benefit of those attending and those residing in the neighbourhood.
Although it is accepted in the majority of cases that events are
organised and held with no problems, the legal responsibilities
attaching to promoters are limited.   It is considered unfortunate
that the 1975 Act, which may inhibit further legislation, was
passed with its limited controls.   Moreover, no premises in
Sheffield are at present designated under the Act.


Accordingly, the W or k in g Party considers that legislation is required
to provide local authorities with realistic and practical controls
not necessarily to prevent, but to regulate, such events in
consultation with the police, the promoters and other authorities.
It is appreciated that difficulties arise at a minority of highly
publicised events, so that flexible controls are required.      This
will require the preparation of detailed submissions to the
Association of M e tropolitan Authorities and central government
departments in addition to wide consultations with the police and
other interested organisations.


The submissions should involve the following principles


     (i)   defining the events as all those sporting and
           entertainment events involving the attendance of
           members of the public.

    (ii)   licensing powers thereover should be vested in
           District Councils, to be exercised after
           consultation with defined bodies in respect of
           events in their areas.

   (iii)   the controls should govern such matters as date
           and time of commencement, maximum capacity, parking
           and nearby traffic arrangements (with of course
           appropriate penalties for non-compliance).
     5.   It is appreciated that these matters are nation a l rather than
          local in. their effect and require general rather than local
          legislation.   Also, many matters of detail will need to be
          embodied in any draft legislation.   However, the experiences
          of Sheffield with its various venues for events, provide a good
          basis for recommendations of principle.

     6.   The Working Party will undertake a continuing dialogue with
          interested bodies and review of progress.

                                           ON 23RD NOVEMBER 1977



The meeting was chaired by Councillor Wilson and attended by representatives
of the City Council, the Magistrates (including the Licensing Justices
and the Juvenile B e n c h ) , Sheffield and District Licensed Victuallers
Association, South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive, Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club, Sheffield and Hallamshire County Football
Association, South Yorkshire Police and Sheffield Recreation Department.

Apologies for absence were received from the Football League and Sheffield
United Football Club.

The Chairman explained that because of the steadily increasing incidence
of acts of vandalism and hooliganism in the City, the Council had formed
a Working Party whose terms of reference include investigating and
making recommendations on all aspects of hooliganism and vandalism
associated with sporting and entertainment events which involve the
attendance of numbers of people.

The Working Party had now met and produced a report containing certain
initial recommendations, which report had been circulated to all interested
parties     was the basis for discussion at this meeting, and members
were invited to put forward their views and suggestions.

The intention was to collate firm recommendations on steps which could
be taken to meet the problem for submission to the Association of
Metropolitan Authorities and through that Association, to the Government
for possible legislative action.

There followed a long and wide ranging discussion and it was finally
agreed that one representative would be nominated by each of the bodies
or organisations which had been invited to attend, together with a
representative from the Education Department.  The Head of Administration
and Legal Department would obtain the nominations and arrange an early
meeting of those representatives with a view to considering the Working
Party's report and making further recommendations.

T he following were the main points which had emerged in the discussions
and which it was agreed should be examined by the W orking Party

  (a)   the possible need for local authorities to have statutory
        powers to control the staging of certain types of event;
        this and the other matters covered in the Working Party's
        report to be the initial areas of consideration

  (b)   the need for magistrates to have more options open to them
        in dealing with offenders

  (c)   the need for a great many more Adult Attendance Centres
        throughout the country

  (d)   the need for a more responsible attitude on the part of
        the media in their treatment of the subject of violence generally
in the case of football matches, the need to be able to influence
transport operators to ensure that visiting supporters arrive
as late as possible before kick-off and leave as soon as
possible after the end of matches

the need to investigate more closely the hitherto generally
accepted assumption that alcohol is always a prime factor in
crowd violence

the need to impress on parents their responsibilities, e.g.
by making them pay compensation for acts of vandalism (especially
in schools) where offenders are positively identified

the encouragement by the Education and Recreation Departments
of participation by young children in tree and flower planting
s ch ernes

the need to investigate other possible educational measures in
an effort to tackle the problem at its source and to influence
young children in positive and constructive directions

the need to investigate existing recreational facilities in the
10/16 age group and to establish what more could reasonably be
done nrirf also ascertain what work in this field is already
being carried out in the City by other bodies and organisations.

The Situation in

South Yorkshire.
VANDALISM: The Situation in South Y orkshire


1. Introduction

1.1      An officers' subgroup was established in the County Council early in
1976 whose term s of reference included the following:

          " to study the range and scope of the problem (of vandalism)
          in the county"

1 .2      The collection of information was approached in two ways - firstly, by
way of a questionnaire survey of bodies in the county to a s s e s s the extent of
vandalism suffered and secondly, by analysis of C rim inal Damage records from
the South Y orkshire F orce Crim e R e g ister. In both c a se s the period covered was
from A pril 1975 to March 1976. Information from the two studies is sum m arised
below.

1.3       It em erged from these studies that local authorities and other public
bodies reported very little damage to the Police and that Police reco rd s dealt
mainly with private firm s and individuals. The two studies w ere, therefore,
com plonentary in providing an overview of the problem . At the sam e tim e,
however, it is c lea r that the Police information, which has been considered in
some depth, is not rep resen tativ e of a ll damage in the county.

1.4        In any study of vandalism it is n ecessary to define the range of activities
covered. In view of the inform ation sought and the variation in the amount of
detail recorded fo r individual acts of damage, it was necessary to adopt the
operational definition of "non-accidental damage" fo r these studies. F o r Police
record purposes this is simply C rim inal Damage.

1.5         The total identified cost of vandalism in the county is £620, 000 for the
y e a r 1975-76. However, this figure rep resen ts the minimum cost since it includes
only those item s which have been reported in these two studies.

 2. The Survey

2.1        A questionnaire to a s s e s s both the cost and num ber of incidents of
damage suffered and the attitudes of organisations tow ards vandalism was sent to
public bodies operating in the county and to the appropriate departm ents of the
County Council. In addition, a copy of the questionnaire was sent to the local
C ham bers of T rade and Com m erce together with a request fo r a lis t of th eir m em bers
to whom the questionnaire might usefully be sent. In the event, an insufficient
num ber of firm s was contacted to provide any re a l indication of the extent of
vandalism suffered by private firm s and inform ation from the three Barnsley firm s
is included h ere for in te re st only. Information is now being sought from the
D istrict Councils although some indication of the amount of damage they suffer has
been obtained from p re s s re p o rts .
2.2         26 rep lies w ere received from outside bodies, in addition to the County
Council inform ation. Although the coverage was lim ited it is felt that m ost of the
m ajor victim s of vandalism within the public se cto r (with the obvious exception of
the D istrict Councils) will have been included.

2.3       Some 26, 000 incidents w ere reported in the survey, costing £180, 000.
A breakdown of these figures is given in table 1. In addition, security m easures
costing m ore than £20,000 were rep o rted .

Y orkshire E lectricity Board.

2.5         T h ere was general agreem ent among the survey respondents that
vandalism is a problem that is not decreasing in intensity. Most respondents
felt that a combined approach would be beneficial. Survey rep lies highlighted
the fact that very few incidents of vandalism - in the public secto r at le ast - a re
reported to the P o lice. The overall percentage of incidents reported was le ss than
5% and, on the whole, the organisations which reported a high proportion of
incidents w ere those suffering relatively little dam age. In two rep lies it was
stated that re p o rts w ere made only in cases of serious damage o r when there was
a chance that the cu lp rits could be identified.

3. Analysis of Police R ecords and C rim inal Damage

3 _\       The information from 1543 recorded incidents of C rim inal Damage
valued at over £20 each was extracted from the South Y orkshire F o rce Crim e
R egister to provide a different view of the problem of damage in the county. It
m ust be recognised that th ere a re lim itations in using Police re c o rd s a s a
source of information, largely as a resu lt of th e ir dependence on the public for
the reporting of c rim e s. It has already been stated that little damage in the
public se cto r is rep o rted to the Police and one consequence of this is that Police
inform ation is not representative of all incidents.

3.2       More than 1500 incidents and an estim ated £145, 000 worth of damage
have been identified in the Police r e c o rd s . A breakdown of the incidents by item
damaged and by type of p rem ises damaged is shown in Figures 1 and 2.

3.3       In general the breakdown of the costs follows the pattern fo r incidents with
the exceptions of dam age to c a rs and m o tor-cycles (21.2% of incidents, 12.5% of
value) and damage to m ore than one item (5.9% of incidents, 11.7% of value).

3.4        More than 80% of all incidents involve damage to vehicles or to buildings;
windows are the la rg e st single ta rg e t. F o r these la rg e r categories of dam age the
detection ra te is around 25%.

3.5        The amount of damage (m easured as a ra te p e r head of population) varies
between different p a rts of the county and it is especially concentrated in the town
and city c e n tre s. Between them, the 4 cen tres account fo r m ore than 20% of all
incidents. When the social class profile of an a re a is considered, the m iddle-class
a re as suffer proportionally le s s damage.

3.6        The proportion of offenders in the resid en t population v aries between
different a re a s of the county but the distribution of offenders does not coincide
exactly with the distribution of incidents. However, in general, a r e a s with a low
incidence ra te do not have high offender ra te s and v ice -v e rsa. T h ere a re fewer
known offenders in m id dle-class a re a s .

3.7         Most of the damage for which a tim e is recorded takes place at night,
the b u siest period being between 9 p . m . and midnight. The incidence of damage
is m ost frequent in the autumn with October as the b usiest month. Relatively
little dam age is recorded for the month of August.

3.8           The known offenders a re predominantly young (under 25) and mainly in
th e ir teen s. The three la rg e st age groups a re the 17, 18 and 19 y e a r olds. Alm ost
all known offenders a re male and only a third a re involved in group offences.
4.     Sum m ary

4 1     Since there is very little overlap between the Police information and the
iriformation from the survey, it is possible to aggregate the costs derived to produce an
estim ate of the minimum loss to the county as a re su lt of vandalism (table 2). It should
be noted, however, that the figure for private firm s and individuals is likely to be an
understatem ent relative to the other figures as the information has not been sought
directly (as was the case for the other bodies) but has been taken from Police reco rd s.

PROTECTION

AGAINST

VANDALISM
                     PROTECTION AGAINST VANDALISM

The following re p o rt is an edited version of a Home Office booklet published in
November 1975 entitled "P rotection against V andalism ". That booklet was itself
a re p o rt from a Home Office Standing Committee Working P arty with the following
te rm s of reference

"To establish as far as possible the extent of vandalism and make recommendations
for practical m easu res which can be taken to prevent it."



I         INTRODUCTION

1.1          There can be few who a re not at least uneasily aware of the increasing
frequency of vandalism in our society. It is hardly possible, for instance, to
read a local newspaper without finding some reference to serio u s, m indless damage
by hooligans - windows broken on housing estates even before construction is
complete; shrubs and tre e s slashed o r uprooted in public parks and gardens;
in terio rs of football trains virtually wrecked; telephone kiosks put out of o rd er;
w alls and fences pushed over; schools entered and valuable equipment smashed;
public lighting system s rendered unworkable; the scoring of paintwork on c a rs
and tyres cut. There is literally no lim it to the number of examples of wilful
destruction. E very week in every locality publicity is given to indignation
expressed a t Council m eetings or m eetings of R atepayers' or Residents' A ssociations.
R epresentations a re made to the local police who prom ise to try to give m ore
attention to the a re a or service affected - only to find there is a fresh outbreak
somewhere e lse , perhaps in a totally different form .

1 .2       The problem ex ists everyw here, all the time. Single instances may
cost only a few pounds to rep air; others run into th re e - and four-figure sum s.
Collectively vandalism n ecessitates the diversion of quite sizeable labour forces
who do little else but re p air damage - which re c u rs as soon as it is made good.
P rivate p erso n s, including the old and the infirm , despair at the damage to their
property, often beyond their m eans to make good. Equipment designated for the
protection of life is rendered ineffective. Above all there is the effect on the
environment; s tre e ts , p a rk s, houses which should be sources of pleasure and pride
take on an a ir of neglect and decay.

1 .3        In spite of all this, there has been no nationally inspired, organised and
co-ordinated attack on the problem . The reasons for this a re not hard to find.
Generally the effects a re local and a re not of such a nature as to a ttra c t nationwide
publicity; the v ery nature of the offence m akes it difficult to detect - it does not
therefore a ttra c t much reporting in the proceedings of M agistrates' Courts; m ost
exam ples of damage a re not recorded as " c rim e s' and therefore fail to em erge as
a serious problem in the Crim inal Statistics; the cost is sp read over a m ultiplicity
of public auth orities, com m ercial organisations and private individuals. Yet
vandalism is as symptomatic of something wrong in our society as is violence (with
which it is som etim es associated for its m indlessness) and other form s of crim e.
The causes of vandalism are difficult to identify and complex in the extrem e and
there is a need for system atic investigation of these as well as of methods of
prevention. The immediate need is to focus attention on the magnitude of the
problem and to seek support in taking rem edial m easures that will a s s is t in
prevention and will make the task of the vandal much m ore difficult.



II         THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM

What is Vandalism?

2.1         There is of course no offence known to the law as 'vandalism '; yet the
term has come to be widely used by the public and in the p re s s to describe those
acts of wilful and unnecessary damage committed in re sp e c t of public and private
property without any clear advantage accruing to anyone, least of all the
p erp etrato rs. "Hooliganism" is a sim ilar term - the banding together of young
people (generally) in a m anner which causes discom fort and even alarm to other
citizens for no apparent purpose except perhaps to derive some sense of power.
Vandals and hooligans have much in common; they create a public o rd er problem
and their activities a re an affront to law and o rd er and to those who wish to pursue
their lives in peace and enjoy the sense of security to which they a re surely
entitled.

2. 2      For the purposes of sim plicity we have interpreted "vandalism" as the
wanton and apparently m otiveless destruction of, or damage to, property.
Inevitably in gathering information there has been some overlapping but as far
as possible we have excluded damage incidental to the com m ission of a crim e
(for example, damage to parking m eters in furtherance of theft and arso n , which
is a specialised form of wanton destruction and, although it is often m otiveless,
nevertheless frequently a r is e s from mental disorder and is a special problem to
which our recommendations will not n ecessarily apply).

2. 3        Within the lim its of our definition we have sought to make an a s s e s s m e n t ,
of the incidence of vandalism by scrutiny of the crim inal sta tistics and by tapping *
the experience of a num ber of authorities who a re particularly affected. It is fair
to say a t this stage that we were soon convinced that no p recise assessm en t could
be m ade, for reasons that will appear, but nevertheless sufficient m aterial was
available to dem onstrate beyond doubt that the cumulative effect of literally
m illions of acts of destruction, m ost of them m inor in them selves, is far m ore
se rio u s, expensive and deleterious to the environment that the public can possibly
appreciate.

C rim inal Statistics

2. 4          Although some useful indications of trends can be obtained from the
sta tis tic s, they a re of only lim ited value in painting the complete picture, for a
variety of reasons. P rio r to 1972 (a new Crim inal Damage Act came into operation
in October 1971) any act of damage was recorded as a crim e only if it was damage
of a kind specifically provided for in the legislation or was damage to general
property to the value of £20 or m ore - these were the 'Indictable’ offences;
there were also kept records of 'non-indictable' offences of damage for the
purpose of com parison with records p rio r to 1964 when changes were made
in the standards of ’indictability'. (From 1972 onwards some further changes were
made in the recording system when virtually all the legal definitions of acts
of damage were consolidated in one piece of legislation; we have refrained from
comparing the 1965-71 figures with those for subsequent y ears as this would
make the situation m ore confusing. )

2.5        Thus acts of damage were only recorded as crim es if they involved
property of fairly substantial value; a broken window, a sm ashed electric light
bulb, a slogan paint sprayed on a wall would in all probability not be 'c rim e d '.
Yet these a re exactly the s o rt of occurrences with which we a re concerned.
On the other hand, acts of damage which led to prosecution, however trivial
the value of the damage done, do appear in the Crim inal Statistics in the
records of the disposal of offenders.

2. 6         It should be stated h ere that even in the post-1971 sta tistics the £20 lower
lim it still applies. Although we accept that is is impossible for the police to
reco rd and treat as c rim es all those incidents of m inor damage below that
figure, while the p resen t arrangem ents exist it will never be possible to obtain
even an approxim ate figure for the incidence of vandalism - we make later some
suggestions regarding this. M oreover, in these inflationary days an a rb itra ry
lim it such as £20 tends to confuse those figures that a re compiled; an ac t
of damage to the value of £19 one year would not be 'crim ed' but the following
year the sam e act would be included in the crim inal statistics since the cost of
making good would be well over £20. The effect is the artificial inflation of the
crim e retu rn s in step with m onetary inflation.

2. 7     For these reasons we do not attem pt to attach g reat importance for
our purposes to the sta tistic s of recorded offences.

2.8       The following points em erge from an examination of the statistics:

(a)       Over the seven-year period the num ber of offenders prosecuted
          increased by about 30%; in the sam e period the num bers cautioned
          by the police increased by 61%. hi the same period the total number
          of cases of damage over £20 has m ore than trebled.

(b)       Children under 14 showed a d ecrease in the number of prosecutions.
          This is compensated for by an increase of 50% in the number of
          children of this age who were cautioned. On the other hand,
          those in the age groups 14-17 were the subjects of 32% more
          prosecutions and alm ost double the cautions.

(c)       Of the total number of offenders brought to book over the seven year
          period (over 150,000) roughtly one q u a rte r were under the age
          of 17. The com paratively narrow age group of 17-21 accounted
           for nearly 30%. So over half of the offenders throughout the
          period in question were under 21.
(d)        On analysis of known offenders the three age groups under
           21 are respectively responsible for 7. 6%, 12. 7% and 17. 9% of
           all non-indictable and indicatable offences (except motoring
           offences) but the percentage in each case is alm ost doubled
           when damage offences only are considered.

2. 9       The sta tistic s in fact confirm what m ost will strongly suspect already -
that damage is a favourite form of crim inality or quasi-crim inality of the
young; that the offenders a re predominantly boys (to an overwhelming degree);
that those under the age of 14 when caught have a one in three change of being
cautioned (for g irls the odds a re somewhat better), while between 14 and 17
about one in six o r seven is cautioned.

2 . 10         What the figures cannot be expected to bring out, and what seem s to
be of considerable im portance, is the paucity of the identification rate for
offenders in relation to the frequency of offences. Even in 1971, the m ost
's u c c e ssfu l' y e a r with about 30,000 offenders identified, this is insignificant
when com pared with the hundreds of thousands, perhaps m illions, of offences
which can be deduced from the retu rn s of damage experienced by the various
authorities to which we later re fe r. We a re bound to reflect that as long as
detection rem ains at such a low level the d eterren t effect of court proceedings
or a ste rn warning m ust be making little impact on the problem .

Police E eturns

2.11        From our own knowledge we appreciated that detailed reco rd s of
damage were unlikely to be forthcoming from police so u rces, except in resp ect
of incidents that a re 'crim ed' as being over £20 in value. There is no
requirem ent to keep records of m inor damage and indeed the reco rd s kept
are bound to be incomplete - the frequency of the occurrences a re such that
many victim s, particu larly local authorities, do not bother to rep o rt individual
instances of m inor damage and constantly recu rrin g acts of vandalism in
p articu lar are a s a r e resignedly accepted with no m ore than the occasional
rem inder and req uest to the police to keep an eye on things.

2.12        It was not su rp risin g , therefore, that the retu rn s we asked for, and
were freely given, from the police forces of England and Wales revealed fairly
accurate information on the frequency of damage to the value of £20 or m ore,
which is religiously recorded and afforded some degree of investigation -
frequently a hopeless task - but that there w ere totally and admittedly inadequate
reco rd s of m inor damage. E stim ates asked for on the annual cost of damage done,
which in the whole country totalled some £ 2^ m illion, w ere no better than
guesswork; indeed, in any case where police figures w ere capable of being c r o s s ­
checked with known local authority expenditure (only), the police estim ate was
seen to be but a sm all fraction of the actual cost to a single victim authority.
As to the actual num ber of incidents of damage, these were a s se s se d at over
140,000 but this figure was clearly a g ro ss underestim ate; as one force frankly
admitted in connection with its return - 'this is only the tip of the iceberg '.
2.13         Almost all m em bers of the Working P arty a re a ll too fam iliar with the
difficulties of keeping records of incidents which occur with such frequency and
of giving even nominal attention an d /o r enquiry to each case that could be reported
to them. Yet the danger that exists is that inadequate recording m inim ises the
serio u sn ess of the situation which fails to im p ress itself on supervising officers
as a failure of basic policing. M oreover injured p a rtie s cannot be blamed for
scepticism over the routine police undertaking that 'attention will be paid' and
in their turn do not bother to bring to notice incidents that a re su ely deserving
of attention by the police. We retu rn later to the question of communicating and
information.

2.14        It m ust not be thought from this that police forces a re inactive or
uninterested in vandalism; in their retu rn s they provided a wealth of information
of steps taken from time to time to come to grips with it but practically all adm it that
they can afford manpower for special efforts only sporadically, that when they do so
the resu lt is m erely to push the problem to another a re a and that when the special
effort is relaxed there is a resurgence of damage equal to or even g re a te r than
that which existed before the special operation was mounted. As in so many
fields of police work, the difficulty is maintaining constant, unrem itting p re ssu re
through an adequate patrol system .

Local Authorities

2.15       With all local authorities a t every level being among the main victims
of vandalism , it would have been im practical to ask for, o r to analyse, details
from them all. We therefore add ressed enquiries to fifteen fairly typical
authorities a c ro s s the country and we a re m ost grateful to these authorities
for the trouble they have taken in extracting information from their records and
in invoking the observations of the many heads of se rv ices that a re affected by
the problem . Clearly there Is considerable concern in this q u arter over the
co st, inconvenience and disfigurem ent arisin g from vandalism.

2.16       In spite of their efforts, however, there is still a considerable lack of
precision In the figures supplied by the local authorities. It was adm itted that
the scale of vandalism in some spheres - housing departm ents in p articu lar -
defeated attem pts to keep track of it. Some authorities found difficulty in
separating deliberate and accidental damage. F urth erm o re, in some cases
damage was rectified in the course of general m aintenance. Two of the
authorities told us that they w ere now beginning to maintain detailed costs of
vandalism.

2.17       Two authorities w ere unable to estim ate their overall costs, nor did
they keep re c o rd s of departm ental co sts. Another dealt with incidents by way of
general m aintenance.

2.19       It would be tedious to repeat the hundreds of examples that were quoted
to us of the ways in which local authority property is damaged. It is sufficient
at this stage to comment that literally no accessible public property is safe from
the vandal; even cem eteries and crem ato ria a re not reg ard ed as sa c re d and there
is complete indifference to public safety, such things as fire hoses and
extinguishers being quite popular targets. The popularity of targets varies
from place to place for no apparent reason.

2.20      None of the figures quoted takes into account he cost already being
borne by local authorities in preventive m easu res, some of which run into
hundreds of thousands of pounds annually in the provision of guards, p ark
patrols and alarm system s.

2.21       Once again we m ust re g re t the impossibility of obtaining m ore p recise
figures, but the examples quoted above m u st surely bring home the vast public
expense that is being incurred each year., It is certain that the general public
will not take this problem seriously, nor will it accept its own responsibility
in the m atter, until m ore accurate and reliable figures a re available for regular
publication.

The P ost Office

2.22        The main a re a in which the P ost Office suffers is in resp ect of wilful
damage to telephone kiosks. We have been informed that during the y ear 1971/2
there were 160,844 cases of such damage in the United Kingdom (some of these
incidental to other form s of crim e); these consisted of damage to handsets and
handset co rds, blocked coin-entry slots and retu rn chutes, damage to coinbox
m echanism and to kiosk stru ctu re, dials and d irecto ries. Any one incident might
consist of any combination of the types of damage described. The total cost in
a single y ear amounted to £426,000.

B ritish Rail

2.23       In 1971 the B ritish T ransport Police recorded 4,916 cases of wilful
damage to B ritish Rail property, 5,166 cases of stone throwing and, in addition,
these m ore serious indictable offences:

           Endangering the safety of railway passengers               167
           Maliciously obstructing railways                         1,160
           Destroying o r injuring telegraphs                          40
           Malicous damage of property over £100                       69

2.24        The London T ransport Executive do not re p o rt a ll incidents to the B ritish
T ransp ort Police but during 1972 a total of 450 complaints of crim inal damage
were reported, eighty-three relating to the road serv ices and the rem ainder to
the railway undertaking. All the underground serv ices suffered; there was
damage to the perm anent way, buildings and stru c tu re s, generating stations and
high-voltage cables, signals, telephones, lighting and rolling stock. Road
service vehicles and roadside furniture were seriously affected.

2.25       B ritish Rail were able to provide us with costs of damage in four out of

The Building Industry

2.27         With the help of the National Federation of Building T rades Employers
we w ere able to obtain views and retu rn s on the extent of vandalism on their
sites in 1971/2. The general reaction was that vandalism is a serious problem
but (yet again) it was impossible to give p re c ise details of all cases which
occurred. One reaso n for this was that, although m ost builders insure against
the r is k of wanton damage and have a re c o rd of claim s m ade, trivial incidents
a re not rep o rted beyond site level. Some of the comments of individual firm s were:

           A large firm estim ated that it suffered 1,000 incidents of vandalism;
           the m ost serio us o ccu rred when gang fights took place on a site,
           involving groups of youths chasing each other, tearing down property
           to use as weapons and m issile s and taking refuge in partly
           constructed p ro p erties.
           'Vandalism has reached alarm ing proportions, few sites escaping
           some form of wanton damage . '
           Another large firm estim ated that the num ber of cases of wanton
           damage was between 5,000 and 10,000 p e r annum, although no firm
           figure was available.
           One firm said that it suffered 'an infinite num ber of cases of petty
           damage by sm all children, but a relatively sm all num ber of cases of
          wilful d am ag e.'
          'The num ber of cases v aries with the d istric t and populace adjacent to
           the s i t e . '
In assessin g the problem m ost firm s found it difficult to separate accidental
damage, wilful damage, theft and arson.

2. 28       Theft from building site s has long been a m ajor problem in the
industry; this has led to the adoption of preventive m easu res such as p e rim e te r fencing,
secure compounds, locking away of property in completed houses and the
provision of p atrol guards either perm anently or on a visiting b asis. No doubt
these m easu res have also serv ed to combat vandalism. Yet we w ere left in no
doubt that vandalism rem ains a serious problem; builders w ere b e tte r able to give
us examples of the damage suffered than to provide exact num bers of incidents
and the cost involved. Most of the following w ere repeated in re tu rn after retu rn ,
indicating that very little can be regarded as safe:

           Windows broken
           E lectric wiring ripped out
           Sanitary fittings sm ashed
           Brickwork pushed over, p la s te r work and paintwork defaced
           Newly laid concrete walked on o r defaced
           Signs and w am irg lights rem oved or damaged
           Drainage pipes broken
           B ricks and m a te ria ls thrown off scaffolding
           Copper tubing pulled out, etc. etc.

2.29       All the above relate to work in p ro g ress. Bn addition there was wide­
sp read reference by firm s to damage caused to stockpiled m a te ria ls, not amounting
to theft but which resu lted in considerable financial loss that had eventually to be
p assed on to the custom ers. Examples included damage to stocks of b ricks,
sand and aggregate, p lasterb oard, blockboard, p la ste r and cem ent, time clocks
broken, drawings and plans destroyed o r spoiled, gas cylinders turned on, tops
taken off paint tins and paint thrown around.

2.30       Hie cost of all this is enormous. One large company informed us that
in an annual turnover of £5 million lo sses w ere estim ated at between £130, 000    ^
and £150,000 about 3% of the contract figures - included in these figures was a
bill for approxim ately £30,000 for the rep airing of broken double glazing on a
1, 600 dwelling site. Other estim ates v aried from 0. 2% to 3% of contract value.
One firm told us that the cost of damage o r replacem ent of m aterials could not
be given in detail as acts of vandalism gave r is e to costs that varied between 50p
to £1,000 p e r item . A composite re p o rt from thirteen firm s a s s e rte d that
vandalism had reached such alarm ing proportions that it was impossible to establish
its total cost. Here a re a few examples of figures that w ere quoted (albeit not
in the context of the size of the p a rtic u la r contracts):

           £40,000 - £50,000 overall
           £40,000 overall
           £5,000 - £6,000 overall
           £2,234 glazing re p a irs
           £1,123 plant and m achinery
           £600 co m p resso rs tam pered with
2,31      A re c u rrin g theme in the rep o rts was that beside the cost of m aterials,
replacem ents being not always im mediately available financial loss accrued due
to the over-running of contracts.

2. 32     Bearing in mind that our information was confined to that obtained
from fifty-six of the la rg e r firm s in the country, the cost of vandalism to the
building industry as a whole m ust run into many m illions of pounds annually;
m oreover for the 'sm a ll' builder, working on narrow m argins, it can be of
sufficient significance to affect Ms continuing in b usiness.

Conclusions

2. 33      The review was undertaken because it was thought likely that the cost
of vandalism to the community is far higher than generally suspected. Bn the
outcome it was found to be even w orse than we supposed. Bearing in mind that
we have been able to obtain information from only a few undertakings (admittedly
some of the la rg e r ones), that m ost figures we were given w ere incomplete
and that we were unable to compute any figure whatsoever for the private sector
(the larg est se cto r of all), it is quite certain that the annual cost of wilful and
unnecessary damage m ust run well into eight figures; it could be m ore.
M oreover the situation is getting w orse every y ear. Not only can the country
ill afford this g ro ss waste of its financial reso u rces - there m ust be concern,
and serio u s concern, at the declining standards of behaviour of a relatively
sm all section of our young people, a t their total d isreg ard for property and a t
the implications for the future not only as reg ard s law and o rd er but also for the
ex ercise by these young people of a pro p er sense of civic and social responsibility.
It is possible to introduce m easu res (at a cost) to make vandalism m ore
difficult; this will be dealt with la te r. The m ajor problem , however, is to awaken
the public consciousness to what is happening, to secure co-operation in preventing
and detecting vandalism and (hopefully) to find ways to bring about a higher sense
of social discipline among potential offenders and to provide alternative and
harm less outlets for energy that is a t p resen t being so disgracefully m isused.



m          GENERAL MEASURES AGAINST VANDALISM

3.1        The social and financial consequences of the ev er-increasing incidence
of unnecessary damage a r e such that there is a c le a r need for a hardening of
public attitudes towards such conduct; this is likely only from a public that is
adequately inform ed. Only in a clim ate of public concern about vandalism is
there likely to be support for the m easures that appear to us to be necessary .
These a re :

(a)        The identification and adjustm ent of those features in our family life,
           education and leisu re activities which produce indiscipline and lack
           of re sp e c t for property. These factors constitute the social agpect
           of the problem - the m ost difficult aspect.
(b)        Increased supervision, mainly by police, to prevent and detect
            offences, reinforced by w hole-hearted public co-operation in
            reporting incidents and offenders.

(c)        The d e te rre n t effect of adequate punitive m easu res against detected
           offenders and, where these a r e juveniles, against their p aren ts.

(d)        The wider u se of v an d al-resistan t m a te ria ls which will serv e to
           fru strate the hooligan, will p re se rv e the am enities and, in the
           long run, w ill show a financial advantage. At the sam e time
           m ore attention to be paid by arc h ite c ts, planners and other
           responsible bodies to the design and siting of public buildings
           and other facilities so as to improve opportunities for their
           n atural surveillance by m em bers t f the public and others.

3.2       Bn. this section of our R eport we deal with the firs t three points; m aterial
defence against vandalism will be dealt with in the next section.

The Vandal

3.3       In the Introduction reference was made to the complexity of the problem of
motivation and to the fact that its identification and redirection m u st be a long-term
task. As such it is stric tly outside our term s of referen ce which in effect require
us to suggest im m ediate practical m e a su re s to reduce the nuisance. Motivation
cannot be wholly ignored, however, for even the m ost p ractical m easu res need to
be devised in the context of the attitudes of those whose activities we a re striving
to reduce. We therefore asked the Home Office R esearch Unit to p rep are a short
note on the subject. This is given in full later.

3 .4         There is a g re a t deal of theorising on the subject. The R esearch Unit
note itself comments that 'A certain amount of what has been w ritten is perhaps
m ore speculative than factual and m ore re se a rc h is required if a fuller understanding
of the vandal is to be a tta in e d .' We have no doubt this is tru e, but the re se a rc h should
not be one sided. We w ere struck by the fact that in the literatu re mentioned in
the R esearch Unit note there is no shortage of explanations and excuses for
vandalism but little attem pt to identify what was m issing from the training and
upbringing of the offender. What factors turn youthful high sp irits into senseless
destruction? When this happens, why a re there no adequate counteracting influences
at work to produce a re sp e c t for pro p erty , a sense of personal discipline and of
responsibility to society? R esearch needs to consider how far acts of vandalism
a re due to m easure of failure in the family of the offender, in his school, o r on
the p a rt of those who should be seeking to provide for, if not to direct, the leisure
activities of youth so as to satisfy the need for challenge and for outlets for quite
natural aggresion.

L eisure A ctivities

3.5        There was general recognition among those who provided us with
information that one of the b est ways to tackle vandalism is to d ivert the energy
of young people Into recreational and leisu re activities to occupy at least some of
their spare time. In this way boredom can be reduced and there will also be the
steadying influence of youth leaders - if they can be made available. Most local
authorities take pride in what they have done n these connections; there were
quoted to us many examples of local en terp rise although a t the same time some
reserv atio n s were expressed. It was not our job to make a general assessm en t
of this asp ect of the work of local authorities, nor do we pretend to have made
a full study of the problem s and achievements of the youth serv ice. It is for
others to do this. N evertheless we think it is useful to se t down a sum m ary of the
im pressions left with us by the information we collected.

           Sports Grounds and F acilities. The la rg e r the authority, in general
           the wider the. variety of facilities made available - pitches for all team
           gam es; golf co u rses, pitch-and-putt courses and putting greens;
           tennis and netball courts; boating (and som etim es fishing) facilities.
           Indoor and outdoor sports centres have been, o r a re in p ro cess of
           being provided by one or two authorities. One authority stages an
           annual 'Sports Week'; in another a re a a five-a-side football league is
           very successful. Swimming pools are in considerable demand. Only
           one authority, however, went so far as positively to a s s e r t that they
           suffered less than others from vandalism because of the opportunities
           it gave to the young for sport and recreational facilities. On the whole
           there is some reason to doubt whether young people suffering from
           the s o rt of attitudes re fe rre d to in the R esearch Unit note a re much
           attracted to conventional sport, although we a re sure the absence of
           such facilities might easily lead to the emergence of a far g re a te r
           vandalism problem .
           Playgrounds. These, though m ore prim itive and less expensive than
            fully equipped Sports C entres, w ere generally felt to make a really
           worth-while contribution to combating vandalism. Most authorities
           a re aiming to provide an adequate num ber and for the future they
           contemplate providing such facilities on all new housing estates.
            Some local authorities spoke highly of the value of 'adventure play­
           grounds' with less stereotyped equipment than the usual playgrounds.
            The view was expressed, and we entirely ag ree, that playgrounds
            should be open as often as possible out of school hours, a t weekends
           and on public holidays; we would urge the g re a te r use of school
           p re m ise s for such purposes in o rd e r that young children can identify
           m ore readily with the schools as th eir property and not as places
           which, when not used for school work p ro p er, a re bolted and b a rre d
           by 'them' and as such p re se n t a challenge for assau lt and destruction.
            The e v e r-re c u rrin g problem is the provision of suitable leaders and
            su p erv iso rs. Police cadets a re used for this purpose in some a re a s .
           We would hope that this could be encouraged, not least because such
            service is not only beneficial to the cadets in their preparation for a
           police c a re e r; they a re also them selves generally engaged in various
            form s of adventure training and a r e , m oreover, very close in age to
            those supervised.
            Youth Clubs. The shortage of suitable full- and p art-tim e leaders is
           also a perennial problem in youth clubs. All types of clubs and youth
           organisations w ere claim ed to be liberally supported by the authorities
            who supplied us with information and generally it was felt that such
 support had a significant effect on the incidence of vandalism. One
authority spoke of the need for m ore development of 'junior clubs to
c a te r for children not yet in their te e n s .'
On the ot'ier hand some misgivings were expressed about youth clubs.
One comment was that in some cases clubs engendered the formation
of groups who might well be responsible for vandalism, both a t the
 club itself and when m em bers were on the way home - this could
happen where a club was without a strong leader. In some a re a s the
police have found it n ecessary to increase patrols when youth clubs
closed and one force went so far as to claim that vandalism was a t its
w orst when young people left youth cen tres. From time to time
riv alry and even antagonism a r is e s between different clubs, leading
to vandalism and violence; yet the closure of a club usually resu lts in
increased vandalism. One estim s te given us was that youth clubs and
organisations attracted only about one-third of the adolescent
population, the main reason being that youth clubs were too regim ented,
children p re fe rrin g less form al surroundings.
It is clear that it is from the 'unclubbable' that the main problem of
vandalism a r is e s - those who do not m erely lack in terest in the
facilities norm ally provided but a re actually hostile to anything which
sm acks of 'authority', 'the establishm ent' o r 'conforming' (which
hints a t discipline, including self-discipline). We received few useful
suggestions regarding this elem ent of the population. Some authori­
ties w ere, however, experimenting in techniques for channelling the
energies of such elem ents into worth-while activities and we feel that
this is an a re a in which experim ent and re se a rc h a re m ost capable of
showing really useful re su lts. One authority was considering the
appointment of a full-tim e youth leader who would not be associated
with youth clubs but whose job it would be to seek out the unruly
section and devise ways and m eans of directing th eir energies into
non-harm ful pursu its. Other authorities felt they have achieved some
success with the ' unclubbable s ' by opening coffee-bars for them,
som etim es in fairly run-down buildings which they can renovate or
not, as they please; rules and regulations a re kept to a minimum,
though d isc reet supervision is n ecessary . One such successful club in
a tough d istric t managed to retain its m em bers by offering really hard
physical activities such as boxing or canoeing (activities which,
strangely enough, a re often found in 'conventional' youth clubs).
A m otor-cycle club run by a police officer claim s success with oth er­
wise 'unclubbable' youths. A g reat deal of information was given
about police involvement with the difficult elem ents in providing 'club'
facilities for them; in our view the m ore police involvement in such
work the b e tte r, provided the officers a re of the right type and their
efforts a re seen not as a police 'operation' but as a genuine desire
to participate. M otor-cycling was also considered to be an attractive
p u rsu it by another authority that allowed its speedway stadium to be
used as a training ground for aspiring speedway d riv e rs , coached by a
professional team , on condition that other young people were adm itted
free to watch. One police force expressed re g re t at the decline in
           the num ber of b illiard h alls, which were always popular with young
           people not interested in the m ore norm al kind of club activity - this
           may provide the germ of an idea for those who appreciate the need for
           developing new and essentially masculine types of diversion.

3. 6        We recognise to the full the g re a t value of the conventional activities
supported and sponsored by so many local authorities and voluntary
organisations. We see them as being m ore positive and constructive than
m erely 'c rim e prevention' m easu res although we have no doubt that any lessening
of the opportunities provided would lead to a considerable further increase in
vandalism and hooliganism. In the context of our problem , however, there is
an increasing need for other kincfe cf youth involvement, which will a ttra c t the
'unclubbable'w hose activities a re certainly one of the main sources of damage.
We hope that youth lead ers will go on searching for the unconventional, tough,
even slightly dangerous activity which will consume energy and provide controlled
outlets for aggression and vigorous individual and group competition.

3. 7       Youth activities a re not m erely diversionary; they a re educational in
the widest sense, developing c h a ra c te r and responsibility. We have considered
m ore d irect methods of education not only of the young but also of the adults who
need to be made aw are of the extent, cost and social consequences.

Publicity and Training

3. 8      The m ost significant contribution in this field is that made by the Local
Government Information Office. Some ten years ago local authorities, concerned at
the rapidly increasing cost of vandalism, com m issioned their Information Office to
produce a se rie s of p o ste rs and leaflets. The p o sters were designed to catch the
eye of children with such slogans as "Why waste your tim e?" (with space for showing
available youth facilities), "Who pays for this damage? - Your p aren ts" and "Team s
a re men - hooligans a re sheep". Leaflets explaining the cost of vandalism w ere
produced for circulation with rates notices and a "discussion digest" was devised
to provide m aterial for teach ers, youth leaders and others in their discussions with
young people on vandalism.

3.9        The campaign has been m aintained over the p ast five y ears and there
is still a demand for the m aterial. In 1971 and 1972 there w ere sold 8,000
discussion digests, 235,000 leaflets and 43,500 p o sters - the b est-selling p o ste r
has been that with the m essage, "Who pays for this damage? - Your p aren ts". The
Local Government Information Office is now closed but the m aterial can be obtained
from Local Government Publications, 36 Old Queen Street, London. SWl.

3.10        Experience in the use of this and sim ilar types of propaganda is decidely
mixed; there is in fact among our sources of information a general em phasis on the
need for g re a t caution in its u se, for it can be counter-productive and at best there
is little evidence of its efficacy. P o ste r and p r e s s propaganda can positively stim ulate
activity by vandals. P r e s s re p o rts of obstructions being placed on railway lines
were followed by outbreaks of sim ila r incidents elsewhere; a sim ila r experience
resulted from the publicity given to the dropping of bottles from h ig h -rise flats.
3.11         It would seem from the considerable evidence and examples quoted to
us that the m ost effective propaganda is that contained in rep o rts of the
prosecution and conviction of vandals, particularly those cases where
substantial penalites have been imposed. This is a point to which the attention
of P o lic e /P re s s Relations Officers could be called. But such rep o rts a re only
effective for this purpose if the penalties imposed appear substantial and not
derisory. The courts have substantial penalties that they can impose on offenders
and on their p arents. Substantial penalties a re available, for exam ple, under
the Crim inal Damage Act 1971, while the new provisions regarding community
service would be appropriately used in some cases of vandalism. It is not
widely enough known that the Children and Young P ersons A ct 1933 (as amended)
provides that fines, damages and costs may be made the responsibility of parents
o r guardians of young offenders, whilf the powers of the Crim inal Courts Act
1973 give power to enforce the payment of compensation without lim it by the
Crown Court and by M ag istrates’ Courts up to a maximum of £400 for each offence.
These powers appear to be only seldom used. We a re not asking for heavy
penalties in all cases without reg ard to the circum stances of the offence o r of
the offender and his family, but we suspect that nominal and apparently ineffective ™
penalties a re som etim es applied to individual incidents of vandalism because
benches of m ag istrates, in common with the public as a whole a re not aware of
the true size of the social and economic implications of the problem . If these
could be brought home to m ag istrates they might well be m ore disposed to make
g re a te r use of the penalties available to them in resp ect both of offenders and of their
paren ts. If a wider use of these powers were coupled with wide publicity the resu lt
would, in our view, be a m ost effective way of alerting all parents to the need for
clo ser control of their children.

3.12      Much use is made of radio and television publicity in connection with the
prevention of the m ore conventional types of crim inal offence but only rarely
in tackling vandalism. The right kind of publicity, avoiding the counter-productivity
likely from over-glam orization which acts as a challenge to delinquents, could be
of g reat value. It would be helpful if television filler and feature films could be
made available and used in the context of wider public education on the cause
and extent of vandalism. These films should s tr e s s the need for the quick r e p o rtin g }
of acts of damage observed and, indirectly, the responsibilities and possible
liability of parents.

3.13     In p o ste r and leaflet publicity, as with publicity through the m ass m edia,
it is clearly of little use to try to appeal to the b etter instincts of hardened vandals
o r, regrettably, to their p artents. Ridicule has been shown to be of value (the
Local Government Information Office p o ste r "Be a Man, not a Sheep", is a case
in point), while a specific m essage, perhaps even amounting to a th reat, is
effective when exhortation fails. Leaflets explaining the cost of damage, sent
out with ra te s notices, can a rriv e at a time when they make the g re a te st impact;
one local authority discouraged vandalism by giving publicity to the fact that its
schools were being fitted with alarm s and that dog p atro ls were to be operated;
another warned, with considerable effect, that unless vandalism at day n u rse rie s
ceased these would be closed.
3 14                Several referen ces have been made to the need for public aw areness
m d readiness to rep o rt offences and offenders. In this context the validity of
r e w a r d ^ for information fa ll, to be considered.      As for other less d irect form s of
propaganda, the effectiveness of rew ard schem es was regarded with mix
feelings by those that submitted evidence. A few successful schem es were
r e p S C d building c o m p l i e s had had good resu lts - one claim ed that "Warning"
and "Reward" notices had been m ost effective; the other claim ed that letters to
 local householders in the vicinity of building sites and p o ste rs , offering £10 rew ard
 for information leading to conviction - the information to be treated in e
 s t r i c t e s t confidence - resulted in up to thirty convictions a y ear.


3.15       These w ere isolated exam ples, however, the general consensus of opinion
being that rew ard schem es had been pf little value:

            Four of the sample of fifteen local authorities had offered rew ards
            (from £5 to £25) and reported practically no success.

            One authority offered rew ards in connection with attacks on parking
            m aters; only one rew ard was paid in 1971/72.

             One local newspaper, in conjunction with a police authority, offered
             rew ards for information on crim e generally. Only a very few rew ards -
             in connection with shop-window breaking - had been paid.
             One police force, commenting on a local authority's £25 rew ard
             schem e for information on vandalism, described it as a complete
             failure.
             B ritish Pail's reward scheme, prominently displayed on stations, had
             had negligible re su lts.

             In general the building industry regarded rew ard schem es as ineffec­
             tive , but noticeably b etter resu lts w ere achieved if linked with warnings
             as to the dangers to young people arisin g from playing on building
             site s.

  3.-16       In spite of these discouraging observations there may well be a place
  for offering substantial rew ards provided they are not used in isolation bu as
  p a rt of a much w ider, general attack on the problem in which public aw areness
  is aroused by every acceptable m eans. Some thought needs to be given as to
  how this is to be done.

  The Role of the Police

  3 17      Police forces provided an im pressive list of special m easures taken to
  control vandalism. In spite of this it is c le a r, as a generalisation, that tfie
  problem is m ost serio u s in those a re a s where the police manpower shortage is
  m ost serio u s, and that a g re a te r and m ore positive contribution could mdoubte y
  be made if m ore manpower becam e available. Some forces use thetr "T ask Forces
from tim e to time to give special attention where vandalism is rife. Other
forces institute sm all "anti-vandalism " patrols. All this shows willingness
but can make only a tem porary and m inor impact; to achieve b etter resu lts
the p re s s u re needs to be perm anently maintained so that the problem does not
tran sfer itself to less well policed a re a s.

3.18       One p articu lar police anti-vandalism patrol illu strated the need for
m ore information. In this case a sm all squad (Sergeant, Constable and
Woman Constable) operated over a police division in an unm arked vehicle,
concentrating its effort on a re a s of known re c u rre n t damage. In o rd e r to select
the targets a close contact had to be kept with the principal authorities whose
property was subject to p ersisten t damage. Contacts w ere also made with
the parents of schoolchildren and witt}. the children them selves in the form
of lectures on citizenship and social responsibility ra th e r than dealing with
vandalism in isolation. While it is impossible to say which features of this
approach were m ost effective, in the end resu lts of some significance were
achieved:

                                      2 months p rio r
                                       to instigation       2 months during
                                         of patrol              p atro l

 property                                28 cases              10 cases
Damage a t building sites                48 cases              20 cases
other damage and rep o rts of
 vandalism                              263 cases            233 cases

                                       339 cases             263 cases

                                                            (decrease of 22%)

3.19        Thus the important feature of the scheme above was the necessity that
arose to make regu lar and frequent contacts with authorities m ost affected.
In the wider scene no really effective pro g ress can be made without this
information being constantly and readily available to all officers on s tre e t
duty, together with an appreciation of the size of the problem overall. From
the police rep o rts submitted it was c le a r that a very considerable amount of
m inor damage is unreported and unrecorded; this is not something that is the
fault of the police - victims of vandalism have grown so accustom ed to the
situation that individual examples are frequently not regarded as worth reporting
o r are reported in the form of a general "req u est for attention". The danger here
is that both victim s and police alike can get into the fram e of mind where wanton
damage is regarded as a fact of life and nothing much can be done about it.


3.20        Yet this should not be - indeed, the regular attention to problem s of
this kind is the v ery stuff of police work. A casual attitude can resu lt not only
in a mounting problem but also in an inadequate appraisal of the police manpower
needs of an a re a with a perpetuation of a nuisance that an efficient force should
be preventing.

3. 21          It is not within the scope of this rep o rt to indicate the p re c ise ways that
individual forces should cope with vandalism , p articularly as we a re so well
acquainted with the manpower problem s. However, if there could be stim ulated
within police forces a g re a te r aw areness of the size of the vandalism problem
in financial and social term s, it would be m ore readily seen as a justification
for g re a te r effort on the p a rt of police and public alike; public opinion needs to
be fully informed, public co-operation sought and the maximum police effort made
available. In all this there is an opportunity for the police to play a leading p art.

3. 22        What is needed is a regu lar flow (from day to day) of reasonably
accurate information as to the location of acts of damage caused, even of a relatively
m inor kind, and an accurate assessm en t of the annual cost to the community.
This could be done without excessive inroads into police time if the full co-operation
of local authorities and other affected bodies were sought. It should be possible
for the police to devise and distribute a suitable simple form to be immediately
completed whenever damage comes to notice, giving the location of the incident
or incidents and the cost and nature of the damage. If these form s were sent
forthwith to the collator o r the local intelligence officer, a t sub-divisional or
divisional police stations, the incidents could be plotted so that officers in charge
of police reliefs could determ ine how b est to deploy their reso u rces and could
so a c t within a reasonable time. At the same time a fairly accurate costing
could be made and could and should be used in a continuous publicity campaign,
adapted to the needs of the locality and of a kind to which we have already
referred ; this campaign should be used as a background to an appeal to the
public, if only in the in terests of their own pockets, to rep o rt groups of vandals
on the prowl o r those seen committing damage. With the full cost of vandalism kept
constantly in the public eye there is little doubt that this type of co-operation
would be m ore readily forthcoming.



IV         MATERIAL DEFENCES AGAINST VANDALISM

4.1       From what has gone before it is apparent that there is a need to
identify and reduce the causes of vandalism and to attack the problem w herever it
is found. To ensure a fully informed public and hence to m obilise public
co-operation will take some time; even when this is done only a confirmed
optim ist would anticipate total success. Meanwhile there a re m easures that
can be taken by potential victim s that would make vandalism m ore difficult
and would substantially reduce the cost to the community.

4.2       Many local authorities and sim ila r interested p arties have shown
considerable ingenuity and en terp rise in the use of vandal-proof m aterials and
in taking precautionary m easu res designed to make attack difficult. Generally
these efforts have been conditioned by two factors - the overall cost needs
to be substantially less than that of the vandalism they a re designed to prevent
and, secondly, anti-vandalism m easu res m ust not be of such a nature as to be
unsightly or otherwise unacceptable in that they in them selves reduce the
standard of am enities or a re harm ful to the environment.

4 ^3         ;p0r both these considerations there m ust be considerable support
although, on the cost factor, there m ust be given due weight to the hidden,
imponderable cost to society of allowing the behaviour of young people to develop
in such a way that they become socially irresponsible in that they have no resp ect
for the peace and tranquility of others o r for property whether public o r private;
furtherm ore from violence against property it may in some cases be but a short
step to violence against the person, already a considerable problem in our p resen t
society. However, it is the d irect cost factor which is likely to weigh m ost heavily,
and happily a num ber of authorities have already dem onstrated that it is cheaper
to pay m ore for a sturdy artic le in the firs t place (or as a replacem ent) than to
provide easily damaged equipment at a ’lower cost. Moreover design and the
development of m aterials have advanced so much in recent y ears that it is possible
 to produce v an d al-resistan t equipment that is visually acceptable.

4.4          The efforts of the P ost Office w ith regard to telephone kiosks i l l u s t r a t e s ^
what can be done in the elimination of "soft targ ets". The P o st Office testified
that the m ost im portant and productive m easures against damage taken so far,
and which have resulted in a steady improvement in the situation, have been the
construction of a ll-ste e l coinbox equipment; the introduction of 24-hour fluorescent
lighting; fine w ire m esh screen s to cover glazing; steel plates to replace glass
in lower windows; acrylic o r polycarbonate panels in place of glass; strengthened
handsets with steel conductor cords and recessed dials to make rem oval difficult.
The end re su lt is by no m eans unsightly and the additional cost is fully justified
by the saving in labour and m aterials used in making good the alm ost inevitable
and constant damage to the old type of equipment; m oreover the public service which
telephone kiosks a r e intended to provide is, of course, m ore efficient.

 4 5         The b est time to consider the installation of vandal-proof equipment
 is obviously before new buildings and estates a re built. On an estate, for example,
 pious hopes that it will not a ttra c t the attention of violent delinquents are
 unfortunately unlikely to be realised; ideally equipment and 'furnitu re' should      A
 be constructed and sited so that even violent and p e rsis te n t attem pts to damage
 them will show little visible effect. As with crim e prevention, so with vandalism
 prevention; the dangers should be appreciated in the planning and specification
 stages as an integral p a rt of good design.

 4 _g          As far as we can determ ine the only re se a rc h of any substance that has
 been done in resp ect of vandal-proof building m aterials and techniques is that
 c a rrie d out a t the Building R esearch Station a t Garston, Watford. This resulted
 in the production of the R esearch P aper "Digest 132"; we should like to see
 this initial work continued and expanded.

 4 #7            even mo® basic approach to the problem s lies in clo ser attention
 being paid by local authorities to the layout and design of housing estates; failure
 in these resp ects can produce an atm osphere where there is little reg ard for
 the maintenance of public property. One local authority felt that sm aller
 estates were m ore successful and there is evidence, especially from A m erica,
 that some form s of modern arch itectu re, such as h ig h -rise buildings, create

                                           18.
an im personal atm osphere and also prevent the formation of a community
sp irit amongst tenants. The old te rra c e d housing which they have replaced may
have lacked am enities but it enabled daily communication between neighbours;
such housing also overlooked the surrounding stre e ts whereas large blocks
of flats (often b uilt a t no higher densities than the old terrace s) leave public spaces
open and exposed to attack.



V            CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

5.1       The figures for crim inal damage for the y ears 1972 to 1974, based on
new methods of recording, a re noteworthy:

                                                  1972         1973       1974

Criminal damage endangering life                      99          102        144
Other crim inal damage (over £20 in value)        35,816       45,089     59,198
Threats to com m it crim inal damage                 234          443        650

                                        Total     36,149       45,634     59,992


P erson s dealt with a t M agistrates' Courts
  for crim inal damage (excluding arson):
   21 and over                                    13,067       15,005     16,534
    Under 21                                      16,325       20,269     22,086


                                       Total      29,392       35,274     38,620


Possibly some of the increase is due to the effects of inflation but nevertheless
the continued growth in seriou s vandalism is substantial.

5.2         We have little doubt that unrecorded m inor damage of a value in each
case of less than £20 has increased correspondingly; this is the kind of damage
to which the younger age groups a re p articu larly prone.

5. 3        Inspite of careful re se a rc h the information available does not p erm it
anything like a p re c ise figure to be put on the annual cost of non-accidental
damage; from careful consideration of such figures as were available we have
no doubt that the annual cost of vandalism to the community in England and
Wales m u st run into tens of m illions of pounds, and is increasing fast.

5. 4         The economic and social consequences of allowing this state of affairs
to continue unchanged a r e intolerable in any responsible society. There is an
urgent need for concerted action by the public, by the victim s and potential
victim s of vandals, and by the police, to re v e rse this trend; attitudes of indifference
or resigned acquiescence need to be transform ed into resolute action. Public
reaction is unlikely to be fully m obilised on social grounds alone; an appeal to
the 'pocket' is far m ore likely to succeed.

5.5       The firs t requisite, therefore, is to identify m ore p recisely the cost of
vandalism in each town o r community; this can be done by m ore system atic,
even daily, rep o rts to the police by bodies and individuals affected. No very
complex system is necessary (too much detail would place an intolerable
adm inistrative burden on the police). All that is required is a sim ple pro
form a to be sent to o r completed by "collators" of local intelligence in the
Police Service and giving the nature and location of the damage and the realistic
estim ated cost of making good.

5. 6       The total cost should be published monthly and dissemirated as widely
as possible as a basis of a local publicity campaign; where they exist the assistance
of Crime Prevention Panels should be sought in ensuring the maximum impact.
Publicity should be accompanied by appeals to the public to re p o rt immediately
to the police (on a confidential basis if necessary) instances of damage being            a
com m itted and information of groups of vandals 'on the prow l', but the leaflets,       ™
p o sters and p re s s a rtic le s in support of such local campaigns should take account
of the experience and recommendations se t out in Section III. Local campaigns
should be supported by national publicity in the p re s s and by suitable filler films
on television. There is also need for feature films on the extent and nature of
vandalism.

5.7         While readily acknowledging the special efforts made in many police forces,
there is scope for the police to take a m ore positive role. From the information
supplied as described above, it should be possible regularly to identify areas
and objects of cu rren t vandalism and potential targets; there would then be
opportunities for m ore flexible deployment of the lim ited police manpower
available in o rd er to prevent and detect offences of damage. A clear determination
on the p a r t of the police to tackle the problem resolutely is the firs t essential
for any sustained and successful campaign. Special patro ls of the kind described
in this R eport a re of g re a t value but they m ust not be regarded as a replacem ent
for the very necessary personal attention of every officer on s tre e t duty.
Additionally the police and local authorities will need to come to term s with the
surveillance problem s brought about by new types of housing, p articularly high-
r is e flats, a n d 'p riv a te ' shopping precin cts.

5.8      It is im portant that the active support of parents and teachers should be
enlisted. The responsibilities of p aren ts could be effectively established with
wider publicity being given to cases where parents a re made liable for fines
and compensation awarded against young offenders; there is scope for the latter
practice to be m ore widely adopted by M agistrates.

5. 9     While it seem s to us that much m otiveless damage is caused from
boredom, lack of challenge, indiscipline and a desire for excitem ent, there is
a need for others m ore qualified than ourselves to identify the causes and
motivation underlying vandalism and to suggest methods to rem edy the situation.
Work currently being undertaken by the Home Office R esearch Unit is of value
but m ore re se a rc h needs to be undertaken in this difficult field. We should
p articu larly like to see re se a rc h findings which point the way to m ore constructive
program m es of youtn activity. Youth clubs do not make a universal appeal and
here again some of the original thinking that has been going on regarding leisure
activities for the "unclubbable" needs to be made m ore widely known and
encouragement given to experim entation in perhaps unconventional methods
of harnessing excess energy and in the reduction of resentm ent against what
is seen as an authoritarian society. We welcome moves that a re currently
taking place to make school and other local authority p rem ises available for
use during holidays and in the evenings, and for d irected projects to be initiated
during school holidays; these will, however, provide 'conventional' activities
and are unlikely to appeal to those who^persistently cause damage and d istre ss
in o rd e r to dem onstrate their unwillingness to conform to the conventional.

5.10    In addition to the above attention is drawn to the following points which
have em erged during the co urse of our review:

(a)      The need to improve the supervision of vulnerable public property,
         particu larly that to which a t p re se n t the police do not norm ally have
         access.

(b)      The importance at the design stage for schem es for buildings and
         am enities to take account of the desirability of 'natural surveillance'
         by the public. Opportunities for vandalism should as far as possible
         be 'designed out'.

(c)      The need for still m ore re se a rc h into vandal-proof m a te ria ls and
         equipment and the wider use of them by public authorities; any
         additional cost will be quickly offset by the savings in replacem ents and
         labour.

(d)      Publicity directed towards the vandal him self can be counter­
         productive; the type of p o ste r which tends to bring the vandal into
         ridicule appears to be the m ost successful.

(e)      Other publicity and public education should be directed towards
         making the public aw are of the cost of vandalism; seeking public
         co-operation in preventing and reporting it; informing M agistrates of
         the gravity of the situation with a view to m ore severe penalties and
         bringing to public notice through the m ass m edia examples of any
         severe penalties inflicted.

(f)      The offering of rew ards for information leading to the conviction of
         vandals has been found to be only m arginally successful; nevertheless
         substantial rew ards may be of value in re sp e c t of building sites and
         other very localised seats of trouble when m ore general campaigns
         a re in p ro g re s s.
(g)      The im portance of an up-to-date re c o rd of successful anti-vandal
         m easures of all kinds being maintained at the Home Office Crim e
         Prevention C entre, Stafford, and the need for these records to be
         instantly fed by police forces, local authorities and others concerned
         with the problem .

5.11       This R eport has been fram ed deliberately to avoid the m ass of detail that
a t one time it was thought desirable to publish. The reason for this is that the
m ore the detail was examined the m ore convinced we became that the only long
term method of reducing vandalism lies in a complete change in existing public
attitudes to the problem . N evertheless had it not been for the ready co-operation
of public authorities and police forces in supplying us with so much relevant
m aterial and for the efforts of our s e c re ta rie s in analysing the m ass of paper, we
could not have a rriv e d a t so firm a conclusion as to the size of the problem and
the need for positive action. To them all we a re grateful.

APPENDIX

THE VANDAL
Note by the Home Office R esearch Unit

Though the effects of vandalism a re evident to a ll - broken windows, broken s tre e t
lam ps, damaged c a r s - it is r a r e to catch a glim pse of the vandal a t work; he
seeks his targets in isolated places o r waits for the moment when nobody is
passing. As a re su lt, few vandals a re caught and those who a re will not n ecessarily
be typical. For instance, the m ore serious offences a re m ore likely to be reported
and the vandal who has also been drinking, for example, is m ore likely to be
apprehended.

Thus care is needed when looking a t official sta tistic s of those who a re caught and
either sent to co urt o r form ally cautioned, but it is possible to learn something
from the ex ercise. P ossibly the m ost striking fact is how few female vandals
there are; in 1971 there were eighteen male offenders for every female and among
those younger than 21 the proportion was even sm aller; twenty-eight boys for
every g irl. Vandalism, it seem s, m ore so than m ost other offences, is overwhelmingly
a m asculine activity.

The picture for age is not quite so c le a r. Of all the m ales, nearly four out of
ten w ere 21 o r over but there a r e , of co u rse, fa r m ore adults in the population
than juveniles. Taking this into account one finds that there is one offence of
malicious damage for every 211 m ales aged less than 21; among adults the rate is
much lower - one offence for every 1,430 men. The peak age for vandalism
appears to be a t 14-16, where there is one offence for every 160 boys of that age
group. Thus there a re nearly nine tim es as many offences by 14-16 year olds as
by adults when the size of the age group is taken into account.

Studies in Norway and A m erica, as well as in this country, have consistently found
that the solitary adolescent vandal is ra re ; it would appear that m ore than 90% of
adolescent vandalism is done in groups. Before attem pting to explain why
adolescent boys in groups appear to be the forem ost contributors to vandalism ,
it should be recognised that not all vandalism is the sam e kind of activity; even
the same behaviour may have quite different purposes in different situations. Take,
for example, a boy breaking a window; this may be, to cite ju s t a few possibilities:

         to revenge an insult
         to break in and steal
         as targ et practice with an air-g u n
         the re su lt of a dare

The boy who breaks windows for revenge, however, may be different from the
burglar and both may be different from the boy practising with his air-gun , so
that to lump them all together may be quite m isleading. One useful classification of
vandalism distinguishes between three m ain v arieties: 'tactical vandalism ',
'vindictive vandalism ' and 'wanton vandalism '.

In 'tactical vandalism ' the damage is not an end in itself but m erely a way to achieve
a further, non-destructive goal. People break things, such as the equipment in
a telephone kiosk, to steal or in o rd er to burgle a house. Tram ps not infrequently
break windows in the autumn in o rd e r to spend the w inter in prison. Workers
in factories som etim es sabotage equipment In o rd er to gain relief from a
monotonous job. Political activists and football supporters paint slogans on
walls. To understand this kind of vandalism we need to understand why people
steal, why they a re tram ps o r bored factory w orkers. 'T actical vandalism' should
not be m inim ised, as it makes a large contribution to the total cost of vandalism.

Others use vandalism to express discontent - to avenge a real or imagined affront
o r to vent frustration o r resentm ent. In 'vindictive vandalism ' of this kind, much
m ore than in 'tactical vandalism ', the vandal is interested in the destruction
itself. He knows that the damage he does will inconvenience the person or
persons he re se n ts , but over and above his 'revenge' there is the relief of pent-
up emotion that is afforded by destroying something. We need to know about why
some people express their anger or frustration in this m anner ra th e r than in some
m ore acceptable way.

Not everyone would agree that 'tactical' and 'vindictive' vandalism a re really
vandalism a t all. The popular image of vandalism is one of irratio n al, gratuitous
or 'wanton' destruction - but it may not really be so m otiveless. It may be
m erely that the m otives a re less obvious and this can be illustrated by considering
evidence of what actually happens in a vandalism incident. Andrew Wade
interviewed apprehended vandals in M issouri and a pattern em erged of spontaneous
activity arising out of group activity. He describes five stages to this:

1   .    Waiting for something to turn upi the group is unoccupied and
         aim lessly sitting around o r wandering about the stre e ts .

2   .    'The Proposition': one of the group proposes vandalism , or dares
         another m em ber, o r actually begins destruction.

3.       'E ntertaining the P roposition': the proposition is considered and
         taken up o r rejected. If it is rejected a vandalism episode does
         not follow.

4.       'Joint Elaboration': if the proposition is taken up an episode of
         destruction usually follows. Excitem ent is maintained by a c irc u la r
         chain reaction.

5.       'A fterm ath': after the episode the activity is usually neu tralised .by
         defining it either as a 'prank' o r as 'reveng e'. The reationalisation
         does not n ecessarily b ear any relation to what really happened.

This information is based on Am erican experience but observations in this
country suggest a sim ilar pattern, which seem s to hold whether for sm allish
groups in the stre e ts or the la rg e r groups involved in so ccer hooliganism. To
put it briefly, the beginnings of a group episode of vandalism may be m inor
acts of little significance in themselves; but they a re aggravated by the
excitem ent induced by the group situation and the knowledge that others a re
doing the same thing. It is interesting to note too, that vandals may rationalise
their behaviour as 'pranks' o r as 'reven ge'. This suggests that they recognise
that vandalism is 'wrong' and feel a need to justify what they do: the fact that
the activity takes place in groups enables individuals to overcom e, or fo rg et,
qualms they m ight otherwise hasre had.
The form taken by the vandalism episode ra ise s questions of why some groups
of boys indulge in this kind of behaviour while others do not, and what they get
out of it. One possible line of explanation Is tte-t vandalism is a m eans of
gaining p restige in the group. Breaking the law, even in this relatively safe
way (in term s of the chances of being caught), requ ires a certain amount of
daring and so, by acting as a vandal, a boy can ’prove’ his courage. In addition,
vandalism may satisfy a d esire for excitement: the elem ent of ris k and the
physical exercise involved (If only in running away) m akes vandalism something
of a crude sporting activity.

The d esire for prestige or status and the d esire for excitem ent a re universally
presen t - they a re not illegitim ate d esires - but the question that m ust be asked
about vandalism is why some groups of adolescent boys seek p restige and
excitement through this kind of illegal activity.

P a r t of the answ er lies in the kind of environment different boys grow up in.
Neighbourhoods vary greatly in the number of targets they offer to vandals and
in how far the inhabitants feel them selves responsible for preventing, o r are
able to prevent, vandalism. In a hig h -rise block, for instance, residents cannot
see what is happening on the ground and in some housing developments there are
large a re a s of public space for which nobody seem s responsible. Both these
circum stances make vandalism m ore likely to occur. In some neighbourhoods - in
new housing developments for example - the community is much less tightly knit
than in others and concerted action to reduce vandalism is less likely. The fact
that vandalism is probably m ore opportunistic than many other kinds of crim e and a ris e s
not so much from deliberate intention, but out of the natural adtivities of some
groups of boys, m akes it m ore dependent upon the immediate situation than other
offences.

Because of differences among neighbourhoods, quite sim ilar groups of boys may
be m ore or less inclined to com mit acts of vandalism simply because they
have m ore o r less opportunity to do so. There a r e , however, other boys who
are not vandals even though they do not lack opportunities, so that there is still the
question of what m akes some boys disposed to comm it such a c ts, given the
opportunity, and whether these a re the same boys who com m it other types of
offence o r not. We a re a long way from being able to give an adequate answer
to these questions; many different factors a re involved and m ore re se a rc h is needed
before they can be satisfactorily disentangled.

 Of obvious im portance is the child's home; the em phasis parents lay on m oral
 values differs considerably and the extent to which a boy incorporates these
 values in his own behaviour will therefore also vary. Those boys who have
 strong inhibitions will be relatively less prone to vandalism. On the other hand
 even a boy with strong m oral values may be under p re ss u re to engage in vandalism
 and, as we have seen, many boys who damage property still see vandalism as
 'wrong' and feel a need to explain away their behaviour as a 'prank' o r a 'revenge .
 P arents also differ in how much they regulate their children's tim e. A child
 who is not allowed to wander the s tre e ts a t will does not have much opportunity
 for vandalism . Fam ilies a r e often cram ped into homes far too sm all for them
however, and we cannot always blame parents who allow their children to go
where they want.

The child's p ro g ress at school can also affect his behaviour when he is out of
school; the resu lts of re se a rc h suggest that boys who do poorly at school are
m ore likely to be delinquent than those who a re successful, whether academ ically
o r in other ways such as sp ort. Some of the boys who do not succeed a t school
may gravitate to the traditional stre e t-c o rn e r groups, mentioned before, where
it is possible to gain p restige by toughness and by such activities as vandalism
and fighting. But not all, especially the m iddle-class boys, are interested in
such groups. They are attracted instead to a life-style centred around pop
m usic, clothes and som etim es d ru gs,,an d where m ore importance is attached,
perhaps, to friendship than p restige.

 There a re many other factors which predispose a boy to delinquent behaviour,
but the ones described above a re those m ost likely to be conducive to vandalism   Jl
as distinct from other so rts of offending; these are the ones which lead a child   ™
 to be m ore dependent upon, o r affected by, his surroundings, and it is the
environment a child moves in and the situation in which he finds him self that are
the im portant factors in the usual run of vandalism offences. There a re m aladjusted
children and those with damaged personalities who a re prone to commit many
kinds of offence, including vandalism , but we a re talking here of a much wider
range of children who, although somewhat disadvantaged socially, a re by no means
'abnorm al'.

A certain amount of what has been written above is perhaps m ore speculative than
factual and m ore re s e a rc h is required if a fuller understanding of the vandal is
to be attained; some work in this direction is being undertaken by the Home Office
R esearch Unit. One project is a study of Liverpool schoolboys, in which the boys
have been asked to say (under conditions of anonymity) what types of damage
they have recently com mitted, as well as other offences. The object of this
re se a rc h is to discover whether vandalism is connected with other form s of            _
delinquency, and in what way those m ore Involved in vandalism differ from those
less involved. In this project a close look is being taken at the type of group
to which a child belongs. The other re se a rc h studies a re focused m ore on
environmental o r situational factors in the genesis of vandalism . One such project
is looking a t the design and layout of housing estates in o rd e r to test the hypothesis
that certain arch itectu ral features a re m ore or less v an dal-prone; another
is investigating the effects of supervision by the conductor and d riv er on
vandalism in buses; and another study is experimenting with different ways of
m easuring vandalism ra te s in one p articu lar a re a , including both official
sta tistics and a door-to-door Victim' survey, while looking atwhat proportion of
damage gets repo rted and how an area gets a reputation for being particularly
vandalised. These projects a re designed to examine different aspects of the problem
as outlined above, and together should give a m ore complete picture than exists at
p re se n t of how and why vandalism occurs.

  Sem inar On Vandalism




  Held a t :

  3 1 s t.   March,   1977.
INTRODUCTION

The South Y orkshire Police Committee decided to hold the Seminar on Vandalism
due to increasing public concern about the problem s associated with
vandalism and in an attem pt to identify m easu res which m ight be employed to
m inim ise those problem s.

The organisation of the sem in ar was dealt with by Officers of the South Y orkshire
County Council reporting to a Steering Committee of m em bers of the Police
Committee. Invitations to the sem in ar w ere given to representatives of a wide
range of organisations including local authorities, nationalised industries and
voluntary groups mainly from within South Y orkshire but in som e cases from
outside it. In addition invitations w ere issued to m em bers of the public who
responded to an advertisem ent placed in the local p r e s s .

The Sem inar was organised In th ree se ssio n s. During the f irs t session the sem inar
was addressed by P ro fe sso r L aurie Taylor of the D epartm ent of Sociology,
University of Y ork on "Motives and Meanings of Vandalism". During the second
session rep resentatives divided into six discussion groups dealing with:

1.      Building Design, Estate Layout and Management

2.      The involvement of the Community.

3.      The Police approach.

4.      The attitude of the Courts.

5.      The role of Local Education Authority in Schools.

6.      The role of the Local Education Authority In the Community.

In the third session the lead er of each group reported to the sem in ar on the
findings of th eir respective groups and rep resentativ es w ere given the opportunity
to question the group le a d e rs. This re p o rt sets out a tra n s c rip t of the address
given by P ro fe s so r Taylor and the re p o rts of each of the six discussion groups.
PROFESSOR LAURIE TAYLOR

I suppose one is occasionally aware when talking about sociology of certain

environmental incongruities, of a certain m is-m atch which occurs between context

and subject m a tte r, I do not think I have ev er had a m ore evident example of it than

we have this morning to be sitting in a room like this and talking about Vandalism.


Well f ir s t of all I should tell you that I refused your kind invitation to speak to this

Seminar twice; it may seem odd to draw attention to my churlishness but at least it

provides me with an opportunity to tell you some of the reasons for this refusal.


In the f ir s t place, I w a s, quite frankly, w orried about wasting your time because when

I looked through the list of speakers and indeed when I spoke to the O rganisers of this

Conference it was evident that there is a very practical s tr e s s to the day’s discussion.

The people who a re on the list a re people who want to do something about Vandalism,

want to do it quickly; they a re people who a re suffering from its immediate effects.

You want to try to stop those who are spoiling the environm ent and there a re people

here who a re concerned with catching vandals and with finding methods to stop them

repeating their behaviour.


I do not for a second c a st any doubt on the validity of all those e n te rp ris e s.   Sociologist J & -

as much as anybody else dislike sm ashed telephone boxes, broken s tr e e t lights,

disfigured buildings and, I think, will always recognise that an attem pt to cure the

symptons is a perfectly acceptable response to this.


It would be possible, I suppose, for me to talk about prevention; I could tell you about

the failure of publicity campaigns.      I could tell you, alm ost, that drawing attention to

the problem has a certain counter productivity of its own. I could talk about the possible

benefits which can come from fortification, but I would wish to draw your attention to the

way in which increased fortification of p articu lar environm ents actually helps to
constitute the very type of environment which may be the reaso n for the vandals response

in the f ir s t place.   I could tell you about protection groups, about the use of vigilantes,

about the relative success of special p atro ls.      I could tell you about deflection; the ways

in which the use of adventure playgrounds;the use of graffiti boards, though those graffiti

boards a re the empty spaces on the walls of lavatories.          I could talk about the way in which

d eterren ts work, the possibility of using custodial sentences and the likelihood of this

decreasing vandalism occuring.          But I really do feel that what could be said in m ost of those

a re a s is , in many c a s e s , highly contro v ersial, in the sense that it produces no c le a r cut

re su lts and I think is often based upon such a misunderstanding of the nature of vandalism

that it really is not appropriate to consider it or to spend a great deal of time deciding

what one would do about vandalism until one has spent a little m ore time establishing exactly

what we a re talking about.


 Of c o u rse, this is where sociologists, I suppose, traditionally come in because they a re the

boring people who come rolling in saying "I would just like to spend a little bit of time

defining what we mean by vandalism, I want to spend a little bit of time on understanding, a

 little bit of time on explanation of the phenomenal before I s ta r t preventing i t ”. At the

 moment the explanatory side has very little to say to the preventive side.            Those people

who a re engaged in the prevention, as it w ere, may not be able to obtain any reliable

 indication of what they should be doing from those people involved in explanation.              I may

 also appear irrita tin g , and I also said perhaps I shouldn’t be coming along, because I want

 to play at definition.     The word vandalism simply doesn’t mean too much to me until it is

 differentiated.     This i s , of c o u rse, c ritic a l if I am seeking explanation and understanding.

 Unless we know what we a re talking about there is no way in which we can explain causes.

 I have a homogeneous notion of vandalism , I put together in a pile all so rts of behaviours

 which in fact a re very different.      There really is no possibility of      finding a number of

 causes in o rd er to explain this bundle of behaviours which I have christened vandalism .

 I was also concerned about coming and m ypresence may prove a little irritatin g to you,

 because I also wonder why everybody gets quite so upset about vandalism when there a re
so many other p ressin g problem s in the world.


Let’s take the la st one f ir s t.   Undoubtedly we do get very upset by vandalism , the fact that

we a re holding this sem in ar and the fact that I can tell you that a large num ber of such

sem in ars a re held up and down the country and have been held for y e a rs.          A large amount

of money has been put into re se a rc h on vandalism .       Despite the fact that really vandalism

is not very visible to many in this room; we h ear about it and get re p o rts of it but few of us

see much m ore in daily life than broken windows and telephone boxes out of action and at
b est som e graffiti which has become m ore evident because of the invention of the aero so l

ra th e r m ore evident than when people used penknives on tre e s .        Much of the time we a re         ^

told of vandalism by o th e rs, by a group of sociologists - m oral e n tre p re n e u rs, people who

se lect certain problem s and say they deserve our attention.


I will give an example of how vandalism becom es a problem .              Recent Home Office r e s e a rc h

by Tony M arshall in Blackburn looked at crim e re p o rts in local new spapers - and he found

that 45% of all crim e re p o rts dealt with vandalism but damage offences, including a rso n ,

w ere only 3.4% of all known offences.         Clearly the e d ito rs, r e p o rte rs , and public who buy

the papers say this is something we should pay attention to - i t ’s highly im portant and much

m ore im portant than a variety of other c rim e s.       It is strange how often we get into a s o rt of^j

m oral righteousness over certain types of behaviour.


Now vandalism is an extrem ely w orrying and costly phenomenon - nothing I'm saying now is

to deny that.     But it’s am azing how those of us who a re not vandals and find the behaviour

difficult to understand, engage in petty c rim e s ourselves (perhaps traffic offences, speeding

o r whatever) and we manage to work up a m oral righteousness about those who scraw l on

w alls or sm ash s tre e t lights. Even though the possible economic and human re p erc u ssio n s

of those actions may be quite incompatible.           Clearly we think it is im portant.
We also are concerned because we think it has increased greatly - we have a notion

that vandalism is growing every day, that it is much w orse than it used to be.           But it

is difficult to estab lish that.    As M arshall points out in his re s e a rc h - we really don’t

know because although the number of offences has increased (there is an in crease in the

sta tis tic s), it is difficult to know whether that in crease is because en tries under that

heading relate to property over £20 ^nd we don't knowwhether increased cost is because

of inflation)or whether there has been m ore m alicious damage.


T here a re only estim ate s for us to go on and people use a variety of assum ptions to a rriv e

at their fig u res. An M . P . , in a recen t debate, suggested a figure as high as £100m. per

y e ar fo r all cases of vandalism .    But when you examine how he a rriv e s a t that figure you

find that quite a percentage of it is based on 'found' damage ra th e r than evidence of

intentional damage. Any estim ates of vandalism , th erefo re, a re complicated by the fact

that a vandal com pletes a job which w ear and te a r has already sta rte d .     It would be pleasant

to walk around one's own home and when something was pointed out as being broken we

could blame vandals again.         People who a re concerned with public property, shops, schools,

d eterio ratin g public buildings find it easy a t the end of the y e a r to say vandals have done

this or we've had depreciation occurring which we can put down to vandalism.


Indeed the vandal may have picked on what was already breaking and disfigured it.

Any sign of d eterio ratio n will be compounded by vandals.


I'm unhappy about the word vandal.         It suggests somebody waking up a t 8. o'clock in the

m orning, coming dow nstairs being a vandal, and going out and vandalising a ll day, ra th e r

like delinquents.   The fact is that many vandals a re good at school, at work and live in

happy homes and a re responsible, reliable people who interm ittently, occasionally and

sporadically engage in an act called vandalism . Whether that m akes them vandals I'm

not certain .   In the sam e way should our occasional bit of motorway speeding make us into

psychopathic m o to rists ?
Many of us will know Shepherd's Law - the law of diminishing vandalism which states

"if you wish to do something about vandalism , then as soon as any destruction occurs you

im m ediately re p a ir it, and re p a ir it again and again until eventually vandalism on that

site c e a s e s ." This suggests that certain sites a re attacked and a re attacked for a time

but if they a re renovated the attack will switch elsew here.       Vandals provide thereby a

useful scapegoat in many ways, a way of w riting off certain so rts of pro p erty lo sses due

to depreciation.


But in saying that we get too upset about vandalism we take         some of the figures quoted in

the p re ss too serio u sly ,   we take what is said in the local newspapers as reflecting the

actuality ra th e r than as a g ro ss distortion but nevertheless there a re good reaso n s why

we should get upset about vandalism .      To put the problem into perspective is not to throw

it out of the window.


L et's tilt the evidence a bit the other way.    Vandalism is one of those offences ra re ly

reported - it's difficult to know how much is reported - but another Home Office Study -

S turm an's M anchester Study - suggested that approxim ately 1 in 15 c ases w ere being

reported.    There is evidently what crim inologists would call a large 'd a rk ' figure - w here

the num ber of c ases in court re p re se n ts 1/15 of the total.


We should also get upset because it affects vital services^in p articu lar telephone se rv ic es

and perhaps tran sp o rt. We m ust rem em ber that the p re ss and other agencies 'play up'

what is occurring.      The Daily M irro r re fe rre d to "the way in which louts and petty thieves

a re putting nearly half of B ritain 's 75,000 phone boxes out of action every y e a r. " That

suggests that vandals a re taking over.      If you examine the figures m ore closely, half of

B ritain 's phone boxes w ere damaged a t one time o r another but at any one time the number

out of action was about 1 in 30.     The M irror story suggests that half a re out of action at this

 moment.       A good example of how the th reat is played up.
 If I had to select one topic of concern it would be that those sections of society, the

 deprived sections in so many ways, - unemployment, poverty and poor environment -

 a re the people who live in those conditions whichare     m ost affected by vandalism .      Certain

 crim inologists a re rom antics a»d can be heard talking of the vandal who is making an

 anarchic resp o n se, a revolutionary response to the stru c tu ra l inequalities of contem porary

 society.   Such people ignore that the people who have to pay for such revolution a re in many

ca se s the underprivileged them selves.


 Vandalism violates many of our cherished values.          It's a subject for concern because it

violates such things as the value of property.        To us who own houses, c a r s , who have a lis t

of p o ssessio n s, the way we come to p rotect them is very r e a l.     It is something we think

of often during the day, w e're interested in purchasing new possession s.           I am not talking

about c ra s s m a te ria lism , simply basic m iddle-class living.   To those of us who have

pro p erty , to see other property being destroyed is something that produces a feeling that

this m ust be an irratio n al and m eaningless resp on se, that there is something appalling

about this type of destruction.     It also violates our aesthetic values.     There is a notion we

have of the way in which the world can be made beautiful, ways in which flow er-beds,

statues and tre e s can be se t out to beautify our urban environm ents.       If these a re 'turned on'

it 's an attack against our own aesthetic values.


There is also the fact that going out and having a good time is something we know. We

know the attacks on m arijuana use, despite the evidence of the insignificant effects of

something like this.    Psychologists and sociologists suggest that attacks on things like this

suggest 'fun m o ra lity ', a lack of se rio u sn e ss, a lack of responsibility, a lack of

involvement in the re a l w orld, and a lack of m aturity.


Many people see vandalism as a symptom of all that is sick and rotten, these a re the

'C assan d rin e' like views of society which g en eralises from a p a rtic u la r broken telephone

box to m ass in cre ases in delinquency to the end of our world as we know it today.          So it's
 a very potent thing. A broken train window can spark off all so rts of le tte rs commenting

 on the decline of civilisation as we and Lord Clarke once knew it. Well is it? This

 violation of values tends to make us see it as m indless, irra tio n a l and m eaningless.       To

what extent is it any of those things. If we a re to prevent it we want answ ers to those

questions.    This leads us into differentation in motives and meanings.


A few y ea rs ago I did some work on industrial sabotage.          Very little work had been

done on in dustrial sabotage and there was good evidence that m illions of pounds a y ear

w ere being lost through the activities of employees who system atically, or unsystem atically,

destroyed aspects of th eir workplace, the product itself, the conveyor belt, offices

w hatever.   This looked p retty m eaningless when we sta rted the re se a rc h . We went

and interviewed large num bers of industrial w orkers about this to tap the evidence for

its existence and we asked them why they w ere engaged in it.           To cut a long sto ry short

we eventually found that we could distinguish between different so rts of industrial sabotage.

It was not sim ply a m eaingless blowing up although there w ere occasions when it was just

that, a reduction of tension and fru stratio n .    The sudden sense that one couldn't c a rry on

at this job any longer.    It was not therefore an attem pt to change the w orld, it did not

make their life e a s ie r. What was hit was often a rb itra ry , often the n e a re st thing in sight.

One had been standing there for six hours engaged in this p articu larly d rea ry task and

suddenly one blew up and hit the n e are st thing in sight.     It's possible that many of your cats

b ear the m ark of a sim ila r psychological response.


The second in dustrial sabotage was the u tilitarian version in which attem pts w ere made

through sabotage to make life somewhat e a s ie r.      So for example when we investigated

a carp et factory we found people who recognised that in o rd er to get a few m inutes in which

the whole m achinery would grind to a halt they could cut one of the threads on the m achine.

One thread took a minute to re p a ir so if you wanted ten m inutes you simply cut ten, it was

a straightforw ard u tilitarian action.   The other way was causing sm all fire s .       Small fire s

w ere p articu larly popular in one of the fa c to rie s, in which you sim ply threw a m atch into
a bin of m a te ria l, shouted " F ire " , and im m ediately the fire brigade or the fire group

attached to the factory rushed in, everybody else went off to the canteen and had a quick

cup of tea and cam e back la te r on.       Provided it w asn't too often it was a recognised way

of relieving the monotony.


One Thursday afternoon a s I was preparing to go to a factory to interview some w o rk ers,

I had a fchone ca ll from a co-w orker who said not to com e.            I asked why not.      He said

"The factory has burned to the ground".            The whole lot had gone up and disappeared that

afternoon.    Eventually somebody was charged with a rso n and he said to the investigating

police, 'I 'm very so rry about th is, I only m eant to s ta r t a sm all f ir e '.     They said, 'Y es,

come along now, of course you d id .' As though the fact that anybody should want to s ta rt

a sm a ll fire seem ed so stran g e.      In court he said 'I was ju st trying to s ta r t a sm all f ir e '.

The judge said 'I don't know w hat's wrong with you, we've had you examined by

p sy c h iatrists and there seem s to be nothing mentally wrong with you, but you keep saying

you like lighting sm all fire s .      I can only think you get an unholy th rill out of the sight of

flam es.   Life im p riso n m en t.'


This was ab stracted from context.           There was something rendered m eaningless and

irra tio n a l, when it was taken out of context - how could anybody want to s ta r t sm all

fire s ?


We also found evidence of political sabotage - whether deliberate attem pts to gain

control, to challenge authority and to use sabotage as an industrial action. We w ere

always told at school that the Luddites who sm ashed m achinery w ere prim itive vandals.

The historians who have re sea rch ed that a re a have suggested that it was 'collective

bargaining by r i o t . ' In a pre-unionised situation this was one way in which power could

be a sse rte d and statem ents made.        One way in which the impotent could become potent.


We can also find in vandalism m otives and meanings about the environm ent.                    This is

w here we com e into the a re a of differentiation.         F irstly there is acquisitive vandalism .
 A g rea t deal of vandalism is system atic ’junking’ , collecting and looting. It is in fact

 theft and not really vandalism at all and to w rite it off as vandalism is to simply compound

 the problem of vandalism and ignore the problem of theft.            Most telephone vandalism is

 in fact acquisitive vandalism , broken telephone boxes a re ra re ly simply broken by

children who go in and sm ash it fo r the fun of it.       They a re m ostly broken into by older

people who a re concerned with theft. It depends in the a re a you live in the extent to which

junking and looting goes on. If you live in a decaying d erelict a re a the chances of it

occurring a re much g re a te r, than if you live in a middle class suburb.


One social psychologist in New York actually left his c a r to see how long it would be b e fo r^ j

it was ’junked’ o r bits w ere knocked off it.      He sim ply left it on the s tre e t, he left the

bonnett open to indicate that it had broken down, then watched fro m a flat opposite.

Within 24 hours the c a r had virtually disappeared.         People had come along and collected

pieces of it, ty res had gone, people had eventually come along and sm ashed it to b its.

He also tells the story of a friend of his who arriv e d in New York, his c a r stopped, the

lights w ere flickering, he thought it m ust be the battery.        He got out, lifted the bonnet

and was checking the b attery , he peered round the bonnet and saw somebody taking a

tyre off the back wheel.      He said ’What a re you doing with the tyre ?’. The man said,

’Don’t w orry.    You have the b attery , I’ll have the t y r e s .’ We haven’t quite reached that     ^

stage yet and Barnsley is s till an am iable place to p ark , com pared to that.


We m ust also talk of tactical vandalism - vandalism in which p artic u la r effects a re

d esired . An example of this would be another facet of industrial sabotage w here a few

m inutes break would be gained by sm ashing up something.            But also things like breaking

windows to get a night in priso n o r draw attention to one se lf.


More im portant is play vandalism .        The attem pt to 'cre ate a play environm ent on the s tre e ts

by throwing stones at windows, by using buildings as m ountains, using lift shafts a s clubs,

s ta irs as tra in s o r w hatever.   Complicated, involved gam es of play involving children up to


                                             10.
about 12 y e a rs old. W hether o r not this becomes m ore serious depends upon the reaction

to it.   It may be that people who attem pt to prevent it se t up a reaction that becomes m ore

vindictive.    This play is a very im portant elem ent.           Some people say ’Isn’t it am azing

that some of our vandals a re 12 y ea rs o ld ? ’ But if you investigate what 12 y e a r old vandals

a re doing, in the m ajority of cases play is the em phasis.             That doesn’t mean that in play

property isn’t destroyed but we’re talking here of m otives and meanings and the idea of

the m in d le ss, irra tio n a l, p u rp o seless, sen seless roam ing vandal who m ust be curbed is

one that needs to be undermined when we examine what is being done and the gam es which

a re being played and the way in which vandalism is p a rt and p arcel of the gam es.


Now we m ust add vindictive vandalism .            (Some of these te rm s a re taken from Stan Cohen’s

work on v a n d a lism .) Vindictive vandalism is w here we’re talking of straightforw ard

revenge, where those who cannot p ro te st about what is happening to them use vandalism

as that form of p ro te st.     There a re many exam ples of N .A .B . windows being sm ashed,

Social Security Offices windows being sm ashed and much m ore common of schools being

broken into and sm ashed. We have not conclusive evidence of this but such evidence that

we have points to a high number of children who break into th eir own school and sm ash up

th eir own classro o m s.     There a re many exam ples of c a se s of people taking it out on

building's and property as a way of protesting about something which they see as an injustice.


Now we need to talk of another category - personalising the im personal.                     There is very

little difficulty about us having a sense of personal identity. Walking ac ro ss a c a r park

and looking a t a ll the different types of c a r s , c a rs with stic k e rs on, c a rs with little

name p la te s , c a rs with personalised num ber p la te s , c a rs with p a rtic u lar so rts of a e r i a l s ,

c a rs with certain so rts of h e ad rests, custom ised, personalised c a r s , bigger c a rs than

anybody e ls e , sm a lle r c a r s , fa ste r c a rs than anybody e ls e , 150 indications of some so rt

of p erso n al identity.   If I w ere to follow someone home, I would see the way in which his

property and possessions autographed his identity around his house, right through the

garden into the house and the way in which a num ber of personal choices put a signature
upon whole asp ects of his existence.       I would ask you to think briefly of those people

who a re faced with a greatly m ore im personal environm ent than we have.            Many people

go and stand in tower block a re a s and feel a sense of anonimity and deep depersonalisation

afte r half an h o u r, let alone living th e r e , returning there seeing that as a place where

you have to ex ist.    So personalising, the use of g ra ttiti, tjie use of m a rk s, the use of

certain acts of destruction to say ’this is w here I liv e ', ’this is my p la c e ', ’I did that’ ,

’this is my block of f la ts '.   There may be no other way, it may be an ag g ressiv e, a violent

way of scratching yourself a c ro ss that environm ent, perhaps it's the only way, there a re

not many other ways of gaining your identity.


May I quote an a rch itect, who was w riting about an attem pt to acquire possession.           He

w rote, 'to p o ssess something we have to take possession, we have to make it p a rt of

o urselves>it is th erefore n ecessary to reach out fo r it.    To p o ssess something we have to

take it in our hands, touch it, test it, put our stam p on it.      Something becomes our

possession because we give it our name o r defile it, because it shows tra ce s of our

existence, a way of making the environm ent our own.'


We m ust turn to the final category - m alicious vandalism .        To that vandalism that

com es out of boredom , d esp air, fru stratio n , out of a need for excitem ent for those c h i l d r j P

who a re 15 or 17 y e a rs old, w here there is a sense of failu re, a re a l sense of hostility,

and w here there is no other way in which excitem ent can be found in this dull environm ent.

Where jobs a re not going to provide any excitem ent, w here m arria g e isn 't going to provide

much excitem ent, w here living conditions a re not going to provide much excitem ent, there

a re not holidays to provide excitem ent.        How with all those things taken away do you show

anybody else who you a re ? With little money, hardly a job, how do you say ' Look at me{

This is me!    I have an identity".


Vandalism provides one way.         Stan Cohen sa y s, "Vandalism is ju st rig h t, it's the ideal

fo rm of ru le breaking both in expressive and instrum ental te rm s.        If one is looking for

                                           12.
toughness, excitem ent, action and a sense of control then school and work do not provide

the right a re a . " In other words this provides a little bit of contact with the police,

perhaps a little bit of excitem ent , a little bit of sense of group solidarity (in the m ain

vandalism is a group offence as you know) a little sense of personal identity to those who

have very few other ways of a sse rtin g them.


In relation to that la s t category we have to notice the class of the vandals and we have

to recognise their predicam ent. With so much wrong with our cities we seize on the

m indless vandal ra th e r than the apparently ratio n al, mindful planner.          After a ll, the

public policy we a re talking about h ere       en su res that houses a re spotless while our

public places a re squalid, that our private c a rs a re im m aculate while our buses and

tra in s a re m altreated and while all our pin neat gardens often depend on our having tipped

the rubbish over the wall. And also the fact that when urban motorways a re built they

plough through the cheapest p ro p erties in our c itie s, and such incidental but im portant

fe atu res.


For example Aberfan was not a com m uter village, Konan Point was not a luxury block -

there a re a m illion and one exam ples we can give          of the ways in which dereliction and

neglect and planning in many cases re p re se n t attacks upon this very group who a re then

in tu rn , turned upon and blamed for the destruction of property in th eir a re a s.


Vandalism, as we know occurs in the m ost im personal of a re a s , usually in public pro perty ,

w here it is d e relict o r incom plete, on large ra th e r than sm a ll e s ta te s, in higher ra th e r

than lower tower b lo ck s, in places where children have been crowded.               If you want a

p red icto r of vandalism , the b est, as Sheena Wilson has shown, is the density of children

within a p artic u la r e state.


The vandal created none of those circu m stan ces.          However, he responds som etim es in

a playful, som etim es in a u tilitarian way, som etim es in a m alicious way to many of those

circu m stan ces.
So I would hope that in your discussions during the day, and I'm grateful to the

o rg an isers who have indicated that they would be pleased if I would go to some of the

sem inar groups, that some distinctions could be made between types of vandalism .             You

see some of the problem s of not distinguishing a re fairly readily seen.       If for example

you say we need m ore adventure playgrounds and then m ore vandalism occurs you might

say that adventure playgrounds a re n 't the answ er. Well, there may not be any complete

answ er, they may be a p artial answ er, but perhaps they a re only a p a rtia l answ er to

those who a re vandals because they a re play vandals, but will not be an answ er to those

engaged in m alicious vandalism . They probably don't provide much answ er fo r those

involved in personalising vandalism .     Those differentations a re im portant for p rev en tio n s^

because you may say the way we can prevent vandalism in our a re a is by fortifying, to use

this p articu lar m ate ria l, to not allow opportunities for destruction.   Then, in fact, you a re

creating in many c a se s, a fu rth er im personalisation of the environm ent by that very

fortification. As I've said its the im personalisation of the environm ent which seem s to

be p articu larly related to that p articu la r vandalism we've described.    So the idea of

one solution to a ll s o rts of vandalism is a contradiction in te rm s , that is im possible.


I've trie d to define the te rm vandalism because there a re different causes fo r each one.

I've also said that there is some sense of 'm o ra l panic' over vandalism .      This is not to s d |

that people should not be concerned about it, but there is a scapegoat available. When we

see the way in which p re s s coverage deals with the vandal then we need to be very

careful about deciding what the vandal is responsible fo r. We need to pay as much

attention as we would if someone cam e along and blamed a ll the problem s of the inner

city upon the presence of im m igrant com m unities. We need to be absolutely certain that

in fact we a re not using a convenient scapegoat as a substitute for analysing the full nature

of the situation.

GROUP ONE:       Building Design, E state Layout and Management

Leaving aside the sociological asp ects of vandalism which a re outside the b rief of
this group, a heavy responsibility r e s ts with the designer of buildings and estates
where vandalism is concerned.

It is the designer who, by creating sensible and sym pathetic designs, can m inim ise
the opportunity fo r vandalism by acknowledging the profound effect that design can
have on the quality of life and the environm ent. The creation of a layout which
prom otes responsibility and identification within the community together with the
stim ulation of pride in property and the a re a as a whole is of param ount im portance
in d eterrin g vandalism .

One im portant facto r is the creation of a ’defensible sp ace’ i .e . a space for which
individuals can feel responsible such as a porch o r the traditional front garden with
a fence round it. Where such a space ex ists, with a clearly defined boundary for
all to see, then a situation is created where people a re m ore likely to feel responsible
for that a re a and accordingly to defend it.   In co n trast, people seem less p repared
to ca re for anonymous spaces w here no identification ex ists,su ch as the co rrid o rs
and lift a re a s in high r is e developm ents.

Another factor is the phasing of the construction of new developm ents. At p resen t,
it is not uncommon to find completed and occupied houses alongside houses in the
early stages of construction. Such site s, p a rtic u la rly where building m a te ria ls can
be found lying around, tend to a ttr a c t vandalism , perhaps because of the tem porary
appearance of dereliction o r d iso rd e r. It is suggested that developments could be
completed in sm all se lf contained sections to m inim ise the tem ptation.

The relationship between the initial capital investm ent and the revenue costs is
another significant facto r faced by the designer. Constraints imposed fa the form
of specified building m a te ria ls o r housing densities can produce a design with an
unacceptable potential for vandalism e .g . flim sy m a te ria ls which d eterio rate
quickly o r m inim al space for recreatio n al facilities. This often m eans that an
initial reluctance fo r capital investm ent can re su lt in in creased revenue co sts and
lo st capital investm ent.
A cognisance of the needs and d e sire s of future u s e rs of developments is im portant
fo r d esig n ers. Thus a design which is compatible with the aspirations and needs of
future residen ts is param ount in avoiding an unsettled and potentially violent
community. Inherent in this point is the imposition of arch itectu ra l concepts such
as G arden Cities o r high r is e developm ents.

The design of public facilities and th e ir anonymity creates problem s e .g . parks
buildings and bus stands. T here is no opportunity to create a defensible space
and it seem s th at a preventive o r defensive design is called fo r.

GROUP 2: The involvement of the Community


Although the title seem ed vi rtually all em bracing, We trie d in very p ractical ways
to find m eans of combatting the apathy of the public and to awaken in them a sense
of community responsibility and involve them in a concerted effort to counteract the
problem of vandalism .

We discussed the Home Office Standing Com m ittee’s re p o rt together with the points
raised by P ro fe s so r Taylor,ranging over causes and effects and there was unanimous
ag reem en t that rem edies to the problem w ere many and varied.

We learned that there was very little vandalism in E astern Europe but there was no
d ire c t p arallel with B ritain because we do not have the th re a t of a ’S ib eria'. This
together with the fact that there a re seem ingly very few sm iling people in th e E astern Bloc
convinced us that we could not recom m end the ra th e r re p re ssiv e rem edies which take
place in that p a rt of the world. But we a re equally resolved that we do not want a
community based on hedonism and any rem edies to vandalism proposed should be
im plem ented in such a way th at it would be c le a r to the cu lp rit that there w ere lines of
behaviour in the community beyond which he should not go. Em phasis was placed on
’h e ’ because in the Home Office Report it was noted that g irls were much b e tte r
behaved in re sp e c t of vandalism , indeed they c a rrie d out very few acts of vandalism.

P ro fe s so r T ay lo r's descriptions of the various acts of vandalism were d iscu sse d :-
industrial vandalism , acquisitive, vindictive and irratio n al, but we a re unhappy when
he quotes Stan Cohen who a s se rte d th at ’vandalism is the ideal form of rule b reaking’.
We a re , however, in accord with the view that the s ta r t is in the environm ent and in
the home.

Some parents a re avoiding th e ir resp o nsib ilities, the community's conscience is not
rea lly awakened on the subject and so we looked a t ways and m eans of awakening that
conscience so that action could follow. Accepting that a d e te rre n t is necessary to
check those youngsters who can not le a rn in any other way that they m u st be punished
for doing wrong we turn then to m ore positive proposals.

The guidelines of behaviour have become too smudged and the community m ust g e t back
to b a sic s. T here is insufficient attention given to improving the living and working
environm ents of the citizens of the United Kingdom. In this country only one q u a rte r of
the money spent in Europe on appearance and am enity goes on that im portant p a rt of
developm ent and we feel that when the financial position in the country improves m ore
should be spent along those lin es.

We re a lise that a t the turn of the twentieth century, th ere w ere less c ars to damage,
le ss saplings to destroy, lessjpass to b reak and we took into consideration that the
tem ptations to the younger people today a re g re a te r, as affluence in creases so logically
does the num ber of ta rg e ts fo r vandalism .
The next point touched on was the rem oteness of the a d m in istrato rs. A num ber of
m em bers of the group feel that these a re schism s between the governed and the
governors but we all agree that there a re som e fam ilies who isolate them selves from
the community and ways m u st be found to b re ak down those b a r r ie r s .

Schools could play a m ore positive role in the community and in promulgating
preventative m easu res and parental resp o n sib ilities. T here should be g re a te r use
made of school facilities on evenings and during school holidays so that m ore benefit
could be derived from the facilities by the community. In some are as where play
schem es a re run by local volunteers, it was pointed out in no uncertain te rm s that
adventure playgrounds a re not a good way of bringing the community togetbe r and
preventing vandalism . There is a need to s tr e s s to the community that such facilities
belong to them and not the im personal ’A uthority’.

Some victim s of vandalism a re afraid to re p o rt to the police for fe a r that if th e ir
nam es become known there could be fu rth er acts of vandalism by way of revenge.
We suggest that plaintiffs’ o r in fo rm ers’ nam es in such cases should be treated as        f
confidential and not disclosed indiscrim inately.

We feel there is an initiative to be taken by local au th o rities. We w ere encouraged
by the steps taken to publicise the cost of making good acts of vandalism , and we
note p articu larly that the Rotherham Borough Council ra te demand contains a section
relating to the money expended on making good acts of vandalism .

However, publicity m u st be p a rt of an anti-vandalism campaign and needs to be handled
in a v ery professional way. Lines of communication to the authorities m ust be clearly
laid down and widely known. A num ber of ex p erim en ts in selected a re a s of South
Y orkshire could be undertaken, subject to careful m onitoring, on the lines of those in
the six ties in the juvenile delinquency field.

Local aut horities should take an initiative in setting up local community action
com m ittees in selected a r e a s . The com m ittees should com prise resid en ts of the
a re a , served by officers of the County and D istrict authorities with a budget fo r         A
employing skilled advertising agencies. The will to im prove conditions in an a re a           ^
m u st come from the inhabitants and local authorities should be on hand to give as
much assista n ce as possible while maintaining a low profile.

Publicity is very im portant indeed, being seen as the only way to g et down to the
g r a s s roots of the problem and our recom m endation of this 'sharp-end* approach in
selected a re a s would, it was hoped, involve all agencies, p articu larly those in the
voluntary field.

T here w ere m isgivings, obviously, voiced by some m em bers of the group as to
w here the reso u rc es would come from , but we feel that they should be found. Some
m oderate outlay in this field m ay well repay itse lf sev eral tim es over.

We conclude by stre ssin g that ju st as there a re ma.ny fecets to the problem of
vandalism there a re equally as many avenues of approaching the subject; each with
the overall aim of making South Y orkshire a b e tte r place in which to live.
GROUP 3: The Police Approach                             GROUP LEADER:
                                                         R. S. RARRATT, E sq .,
                                                         Chief Constable,
                                                         South Y orkshire Police


 The group believe that there is a considerable amount of police support for the role
of the police in the vandalism situation and for what they a re doing.

 The group whilst appreciating the difficulty in establishing the size of the problem
n evertheless recognise that th ere is a serious problem which is causing a g reat
 deal of concern among thinking people.


We encountered what many people will reg ard as a hardy annual - the inadequacy of the
num bers of policemen - but value the preventive patrolling asp ect of police work.
Though appreciating that the Panda C ar has been introduced fo r good reasons it is still no
substitute for the m an on the beat, and it is in the preventive      patrolling field that the
police believe so much m ore needs to be done.


The police feel that they a re increasingly only responding to situations and not doing
as much as they would like in te rm s of actual physical preventive patrolling.


The group would like to see liaison with the public developing even m ore than a t the
m om ent but this again is one of the problem s resulting from the shortage of m en on
foot who have got tim e to see what is going on, find out what is going on and take the
appropriate action.


R ather than police officers entering schools a fte r an a c t of vandalism has occurred,
the group would like to see a g r e a te r police presence   in the schools as p a rt of the
norm al pro cess of education, being involved, perhaps, in courses on civics. The
School Liaison Officer stated that the frequency of v isits to schools by the police a re
not as often as they would wish, p artially because of th e ir lim ited num ber, but also
because entry is by invitation and not all Head T eachers want to see police officers
within th e ir schools.


T here is a need to extendthe school liaison se rv ice into the youth clubs, since much of
the vandalism which occurs is attributed to teen ag ers, but because of insufficient
m anpower this cannot be done during working hours.          Officers a re therefore encouraged,
on a sem i-official b asis, to become involved but they need to be of the right age and
tem peram ent.                            1R
P aren tal responsibility needs to be em phasised and again the group would like to see
m ore police involvement in the education of parents ju st as much as in the education of
their children since it is often the lack of parental discipline and control which leads to
vandalism.


To g e t a c ro ss the m essage Qf the cost to society there was a suggestion to include an
item on the rate demand notice showing ju st what ratep ay ers a re paying for vandalism
in ju st the sam e way as they a re shown what they a re paying in te rm s of schools.


T here was agreem ent that the police need the support of the public if they a re going to be
m o re effective in dealing with acts of vandalism. We do not really see that the public
can      hide behind a cloak of anonymity because in many cases the principal witness
going to be the person who actually sees the damage happen and will be known in many
cases to the m isc re a n ts.


An example which was quoted in fact was of a s tre e t w here all the s tr e e t lights w ere shot
out and clearly someone would have seen o r certainly m u st have heard som ething. Yet when
residents in that S treet -were qiMfetioned on the folkm ngdqy a fte r the damaged lam ps had been
found, no-one was prepared to come forw ard and say that they had seen o r heard anything.
Without active public support, and without the public giving the police a hand, the police
cannot do very much m ore in bringing people before the courts.


Though the othergroups have alsodealtwith this aspect, we \*antto emphasize m ost strongly tl^ J^
vandalism is not ju st a job fo r the police se rv ice.   Basically the police a re th ere to help
c le a r up the afterm ath but th ere a re many other facets to this p a rtic u la r problem .


Ideally the police need to be seen about m o re, p articu larly on foot.
 They need to im prove th eir education effort to get the m essage
 a c ro ss not only to children, but to a w ider public so as to obtain a ra th e r wider
public support than they a re getting a t the moment, because without such help
the police cannot be as effective. Vandalism is not ju st a problem fo r the police in
uniform , but is a problem fo r the community a s a whole.

GROUP 4: The attitude of the Courts


Although our discussions produced a wide divergence of opinions th ere a re some
aspects of our subject on which there is general agreem ent. We em phasise that
M agistrates find them selves in a difficult situation; they a re n ecessarily dealing
with circum stances where vandalism has already occurred. When offenders have
already been caught and eventually appear before a co u rt for sentencing. This
produces lim its within which M agistrates have to operate.

The question of sentencing was obviously one which attracted m uch discussion.
We em phasise th at th ere a re no inflexible ru les laid down for m a g istra te s. They
a re th ere to adjudicate on each individual case and make a judgement in the
p articu lar circu m stan ces. T here was a suggestion from one of our m em bers
that there should be a 'parking ticket' o r fixed o r minimum penalty type of sentence but
this did not find general agreem ent. We agreed that each case had to be dealt with on its
m e rits and that fines a re a d e te rren t. If m ag istrates feel that they can impose an aiequate
fine on an offender then that is sufficient. But M agistrates a re dealing with not only the
offence and punishment but the offender also and aiming for his refo rm . We accordingly
re je c t any suggestion that there is a need to change existing legislation. In doing so we
draw attention to the m o st recen t bill before p arliam ent which if c arried into law, will
provide for adults to be fined up to a maximum of £ 1 , 000.
We agreed that people should be made to rea lise the physical effects of vandalism
and destruction. In the case of juveniles we feel that this can be achieved by
obliging offenders, eith er physically or m onetarily, to re p a ir the damage which
has been caused. A lternatively offenders should be required to perform some
form of se rv ice to help them re a lise the serio u sn ess of th eir actions; the
Community Service approach. Although the idea of offenders reporting to
attendance centres appeals generally, this approach is re stric te d by the shortage
of finance.

On the question of compensation we feel that w here it is applied for - and this
does not always happen - and granted by the Court as p a rt of the penalty then this
provides a useful d e te rre n t. We feel that whenever compensation is applied for
it should be g ran ted . We see some problem s h ere regarding p oorer fam ilies
w here they cannot afford to pay fines and compensation. But we feel that w herever
possible, a t le a s t a m inim al fine should be imposed.

A larg e p a rt of vandalism is caused by juveniles and we feel that parents need to
be involved as much as possible. We need to draw to th e ir attention the seriousness
of th eir ch ild ren 's actions. We feel that this parental involvement can be secured
by requiring them to appear in court when th eir children appear as a re su lt of acts
of vandalism .

Inevitably, some of us feel very strongly that corporal punishm ent should in some
way be re-in tro d u ced . A fter a lengthy discussion the m ajority of us re je c t this.
We a re also opposed to the introduction of a specific offence to deal only with
vandalism .
We felt considerable concern at the delay in co u rt appearances; there is often a
lapse of 12 weeks o r longer before a court appearance. We feel that this tends
to d etrac t from the seriousness of the offence and that speedier court appearances
can serv e as a d e te rre n t to vandalism.

We think th at the m edia a re im portant in that they can m itigate against the whole
concept of trying to reduce vandalism by exaggerating some exam ples of it.
F u rth e rm o re, we find that the media only ra re ly publicise the sentences which a re
imposed by the Courts as a re su lt of vandalism . The railw ays a t one tim e tried
to publicise by pictures, the kind of vandalism that was taking place only to find that
some people who had not thought of it copied the acts of vandalism shown. We
accordingly re je c t any campaign of this kind. We do feel, however, that some
discussion with the media on th eir approach to vandalism m ight be useful. If it
becomes g enerally known that Courts a re imposing quite se v ere sentences as a
re su lt of vandalism this this will provide a d eterren t.

We concluded our discussion on the sam e note as we started; Courts deal with cases
where vandalism has already been committed but we do want to express some views
to those concerned m ore directly with the prevention of vandalism . Some of us felt
that som e parents hatfe opted out Of th e ir responsibilities and failed to g et ac ro ss to
th eir children that th ere is a right and wrong. Education can strengthen the role of
the fam ily and give the support which is often needed by young people who feel quite
insecure o r who a re deprived in any way. Whilst the M agistrate is p rim arily
concerned with adjudicating on com m issioned offences we feel that the way in which
they do this can provide a d ete rre n t. M agistrates have, we feel, a very positive
role to play.

GROUP 5 : Role of the L ocal Education Authority in Schools



Despite P ro fe s so r T ay lo r's possible e rrin g towards caution in considering the

phenomenon of vandalism ,the group were generally agreed that the problem was a

significant one and worthy of careful thought and attention. It was thought that the

problem should never at any time be under-estim ated even though there was no.

positive identification of the size of the problem at the moment.



The sociological .approach of P ro fe s so r T ay lo r was welcomed. It is an em inently suitable

approach to the phenomenon since it suggested that a piecem eal attack on the v ery nature

of vandalism would in fact produce v ery little long te rm advantage.



D iscussion within the group was wide, and it was discovered that a v ery wide v ariety

of assum ptions w ere continually being made when statem ents a re made and possible

solutions offered. G eneralisations were made on attitudes towards the discipline

of the so called problem of large com prehensive schools, on the role of the governing

bodies and management bodies, and on the problem s of the less able children. As

discussions developed many Of the assum ptions were found to be only p a rt of the tru th .



The group did not believe that there could be a solution to vandalism but considered

that its effects could be m inim ised by b etter understanding of its causes and a concerted

sustained effort by a ll who a re interested in its reduction. In other words there

must be a general com m itm ent to the alleviation of the nuisance. Only then can

detailed suggestions have any hopes of su ccess.



Some time was spent discussing c e rtain aspects of the curriculum „particularly as it

affected pupils in the 5th y e a r who were considering leaving school and looking for jobs.
Concern was expressed that the work of the Job C reation Program m e should be continued and

expanded if a t all possible.     Following from this there should also be as much

development as possible in work experience, e .g . P roject Tricfent link cou rses with

colleges of fu rth e r education, in efforts to overcome some of the possible misgivings

and doubts that students might have upon leaving school.



Another a re a of discussion followed from this; that there should be a continued

evaluation of the cu rricu lu m within schools to ensure that it is fulfilling the needs,

not only of the children them selves but the requirem ents of th e ir parents and the
                                                                                                  m
m em bers of staff actually at the school.



A num ber of sm all item s followed th is, p articu larly significant, because there was

a v ariety of p ractice between the authorities represented in the group. T hat related

to c a re ta k e rs and th e ir function. It was strongly felt that w herever possible c a re ­

tak ers should five within the school campus and m ost certainly they should be provided

with telephones so that they w ere in a position to make d ire c t contact with the police



                                                                                                  •
if they should need to do so at any time during the course of the day.



The group appreciated in so many recom m endations, that money was involved

and it was felt that p re ss u re s should be brought to b ear by all concerned in an attem pt

to provide the n ecessary financial re so u rc e s.                                                   . ‘



The   group felt that so much of the responsibility for the education of the children

and th e ir behaviour in society was placed on p a re n ts. It was not felt that this was

always possible because parents did not and were often not able to accept that

responsibility. To that extent the school should undertake as much as it reasonably

could in the circu m stan ces.    F u rth e r the group felt that in all school organisations,

whether it be p rim a ry o r secondary, the managing o r governing bodies had a very
                                             23.
positive role to play in showing special in te re st in the nature of the school, in the

organisation of the school, in the cu rriculum of the school, and in aspects of its

discipline; that they were in a position to act as m ediator on occasions and som etim es

as links between the main schqol body and the community itself.



The two main recom m endations, th erefo re, which em erge from the long involved

discussions of this group w ere:-

F irg t that there should be the identification of a v ery positive community in terest

w ithin the school itself so that the students saw them selves as p a rt of the whole

and the co rro lo ry to that;second, that the school itse lf should be seen within the

context of the community; not as isolated from it but very much p a rt of it.

Authority in the Community                                      Youth and Community Service,
                                                                B arnsley M etropolitan Borough Council


1.   A problem that faced us befoye we began our discussions was that our subject overlapped
     that of two other groups, namely group 2 - the Involvement of the Community, and
     Group 5 - the Bole of the lo cal Education Authority in Schools, This placed us in a
     difficult situation as we did not want to duplicate discussions that may have been taking
     place in these other two groups.

2.   The group was m ade up of pe ople from varying occupations and ways of life. In addition
     to the rep resen tativ es from Education A uthorities, m ag istrate 's co u rts, etc. we also had
     a num ber of ordinary m em bers of the public who put th e ir views as individuals forward
     against the professional views of the te a c h e rs, social w o rk e rs, etc. on the group. This
     m eant that we did not reach agreem ent on many of the points we discussed. We did,
     however, ag ree on the question of sanctions. As to what form these should take was
     something we could not agree on; som e of us felt that coip oral punishment was the answ er
     w hilst others thought that a m o re lenient approach would be m ore appropriate.

3.   We started our discussion by talking about the ro le p aren ts should take in assistin g
     schools and local education authorities to reduce the incidence of vandlism . Several of
     us thought that much of the responsibility for the p resen t level of vandalism lay with
     the p aren ts for th e ir lack of guidance to th e ir children. Young children a re very
     im pressionable and tend to copy adults in both actions and thought. If parents show
     d isresp ec t for authority and property th e ir children a re likely to show a sim ilar d isre sp e ct.
     This w ills how k itia lly at school in one form or another. U nless the education se rv ic e , in
     its w ider sense of culture ra th e r than instruction, rece iv e s assistan ce from paren ts in
     attem pting to inhibit the undesirable behavioural patterns being shown by certain children,
     the vandalism problem will not be reduced. Children m ust see that th e ir teach ers have the
     support of the ch ild ren 's p aren ts.

4.   We then went on to discu ss the ro le that the community could play in reducing vandalism .
     We w ere told that schools serving a p a rtic u lar catchment a re a or community often
     suffered le s s vandalism than those serving an indistinct a re a . It was generally agreed that
     this was because the Community looked upon the school as 'belonging' to them , and ju st
     as the m ajority of people would not vandalise th e ir own prop erty , they do not damage the
     school. Many of us agreed that if a community was involved in the initial plans for building
     a new school the feeling of 'owning' the school was implanted right at the very s ta rt.
     Sim ilarly if the pupils w ere involved in deciding the colour schem es of classroom s and the
     choice of furnishings, they too, began to feel that it was th e ir school.

5.   An extension of this idea of a school 'belonging' to a community was introduced when we
     discussed schools becoming m ore of a community building ra th e r than an educational
     establishm ent. Schools should become m o re of a focal point for the community, being
     used m ore in the evenings but not ju st for evening classes organised by education
     au th o rities. The community should be perm itted to organise th e ir own events and
     activities in 'th e ir' school.

6.   Something which we discussed, although not strictly falling within our discussion a re a ,
     was the problem of poor social habitats. High r is e blocks of flats do not provide a
     family with the sam e sense of ownership as an ordinary house, with its garden and
     fence. The fam ilies in these high r is e flats do not, th ere fo re , consider the block as
     th e ir pro p erty and as a consequence the flats a re vandalised. A poor environment and
     the lack of social am enities are seen by the group as being problem s leading to
     vandalism brought about by a lack of resp ect for the a re a , the responsible authority and
      other people in the neighbourhood.
                                               25.
                                          2.


7.   This brought us back onto our topic by revealing that children need to be taught to respect
     authority and individuals, to act as responsible m em bers cf the community and to be
     told of th eir rig h ts in the community. This point tie s in v ery closely with the argum ent
     that education should be cultural as well as instructional and that parents should support
     teach ers in this cultural training. This point of co-operation and implanting the feeling of
     responsibility came through many of the m a tte rs raised during the cSscussions.

8.   One m a tte r which we discussed very b riefly , probably because it was one point on which we
     all agreed, was that th ere should be g re a te r liaison between the various educational
     se rv ic es and other social agencies e .g . social se rv ic e s, a re a health authority, housing,
     probation,working in a p a rtic u la r a rea. From this liaison, however, m ust come action
     aimed at improving a. fam ily's predicam ent. In addition to the liaiso n , th ere fo re , there
     m ust be action p ro jects and alliances. The information from these alliances should not
     be kept in one a re a but circulated throughout the country so that other organisations can
     take advantage of the experiences of others.

9.   Throughout our discussion the central them e of implanting both the feeling of re s p o n s ib le ^
     and resp ec t in individuals and of the community towning* the schools in th e ir a rea w ere W r y
     prevalent. We appreciate, though, that it is im possible to rein state a sense of community
     sp irit im m ediately;it will take changes in our whole social and environmental stru ctu re s
     which itse lf will take th ree or four generations. We a r e , however, optim istic that
     something can be done to reduce the incidence of vandalism .

Sem inar On Vandalism




Held at:
Lady Mabel C ollege of Education
Wentworth
Rotherham


3 1 s t.   M arch,   1977.
INTRODUCTION

The South Y orkshire Police Committee decided to hold the Sem inar on Vandalism
due to increasing public concern about the problem s asso ciated with
vandalism and in an attem pt to identify m easu res which m ight be employed to
m inim ise those problem s.

The organisation of the sem inar was dealt with by Officers of the South Y orkshire
County Council reporting to a Steering Committee of m em bers of the Police
Com m ittee. Invitations to the sem in ar w ere given to representativ es of a wide
range of organisations including local au th orities, nationalised industries and
voluntary groups m ainly from within South Y orkshire but in som e cases from
outside it. In addition invita tions w ere issued to m em bers of the public who
responded to an advertisem ent placed in the local p re s s .

The Sem inar was organised in th ree se ssio n s. During the f irs t sessio n the sem inar
was ad dressed by P ro fe sso r L aurie Taylor of the Departm ent of Sociology,
U niversity of York on "M otives and Meanings of V andalism ". During the second
sessio n rep resen tativ es divided into six discussion groups dealing with:

1.     Building Desfen, E state Layout and Management

2.     The involvement of the Community.

3.     The Police approach.

4.     The attitude of the C ourts.

5.     The role of Local Education Authority in Schools.

 6.    The role of the Local Education Authority in the Community.

In the third sessio n the lead er of each group reported to the sem inar on the
findings of th eir respective groups and rep resen tativ es w ere given the opportunity
to question the group le a d e rs. This re p o rt se ts out a tra n sc rip t of the ad d ress
given by P ro fe s so r Taylor and the re p o rts of each of the six discussion groups.
PROFESSOR LAURIE TAYLOR

I suppose one is occasionally aware when talking about sociology of certain

environm ental incongruities , of a c e r tain m is-m atch which occurs between context

and subject m a tte r, I do not think I have ev er had a m ore evident example of it than

we have this m orning to be sitting in a room like this and talking about Vandalism.


Well f ir s t of all I should tell you that I refused your kind invitation to speak to this

Seminar twice; it may seem odd to draw attention to my churlishness but a t le a st it

provides me with an opportunity to tell you some of the reason s for this refusal.


In the f irs t p lace, I w as, quite frankly, w orried about w asting your time because when

I looked through the list of speakers and indeed when I spoke to the O rganisers of this

Conference it was evident that there is a very p ractical s tr e s s to the day 's discussion.

The people who a re on the lis t a re people who want to do something about Vandalism,

want to do it quickly; they a re people who a re suffering from its im m ediate effects.

You want to try to stop those who a re spoiling the environm ent and there a re people

here who a re concerned with catching vandals and with finding methods to stop them

repeating th eir behaviour.


I do not fo r a second ca st any doubt on the validity of all those e n te rp ris e s.   Sociologists
                                                                                                    |
as much as anybody else dislike sm ashed telephone boxes, broken s tre e t lights,

disfigured buildings and, I think, will always recognise that an attem pt to cure the

symptons is a perfectly acceptable response to this.


It would be possible, I suppose, for me to talk about prevention; I could tell you about

the failure of publicity cam paigns.     I could tell you, alm ost, that drawing attention to

the problem has a certain counter productivity of its own.          I could talk about the possible

benefits which can come from fortification, but I would wish to draw your attention to the

way in which increased fortification of p articu lar environm ents actually helps to
    constitute the very type of environm ent which may be the reason fo r the vandals response

    in the f ir s t place.   I could tell you about protection groups, about the use of vigilantes,

    about the relative success of special p atro ls.     I could tell you about deflection; the ways

    in which the use of adventure playgrounds?.the use of graffiti bo ards, though those graffiti

    boards a re the empty spaces on the w alls of lavato ries.       I could talk about the way in which

    d eterren ts work, the possibility of using custodial sentences and the likelihood of this

    decreasing vandalism occuring.         But I really do feel that what could be said in m ost of those

    a re a s i s , in many c a s e s, highly co ntroversial, in the sense that it produces no cle a r cut

    re su lts and I think is often based upon such a m isunderstanding of the nature of vandalism

    that it really is not appropriate to consider it or to spend a g reat deal of tim e deciding

    what one would do about vandalism until one has spent a little m ore time establishing exactly

    what we a re talking about.


    Of co u rse, this is w here sociologists, I suppose, traditionally come in because they a re the

    boring people who come rolling in saying "I would ju st like to spend a little bit of time

    defining what we mean by vandalism, I want to spend a little bit of time on understanding, a

    little bit of time on explanation of the phenomenon before I s ta rt preventing it" .       At the

    moment the explanatory side has very little to say to the preventive side.            Those people

    who a re engaged in the prevention, as it w ere, may not be able to obtain any reliable

^   indication of what they should be doing from those people involved in explanation.             I may

    also appear irrita tin g , and I also said perhaps I shouldn't be coming along, because I want

     to play a t definition.    The word v a n d a lis m simply doesn't mean too much to me until it is

    differentiated.      This is , of co u rse, c ritic a l if I am seeking explanation and understanding.

     Unless we know what we a re talking about there is no way in which we can explain causes.

     I have a homogeneous notion of vandalism , I put together in a pile all so rts of behaviours

     which in fact a re very different.      There really is no possibility of    finding a num ber of

     causes in o rd er to explain this bundle of behaviours which I have christened vandalism .

     I was also concerned about coming and my presence may prove a little irrita tin g to you,

     because I also wonder why everybody gets quite so upset about vandalism when there a re
so many other p ressin g problem s ill the world.


Let's take the la st one f irs t.   Undoubtedly we do get very upset by vandalism , the fact that

we a re holding this sem inar and the fact that I can tell you that a large num ber of such

sem in ars a re held up and down the country and have been held for y e a rs.         A large amount

of money has been put into re s e a rc h on vandalism .     Despite the fact that really vandalism

is not very visible to many in this room; we h ear about it and get re p o rts of it but few of us

see much m ore in daily life than broken windows and telephone boxes out of action and at
best som e graffiti which has become m ore evident because of the invention of the aero so l

ra th e r m ore evident than when people used penknives on tre e s .       Much of the tim e we are

told of vandalism by o th e rs, by a group of sociologists - m oral e n trep ren e u rs, people who

select certain problem s and say they d eserve our attention.


I will give an example of how vandalism becom es a problem .             Recent Home Office re s e a rc h

by Tony M arshall in Blackburn looked at crim e rep o rts in local new spapers - and he found

that 45% of all crim e re p o rts dealt with vandalism but damage offences, including a rso n ,

w ere only 3.4% of a ll known offences.       Clearly the e d ito rs, r e p o rte rs , and public who buy

the papers say this is som ething we should pay attention to - i t 's highly im portant and much

m ore im portant than a variety of other c rim e s.      It is strange how often we get into a so rt of

m oral righteousness over certain types of behaviour.


Now vandalism is an extrem ely w orrying and costly phenomenon - nothing I'm saying now is

to deny that.     But it's am azing how those of us who a re not vandals and find the behaviour

difficult to understand, engage in petty crim es ourselves (perhaps traffic offences, speeding

o r whatever) and we manage to work up a m o ral righteousness about those who scraw l on

w alls or sm ash s tre e t lights.    Even though the possible economic and human rep ercu ssio n s

 of those actions may be quite incom patible.        C learly we think it is im portant.
We also are concerned because we think it has increased greatly - we have a notion

that vandalism is growing every day, that it is much w orse than it used to be.        But it

is difficult to estab lish that. As M arshall points out in h}s re s e a rc h - we really don't

know because although the num ber of offences has increased (there is an in crease in the

s ta tis tic s), it is difficult to know whether that increase is because en tries under that

heading relate to property over £20 (knd we don't knowwhether increased cost is because

of inflation)or w hether there has been m ore m alicious damage.


T here a re only estim ates fo r us to go on and people use a variety of assum ptions to a rriv e

at their figu res. An M . P . , in a recent debate, suggested a figure as high as £100m. p er

y e a r for all cases of vandalism .   But when you examine how he a rriv e s a t that figure you

find that quite a percentage of it is based on 'found' damage ra th e r than evidence of

intentional dam age. Any estim ates of vandalism , therefo re, a re complicated by the fact

that a vandal com pletes a job which w ear and te a r has already sta rte d .   It would be pleasant

to walk around one's own home and when something was pointed out as being broken we

could blame vandals again.      People who a re concerned with public property, shops, schools,

d eterioratin g public buildings find it easy a t the end of the y ear to say vandals have done

this o r we've had depreciation occurring which we can put down to vandalism .


Indeed the vandal may have picked on what was already breaking and disfigured it.

Any sign of d eterioratio n will be compounded by vandals.


I'm unhappy about the word vandal. It suggests somebody waking up a t 8. o'clock in the

m orning, coming dow nstairs being a vandal, and going out and vandalising all day, ra th e r

like delinquents.   The fact is that many vandals a re good at school, a t work and live in

happy homes and a re respo nsib le, reliable people who interm ittently, occasionally and

sporadically engage in an act called vandalism . Whether that m akes them vandals I'm

not certain .   In the sam e way should our occasional bit of motorway speeding make us into

psychopathic m o to rists ?
Many of us will know Shepherd's Law - the law of diminishing vandalism which states

"if you wish to do something about vandalism , then as soon as any destruction occurs you

im m ediately re p a ir it, and re p a ir it again and again until eventually vandalism on that

site c e a s e s ." This suggests that certain sites a re attacked and a re attacked for a time

but if they a re renovated the attack will switch elsew here.     Vandals provide thereby a

useful scapegoat in many w ays, a way of w riting off certain so rts of property losses due

to depreciation.


But in saying that we get too upset about vandalism we take       some of the figures quoted in
      i
the p re ss too seriously,     we take what is said in the local newspapers as reflecting the

actuality ra th e r than as a g ro ss distortion but nevertheless there a re good reasons why

we should get upset about vandalism .      To put the problem into p erspective is not to throw

it out of the window.


L et's tilt the evidence a bit the other way.    Vandalism is one of those offences ra re ly

reported - it's difficult to know how much is reported - but another Home Office Study -

Sturm an's M anchester Study - suggested that approxim ately 1 in 15 cases w ere being

reported.   There is evidently what crim inologists would call a larg e 'd ark ' figure - where

the num ber of cases in court rep resen ts 1/15 of the total.

                                                                                                  *
We should also get upset because it affects vital se rv ices,in p a rtic u la r telephone serv ices

and perhaps tran sp o rt. We m ust rem em ber that the p re ss and other agencies 'play up'

what is occurring.      The Daily M irro r re fe rre d to "the way in which louts and petty thieves

a re putting nearly half of B ritain's 75,000 phone boxes out of action every y e a r. " That

suggests that vandals a re taking over.      If you examine the figures m ore closely, half of

B ritain 's phone boxes w ere damaged a t one time o r another but at any one time the num ber

out of action was about 1 in 30.     The M irror story suggests that half a re out of action at this

m oment.      A good example of how the th reat is played up.
 If I had to se lect one topic of concern it would be that those sections of society, the

 deprived sections in so many ways, - unemployment, poverty and poor environm ent -

 a re the people who live in three conditions which a re   m ost affected by vandalism .     Certain

crim inologists a re rom antics and can be heard talking of the vandal who is making an

anarchic respo nse, a revolutionary response to the (Structural inequalities of contem porary

society.   Such people ignore that the people who have to pay for such revolution a re in many

c a se s the underprivileged them selves.


 Vandalism violates many of our cherished values.          It's a subject for concern because it

violates such things as the value of property.       To us who own houses, c a r s , who have a lis t

of p o sse ssio n s, the way we come to p ro tect them is very r e a l.   It is something we think

of often during the day, w e 're interested in purchasing new possessio n s.        I a m not talking

about c ra s s m a te ria lism , sim ply basic m iddle-class living.   To those of us who have

p ro p erty , to see other prop erty being destroyed is something that produces a feeling that

this m ust be an irratio n al and m eaningless resp onse, that there is something appalling

about this type of destruction.     It also violates our aesthetic values.     There is a notion we

have of the way in which the world can be made beautiful, ways in which flow er-beds,

statues and tre e s can be se t out to beautify our urban environm ents.      If these a re 'turned on'

it's an attack against our own aesthetic values.


There is also the fact that going out and having a good time is something we know. We

know the attacks on m arijuana use, despite the evidence of the insignificant effects of

som ething like this.   Psychologists and sociologists suggest that attacks on things like this

suggest 'fun m o ra lity ', a lack of se rio u sn ess, a lack of responsibility, a lack of

involvement in the re a l w orld, and a lack of m aturity.


Many people see vandalism as a symptom of all that is sick and rotten, these a re the

’ C assandrine' like views of society which g en eralises from a p a rtic u la r broken telephone

box to m ass in creases in delinquency to the end of our world as we know it today.          So it's
a very potent thing. A broken train window can spark off all so rts of le tte rs commenting

on the decline of civilisation as we and Lord Clarke once knew it. Well is it ? This

violation of values tends to make us see it as m indless, irratio n al and m eaningless.        To

what extent is it any of those things . If we a re to prevent it we want answ ers to those

questions.   This leads us into differentation in motives and meanings.


A few y ears ago I did some work on industrial sabotage.         Very little work had been

done on industrial sabotage and there was good evidence that m illions of pounds a year

w ere being lo st through the activities of employees who system atically, or unsystem atically,

destroyed aspects of th eir workplace, the product itself, the conveyor belt, offices,

whatever.    This looked p retty m eaningless when we sta rted the re se a rc h . We went            ^

and interviewed larg e num bers of industrial w orkers about this to tap the evidence for

its existence and we asked them why they w ere engaged in it.         To cut a long story short

we eventually found that we could distinguish between different so rts of industrial sabotage.

It was not sim ply a m eaingless blowing up although there w ere occasions when it was just

that, a reduction of tension and fru stratio n .   The sudden sense that one couldn't c a rry on

at this job any longer.   It was not therefore an attem pt to change the world, it did not

make their life e a s ie r. What was hit was often a rb itra ry , often the n earest thing in sight.

One had been standing there for six hours engaged in this p articu larly d reary task and

suddenly one blew up and hit the n earest thing in sight. It's possible that many of your

bear the m ark of a sim ila r psychological response.


The second in dustrial sabotage was the u tilitarian version in which attem pts w ere made

through sabotage to make life somewhat e a s ie r.     So for example when we investigated

a carpet factory we found people who recognised that in o rd er to get a few m inutes in which

the whole m achinery would grind to a halt they could cut one of the threads on the m achine.

One thread took a minute to re p a ir so if you wanted ten minutes you simply cut ten, it was

a straightforw ard u tilitarian action.   The other way was causing sm all fire s .    Small fire s

w ere p articu larly popular in one of the facto ries, in which you simply threw a match into
a bin of m ate ria l, shouted " F ire " , and im m ediately the fire brigade o r the fire group

attached to the factory rushed in, everybody else went off to the canteen and had a quick

cup of tea and cam e back la te r on.       Provided it w asn't too often it was a recognised way

of relieving the monotony.


One Thursday afternoon as I was p reparing to go to a factory to interview some w o rk ers,

I had a frhone call from a co-w orker who said not to com e.             I asked why not.      He said

"The factory has burned to the ground".            The whole lot had gone up and disappeared that

afternoon.    Eventually somebody was charged with arso n and he said to the investigating

police, 'I 'm very so rry about th is, I only m eant to s ta r t a sm all f ir e '.     They said, 'Y es,

come along now, of course you d id .' As though the fact that anybody should want to s ta rt

a sm all fire seem ed so stran g e.       In court he said 'I was ju st trying to s ta r t a sm all f ir e '.

The judge said 'I don't know w hat's wrong with you, we've had you examined by

p sy c h iatrists and there seem s to be nothing m entally wrong with you, but you keep saying

you like lighting sm all f ire s .     I can only think you get an unholy th rill out of the sight of

flam es.   Life im p riso n m en t.'


This was ab stracted fro m context.          There was something rendered m eaningless and

irra tio n a l, when it was taken out of context - how could anybody want to s ta r t sm all

fire s ?


We also found evidence of political sabotage - whether deliberate attem pts to gain

control, to challenge authority and to use sabotage as an industrial action. We w ere

always told at school that the Luddites who sm ashed m achinery w ere prim itive vandals.

The historians who have re search ed that a re a have suggested that it was 'collective

bargaining by r i o t . ' In a pre-unionised situation this was one way in which power could

be a s se rte d and statem ents made.       One way in which the impotent could become potent.


We can also find in vandalism m otives and m eanings about the environm ent.                   This is

w here we come into the a re a of differentiation.          F irstly there is acquisitive vandalism .
A g reat deal of vandalism is system atic ’junking’ , collecting and looting. It is in fact

theft and not really vandalism at all and to w rite it off as vandalism is to simply compound

the problem of vandalism and ignore the problem of theft.            Most telephone vandalism is

in fact acquisitive vandalism , broken telephone boxes a re ra re ly simply broken by

children who go in and sm ash it for the fun of it.       They a re m ostly broken into by older

people who a re concerned with theft. It depends in the a re a you live in the extent to which

junking and looting goes on. If you live in a decaying d erelict a re a the chances of it

occurring a re much g re a te r, than if you live in a middle cla ss suburb.


One social psychologist in New York actually left his c a r to see how long it would be before

it was ’junked’ o r bits w ere knocked off it.     He sim ply left it on the s tr e e t, he left the

bonnett open to indicate that it had broken down, then watched from a flat opposite.

Within 24 hours the c a r had virtually disappeared.        People had come along and collected

pieces of it, ty res had gone, people had eventually come along and sm ashed it to b its.

He also tells the story of a friend of his who arriv ed in New York, his c a r stopped, the

lights w ere flickering, he thought it m ust be the b attery.      He got out, lifted the bonnet

and was checking the b attery , he peered round the bonnet and saw somebody taking a

tyre off the back wheel. He said ’What a re you doing with the tyre ?’. The man said ,

'D on't w orry.   You have the b attery , I’ll have the t y r e s .’ We haven’t quite reached that     a

stage yet and B arnsley is s till an am iable place to p ark , com pared to that.


We m ust also talk of tactical vandalism - vandalism in which p a rtic u la r effects a re

d esired . An exam ple of this would be another facet of industrial sabotage where a few

m inutes break would be gained by sm ashing up something.            But also things like breaking

windows to get a night in p riso n o r draw attention to one self.


More im portant is play vandalism .        The attem pt t c create a play environm ent on the s tre e ts

by throwing stones at windows, by using buildings as m ountains, using lift shafts as clubs,

s ta ir s as train s o r w hatever.   Complicated, involved gam es of play involving children up to


                                             10.
about 12 y e a rs old. W hether or not this becom es m ore serio us depends upon the reaction

to it.   It may be that people who attem pt to prevent it set up a reaction that becomes m ore

vindictive.    This play is a very im portant elem ent.          Some people say ’Isn’t it am azing

that some of our vandals a re 12 y e a rs old ?’ But if you investigate what 12 y e a r old vandals

a re doing, in the m ajority of cases play is the em phasis.             That doesn’t mean that in play

property isn ’t destroyed but we’re talking here of motives and meanings and the idea of

the m indless, irra tio n a l, p u rp o seless, se n seless roam ing vandal who m ust be curbed is

one that needs to be undermined when we examine what is being done and the gam es which

a re being played and the way in which vandalism is p a rt and p arcel of the gam es.


Now we m ust add vindictive vandalism .            (Some of these te rm s a re taken from Stan Cohen’s

work on v a n d alism .) Vindictive vandalism is where we’re talking of straightforw ard

revenge, where those who cannot p ro te st about what is happening to them use vandalism

as that form of p ro te st.    There a re many exam ples of N .A .B . windows being sm ashed,

Social Security Offices windows being sm ashed and much m ore common of schools being

broken into and sm ashed. We have not conclusive evidence of this but such evidence that

we have points to a high num ber of children who break into th eir own school and sm ash up

th eir own classro o m s.     There a re many exam ples of cases of people taking it out on

buildings and property as a way of protesting about something which they see as an injustice.


Now we need to talk of another category - personalising the im personal.                    There is very

little difficulty about us having a sense of personal identity. Walking a c ro ss a c a r park

and looking a t all the different types of c a r s , c a rs with stic k e rs on, c a rs with little

name p la te s , c a rs with personalised num ber p la te s , c a rs with p articu lar s o rts of a e r i a l s ,

c a rs with certain so rts of h ead rests, custom ised, personalised c a r s , bigger c a rs than

anybody e ls e , sm a lle r c a r s , fa ste r c a rs than anybody e ls e , 150 indications of some so rt

of p erso n al identity. If I w ere to follow someone home, I would see the way in which his

property and possessio ns autographed his identity around his house, right through the

garden into the house and the way in which a num ber of p erso nal choices put a signature
upon whole aspects of his existence.      I would ask you to think briefly of those people

who a re faced with a greatly m ore im personal environm ent than we have.          Many people

go and stand in tower block a re a s and feel a sense of anonimity and deep depersonalisation

after half an hour, le t alone living th ere, returning there seeing that as a place where

you have to ex ist.   So personalising, the use of g ra ttiti, tlie use of m a rk s, the use of

certain acts of destruction to say ’this is where I liv e ', ’this is my p lace’, ’I did that’ ,

’this is my block of fla ts’. There may be no other way, it may be an ag g ressiv e, a violent

way of scratching yourself acro ss that environm ent, perhaps it's the only way, there a re

not many other ways of gaining your identity.


May I quote an arc h ite c t, who was w riting about an attem pt to acquire possession.      He

w rote, ’to p o ssess something we have to take possession, we have to make it p a rt of

ou rselv es,it is therefore n ecessary to reach out for it.    To p o ssess something we have to

take it in our hands, touch it, test it, put our stam p on it.    Something becom es our

possession because we give it our name or defile it, because it shows tra c e s of our

existence, a way of making the environm ent our own.’


We m ust turn to the final category - m alicious vandalism .      To that vandalism that

com es out of boredom , d esp air, fru stra tio n , out of a need fo r excitem ent for those children

who a re 15 or 17 y e a rs old, where there is a sense of failu re, a re a l sense of hostility,
                                                                                                   A
                                                                                                   w

and w here there is no other way in which excitem ent can be found in this dull environm ent.

Where jobs a re not going to provide any excitem ent, where m arriag e isn ’t g o i n g to provide

much excitem ent, where living conditions a re not going to provide much excitem ent, there

a re not holidays to provide excitem ent.      How with all those things taken away do you show

anybody else who you a re ? With little money, hardly a job,how do you say ’Look at me!

This is me!   I have an identity".


Vandalism provides one way.       Stan Cohen sa y s, "Vandalism is ju st rig h t, it’s the ideal

form of ru le breaking both in expressive and instrum ental te rm s .      If one is looking for

                                         12.
toughness, excitem ent, action and a sense of control then school and work do not provide

the right a re a . " In other words this provides a little bit of contact with the police ,

perhaps a little bit of excitem ent, a little bit of sense of group solidarity (in the m ain

vandalism is a group offence as you know) a little sense of person al identity to those who

have very few other ways of a sse rtin g them.


In relation to that la s t category we have to notice the class of the vandals and we have

to recognise th eir predicam ent. With so much wrong with our cities we seize on the

m indless vandal ra th e r than the apparently ration al, mindful planner.          After a ll, the

public policy we a re talking about here ensures that houses a re spotless while our

public places a re squalid, that our private c a rs a r e im m aculate while our buses and

train s a re m altreated and while a ll our pin neat gardens often depend on our having tipped

the rubbish over the wall. And also the fact that when urban motorways a re built they

plough through the cheapest p ro p erties in our c itie s, and such incidental but im portant

featu res.


F or example Aberfan was not a com m uter village , Ronan Point was not a luxury block -

there a re a m illion and one exam ples we can give of the ways in which dereliction and

neglect and planning in many cases re p re se n t attacks upon this very group who a re then

in turn, turned upon and blamed for the destruction of property in th eir a re a s.


Vandalism, as we know occurs in the m ost im personal of a re a s , usually in public pro perty,

where it is d e relict o r incom plete, on larg e ra th e r than sm all e s ta te s, in higher ra th e r

than lower tower blo ck s, in places where children have been crowded.               If you want a

p red icto r of vandalism , the b est, as Sheena W ilsoa has shown, is the density of, children

within a p a rtic u la r estate.


The vandal created none of those circum stan ces.           However, he responds som etim es in

a playful, som etim es in a utilitarian way, som etim es in a m alicious way to many of those

circum stances.
So I would hope that in your discussions during the day, and I'm grateful to the

o rg an isers who have indicated that they would be pleased if I would go to some of the

sem in ar groups, that some distinctions could be made between types of vandalism .             You

see some of the problem s of not distinguishing a re fairly readily seen.        If for example

you say we need m ore adventure playgrounds and then m ore vandalism occurs you might

say that adventure playgrounds a re n 't the answ er. Well, there may not be any complete

answ er, they may be a p a rtial answ er, but perhaps they a re only a p a rtial answ er to

those who a re vandals because (;hey a re play vandals, but will not be an answ er to those

engaged in m alicious vandalism .     They probably don’t provide much answ er fo r those

involved in personalising vandalism .      Those differentations a re im portant for preventions

because you may say the way we can prevent vandalism in our a re a is by fortifying, to u s ^ j

this p a rtic u la r m aterial, to not allow opportunities for destruction.   Then, in fact, you a re

creatin g in many c a s e s, a fu rth er im personalisation of the environm ent by that very

fortification. As I’ve said its the im personalisation of the environm ent which seem s to

be p articu larly related to that p articu lar vandalism we've described.      So the idea of

one solution to all s o rts of vandalism is a contradiction in te rm s , that is im possible.


I've tried to define the te rm vandalism because there a re different causes fo r each one.

I’ve also said that there is som e sense of ’m oral panic’ over vandalism .        This is not to say

that people should not be concerned about it, but there is a scapegoat available. When w' ei "

see the way in which p re s s coverage deals with the vandal then we need to be very

careful about deciding what the vandal is responsible fo r. We need to pay as much

attention as we would if someone came along and blamed all the problem s of the inner

city upon the p resence of im m igrant com m unities. We need to be absolutely ce rta in that

in fact we a re not using a convenient scapegoat as a substitute for analysing the full nature

of the situation.

                                              D. K. PUMMELL,
                                              Chief A rchitect

GROUP ONE:       Building Design, E state Layout and Management

Leaving aside the sociological asp ects of vandalism which a r e outside the b rief of
this group, a heavy responsibility r e s ts with the designer of buildings and estates
where vandalism is concerned.

It is the designer who, by creating sensible and sym pathetic designs, can m inim ise
the opportunity fo r vandalism by acknowledging the profound effect that design can
have on the quality of life and the environm ent. The creation of a layout which
prom otes responsibility and identification within the community together with the
stim ulation of pride in property and the a re a a s a whole is of param ount im portance
in d eterrin g vandalism .

One im portant facto r is the creation of a ’defensible sp ace' i .e . a space for which
individuals can feel responsible such as a porch o r the traditional fron t garden with
a fence round it. Where such a space e x ists, with a clearly defined boundary for
a ll to see, then a situation is created where people a r e m ore likely to feel responsible
fo r that a re a and accordingly to defend it.  In c o n trast, people seem le s s prepared
to care for anonymous spaces w here no identification exists,such a s the co rrid o rs
and lift a re a s in high ris e developm ents.

Another factor is the phasing of the construction of new developm ents. At p resen t,
it is not uncommon to find completed and occupied houses alongside houses in the
early stages of construction. Such site s, p articu larly where building m a te ria ls can
be found lying around, tend to a ttr a c t vandalism , perhaps because of the tem porary
appearance of dereliction o r d iso rd e r. It is suggested that developments could be
completed in sm all se lf contained sections to m inim ise the tem ptation.

The relationship between the initial capital investm ent and the revenue costs is
another significant facto r faced by the desig ner. C onstraints imposed h the form
of specified building m a te ria ls o r housing densities can produce a design with an
unacceptable potential for vandalism e .g . flim sy m a te ria ls which d e te rio ra te
quickly o r m inim al space for recre atio n al facilities. This often m eans that an
initial reluctance fo r capital Investm ent can re su lt In Increased revenue co sts and
lo st capital investm ent.
A cognisance of the needs and d e s ire s of future u s e rs of developments Is Im portant
fo r d esig n ers. Thus a design which Is com patible with the aspirations and needs of
future resid en ts is param ount in avoiding an unsettled and potentially violent
community. Inherent in this point is the im position of arch itectu ra l concepts such
as G arden Cities or high ris e developm ents.

The design of public facilities and th e ir anonymity creates problem s e .g . parks
buildings and bus stands. T here is no opportunity to create a defensible space
and It se em s that a preventive o r defensive design Is called for.

GROUP 2: The involvement of the Community


Although the title seem ed virtually all em bracing, we trie d in very p ractical ways
to find m eans of combatting the apathy of the public and to awaken in them a sense
of community responsibility and involve them in a concerted effort to counteract the
problem of vandalism .

We discussed the Home Office Standing Com m ittee’s re p o rt together with the points
raised by P ro fe sso r Taylor,ranging over causes and effects and there was unanimous
agreem ent that rem edies to the problem w ere many and varied.

We learned that th ere was very little vandalism In E astern Europe but th ere was no
d ire c t p arallel with B ritain because we do not have the th re a t of a ’S ib eria'. This
together with the fact that there a re seem ingly very few sm iling people in the E astern Bloc
convinced us that we could not recom m end the ra th e r rep ressiv e rem edies which take
place in that p a rt of the w orld. But we a re equally resolved that we do not want a
community based on hedonism and any rem edies to vandalism proposed should be
Implemented In such a way that it would be c le a r to the culprit that there w ere lines of
behaviour in the community beyond which he should not go. Emphasis was placed on
'h e ' because In the Home Office Report it was noted that g irls were much b etter
behaved in re sp e c t of vandalism , indeed they c a rrie d out very few acts of vandalism.

P ro fe s so r T aylo r’s descriptions of the various ac ts of vandalism w ere d lscu ssed :-
Industrlal vandalism , acquisitive, vindictive and irratio n al, but we a r e unhappy when
he quotes Stan Cohen who a sse rte d that 'vandalism Is the ideal form of rule breaking'.
We a re , however, in accord with the view that the s ta r t is In the environm ent and In
the home.

Some p arents a r e avoiding th eir respon sib ilities, the community's conscience Is not
really awakened on the subject and so we looked a t ways and m eans of awakening that
conscience so that action could follow. Accepting that a d e te rre n t Is n ecessary to
check those youngsters who can not learn In any o th er way that they m u st be punished
for doing wrong we tu rn then to m ore positive proposals.

The guidelines of behaviour have become too smudged and the community m ust g e t back
to basics . There is insufficient attention given to Improving the living and working
environm ents of the citizens of the United Kingdom. In this country only one q u a rte r of
the money spent in Europe on appearance and am enity goes on that Im portant p a rt of
developm ent and we feel that when the financial position in the country im proves m ore
should be spent along those lin es.

We re a lise that a t the turn of the twentieth century, th ere w ere le ss c a rs to damage,
le s s saplings to destroy, le ss (pass to break and we took into consideration that the
tem ptations to the younger people today a re g re a te r, as affluence in creases so logically
does the num ber of targ ets fo r vandalism .
The next point touched on was the rem oteness of the a d m in istrato rs. A number of
m em bers of the group feel that these are schism s between the governed and the
governors but we all agree that there a re som e fam ilies who isolate them selves from
the community and ways m u st be found to break down those b a r r ie r s .

Schools could play-a m ore positive role in the community and in promulgating
preventative m easu res and parental resp onsibilities. There should be g re a te r use
made of school facilities on evenings and during school holidays so that m ore benefit
could be derived from the facilities by the community. In some a re a s where play
schem es a re run by local volunteers, it was pointed out in no uncertain te rm s that
adventure playgrounds a re not a good way of tringing the community togethe r and
preventing vandalism . There is a need to s tr e s s to the community that such facilities
belong to them and not the im personal 'A uthority'.

Some victim s of vandalism a re afraid to re p o rt to the police for fe a r that if th eir
nam es become known there could be fu rth er acts of vandalism by way of revenge.
We suggest that plaintiffs' o r in fo rm ers' nam es in such cases should be treated as
confidential and not disclosed indiscrim inately.                                             ^

We feel th ere is an initiative to be taken by local auth orities. We w ere encouraged
by the steps taken to publicise the cost of making good acts of vandalism , and we
note p articu larly that the Rotherham Borough Council ra te demand contains a section
relating to the money expended on making good acts of vandalism .

However, publicity m u st be p a rt of an anti-vandal ism campaign and needs to be handled
in a very professional way. Lines of communication to the authorities m ust be clearly
laid down and widely known. A num ber of ex perim ents in selected a re a s of South
Y orkshire could be undertaken, subject to careful m onitoring, on the lines of those in
the sixties in the juvenile delinquency field.

Local a \ t h o rities should take an initiative in setting up local community action
com m ittees in selected a r e a s . The com m ittees should com prise resid en ts ‘o f the
a re a , served by officers of the County and D istrict authorities with a budget for
employing skilled advertising agencies. The will to improve conditions in an a re a
m ust come from the inhabitants and local authorities should be on hand to give as
m uch a ssista n ce as possible while maintaining a low profile.

Publicity is very im portant indeed, being seen as the only way to g e t down to the
g r a s s roots of the problem and our recom m endation of this 'sh arp -en d ' approach in
selected a re a s would, it was hoped, involve all agencies, p articu larly those in the
voluntary field.

T here w ere m isgivings, obviously, voiced by some m em bers of the group as to
where the re so u rc e s would come from , but we feel that they should be found. Some
m oderate outlay in this field m ay well repay itse lf sev eral tim es over.

We conclude by stressin g that ju st as there a r e many fecets to the problem of
vandalism th ere a r e equally as many avenues of approaching the subject; each with
the overall aim of making South Y orkshire a b e tte r place in which to live.
GROUP 3: The Police Approach                            GROUP LEADER:
                                                        R. S. BARRATT, E sq .,
                                                        Chief Constable,
                                                        South Y orkshire Police


 The group believe that there is a considerable amount of police support for the role
of the police in the vandalism situation and for what they a re doing.

 The group w hilst appreciating the difficulty in establishing the size of the problem
 nevertheless recognise that th e re is a serious problem which is causing a g reat
 deal of concern among thinking people.


We encountered what many people will reg ard as a hardy annual - the inadequacy of the
num bers of policem en - but value the preventive patrolling aspect of police work.
Though appreciating that the Panda C ar has been introduced fo r good reasons it is still no
substitute for the m an on the beat, and it is in the preventive patrolling field that the
police believe so much m ore needs to be done.


The police feel that they a re increasingly only responding to situations and not doing
as m uch as they would like in te rm s of actual physical preventive patrolling.


The group would like to see liaison with the public developing even m ore than a t the
m om ent but this again is one of the problem s resulting from the shortage of m en on
foot who have got tim e to see what is going on, find out what is going on and take the
appropriate action.


R ather than police officers entering schools a fte r an a c t of vandalism has occurred,
the group would like to see a g re a te r police presence   in the schools as p a rt of the
norm al pro cess of education, being involved, perhaps, in courses on civics. The
School Liaison Officer stated that the frequency of v isits to schools by the police a re
not as often as they would wish, partially because of th e ir lim ited num ber, but also
because entry is by invitation and not all Head T eachers want to see police officers
within th e ir schools.


T here is a need to extend the school liaison serv ice into the youth clubs, since much of
the vandalism which occurs is attributed to teen ag ers, but because of insufficient
m anpower this cannot be done during working hours.         Officers are therefore encouraged,
on a sem i-official b asis, to become involved but they need to be of the right age and
tem peram ent.                           i«
P aren tal responsibility needs to be em phasised and again the group would like to see
m ore police involvement in the education of parents ju st as m uch as in the education of
their children since it is often the lack of parental discipline and control which leads to
vandalism.


To g et a cro ss the m essage of the cost to society there was a suggestion to include an
item on the rate demand notice showing ju st what ratepay ers a re paying for vandalism
in ju st the sam e way as they a re shown what they a re paying in term s of schools.


There was agreem ent that the police need the support of the public if they a re going to be
m ore effective in dealing with acts of vandalism.        We do not really see that the public
can      hide behind a cloak of anonymity because in many cases the principal witness is
going to be the person who actually sees the damage happen and will be known in many
cases to the m isc re a n ts.


An exam ple which was quoted in fact was of a s tre e t where all the s tr e e t lights w ere shot
out and clearly someone would have seen o r certainly m u st have heard som ething. Yet vdien
residenfe in that s tr e e t were questioned on the following dqy after the damaged lam ps had been
found, no-one was prepared to come forward and say that they had seen o r heard anything.
Without active public support, and without the public giving the police a hand, the police
cannot do very m uch m o re in bringing people before the courts.


Though the othergroups have alsodealtw ith this aspect, we v\antto emphasize m ost strongLythat
vandalism is not ju st a job fo r the police se rv ice.   B asically the police a re th ere to h e l^ }
c le a r up the afterm ath but there a re many other facets to this p a rtic u la r problem .


Ideally the police need to be seen about m ore, p articularly on foot.
 They need to im prove th eir education effort to g et the m essage
 a c ro ss not only to children, but to a wider public so as to obtain a ra th e r wider
public support than they a re getting a t the m om ent, because without such help
the police cannot be as effective. Vandalism is not ju st a problem fo r the police in
uniform , but is a problem fo r the community as a whole.

GROUP 4: The attitude of the Courts


Although our discussions produced a wide divergence of opinions there a re some
aspects of our subject on which there is general agreem ent. We em phasise that
M agistrates find them selves in a difficult situation; they a re necessarily dealing
with circum stances where vandalism has already occu rred. When offenders have
alread y been caught and eventually appear before a court fo r sentencing. This
produces lim its within which M agistrates have to operate.

The question of sentencing was obviously one which attracted m uch discussion.
We em phasise that there a re no inflexible ru les laid down for m a g istra te s. They
a r e th ere to adjudicate on each individual case and m ake a judgement in the
p a rtic u la r circum stances. T here was a suggestion from one of our m em bers
that there should be a 'parking tick et' or fixed o r minimum penalty type of sentence but
this did not find g eneral agreem ent. We agreed that each case had to be dealt with on its
m e rits and that fines a re a d e te rre n t. If m ag istrates feel that they can impose an adequate
fine on an offender then that is sufficient. But M agistrates a re dealing with not only the
offence and punishment but the offender also and aiming for his refo rm . We accordingly
re je c t any suggestion that there is a need to change existing legislation. In doing so we
draw attention to the m o st recen t bill before parliam ent which if ca rrie d into law, will
provide for adults to be fined up to a maximum of £1, 000.
We agreed that people should be made to realise the physical effects of vandalism
and destruction. In the case of juveniles we feel that this can be achieved by
obliging offenders, eith er physically or m onetarily, to re p a ir the damage which
has been caused. A lternatively offenders should be required to perform some
form of serv ice to help them re a lise the seriousn ess of th eir actions; the
Community Service approach. Although the idea of offenders reporting to
attendance centres appeals generally, this approach is re stric te d by the shortage
of finance.

On the question of compensation we feel that where It is applied for - and this
does not always happen - and granted by the Court as p art of the penalty then this
provides a useful d e te rre n t. We feel that whenever compensation is applied for
it should be gran ted. We see som e problem s here regarding poorer fam ilies
where they cannot afford to payftnes and compensation. But we feel that w herever
possible, a t le a s t a minim al fine should be imposed.

A larg e p a rt of vandalism is caused by juveniles and we feel that parents need to
be involved as much as possible. We need to draw to th e ir attention the seriousn ess
of th eir children's actions. We feel that this parental involvement can be secured
by requiring them to appear in court when th eir children appear as a re s u lt of acts
of vandalism .

Inevitably, some of us feel very strongly that corporal punishm ent should in some
way be re-in trodu ced. A fter a lengthy discussion the m ajority of us re je c t this.
We a re also opposed to the Introduction of a specific offence to deal only with
vandalism .
We felt considerable concern at the delay in court appearances; th ere is often a
lapse of 12 weeks o r longer before a court appearance. We feel that this tends
to d etract from the seriousness of the offence and that speedier court appearances
can serv e as a d e te rre n t to vandalism .

We think that the media a re im portant in that they can m itigate ag ainst the whole
concept of trying to reduce vandalism by exaggerating som e exam ples of it.
F u rth erm o re, we find that the media only ra re ly publicise the sentences which are
Imposed by the Courts as a re s u lt of vandalism . The railw ays a t one tim e tried
to publicise by pictures, the kind of vandalism that was taking place only to find that
some people who had not thought of it copied the acts of vandalism shown. We
accordingly re je c t any campaign of this kind. We do feel, however, that some
discussion with the media on th e ir approach to vandalism m ight be useful. If it
becomes generally known that Courts a re imposing quite sev ere sentences as a
re su lt of vandalism this this will provide a d eterren t.

We concluded our discussion on the sam e note as we started; Courts deal with cases
where vandalism has already been comm itted but we do want to ex press some views
to those concerned m ore d irectly with the prevention of vandalism . Some of us felt
that som e p arents h ate opted out Of th eir responsibilities and failed to g et a c ro ss to
th eir children that th ere is a righ t and wrong. Education can strengthen the role of
the fam ily and give the support which Is often needed by young people who feel quite
Insecure o r who a re deprived In any way. Whilst the M agistrate is prim arily
concerned with adjudicating on com missioned offences we feel that the way in which
they do this can provide a d e terren t. M agistrates have, we feel, a very positive
role to play.

and which have resu lted in a steady im provem ent in the situation, have been the
construction of a ll-s te e l coinbox equipment; the introduction of 24-hour fluorescent
lighting; fine w ire m esh sc re e n s to cover glazing; steel plates to replace g lass
in lower windows; acry lic o r polycarbonate panels in place of g lass; strengthened
handsets with steel conductor cords and re c e sse d dials to make rem oval difficult.
T h e end re su lt is by no m eans unsightly and the additional cost is fully justified
by the saving in labour and m a te ria ls used in making good the alm o st inevitable
and constant damage to the old type of equipment; m o reover the public se rv ice which

               HOOLIGANISM AT FOOTBALL MATCHES

               Thank you for your letter of 2nd November 1977* the substance of which has been

               County Hall, B arnsley ; 24th Novem ber, 1977

NOTE OF AN INFORMAL MEETING BETWEEN FOOTBALL HOOLIGANISM
WORKING PARTY AND SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB LTD.

PRESENT: Councillor R. ThwaLtes (in the Chair)
              Councillors J . Brough and W. C ircuit
              O fficers J . C. H a rris , R, P e te rs , D. Vaughan,
Apologies for absence w ere received from Councillor A. Waugh and
A ssistan t Chief Constable I, Mead.
              R epresenting the Club
             M r. E, B arron (D irector)
An apology for absence was received from M r. K. T. Addy, the other
D irecto r who had intended to be p resen t.

1 ._____ Introduction

The Chairm an welcomed M r. B arron on behalf of the Working P a rty and
thanked the Club for responding so read ily to the invitation to m eet the Working
P a rty . It was understood th at this p a rtic u la r m eeting was to be on an inform al
basis and could not com m it the Club a t this stage to any p a rtic u la r course of
action.

2 .____ Working P a rty ’s R eport

The Working P a rty ’s R eport, as approved by the County Council on 28th
Septem ber, 1977, was d iscu ssed . It was evident that th ere w ere la rg e a re a s
of ag reem ent, but the Club felt th at they would have to re se rv e th e ir position
on the questions of the designation of the Stadium under the Safety of Sports
Grounds A ct, B75, a n d who should be responsible for com pensation (covered by
insurance) for person al injury and dam age to p rop erty .

Tie C hairm an s tre s s e d that the call for legislatio n to give County A uthorities the
g en eral power to ban proposed sporting events was intended to be a re se rv e
power to be used as a la s t r e s o r t to cover exceptional circum stances where
arran g em en ts w ere c learly inadequate, and hopefully, would never be req u ired to
be e x e rc ise d . The la s t thing the County Council wished to see was the clo su re of
the Stadium.

3.     League Cup M atch - 29th N ovem ber, 1977

W hilst it was appreciated that the League Cup M atch on 29th N ovem ber, 1977
with E verton was not an a ll-tic k e t m atch and was unlikely to a ttr a c t a maximum
capacity crowd, possible co u rses of action w ere discussed which could be
tre a te d a s experim ents fo r future capacity m atches.
4.      Becommendations

That, in consultation with the Police and the Club, the following p o ssib ilities
where capacity crowds a r e expected be investigated

(a)    the opening of the g ates as e a rly as possible before a m atch so that
        the fans do not have any reaso n to congregate in the vicinity of the
        stadium ;

(b)    the ra il and coach o p erato rs be requested to en su re com pliance with
        the recom m endation of the M in ister of Sport th at a rriv a ls should be
        tim ed as close as possible to the com m encem ent of m atches and
        d ep artu res a s soon a s possible a fte r the cessatio n of m atches;

(c)    the clo su re, to both vehicular and p ed estrian traffic, of s tre e ts in
        "The T rian g le" (Vere, Fielding and B lckerton Boads) and possibly
        Leake and F arndale Boads (off Leppings Lane) because of consistent
        conap lain ts by local resid en ts;

(d)    the erectio n of d irection al signs (according to tick et num bers) in the
        vicinity of the ground, a s well as directions on the tickets them selv es.

    D ear Councillor,

    Hooliganism at Football Matches

    A t the req u est of the Chairm an of the Working P arty , the Sheffield Wednesday
    Football Club w ere requested to m eet the Working P a rty fairly quickly and
    preferably before the League Cup Match between the Club and Everton on the
    29th Novem ber.

    W hilst the Chairm an of the Club and certain D irecto rs will not be available
    until after 10th D ecem ber, they have suggested that two of th eir D irecto rs
    (Mr. K .T . Addy and M r. E. Barron) could m eet the Working P a rty to d iscuss
    m atte rs of m utual in te re st on the understanding that at this stage they cannot
    com m it the Club in any way.

    I re g re t the extrem ely short notice, but in the circum stances a meeting between
    the Working P a rty and the two Club D irecto rs has been arranged (with the
    approval of the Chairm an of the Working P arty ) fo r 4.00 p .m . tom orrow ,
    Thursday, 23rd November in the 6th F loor Conference Room, A dm inistration
    Building, County Hall, B arn sley .

    Attached fo r your inform ation is a copy ctf the R eport of the Working P arly , as
    approved a t the County Council on 28th Septem ber, together with a copy of a
    recently published R eport of a Scottish Working Group on Football Crowd Behaviour.

    I would mention that all the recom m endations of the County C ouncil's Working
    P a rty have been followed up, but not all of the persons and bodies contacted have
    yet replied .

REPORT OF WORKING PARTY RELATING
TO HOOLIGANISM AT SOCCER MATCHES

1.   The problem of H ooliganism and Vandalism at Soccer M atches h as been brought
      to a head in South Y o rkshire with the trouble caused during and a fter the F .A .
      Cup S em i-F inal m atch between M anchester United and Leeds United held a t the
      Sheffield Wednesday Football Club G rcund e a r lie r th is y ear, and in view of that
      trouble, there should be no m ore S em i-F inal m atches in South Y ork sh ire u ntil the
     hooliganism problem has been b eaten .

2.   I t m ust be em phasised at the outset that the P o lice did a m agnificent job both
       in the forw ard planning and in policing on the day and no c ritic is m of them is
       intended by th is re p o rt. However, a num ber of trouble m ak ers in the crowd
      attending the m atch caused dam age, injury and some a larm to the public and,
      unfortunately, the public have come to expect a c e rtain type of behaviour from
       Soccer m atches of th is s o rt and, in p a rtic u la r, to expect it from those involving
       ce rta in clubs.

3.   T he Working P a rty consider that the m atter m ust be tackled on a National level
      a t the ro o t cause of the problem . C en tral G overnm ent m ust face up to the
      problem and tackle the causes a t the root.

4.   W hilst the problem needs to be tackled on a N ational level and m ay take som e
     tim e to solve, the W orking P a rty co n sid er that they owe a duty to the people
     of South Y orkshire to take im m ediate action to prevent wanton violence, damage
     e tc . asso ciated with football hooliganism which people of South Y o rk sh ire, be they
     football fans o r otherw ise, generally deplore.

5.   On this b asis the South Y orksh ire County Council c a lls fo r legislation to give
     them the pow er to ban any proposed sporting event w ithin South Y orkshire w here
     they, having considered a ll the inform ation and evidence available to them ,
     co n sid er th e re to be a r e a l danger that p erso n s attending o r attem pting to attend
     the event w ill cause injury o r dam age to p erson s and p ro p erty o r cause fe a r or
     a larm to the re sid e n ts in the vicinity where the proposed event is to take place.

6.   It is co nsidered that the approach coupled with a re a listic use of the pow er does
      not run away from the ro o t cause n o r does it move the problem onto someone
      e ls e s do o rstep in that the pow ers should be available to a ll County A uthorities.

7.   The Working P a rly have considered the effect of the Safety of Sports Grounds
     A ct 1975, in p a rtic u la r Section 10, and feel th at the Act h as little relevance to
     hooliganism and no relevance to events taking place outside the ground and thus
     co n sid er th at th is A ct does not contain the n e c e ssa ry leg islativ e pow ers now
     re q u ire d . They nonetheless consider that the pow er of the S ecretary of State to
     designate a stadium under Section 1 should be e x ercised m uch m o re freely so that
     a ll stad ia w here larg e crow ds could be attra c te d a re autom atically and p ro p erly
     brought into those arran g em en ts, a s only in th is way can the County Council be
     sa tisfie d that within the ground p ro p er action has been taken. F u rth e rm o re the
     Working P a rty co nsider that Hillsborough Football Stadium should be specifically
     designated under Section 1 of the 1975 Act.

8.     The Working P arly went on to consider a num ber of o th er m a tte rs connected with
       s o c c e r hooliganism .

        (a) The num ber of unruly p erso n s attending so c c e r m atches looking fo r trouble
            is a m inority of the total attendance.             it is likely th at these p erso n s a re
            not "su p p o rte rs" of th e ir declared team bu t u se the so c c e r m atch as an excuse
            fo r violence and vandalism .

        (b) Separation of fans before during and a fte r the m atch should allev iate problem s,
            in p a rtic u la r the policing.
                                                  ♦                        •                      4
                                              *

        (c) The co st involved can be m easu red in ex tra policing, dam age to p ro p erly both
            public and p riv ate, and p erso n al in ju ries including am bulance and m edical
            attendances.

       (d )' Hooliganism and intoxicating drink in m any c a se s go hand in hand.

       (e) Many fans tu rn       at m atches without tickets and when unable to obtain tic k e ^ ^
           a r e natu rally disgruntled. This fru stra tio n m ay find an outlet in physical
           violence.

9 ....... T he m a tte rs considered in the preceding p arag ra p h m e rit am plification i n ...............
          consideration of the pow ers now called fo r by the County Council.

       (a) The unruly m inority can be tackled on two fro n ts. F i r s t th e ir exclusion from
           grounds and special tra n sp o rt, secondly th e ir identification if they do a rriv e
           afcthe ground w hether o r not they gain adm ission.

             (i)    exclusion of the unruly elem ent could be p artially achieved by s tr ic t
                     control of tic k e t allocation especially a t all advance tick et events.
                     T ickets to bonafide club su p p o rters (on the lin e s now operated by
                     so m e clubs) coupled with exclusion from special coaches and tra in s
                     of those without tick ets may discourage so c c e r hooligans who a re
                     attem pting to get to away m atches.

             (ii)   identification of the unruly elem ent can a s s is t the police in preventing
                     trouble arisin g .


        (b) Separation of fans during and a fte r the m atches is already p ra c tise d eg.
            coaches of fans arriv in g sho rtly befo re kick off a t se p a ra te en tran ces
            e tc . High fences inside the grounds to se p a ra te fans can cause problem s
            esp ecially w here coupled with stag g ered r e le a s e of fans; the problem s include
            f ir e and safety facto rs p a rtic u la rly w here fans w ishing to get out push the
            crow d in front, quite a p a rt from the legal co nsideratio ns of claim s of false
            Im prisonm ent. It m ust also be ap p reciated th a t putting people in "cages"
            m ay aggravate the problem s eg. dam age caused when fans b reak out. T icket
            allocation control can a s s is t also with sep aration of fans but much depends
            upon the stadium layout, in p a rtic u la r the num ber and location of en tra n c e s/e x its
                                   - 3 -


      (c) Policing inside the so c c e r ground is paid fo r by the club but policing outside
          is not. At the M anchester /L e e d s S em i-F inal th e re w ere four tim es as many
          po lice outside the ground as th e re w ere inside. The co sts of these e x tra
          police (many loaned from o th er fo rces) falls on public funds. Those p rim a rily
          resp onsible fo r the c o st of dam aged p ro p erty and injury to people a r e those
          causing such dam age and injury (although the co st of am bulances,hospital and
          m edical treatm en t is usually irreco v erab le). However, quite ap a rt from the
          difficulties involved in identifying the individuals concerned,those suffering
          from acts of violence and vandalism will generally p u rsu e any rem edy
          ag ain st a guaranteed so u rce of finance r a th e r than the individual p e rp e tra to rs
          who m ay be "m en of stra w ". In consequence, fo r p ro p erty damage th e claim
          is m ade under the p ro vision s relatin g to r io t and fo r p ersonal in ju rie s under
          the C rim inal Injuries Com pensation Schem e,and hence again the burden falls
          on public funds. The Working P a rty how ever, con sid ered that the c o s t of
          all these m atters should fall upon those resp o n sib le fo r attractin g such a
          la rg e crowd in the f ir s t place, although w hether this should be the Football
          A ssociation, th e Home Ground o r the Team s involved in the m atches may
          need som e fu rth e r investigation.

      (d) Drink should be banned a t Football Grounds, on Special Soccer T rain s and
          Coaches, and d iscussions with M ag istrates/L icen ced V ictu allers/B rew eries and
          a ll other in terested parties should be initiated to see w hether the closing of public
          houses /o ff licences in the vicinity of the grounds on the day of sp e cial m atches
          could be achieved.

      (e)   TV) avoid disgruntled fans who a r e unable to obtain tickets re so rtin g to
            hooliganism and vandalism , every effort should b e m ad e to discourage persons
            attending without tick ets. This involves again the C lu b /B ritish B ail/C oach
            O perators in a co -ord in ated effo rt to se e th at tick et allocations and tra n sp o rt
            of tick et holding fans produces the d esired re su lt.

10.   The pow ers now sought by the County Council should not be ex ercised in an oppressive
      m anner and indeed som e bu ilt in checks (eg. appeal to a M agistrates Court) would
      be p erfectly acceptable. In addition th e re should be pow er to the Council to waive
      any prohibition notice upon re c e ip t of sa tisfacto ry assu ran ces and guarantees
      (breach of which should c a r ry sanctions). Such assu ra n c e s and guarantees would
      v ary in accordance with the circu m stan ces but m ay well include:-

      (a) S trict control of tic k e t allocation, distribution and sale.

      (b) Code of pro ced u res and conduct to be o p erated by coach firm s.

      (c) F ull com pliance within the grounds of all anti-hooliganism m easu res proposed
          by the Police.

      (d) Paym ent (covered by insurance) by the re le v a n t club of all police, am bulance,
          m edicalf hospital co sts and com pensation fo r p erso n al injury and p ro p e rly damage

      (e) Control of supply of liq uor on the m atch day.~
                                                -4 -

11.    It is appreciated that the m ajority of Football fans a re law abiding citizen s and
       m ay oppose such rad ical pow ers a s those now suggested, but it is hoped that people
       w ill accept that the County Council m ust deal with a ll fans according to the sam e
       ru le s and no doubt those who a re law abiding w ill ap p reciate the n ecessity for
       the m e asu res now proposed and accept the inherent re stric tio n s on personal lib erty
       in the realisatio n that if the m easu res a re su ccessfu l a ll w ill accordingly benefit.

12.    The Working P arty also considered the penalties fo r the various offences caused by

    REPORT OF THE
WORKING GROUP ON
        FOOTBALL
          CROWD
       BEHAVIOUR

       Edinburgh   Her Majesty's Stationery Office
                           IN T R O D U C T I O N
Dear Secretary of State,
  In October 1976 you asked me to chair a Working Group on Football Crowd
Behaviour with the following terms o f reference:
      "To consider the problems caused by some Scottish football supporters
    and to make recommendations to the Scottish Football Association and
    other organisations concerned” .             ;
 I now have much pleasure in presenting the report of the Working Group
which, I am happy to say, represents our unanimous view.

  We met on 11 occasions and took written evidence from 23 organisations and
individuals and oral evidence from 35 (see Appendices A and B). We are
grateful to all of them for their ready co-operation, their understanding of the
problem and their willingness to help us in our task. We also wish to thank all
those members o f the public, too numerous to mention, who sent in their sugges­
tions for our consideration.

   Very early in the course o f our deliberations we became aware of the great
public interest in our task and o f the very genuine concern of all who wrote and
spoke to us about the problem o f crowd violence and the effect it is having on
th e sport of football in this country.

   There is no simple solution to the problem; it is but one of the manifestations
o f anti-social behaviour besetting society in general today. We have however
in our findings arrived at a number o f conclusions and recommendations which
we hope, given a commitment to implement them on the part o f all those most
closelv concerned, will go some way towards reducing the problem o f hooligan­
ism at football matches and by so doing turn football grounds once again into
places o f entertainment where parents can take thsir children to enjoy, in
relative comfort and safety, the pleasures o f our national game.

   At your invitation we shall continue to meet from time to time to review the
 results of our recommendations and, if necessary, to consider further recom­
 mendations as appropriate.
                                                      Yours sincerely,

                                                      FRAN K McELHONE

 within grounds that they should be served in plastic or paper containers,

 vicinity of a ground should consider closing their premises prior to the start of
 certain matches and on each occasion delay the reopening until the match is over

 8. That in the event of our recommendations about the control of alcohol taking
 effect and bringing about a significant reduction in crowd violence at football
                                          xi
matches, consideration should be given by the clubs, in consultation with the
football authorities and the police, to the possibility of introducing, as an experi­
ment, facilities within selected grounds for the sale of beer and lager in plastic
containers at properly staffed and regulated bars. (Paragraph 36)

order to achieve speedy admission. (Paragraphs 50 and 51)


14. That where separation of rival supporters is carried out at the turnstiles in
terms of the foregoing recommendation it should be continued inside the ground
by the erection of radial or other physical barriers. (Paragraph 52)


15. That to prevent invasion of the playing area by spectators a physical barrier
should be erected with accesses for use in emergencies. (Paragraph 53)


16. That to ensure the orderly dispersal of rival supporters, separation should be

                                         xii
17. That coaches carrying rival supporters to a match, the majority of which are
generally clearly identifiable, should be effectively separated and parked as near

or at least for the current available space being maintained, around football stadia.
(Paragraphs 55-56)

associated with football hooliganism, and in respect of persistent offenders, should
normally impose imprisonment without option. (Paragraphs 62-64)


 20. That to provide an additional or alternative punishment, reporting centres
 should, when financial reso u rces permit, be set up for persons found to have
 committed offences connected with' hooliganism at football matches. Offenders

 to visit the grounds to meet the players for talks on the game in general and good
 sportsmanship in particular. (Paragraphs 72-73)

           W O R K IN G GROUP ON FOOTBALL
                   CROWD BEHA VIO UR
                                     PART I

A PPO IN TM EN T
   1. We were appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland on 9 November
1976 and held our first meeting in Edinburgh on 26 November 1976. Since then
we have held 11 meetings in Glasgow and Edinburgh.

  2. In presenting this report we have carried out our remit in so far as we can
at this stage. Nevertheless we think it will be desirable to meet from time to
time to review the results of our recommendations, and if necessary to consider
further recommendations as appropriate. Throughout this report our references
to football extend only to the game of association football.


The Problem
    3. It is generally accepted that over the past few years violence and hooligan­
ism at football matches has been on the increase and is spreading throughout
the various levels of the game. Reports o f incidents o f ro w d y behaviour at
junior matches are now as common-place as those which take place at our
senior grounds. The rise in hooliganism at football matches appears to keep
pace with the increase in violence and vandalism generally, but because of its
association with football it probably attracts more than its due share of pub­
 licity both in the press and on television. It is regrettable that the good name of
 football should be disgraced because o f the hooligan element in our society.

  4. A hooligan is a hooligan no m atter where he operates and the fact that his
behaviour is conspicuous at a football match has very often nothing to do with
the game itself. To m a n y hooligans football grounds provide the theatres where
they can indulge in exhibitionist violence and be sure o f an audience. A footbaii
ground is a convenient site for the activities of hooligans because of the com­
parative safety from possible detection which a large crowd provides.

   5. Hooliganism is doing a great deal of harm to football; many decent
people are no longer prepared to have their Saturday afternoon entertainment
spoiled by hooligans with the result that attendances at matches are falling.
Young people too are staying away from matches, many on the advice of their
parents who have no wish to see their children hurt or involved in incidents
which are nowadays only too common a feature at football grounds. Those
connected with the future of football are deeply concerned that the pleasure of
the majority of football supporters is being spoiled by the irresponsible behaviour
o f a small minority o f individuals and groups, most o f whom are young people.

    6. Rowdyism is o f course not confined solely to football matches. It occurs
 in other places o f entertainment e.g. in public houses and dance halls, but for the
                                          1
purpose of this report we have confined our consideration to those aspects of the
problem which are directly associated with football.

   7. The problem, therefore, is how to reduce or at least contain the incidence
of hooliganism at football matches without restricting the pleasure o f the
majority o f supporters. We know that this kind of behaviour is not confined to
the grounds alone but includes offences committed before and after matches
in the streets and on public transport and is especially likely at the latter stage
if the result is not to the liking o f the “ away” fan. In this connection a survey
carried out by the Strathclyde Police Statistics Branch, reproduced at Appendix
C, is of interest. We recognise that drinking, especially under-age drinking, is a
major factor triggering-off many kinds o f anti-social, and in some cases
criminal, behaviour and we think that the problems we have been considering
would be considerably reduced if less alcohol were consumed. We have more
to say about this later in our report.


Field of Inquiry
   8. A t our first meeting we discussed the problem and decided to take a
comprehensive view o f the situation and seek to produce a number of practical
suggestions. We recognised that from an economic viewpoint it was im portant to
find solutions to the problem of violence. The impression created by some
sections o f the press and in some radio and TV programmes that violence was a
common feature of life in Scotland did little to encourage employers and
employees to move from the south to Scotland.

  9. We were asked to take account o f the recommendations of the Working
Party on Crowd Behaviour chaired by M r. Denis Howell and to consider their
appropriateness to the situation in Scotland. The Safety of Sports Grounds
Act 1975 also has a bearing on the problem since a number of the recom­
mendations of the Howell Working Party is now incorporated in a revised
edition of the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds—known as the “ Green
Code”—issued by the Home Office and the Scottish Home and Health
Department.

   10. We decided to visit a number of football stadia in Scotland to
arrangements made for crowd control; to attend a number of football m a llle s
in Scotland including a Rangers/Celtic game and others at smaller grounds
where the visiting club support greatly outnumbered that o f the home team;
to visit an English ground, preferably Wembley Stadium, to study its physical
lay-out and the facilities for the sale of alcohol to spectators; and to attend the
Stadium for the England v. Scotland international match on 4 June 1977 to
observe the behaviour of Scottish fans en route to the match, inside the ground
(on the terracing) and dispersing after the match. A record of our visits is set
out at Appendix D and a note of our observations at Wembley on 4 June at
Appendix E. We agreed that it would be im portant to examine not only ways
o f controlling football crowds and of dealing with offences but also ways of
educating supporters, especially the young ones.

   11. Since there has been a good deal of theorising about causes of, and cures
for, football violence, sometimes by people with little experience o f the game,
                                        2
vve decided to seek the views of as wide a range of individuals and bodies with
a close interest in the game as time and circumstances permitted. We approached
a number of individuals and organisations from whom useful evidence could be
expected and, through the press, invited anyone who wished to give us their
views, to do so. Over 70 “ punters” responded to this invitation, 4 of whom
3 men and 1 girl—were interviewed.

   12. In the following paragraphs we consider inter alia earlier recommenda­
tions about football hooliganism and recent legislation about football grounds;
the arrangements at football grounds and in their vicinity and for transporting
supporters to and from matches; the influence o f alcohol on the behaviour of
supporters and what might be done to control its consumption before and
during football matches; the contribution to reducing hooliganism which might
be made by public authorities, by organisations concerned with football and
by the clubs themselves; and finally a number o f social issues including punitive
and educative measures relevant to the problem of hooliganism.

   13. Our recommendations are brought out in the course of our discussion
but for ease of reference these are summarised at the beginning o f our report on
pages (xi)-(xvii) with references to the appropriate paragraph(s) in the body
o f the report.


M r. Denis Howell’s Working Party on Crowd Behaviour
  14. In starting our deliberations we reviewed the recommendations o f the
Working Party on Crowd Behaviour which was set up in M arch 1974 under the
Chairmanship of Mr. Denis Howell, Minister o f State at the Department o f the
Environment with responsibility for sport. The recommendations o f that W ork­
ing Party were issued in the form of a circular to the football league clubs at the
beginning of the 1976/77 football season. This circular, which is reproduced at
Appendix F has now, through the offices o f the Scottish Football Association,
been circulated to all clubs in the Premier and First and Second Divisions in
Scotland. We have noted the recommendations of the Hov.eil Working Party,
some of which form the basis of our own consideration of Scottish problems.
We have however based our conclusions on an examination o f the situation in
Scotland.


 Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
    15. In considering ways in which anti-social behaviour at football matches
 might be reduced, we studied the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. This Act
 implements the main recommendations of the Report of the Inquiry into Crowd
 Safety at Sports G rounds prepared by Lord Wheatley (Cmnd 4952) following
 the Ibrox disaster in 1971 and its main provisions are concerned with ensuring
 standards o f safety for spectators at any sports stadium designated by the
 Secretary o f State. In Scotland the designated grounds are those belonging to
 the clubs who form (or in previous years have played in) the Premier Division
 o f the Scottish Football League, together with the international football and
 rugby grounds at Hampden and Murrayfield. Each designated stadium requires
 a safety certificate which is issuable by the Regional Council in response to an
 application by the club, in terms o f a procedure set out in regulations made under
                                          3
the Act. In dealing with applications for safety certificates the Regional Councils
are asked to have regard to the safety standards set out in the non-statutory
Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (the “ Green Code” ) drawn up on the lines
suggested in the Wheatley Report.

   16. The Green Code, which is a voluntary code, contains two quite distinct
kinds of advice. First, it offers, as a guide, a range o f safety standards in the
matters to which Lord Wheatley gave attention in his Report and secondly, it
incorporates a section devoted to the recommendations o f the Howell Working
Party which are directed chiefly to the clubs themselves. These recommendations
relate in the main to measures for the improvement o f conditions’which are
unsatisfactory and likely to lead to disturbances among the crowd or which
make them more difficult to contain. Although the recommendations in this
section o f the Green Code were compiled in an English context, we consider
that they are relevant also for Scotland, and indeed a number of our own
recommendations take a similar line. The local authorities, when d ete rm ^ B ^
the spectator limits and othev conditions.to which safety certificates are t^T>e
subject, are expected to have regard to the safety standards in the first category
and to such o f the recommendations in the second category as they consider
relate to securing “ reasonable safety” in terms o f section 2(1) o f the Act.

   17. The Regional Councils as the local authorities in Scotland responsible
for the issue of safety certificates, have already had discussions with the clubs
and with other appropriate bodies and authorities, including the police, about
the measures designed for improving spectator safety set out in the Guide to
Safety at Sports Grounds. Because o f the fears expressed by some football clubs
that the authorities (officials and elected members) might be inclined to apply
the guidelines in the Green Code in too rigid a manner, we had a meeting with
officials of Strathclyde Regional Council whose responsibility extends to 8
grounds (including Hampden Park) to learn, without prejudice and without
any wish to influence the decisions, how that Council saw their functions under
the Act and how they intended to carry them out.                                      •

   18. In the course of these discussions it became clear that Strathclyde Regional
Council and the other authorities involved, recognising the financial implications
for some of the clubs, intend to apply these new measures with understanJtoyr,
common sense and flexibility. In some cases a safety certificate may be S K d
in a form which restricts the number of spectators to a figure to be determined
by the authorities, until improvements specified in the certificate have been
carried out.
                                    PART II
  19.    We turn now to a discussion o f the principal areas on which we have
based our recommendations. F or ease o f reference we have divided these into
10 sections beginning with the problem o f drink.




   20. Nearly all those who gave evidence were firmly of the view that a strong
relationship exists between alcohol and violence and that a good deal of the
disturbances associated with football is due to the am ount o f alcohol consumed
before, during and after matches. We are in no doubt that drink is a major
contributory factor leading up to such behaviour. At present no football ground
in Scotland is licensed to sell alcoholic liquor to spectators within the ground
itself. However we are aware that many people like to have a drink when
attending a football match as others do when attending other recreational
events and we have given careful consideration io the possibility of beer and
lager being sold within grounds. Our recommendation in this regard is con­
 tained in the concluding paragraph to this section (36).

  21. Meantime, having witnessed at first hand the considerable quantities of
alcoholic drink o f one kind or another consumed at grounds we visited last
season and the effect it had on the behaviour o f some spectators, many of whom
were under the lawful age, we have come firmly to the conclusion that every
effort should be made to discourage over-indulgence in alcohol before and
during matches and particularly its carriage by spectators into the ground.

   22. There is a further, and we believe more important, reason for banning
the carriage o f alcohol into grounds. The danger in our view lies n ot only in the
alcoholic contents o f cans and bottles, the effects o f which if consumed to excess
are harmful enough, but in the uses to which these containers may be put after
the contents have been drank. And since bottles containing non-alcoholic
liquid e.g. lemonade are potentially every bit as lethal if used as missiles, their
carriage into grounds should be banned also.

   23. We therefore strongly recommend that it should be made an offence for
 any spectator to carry or attem pt to carry into a football ground any glass, metal,
 earthenware or other similar container designed for the carriage of liquid or a
 container o f any description which contains alcoholic liquor.

    24. Attempts will continue to be made by some spectators to smuggle drink
 into grounds concealed on their person. We therefore recommend that it should
 be made an offence for a spectator to be in possession o f any container as
 defined in the foregoing paragraph within a football ground.
                                          5
   25. In the light o f our comments above anyone attempting to gain admission
to, or being in, a football ground while drunk should be guilty of an offence and
we recommend accordingly.

   26. In order that spectators should be in no doubt about the conditions for
entry into grounds we recommend that notices should be prominently displayed
outside football grounds warning them o f their liability to prosecution for any
contravention o f the recommendations set out in paragraphs 23-25; and that
for ticket matches, the tickets should bear the same warning on the reverse
side.

  27. The banning o f containers as defined above will affect the sale o f refresh­
ments within the grounds. Henceforth therefore it should be a condition of any
contract for the sale o f liquid refreshments within a ground that drinks be
served to spectators in plastic or paper containers and we recom m endaccord^dy.

  28. Until the law can be changed in regard to the re c o m m en d atio n in
paragraphs 23-25 it will be necessary in the intervening period for all clubs to ,
exercise their rights in refusing entry to any person in contravention of these
recommendations. We therefore recommend that clubs should adopt a uniform
policy o f refusing admission to, or ejecting from, their grounds any persons _
contravening these recommendations.

   29. In practice this means that the enforcement o f these powers will continue
to be vested in the club stewards stationed at entrances to, and within, grounds.
We are aware o f the difficulties at present confronting stewards in exercising the
duties required o f them. In our view more people who are physically capable
o f carrying out these duties effectively will have to be recruited if the conditions
of entry we wish to see introduced at all grounds are to be enforced and we
recommend accordingly. We suggest that in their recruitment o f stewaids,^clubs
should look to their supporters clubs to assist in providing the kind o f men
required for this job.

   30. We would like to see the stewards supported in sufficient numbers by
 police officers since the effectiveness o f the stewarding arrangements c a n o n ly
 be achieved if the actions o f the stewards themselves are backed-up 'J f c t h e
 authority invested in a uniformed police officer. We therefore recom m eW ihat
 Chief Constables, in consultation with the clubs, should ensure that adequate
 numbers o f police officers are available for duty at football grounds and that
 these numbers should be increased for any particular match for which it may .
 be considered necessary.

   31. Meantime notices should be displayed at the entrances to grounds
 publicising the conditions o f entry laid down by the clubs. These notices should *
 convey the meaning to spectators in clear terms in a standard format, to be
 promulgated by the football authorities as a m atter o f some urgency, and v. e
 recommend accordingly.

   32. In our discussions with representatives o f the licence trade they told us that
 in general public houses in close proximity to football grounds have few
 problems with members o f the public proceeding to a m atch; indeed in the view
                                           6
o f some o f their members the very fact that people can have a drink beforehand
may mean that less alcohol is carried into the ground than would otherwise be
the case.

   33. We recognise that licence holders are generally responsible people and
can be relied upon if the need arises to delay the opening o f their premises or
close them temporarily, especially when there is any likelihood o f trouble
between rival supporters. We would like to see off-iiccnsed shops and other
drink retailers and supermarkets from which carry-outs may be purchased
doing likewise in similar circumstances. In particular we would like to see
licensees in the vicinity o f the ground delaying the opening o f their premises for
a short time after the match is over to allow the crowd to disperse and thus help
to reduce the nuisance to residents in the area around the ground.

   34. We therefore recommend that, in certain circumstances, owners of
licensed premises in the immediate vicinity o f a ground should consider closing
their premises prior to the start o f certain matches and, on each occasion, delay
reopening until the match is over and the crowds have dispersed.

   35. If any licensee persistently keeps his premises open in circumstances
where the interests o f public order or safety clearly demand that they should be
closed, the police should ask the licensing board to exercise its power under
Section 66 of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976.

    36. We would like to think that the time will not be too far ahead, given a
 period in which to assess the effects o f the implementation of our recommenda­
 tions, when the clubs will wish to consider the provision o f facilities for the sale
 o f alcoholic drink under properly controlled conditions at their grounds. We
 would recommend therefore that, at the appropriate time, such a request should
 be considered by the police, the football authorities and the licensing boards
 to the possibility o f introducing, as an experiment, facilities within selected
 grounds for the sale o f beer and lager in plastic containers at properly staffed
 and regulated bars, provided all concerned are satisfied that in all respects the
 conditions for the introduction o f these facilities are right.



 TR A N SPO RT
 Coaches
    37. We wish to place on record our considerable disquiet at the am ount of
 evidence, some if it confirmed by members at first hand, regarding the extent
 to which alcohol is carried and consumed on board coaches hired by supporters
 to take them to football matches. By far the greatest part o f travel to football
 matches is done by coaches licensed as public service vehicles under private or
 contract hire arrangements.

    38. Section 92(4) o f the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976 restricts the am ount
 o f alcoholic liquor that may be carried in a container on a coach used as a
 contract carriage to not more than 6 pints. The law does not however prohibit
 the carrying o f alcoholic liquor by passengers on their person.
                                           7
   39. We are strongly o f the opinion that the-law.ill'this regard is not sufficiently
rigorous to be effective but recognise that complete prohibition is not practicable.
Nonetheless we are deepiy concerned at the many instances reported to us of
public service vehicles hired for the purpose o f conveying people to football
matches arriving at football grounds and discharging passengers who are drunk
and whose subsequent actions could very well contribute to unsocial behaviour
and hooliganism. It should be added at this point that the coach operators
themselves would welcome a change in the law to prevent the carriage of
alcoholic liquor on their buses. In their view it would considerably ease the
burdens placed on their drivers who are often put in an impossible situation
even when under strict instructions not to allow for stops en route to matches.

   40. We therefore recommend that the law in regard to the carrying of drink
on coaches should be amended to make it an offence for anyone to be in posses­
sion o f alcoholic liquor on a vehicle hired specifically for the purpose o f carryg|£
passengers bound for a football match.

  41. It follows that it should be made an offence for the holder o f a public
service vehicle licence or his employee or agent to permit any alcoholic liquor
to be carried on any o f his vehicles being used for the purpose o f carrying
passengers to a football match and we recommend accordingly.

   42. We are aware that at present many coaches hired for the purpose of
carrying passengers to a football match set off from licensed premises and clubs
and that they stop at licensed premises en route to matches for further refresh­
ment by which time some o f the passengers are drunk. In order to prevent
passengers in this state from arriving at football grounds we recommend that it
should be made an offence for the holder of a public service vehicle licence or
his employee or agent to permit the carriage of any drunken person on any of
his vehicles bound for a football match.

   43. Because o f the general concern about drinking on coaches, we would like
to see more liaison between the Police and the Traffic Commissioners in checking
coaches at points of departure and in stopping them at any stage en route to a
match to ensure compliance with the law as it presently stands and we recommend
accordingly.                                                               Wm

   44. Meantime we are pleased to acknowledge the co-operation o f the Traffic
Commissioners in writing to all PSV operators in Scotland, except those in the
Outer Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland, (some 900 in all) to let them know o f the
Commissioners’ concern in this m atter and asking them to pay particular
attention to this problem whenever passengers are to be carried in their vehicles
to football matches. A copy o f the Traffic Commissioners’ letter is reproduced at
Appendix G.

  45. W ith regard to the carriage o f supporters on long journeys, e.g. to
England, consideration should be given by the coach operators to putting a
reserve driver on board. One-driver coaches on such journeys are required to
arrive at their destination long before kick-off so that drivers may comply with
the regulations governing their hours o f rest. In such a situation passengers have
long periods o f drinking time available to them prior to kick-off. If a reserve
                                           8
driver were carried a later departure and therefore a later arrival at the destina­
tion would be possible. This would ine vitably increase the cost o f the hire but
it would reduce substantially the drinking timeavailable for passengers on arrival.



Raii
  46. We were pleased to receive evidence from British Railways (Scottish
Region) to the effect that relatively less trouble has been experienced from
football supporters travelling by rail in Scotland than in the south, largely we
understand because of adequate precautions taken in Scotland, the geographical
location o f our senior football grounds and the relatively short journeys involved
in the majority of cases.

   47. In order to relieve scheduled services, football “ specials” are provided
as far as possible and are under the surveillance o f British Transport Police.
N o alcoholic drinks are served on board these trains and supporters who arrive
at stations carrying alcoholic liquor or who are.drunk are not permitted to
board them. Trains are scheduled to arrive at their destination no earlier that
one hour before kick-off and are tim~d for the return journey as soon after the
game as possible. On the trains themselves British Transport Police ate em­
powered to remove alcoholic liquor from anyone in possession o f it and put
any person causing, or likely to cause, trouble off the train. Police resources
are not however unlimited and acts of vandalism still occur to an extent which
is a m atter o f concern to the railway unions some of whose members often find
themselves at the receiving end of acts of violence.

   48. A t our request British Railways (Scottish Region) have issued a number
o f guidelines to area managers and those concerned with football “ specials ,
and other trains on which football supporters travel, in an effort to reduce the
incidence o f violence on trains and to avoid any irritants to passengers, e.g.
overcrowding and delays, which could trigger-off aggressive behaviour on
arrival at the destination. We are grateful to British Railways for their co­
operation and initiative in this matter. Their guidelines are reproduced in
Appendix H.


Public Transport
  49.     The effect on public transport o f the behaviour o f some football fans,
especially in the City of Glasgow, is a m atter for concern also. Damage to stage
carriage bus services can lead to considerable disruption in services to the public,
loss o f revenue, expensive repair bills and staff recruitment difficulties. Close
co-operation with the Strathclyde Police is maintained by the bus operators
and we are pleased to record that adequate arrangements exist for the police to
give maximum protection for bus crews manning football “ specials” .



SEPARATION
  50.    It is in our view essential on occasion in the interests o f crowd safety and
control for measures to be introduced to separate rival supporters, as far as is
possible and practicable, before, during and after a match. In regard to separa­
tion outside the ground we realise that the responsibility for securing effective
separation lies primarily with the police. Nonetheless w e wish to emphasise the
role of the clubs in co-operating to the fullest extent with the police on such
matters. We therefore recommend that separation of riv a l supporters a         e
turnstiles should be carried out if the police, in consultation with the club,
consider such a step to be necessary.

   51. The build-up of crowds at the turnstiles especially during the half hour
before kick-off, can lead to a feeling of frustration among spectators which, it
allowed to develop, can cause trouble both outside the ground and inside
especially if people continue to pour on to the terraces when the game is under
way We recommend therefore that for matches where larger than average
attendances are expected, sufficient turnstiles should be opened timeously
in order to achieve speedy admission.

   52. We are firmly o f the view that the physical separation o f rival s u p p o ? » s
is one of the most effective ways of reducing hooliganism on the terracing. Where
possible this should be done by the erection of radial barriers or other physical
forms o f separation and we recommend accordingly. Any such improvements
designed to prevent crowd movement should include the provision of suitable
access points to the terracing for purposes of police intervention.

    53 In order to protect the players, match officials and the pitch, access to the
 playing area should be made as difficult as possible. To prevent an invasion of
 the playing area by spectators we recommend the erection o f a physical barrier
 in the form of a fence not less than 1-8 metres in height with access points to
 allow the pitch to be used if necessary for the evacuation of spectators in an
 emergency.

   54 We think it equally im portant that the separation o f rival supporters
 should be continued when the match is over in order to ensure that they are
 dispersed in an orderly manner and we recommend accordingly.

    55 Arrangements for the separation o f supporters coaches should be planned
 well in advance in co-operation with the local police. Accordingly we r e c o r d
 that coaches carrying rival supporters to a match, the majority of
 generally clearly identifiable, should be effectively separated by the police and
 parked as near to the ground as possible. The less distance the fans have to walk
 to the ground the better since long marches through towns with rival supporters
 mingling with one another and with other members o f the public are themselves
  an incitement to acts o f hooliganism.

     56. We are aware that parking spaces are at a premium in our towns and
  cities. Nonetheless we would urge and recommend to local planning authorities
  that they have regard to the need for ample parking space being provided, or at
  least for the current available space being maintained, around football stadia.

    57. We also recommend th at coaches travelling long distances should where
  practicable arrive at the ground no earlier than one hour before k ic k -o ff and
  should depart from the immediate vicinity o f the ground as soon as possible
                                             10
after the match, if necessary with a police escort to avoid any damage to coaches
which may be caused by missiles thrown by rival supporters.

  58.     Exceptionally we would recommend that supporters travelling long
distances (i.e. from Glasgow/Edinburgh to Aberdeen and vice versa) should
have the opportunity to have a meal after the match in the town otherwise on
the return journey coaches may have to stop in smaller towns which do not have
the police resources to cope with any incidents that may arise.



PENALTIES
   59. M any suggestions were put to us for making football hooligans see the
error of their ways. Some of them combined punishment with useful activity
e.g. putting offenders to work in the community at weekends for the whole o f
the football season: others involved punishment only, some o f it o f a decidedly
Draconian kind.

  60. W hat has come through all the evidence is a clear need to stiffen the
penalties for football hooliganism and at the outset of our deliberations we
welcomed the Lord Advocate’s directive that all prosecutions arising from
hooliganism among football supporters in Scotland, including those based on
incidents outside the ground, should henceforth be conducted in the Sheriff
Courts.

   61. There has been an overwhelming demand for increasing the level o f fines
imposed on persons convicted for acts of hooliganism at football matches. Low
fines are no deterrent; even larger lines have little effect on many hooligans and
are often paid for by their friends collectively. We are however pleased to record
that the Criminal Law Act 1977 will raise substantially the level o f fine which
the Sheriff Courts can impose on summary conviction of a common law offence
in Scotland from £150 to £1,000.

  62. We therefore recommend that the Courts should make full use o f the
higher fining powers under the Criminal Law Act, 1977 in respect of common
law offences which include malicious mischief, breach o f the peace and assault,
these being the most common offences associated with football hooliganism.

   63. Some o f our witnesses in evidence were critical o f the methods o f
collecting fines; many thought that fines imposed on offenders remained largely
unpaid. This is not the case. Fine enforcement has been the subject of examina­
tion by two bodies in recent years; the Thomson Committee on Criminal
Procedure and the Scottish Council on Crime. The conclusions of these bodies
in regard to fine enforcement are set out in Appendix J to this report. Also
included in Appendix J is a table showing that only a fraction over 1 % o f the
total fines imposed in Sheriff Courts remain outstanding after three years.

  64. While substantial fines should probably be the “ norm ” for first offenders
there has also been an overwhelming demand in the evidence submitted to us
for longer prison sentences for subsequent offences. We entirely support this
demand. We therefore recommend that, for persistent offenders, the Courts
should normally impose imprisonment without option.

   65. Many of those who gave evidence thought that to “ make the punishment
fit the crime” offenders should attend a centre for a set number of Saturday
afternoons within a stated period during the football season during which time
they could be given useful tasks to perform. The majority were in favour of
police stations being used for this purpose but the police in their evidence were
unanimously against offenders reporting to police stations on Saturdays since
on these days police resources are stretched to the limit; in any event the police
do not regar’d a police station as an appropriate reporting centre nor do they
consider it part o f their function to carry out punishment.

  66. We therefore recommend, as an additional or alternative punishment, the
establishment o f reporting centres in Scotland, when financial circumstances
permit, for persons found to have committed offences connected with
ganism at football matches aijd a requirement that offenders should be reqmred
to report to these centres for a stipulated number o f Saturday afternoons during
the football season.

   67. Others in their evidence, including the police, thought that offenders
should be required to undertake some form o f community service as an altern­
ative to other disposals available to the Courts or to Children’s Hearings.
In recommending this proposed we are pleased to record that planning is at an
advanced stage on the introduction o f community service experiments in
G ram pian, Tayside, Lothian and Strathclyde Regions.



EDUCATION
  68. Above all else, in seeking to make recommendations which will help to
reduce the problem o f football hooliganism, we consider that only through
education in the widest sense is the problem ever likely to be overcome. It is the
duty o f everyone concerned, especially the parents o f teenage children, to
explain why good standards of behaviour are expected and needed and why
football hooliganism should be avoided and condemned.

   69. On 24 November 1976 the Prime Minister, in announcing the Govern­
ment’s proposals to introduce new measures to combat the “ disturbing”
increase in vandalism, told MPs o f his concern at group violence, “including
so-called football fans who use such occasions to frighten peaceful citizens both
inside and outside football grounds” and he urged that “ parents should assume
more responsibility for their children” . “ The role o f the parent and the influence
o f the family were vital” , he said, but “ some parents seemed to have given up
caring for their children” .

  70. We referred earlier in our report to the am ount o f alcoholic drink con­
sumed at football matches by teenage children. This is not confined to the
consumption o f lager or beer; it takes a more insidious and dangerous turn in
that spirits and cheap wine, especially the latter, are also consumed in large
quantities and bottles are passed around the younger element in the group who
                                         12
may then hope to achieve the distinction o f being regarded as “ tough” and
mature. This is a dangerous trend and we are glad to acknowledge the work
of the Scottish Health Education Unit in drawing the attention of young people
to the dangers o f this habit to their personal health. We would like to see the
SHEU engage in an even more ambitious campaign with full Government
support to highlight the harmful effects o f drinking as they and others have
done so successfully in the war against smoking and we recommend accordingly.

  71. M ore must be done also to get across to youngsters that hooligans have
no part in the football scene; they are not wanted anywhere. The young are the
seed corn of future players and spectators who are vital to the game’s playing
and economic survival. Hooliganism in football crowds derives in part from
fans having no greater commitment than the result of Saturday s match; they
must therefore be helped to feel that they are involved with the club.

  72. In order to give youngsters, and indeed all fans, this feeling of involve­
ment some clubs have already initiated club “ open days” . These open days ,
while they may not always be enough to maintain the continuing interest ol
supporters, especially the young ones, can nonetheless do a great deal o f good
and we recommend that more clubs should consider involving their supporters
in this way.

   73. Last April, as part o f the effort to counteract the growing problem of
 hooliganism, a very successful educational experiment was conducted by Celtic
 and Rangers Football Clubs at the suggestion o f the Government. The experi­
 ment was aimed at demonstrating to the younger fan and his parents what
 football grounds could be like if the family atmosphere was restored. This is an
 experiment we would suggest to clubs that they might wish to consider, not just
 as a one-off exercise but as a continuing commitment. As an extension to this
 experiment we recommend that clubs, in co-operation with education authorities,
 should invite groups of pupils from the schools in their area to visit the ground^
 to meet the players for talks on matters relevant to the game in general and
 good sportsmanship in particular.

    74. The concept o f community involvement by the clubs can be sesn at present ■
 in their association with schoolboys where clubs have granted facilities and staff
 for coaching purposes etc. It is hoped that, where appropriate, clubs with advice
 and assistance from local authorities and the S c o ttis h Sports Council could
 extend their involvement by the development o f stadia facilities and areas
 immediately surrounding the stadia for recreational use by the community.
 We appreciate that not all clubs have facilities which can usefully be developed
 in this way and that considerable external financial support would be necessary to
 undertake major developments of this kind. Nonetheless anything that can be
 achieved in this direction would be for the good o f the clubs and the community
 and the stadia might become focal points for a wide range o f community
  facilities than otherwise exist at present.

   75. We do not o f course see such developments as alone providing the
 answer to football hooliganism but, in association with other measures we have
 suggested, we think they could go a considerable way to promoting better and
 closer relationships between clubs, the community and their own supporters.
                                         13
M oreover these developments could, if properly organised, be financially self-
supporting; in some cases they could even bring much needed financial support
to the clubs.



PO LIC E
   76. We recognise that the role of the police in matters o f crowd control is an
extremely im portant one and one that is carried out at most matches with the
utmost care and efficiency as members themselves have witnessed from time to
time. A t the sajne time we are fully aware of the difficulties confronting the
police who are more often than not at the receiving end o f any trouble created
by football crowds, especially after the match is over when most of the worst
manifestations of hooliganism take place. Their task in picking out culprits in a
crowd o f several thousands is an almost impossible one though we were pleased
to observe at the Rangers v Celtic match on 19 March 1977 the assistance g i ^ i
to the police by spectators in identifying troublemakers when d isturba;® *
broke out in the second half of-that match. This is an encouraging development
which in our view demonstrates the increasing public concern in these matters.

   77. We are in no doubt that for certain matches more police than are usually
provided are required outside the stadium before the start of the game to control
the arrival o f crowds, the separation of coaches and rival supporters etc. and
afterwards, to ensure an orderly dispersal. It has also been suggested to us that
the use o f plain-clothes men stationed among the crowd within the ground
itself requires much more development. We are fully aware when saying that
more police are required for duty outside football grounds that the cost of
additional police resources will place a greater burden on the ratepayers.

   78. We wish to acknowledge the assistance given by the police to the club
stewards in refusing admission to persons in a state o f drunkenness or in
possession of alcoholic drink. There are obvious difficulties for the stewards in
attempting to carry out these duties and we would like to see a change in the
law which would give the police powers o f search in these situations. As we
said earlier only when this action is stamped with the authority of a uniformed
policeman will there be any chance o f real progress in the elimination o f one of
the main causes of acts of aggression among spectators. We therefore reco m i^/^f
that the police should have statutory powers to search for any c o n ta in e i^ B
defined in paragraph 23 in the possession of persons entering or attempting
to enter football grounds.                      .

   79. In matters of traffic control it is essential for the clubs and for supporters
clubs to liaise with the police at all times. The need for better intelligence all
round—and this includes co-ordination o f intelligence between Police forces in
the Regions—cannot be emphasised too strongly. Accordingly we recommend
that traffic control on the approaches to football grounds should be carefully
planned by the police in advance o f all major matches and that there should be
better overall intelligence—between the police, the participating clubs and
supporters clubs and between police forces themselves— as to the likely strength
o f the travelling support, number of coaches expected, routes to be taken and
so on.
                                         14
   80. The hooliganism associated with football is not confined solely to the
grounds and within, them; it can manifest itself before the match but more
especially when the match is over when feelings of pent-up frustration caused by
an adverse result in the eyes of some supporters are released and given vent to.
This was the experience o f o n e '“ punter” whom we interviewed whose arrest
was due to such behaviour which, on his own admission, was aggravated to a
large extent by his having had too much to drink. Unfortunately, the recipients
of the worst of the anti-social aspects o f this kind o f behaviour are in many
instances innocent members of the public and their property in the immediate
vicinity o f the ground.

  81. We have already drawn attention to the difficulties confronting the police.
This is especially so on a Saturday when their resources in terms of manpower
are stretched to the limit. Nevertheless having been told by the police themselves
that there is more often than not more trouble with some supporters outside than
inside grounds, we think it is our duty to recommend that each Chief Constable
should ensure that at every match there is an adequate number of police on duty
outside the ground to control the approaches to and dispersal from the ground
in order to safeguard the public, and property, both private and public, in the
surrounding area.



T H E CLUBS
   82. The clubs must bear their share o f responsibility for the behaviour and
conduct of their staff at all levels. Those of us with club affiliations do not dissent
from this view. Indeed we are unanimous in recommending not only that boards
of clubs should take overall responsibility for the conduct o f staff at all levels,
including players, but that all staff should also feel a sense of responsibility for
their own conduct.

  83. We also recommend that the clubs must be seen through the press, club
newspapers and programmes to stand for the ideals o f sportsmanship, good
behaviour and a respect for authority and that they should appeal to their
supporters to co-operate with the authorities, especially the policc, in order to
achieve these ends.

   84. Where a large crowd is expected at any match and there is a likelihood
 that their admission without restriction in numbers would be likely to exceed
 the safe capacity o f the ground, the ground club should consider in consultation
 with the police whether or not the match should be an all-ticket one and we
 recommend accordingly.

   85. In the case o f a ground whjch has been designated under the Safety of
 Sports Grounds Act 1975 and for which a safety certificate is in force the police
 will o f course already have been consulted by the local authority about the
 spectator limit to be imposed either as a general condition of the certificate or
 for nominated special occasions such as those mentioned in the previous
 paragraph; in such cases making the match an all-ticket one would be a good
 means of avoiding an unintended breach of the capacity-limiting conditions of
 the certificate.
                                           15
  86 W ith regard to a non-designated ground (or a designated ground [ ° r
which a general safety certificate has not yet been issued) it may be th at the
police when consulted as suggested in paragraph 84 above, will on the grounds
of S t^ n propose a crowd limit well below that which the club itself would
have imposed. We recognise that at the end o f the day the decision rests with
the clubs themselves but we do recommend that the clubs shouid consider care­
fully the advice given by the police in view of their wide knowledge and exper­
ience of crowd control and crowd safety measures generally.

  87 When it has been decided that admission to a match will be by tk k eto n ly ,
we recommend that the arrangements for the sale of tickets should be publicised
by the club as far in advance of the day of the match as possible, fie recommend
also that tickets should not be sold at the turnstiles on the day of the^match and
where it is known beforehand that the match is a sell-out, the clubs involved
should, if time permits, advertise to this effect in the local press.

   88 We recognise that many football grounds in Scotland are very old;
some could even be described as primitive in that not only do they lack any
kind of comfort for spectators but they also lack basic amenities includin=
adequate toilet a c c o m m o d a tio n . This primitive environment encourages some
people to react in a primitive manner. Moreover there is a strong case for more
S n g accommodation. In our view it would go a considerable way towards
reducing hooliganism; potential trouble spots could be more quickly recogni ed
a n d identification of troublemakers by police would be made that much easier
 We therefore recommend that clubs should consider the provision o f addltlonjJ
seating accommodation. In addition clubs must provide adequate toilet facilities
f o f men“         omen and generally improve amenities for spectators and u*
 recommend accordingly.

   89 We are aware in making these recommendations that many clubs do
           tta: money ,o pu, these p ro p o s a l into effect; the gate r e c e s s o f many
 n o t h av e

 are not sufficient to keep them going and money from other sou.ee.. is not
 enough for them to contemplate such improvement. There are, however signs
 of more money coming in from sponsorships and iniy a ‘y U^ p7 et^
 Tmnrovement Trust will provide some money for clubs in the Premier u m
 (as well as to clubs in the English First Division and other designated
 to help in complying with the requirements of the Safety of Sports G rounds Act,
                          inadequate. It seems therefore that clubs will have to
 increase their own efforts to provide better and necessary g r o u n d improvements
 in the hope that such improvements will, in time, lead to football b e c o m i n g more
  of a family entertainment for young and old alike to enjoy in com or an

     90 We think that all grounds should have a public address (PA) system
  which can be heard clearly at all parts o f the ground and recom m end a cc o rd in g ly
  I s w e l l as prodding piped music for the fans’ entertainment, the system could

  p la y a n im portant ^ a rU n directing crowds to                                    or
  could also be used to put across a message from the club (by the manage
  jointly, by the home and away team captains) that responsible and loyal sup­
   porters are w anted; hooligans are not.
                                              16
   91. Trouble on the terracing can often begin before the match starts because
there is nothing happening to take up the attention of spectators and for some
this pre-match period provides an excuse to go on the look-out for a bit of
“ aggro” . To minimise incidents of this kind some clubs have experimented with
various forms of pre-match entertainment such as 5-a-side football, penalty kicks
and long kicking contests. Some people in evidence have suggested the return
of bands, pipe and brass, playing before the match begins and at half-time.
 We recommend the clubs to consider such forms of entertainment as a means of
concentrating the attention o f supporters on the playing area especially before
play begins.

  92. In order to reduce pre-match drinking time we recommend that, for
certain Saturday matches only, an earlier kick-off time should be consideied
by the clubs concerned and the football authorities in consultation with the
police. These arrangements have operated quite successfully', notably in respect
of “ Old Firm ” matches, but in recommending this to those concerned we
recognise that in regard to earlier kick-off times on a Saturday an added problem
can arise for police with the earlier .dispersal than usual of thousands o f sup­
porters into the city centres and main shopping areas.

  93. Until it is fully appreciated by the public that spectators in possession
of containers of a kind described in paragraph 23 will not be allowed into
grounds, we recommend that clubs should instal at points of entry to the grounds
suitable (temporary) receptacles, to be removed by stewards after the match
has started, for the disposal o f cans and bottles and every attempt should be
made by the stewards and the police to discourage supporters from drinking
the contents o f their “ carry-ins” before passing into the ground.

    94. The players, as well as the clubs, have to bear their share of responsibility
 for ensuring that their behaviour on the field of play is always o f a standard
 which will offer a good example to those on the terracing. Football is becoming
 increasingly competitive. There is greater emphasis on winning and a win at
 all costs” mentality is reflected in the attitude and play o f some players.
 Unfortunately exhibitionism and aggressive behaviour, showing dissent verbally
 or by gesture at referees’ and linesmen’s decisions, can quickly be communicated
 to the crowd at large and lead to similar behaviour on the terraces, especially
 by younger people whose actions in imitating their football heroes may well
 spark off acts of violence.

   95. It is only fair to say. however that the majority of players are themselves
 often adversely affected by disturbances on the terraces and their performance
 suffers to the detriment of the game as a whole. Many players too, it should be
 added, play their part in a voluntary capacity in the community relations field
 and make personal appearances at schools, youth clubs etc. with the objects of
 prom oting the game and the concept of good sportsmanship. We recommend that
 clubs should encourage their players to extend their activities in this area.

   96. We recommend that clubs should consider the advantages of installing
 closed circuit television (CCTV) for crowd control purposes. The system has
 been operated with some success by West Midlands Police at grounds in their
 area. CCTV has great potential for police supervision at football matches, its
                                          17
strongest asset being its ability to record incidents and subsequently identify
individuals involved in acts of hooliganism. CCTV also has a deterrent effect
on hooligans since their actions are not only observed but are recorded on film.
We regard such an installation as something o f a refinement which may be too
expensive for some clubs to instal but larger clubs may wish to consider its
possibilities for crowd control purposes.



SU PPO R TER S’ CLUBS
  97. It would be appropriate at this point to say a word about the supporters’
clubs, some of which are affiliated to the Scottish Division o f the National
Federation o f Football Supporters’ Clubs, and the help that they can give to the
clubs they follow. The Federation, and indeed all supporters’ clubs, are just
as concerned as are the football clubs themselves about the problem of football
hooliganism and are anxious to co-operate in every way possible to avoid ti^ ^ p
kind of behaviour which damages the reputation o f the clubs they s u p p o r ^ ^
They have their own codes of conduct and take whatever disciplinary action
they think appropriate to discourage members from misbehaving themselves.

  98. We recommend that the football clubs themselves should take steps to
harness this source o f support and encourage supporters’ clubs to recruit more
members in order to get across the message that the club welcomes true and
loyal supporters while at the same time seeking their co-operation in dis­
couraging from their grounds the small minority who are bringing disgrace
to the club and spoiling the entertainment o f the majority.

  99. F rom evidence received there appears to be a need for the football clubs
to forge stronger links with supporters’ clubs; supporters need to be brought
closer to the clubs and to feel they belong to it. Periodical meetings between
club management and officials of supporters’ clubs for an exchange of views on
matters relative to the problem o f hooliganism, should be encouraged and we
recommend accordingly.



 SCO TTISH FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION                                              W
    100. As the governing body for football in Scotland the Scottish Football
 Association (SFA) is deeply concerned at the increase in violence at football
 grounds. The SFA has powers to discipline players, officials and even the clubs
 themselves. It has been suggested in evidence that these powers do not go far
 enough and that in some instances when players are punished for infractions of
 the rules o f play they are compensated in some way by their clubs.

    101. We have already indicated the extent to which players' actions can
 inflame the situation on the terracing. Where therefore there :s evidence to
 associate trouble on the terracing with a particular incident on the field of play,
 the SFA should take the strongest possible line within the limits of its powers to
 punish those responsible. If this involves condemning the clubs as vvell (who
 cannot escape their responsibilities with regard to the behaviour of their players
 and officials) the SFA should not hesitate to do so.
                                         18
   102 Accordingly we recommend that the SFA should take pai ticularly
strong measures, in the form of a substantial fine, a lengthy period of suspension,
or both, against any player who infringes the Laws of the Game in a violent way
and against any player or club official whose conduct is sucn that his actions
are liable to inflame the feelings of spectators, thereby causing them to mis­
behave in a way in which they would not otherwise have done, or to engage in
a n y act of hooliganism.


   103 We also recommend that the SFA should, if it is not already in such a
oosition seek powers to enable it to take disciplinary action against any club,
in the event of any of its players or officials being found guilty of infringing the
Laws of the Game or misconducting themselves to the extent described in the
foregoing paragraph.

    104 The officials in charge of a football match have a responsibility to ensure
 that the game is well controlled and that their decisions, however unpopular
 they may be with some sections of the crowd,, are made timeously and with
 firmness. Delays in the flow of play can lead to unrest among spectators and
 should therefore be avoided as far as possible. We recognise the difficulties wun
 which officials, especially referees, are often confronted in making decisions,
  sometimes in an atmosohere of great tension during the course of a game.
  Nonetheless we think that the SFA should regularly remind referees of the
  powers conferred upon them by the Laws of the Game, and of the need to
  exercise firm control in accordance therewith, especially m any situation whicn
  might arise on the field of play and which, if not handled promptly, properly
  and positively, could inflame the feelings of spectators and we recommend
  accordingly.
    105. We have already referred to ways in which certain situations on the
 field o f play can trigger-off disturbances among spectators. The sudden post­
 ponement or abandonm ent o f a game can do likewise within the ground itself
 and later during the dispersal of the crowd. This can create problems for the
 police who may not be in their usual positions prior to the normal conclusion or
 a match. We think therefore that the SFA should instruct referees to advise the
 police before deciding to postpone or abandon a match and recommend
 accordingly.

    106. We also recommend that the SFA before the start o f each season should
  remind each club o f its own responsibility and its responsibility for the behaviour
  of its supporters both at home and away*from home; and that the club should
  actively endeavour to influence its supporters towards good behaviour.

     107. The need for the SFA to assess the success or otherwise of measures
  recommended in this report, and to advise the clubs accordingly, is important.
  We therefore recommend that in each season the SFA should monitor the
  situation and advise the clubs on the success or failure of any particular method
  of combating hooliganism.

     108. M any of the disturbances at football grounds take place in the course
  o f cup-ties especially those in which a small club, whose arrangements for such
  a tie may not be as well prepared in advance as they might have been, is involved
                                           19
at home against a club known to have a large travelling support. On that basis
we recommend that following each Scottish Cup ballot, the SFA should com­
municate with any club drawn to play at home a club known to have, custom­
arily, a large travelling support, reminding it of its responsibility and stressing
the need to consult and co-operate with the appropriate Chief Constable in
matters relative to crowd control, separation, etc.; to satisfy itself that the
“ ground” club nave taken all possible steps to comply with the recommenda­
tions made by the police and impressing upon the “ ground” club, if necessary,
the possible repercussions for any failure on their part to implement the advice
o f the police.

   109.    There have in the past been some disgraceful incidents involving Scottish
supporters following their teams in European competitions. The Denis Howell
Working Party recommendations with regard to the need for clubs to consult
the Consular Department o f the Foreign and Commonwealth Office when
making preparations for such games are quite clear and should be adhered
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office arrange with the local embassy for l i a i s ^ P
with the police about such matters as the numbers of supporters expected to
travel, by what means, i.e. coach, rail or chartered flight. These particulars are
requested o f British clubs on a form sent to them by the Foreign and Com m on­
wealth Office which is subsequently copied to the appropriate Consul-General or
Consul nearest the place where the match is to be held. We therefore recommend
that the SFA as soon as they become aware that a Scottish club will be playing
abroad in a U EFA .competition should get in touch with the club and instruct
them to establish immediate liaison with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.


T H E MEDIA
   110. The importance of the media in the presentation of events leading up to
major football matches and in their reporting of events afterwards is fully
recognised. The media wield a great deal o f power and exercise considerable
influence over their viewers and readers.

   111. We are aware that relations between some clubs and the media have in
some notable instances been far from cordial. Clubs have felt that far too
much sensational and destructive criticism appears in the press. It is our v ie|'
th at the over-dramatising of events leading up to im portant matches by
use o f such emotive words as “ battle” “ confrontation” “ army” are an incite­
ment to young supporters to indulge in wild behaviour.

   112. We think that the freedom enjoyed by the press in writing their stories
should be matched with a responsibility on their part to report in as fair and
constructive a manner as possible. The clubs should improve their relations
with the press and both parties should recognise their interdependence on each
other in this matter. We therefore recommend that full co-operation and under­
standing should be established between the clubs and the media in the interests
o f the game as a whole.

    113. We would also like the media in the build-up to im portant matches to
 refrain from using terms which imply physical confrontation between teams
 and supporters and recommend accordingly.
                                         20
   114. We would like in addition to comment on reports in some sections of
the press about arrests made during or after a match. There is on these occasions
seldom any reference made to the nature of these arrests—we understand many
are unconnected with hooliganism as such. If there are only a few arrests e.g.
there were only 5 arrests out of a 50,000 crowd at a Celtic v. Rangers match in
January 1977 (or one for every 10,000 spectators present) too little credit is
given to the efforts of the clubs, the police and above all else to the crowd
themselves for their good behaviour. We recognise that much depends on the
way in which this information is relayed to the press by the police. We think
that if arrests were categorised the media would co-operate in presenting a true
picture of events at a match. We therefore recommend that arrangements should
 be made for the press to obtain from the police, at the earliest opportunity,
 accurate categorised figures o f arrests and casualties resulting from incidents
 at football matches.

   115. It is our yiew that the press and television can do a great deal more to
reduce hooliganism by exerting their powerful influence to avoid undue dram a­
tisation and presentation of rowdy incidents. Otherwise the attention given
by the media to rowdyism is interpreted as a clear encouragement to the exhibi­
tionists. A balanced report giving credit to the happy and well-behaved crowds
should be adequately presented. We therefore recommend that more publicity
should be given to the good behaviour of supporters as responsible citizens
and to the condemnation and ridicule of hooligan behaviour.

   116. The press can do much to deglamourise football violence and encourage
interest in the game itself by emphasising its skills and sportsmanship. M uch
public support for the game is being lost as a result o f hooliganism. The press
and clubs have a great interest and challenge in maintaining this support and
in developing it.

CONCLUSION
   117. Many o f those who gave evidence, notably the Convention of Scottish
Local Authorities and the Association o f Chief Police Officers (Scotland)
recommended a concerted approach by all agencies involved to solve the
problem of footbali hooliganism. We do not dissent in any way from this view.
Only by a positive commitment and a sustained campaign on the part of all
those involved can there be any hope of positive success in eliminating from
the football scene the kind o f behaviour that is discrediting the good name o f
football in this country. We hope that the changes in the law which we have
recommended will go some way towards achieving this end. M uch however can
be done within the existing framework and it is our hope also that this report
and th e recommendations it contains will bring home to those concerned with
the game’s future the need to have a fresh look at their responsibilities with the
ultimate aim of eradicating the scourge o f hooliganism at football matches.

Football Hooliganism (A survey)

   1. In this survey the circumstances surrounding 270 senior football matches
played in Scotland during 1976 were examined (a summary of this examination
appears at Appendix I).

  2. It was found that these 270 games attracted a total o f 3,906,928 spectators,
1,G79 of whom were apprehended for a variety of crimes and offences.

  3. From the above finding we can see that the average number of spectators at
any one match was 14,470; that the average number of arrests per match w a ^
4-0 and that this represents 0-28 arrests per 1,000 spectators.

  4. The crimes and offences for which the 1,079 arrests were made is shown in
the table below—if the period o f attendance at a football match is 3 hours we
can say during 810 hours (3 X 270) of football matches 1,079 arrests were
made. Also in the table is shown the number of these crimes and offences
committed in Scotland during the year 1975.

                     T otal                        1,079                 N/A


    5. Combining Breach o f the Peace and Assault we find tnat 858 weie com­
 mitted at football matches out o f a total o f 76,158 for Scotland as a whole—t M |
 is 1-13 % of all Breaches of the Peace and Assaults committed.                  W

    6. Admittedly the football matches covered lasted only a total o f 810 hours
 and attracted on average only 14,470 spectators. The incidence o f Breaches of
 the Peace and Assaults at football matches can be calculated i.e. the numbers
 o f Breaches o f the Peace and Assaults committed per 100 hours o f football per
 1,000 spectators is:

                   (827 + 31) X 100 X 1,000
                   _______ :--------------------------   :    7-32
                         14,470 X 810

  This is the same as saying 7-32 Breaches o f the Peace and Assaults are com­
 mitted by 100,000 spectators every hour.
                                              24
  One must make a subjective judgement but it seems probable that this figure,
compares very favourably with the numbers of arrests made for Breach of the
Peace and Assault each hour per 100,000 persons engaged in their various forms
of leisure activity on a Saturday night.

   7    One other point is that perhaps these 1,079 apprehensions made for mainly
petty offences at football matches can be brought into proper perspective when
it is realised that in Scotland for the same period 13,224 arrests were made on
drunken driving charges.

  8 . The table at Appendix I suggest other findings connected with football
hooliganism:
  (a) There is a wide disparity between teams on the degree of hooliganism
       experienced at home games, ranging from -05 per 1,000 spectators at
       Dundee United to -67 at Motherwell.
   (b) Although the total numbers arrested per game may be higher for teams
       with large supports these teams do not necessarily experience high
       numbers of arrests per 1,000 spectators attending (i.e. Motherwell, -6 /
      a n d R a n g e r s -1 4 per 1 ,0 0 0 spectators).
   (c) Generally there is no relationship between the incidence of arrests and the
       size of average attendances. In fact there is a slight tendency towards the
       opposite view i.e. the higher the average crowd the smaller the number of
       arrests per 1,000 spectators attending.
   (d) The two teams with the largest support, Rangers and Celtic, have only
       an average or lower than average number of arrests per 1,000 spectators at
       their home games.

   9. Appendices Ha and lib of this report analyse the home and away records
 of the two teams with the greatest travelling support.
    9-1  The appendices show that there is a significantly greater number of
         arrests at away games in both cases.
    9-2 The number of arrests at away games is so large that it must distort
         home figures for the other teams in the league. It may be a tenuous
         argument but in Appendix I the incidence of arrests per 1,000 spectators
         experienced by other teams in the league seems to vary inverse^
         according to their distances away from Glasgow.
    9 .3 Overall Celtic supporters have a worse record than Rangers supporters,
         especially so in home games.
    9 .4 Rangers supporters have a worse record than Celtic supporters away
         from home.

    10. It will be argued that much of the hooliganism connected with football
 matches takes place not inside but outside the football stadiums. In an attempt
 to determine whether or not there were grounds for this supposition an examina­
 tion confined to Breaches of the Peace and Petty Assaults was carried out in
 Strathclyde Region. The examination covered all such crimes reported between
 I p.m. and midnight during the months January to May and August to Dec­
 ember 1976 (i.e. the football season) and paid particular attention to Saturday
                                                   25
afternoons and Wednesday evenings (these periods when it is most likely football
matches are played).
  10-1   The examination produced the following findings:

    Monday                  2,385                 —                        —

    Friday                  6,924                -                         —
    Saturday                7,760                 ---                   2,306       4 |

    T otal                 27,277                             3,962


  10-2 It can be clearly seen that the average 1 p.m. to midnight period in a
        week produces 27,277      7 = 3,897 crimes which is only slightly less
        than the 3,962 crimes collated over the same 1 p.m. to midnight
        period when football matches are typically played. The fact that there
        are 1-67% more crimes committed when football matches are played
        than when they are not hardly seems cause for concern.
  10-3 The table at 10-1 tends to indicate that concern about hooliganism
       should be aimed at activities on Fridays and Saturday evenings rather
       than at football matches.
   11.      The conclusion to be drawn from this report is that concern expressed
by the media about hooliganism at football matches is out of proportion to the
level of hooliganism which actually occurs at these matches.

Visit by Chairman and Members o f the Working Group to Wembley Stadium on
Saturday, 4 June 1977, for the International Match between England and Scotland

  1. The purpose of this visit was to observe the behaviour of Scottish supporters
en route to Wembley, during the match itself and afterwards in dispersing from
the Stadium.

  2. Reports received from 16 Regional Constabularies in England about the
behaviour of Scottish supporters travelling by road to Wembley give details of
incidents of rowdy behaviour at a number of motorway service station cafeterias
but there were no arrests. A number of fans were however arrested for theft at
service station shops and for causing damage to public houses but there were no
incidents reported of any violence. The overall impression gained from these
reports is that the fans, who travelled to Wembley by coach and other vehicles,
were on the whole generally well-behaved. According to press reports, British
Airways had nc incidents to report and the Scottish Bus Group had “no
trouble whatsoever”.

   3. The majority of supporters appeared to travel down to Wembley by rail
on scheduled services and on “football specials” of which there were about 25
in all leaving from Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Edinburgh. We observed
large quantities of alcoholic drink being taken aboard scheduled services but
saw no evidence of drunkenness or misbehaviour on these trains. This evidence
is supported by British Railways (Scottish Region).

   4. The scenes at the railway termini in London, i.e., King’s Cross and Euston,
on Friday afternoon and evening and on the Saturday morning of the day of the
match were noisy but good-humoured although some supporters seemed to be
a little the worse o f wear probably due to a lack of sleep on the overnight trains
rather than from an excess of alcohol.

  5. En route by road to Wembley early on Saturday afternoon the great
majority of those who were walking to the Stadium were either drinking as
they walked or were carrying cans and bottles in plastic bags. Public houses
were overflowing and many supporters seemed giad to lie out on the grass
verges around the pubs, some in a condition which indicated that their prospects
of ever reaching the Stadium were extremely remote.

   6 . At the ground itself there were indications that many Scottish supporters
had arrived without tickets and a number of those who had tickets, had forged
ones. This led to confusion at the turnstiles and delay in getting through them.
Shortly after 2 p.m. there was little semblance of organisation at the turnstiles;
stewards were conspicuous by their absence and solitary policemen were doing
their best to maintain order but with hundreds pressing to get through each
turnstile their task was a hopeless one. Police on horseback attempted to create
some order but only succeeded in crushing spectators against the turnstiles.
                                        31
  7 Despite notices displayed at the turnstiles to the effect that no cans or
bottles would be allowed into the ground, many supporters ^               *0 be
smuggling drink in on their persons or concealing their carry-ins in their g
and banners.
   8 Inside the perimeter and at the entrance points to theterracing         were
few steward from 2.30 p.m. onwards to facilitate the dKtnbution        P
into their sections on the terracing It was a case of every man for himsel .

   9 there were no incidents of hooliganism during the game itself, but everyone
now k n o ^ X happened when the final whistk: ble» .T h e damage: done. to the
W r m h l e v turf and the goalposts was inexcusable and in the words oi     Jn

Scotsman” leader of 6 June 1977 “it brought
and robbed our excellent team of the success d e-atime
victory should have won them” .

   10. In condemning the actions of a minority of Scottish su P P ^ ers i^‘




 could with commendable patience and good sense.

 television, witnessed at the close of this game.

Working Party on Crowd Behaviour: Circular for 1976/77 Season
  1. The Working Party on Crowd Behaviour, which I chair and which includes
representatives of the Football Association and the Football League, issued
detailed recommendations for improving crowd control and safety at domestic
matches and for British clubs participating in European competitions on 29 July
1975. These recommendations were issued after conferring with clubs in the
First Division of the Football League and with the British clubs competing in
Europe during the 1975/76 season.

   2. The Working Party has reviewed the success of its recommendations, and
the lessons to be learned from the 1975/76 season, in consultation with repre­
sentatives of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Home Office, the
transport operators and trade unions and supporters’ organisations. This
Circular identifies the key areas—all covered in the Working Party’s July 1975
recommendations (copy attached)—to which all concerned are urged to give
the highest priority. Paragraphs 3-13 contain our recommendations for matches
in the United Kingdom and paragraphs 14-19 our recommendations for
matches in Europe.


Protection of the Pitch
  3. In 1975 weemphasised thecardinal importance of measures which protected
the playing area in normal circumstances yet provided access to the pitch in
case of emergency. We recommended that the double barrier or walkway
system was satisfactorily effective and more consistent than continuous fences
with the general requirements of safety and security, particularly Police access.
But we had no objection to fences which contained sufficient supervised gates
through which crowds could be evacuated on the pitch in case of emergency.
The choice between the safety walkway and fence system will often be determined
by the geographical layout (often the amount of space available at each ground).

  4. What is important is to ensure adequate protection and events of the
1975/76 season have borne out our recommendations. On several occasions
adequate protection prevented unsupervised access to the pitch by unruly
crowds and so a lack of crowd control, and local Police forces have commented
specifically on the success of the new safety walkway arrangements, where they
have been introduced. In contrast, major pitch invasions have almost invariably
taken place only where the clubs have not implemented the working party’s
recommendations with the exception of one or two traditional end-of-season
occasions where the Police have deliberately allowed a crowd onto the pitch to
salute their teams. The Working Party again cannot recommend too strongly
 that League clubs should instal satisfactory safety walkway or gated fence
 systems as a top priority and in this regard should hear in mind 7.10 o f the “ Guide
 to Safety at Sports Grounds” which deals with pitch perimeter fences and walls.


 Segregation of Spectators
   5. The Working Party concluded that the other top priority was to restrict
 movement on the terraces. Home and visiting spectators must be effectively
                                          33
segregated both by Police direction at the entrances and by effective radial barriers
inside the ground, preventing rival supporters from moving around the ground and
coming into conflict. Build-up o f excessively large concentrations o f supporters
must be prevented by sub-dividing terraces both vertically and horizontally.

   6 . The 1975/76 season showed that trouble on the terraces often arose
through absence of segregation of rival supporters whether at the turnstiles or
on the terraces themselves—a standing invitation both to deliberate hooliganism
and to provocation which can eventually produce the same result. On other
occasions a lack of lateral and radial barriers set up crowd surges and pressures
which encouraged violent contact or resulted in spectators spilling onto the
pitch to avoid the pressures from behind. Clubs are again strongly recommended
to implement our recommendations on segregation and terrace subdivision
as a matter of high priority. They should also ensure that the surfacing of
 terraces is sufficiently compact to prevent hardcore and similar substances beina^
 a potential source of missiles.

Safety of Sports Grounds Act
   7. Since the Working Party made its July 1975 recommendations, the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act has become law. Its main provision of requiring certain
sports grounds to be subject to conditions in a safety certificate which is to be
issued by the county and regional council, will not become operative until a
designation order has been made naming grounds for this purpose. The first
designation orders will be made very shortly, and will apply to Premier Division
Grounds in Scotland, Cardiff and Wrexham in Wales, First Division grounds
in England and to five other international Rugby Union and Soccer stadia.
Other grounds may subsequently be designated.

   8 . The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (the “Green Code”) was produced
in 1973 on the information then available as a guide to measures for improving
spectator safety. Some of the recommendations are now being amended in
consultation with the football authorities. The revised booklet will also include
the Working Party’s recommendations. Those clubs whose grounds are named
in the designation order will receive* at the time the order is made, a copy of
the amendments together with an explanatory note on the procedures to
followed. The Working Party emphasises even more strongly that clubs■
now take no action to implement our recommendations may well find that if this
 results in risk to spectators their stadia will be given safety certificates only on
 very onerous conditions limiting ground capacity and so on. I f so, this will not
 be due to any lack of warnings from my Working Party, which laid particular
 stress on the implications of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act in their July 1975
 recommendations.

 Travel and Transport Arrangements
    9. The Working Party stressed that responsibility for developing adequate
 ticketing and travelling arrangements must lie with individual clubs. Close—
 and advance liaison with the local Police Forces, railway and coach operators,
 and responsible supporters’ organisations is essential. Experience of the 1975/76
 season has left us in no doubt that careful advance planning and co-operation
 between the various interests involved, can often be vital in preventing or
                                           34
containing crowd trouble particularly when an exceptionally vulnerable match
(for instance the local derby or Cup-Tie) can be predicted in advance.

   10. We maintain in particular our original recommendation that home Clubs
should consider every match in conjunction with the Police to determine which
should be all tickct, and the allocation of tickets to the visiting club. All-ticket
arrangements must be considered whenever there is a particularly vulnciable
match, especially where the combined numbers of the home and away sup­
porters are likely greatly to exceed the capacity of the ground. There are few
greater inducements to hooliganism than thousands of supporters arriving at
a far-off town with no hope of purchasing tickets and it is important wherever
possible to discourage ticketless supporters from travelling to all-ticket matches.
This underlines the desirability of selling combined travel and match tickets for
all-ticket games as recommended in paragraph 12 below.

Transport to and from Matches
   11. Our 1975 recommendations emphasised the vital importance of efficient
stewarding by clubs and reorganised supporter’s associations of both trains and
buses, and of special rail charters. Since then the British Railways Board
suspended the operation of unstewarded football specials, which has provided
an incentive for more clubs to charter and steward their own trains. They are
also considering whether to operate sponsored trains, for which they would
bear the financial responsibility but for which the clubs and supporters’ clubs
would have to provide effective stewarding. The Traffic Commissioners ior the
Northern Traffic Area have introduced a series of more stringent conditions on
licences for coach services to football matches, which can include a ban on the
carriage or sale of alcohol on board, arrival shortly before and departure
shortly after the match, and no halts (other than emergencies) within several
miles of the ground.

   12. The lessons of last season—particularly the outbreaks of hooliganism
during the first few weeks before this action was taken to control unsupsi vised
travel to matches—confirm that there is no substitute for really effective stew­
arding by the clubs and supporters concerned. The Working Party recommended
in particular that:                                   .
     i. Clubs and supporters’ clubs should charter and effectively steward their
        own transport;
    ii. Clubs and supporters’ clubs should sell match and travel tickets as one
        package wherever possible, particularly in the case of all-ticket matches;
   iii. Wherever possible, coaches should park close to the ground in areas
        designated in advance by the Police;
   iv. Supporters should be under constant Police surveillance to and from the
        ground, which implies close and advance liaison between the clubs,
        supporters’ clubs, Police and transport operators;
    v. Supporters’ coaches should be escorted to and from the ground wherever
        Police resources and their overall strategy for each game permit.
    13. Clubs are again reminded of the advantages to be gained from informal
 discussions with local magistrates and magistrates’ clerks about crowd behav­
 iour problems. Some clubs have already found such discussion to be of consider­
 able value.

Away Matches in European Competitions
   14. Last year the Working Party reviewed the problems which can be caused
by away games played by British Clubs in European competitions as a result of
the crowd disturbances which took place at the time of the 1975 European
Champions’ Cup Final in Paris. We issued a comprehensive series of recom­
mendations to British Clubs qualifying for European competitions in consultation
with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. These recommendations were
again discussed at a conference on 20 July 1975.
   15. We underlined the need for advance preparations for away games in
consultation with the Consular Department of the FCO; of tickets for home-
based supporters of the British Clubs being available only through that club
and not from the host club either in advance or on the day of the match; of the
British club’s acceptance of responsibility for distributing both travelling and
match tickets, which should be sold together by the club, supporters’ club or
reputable travel agents; of arrival/departure of supporters not very long b e fo r^ ^
the beginning or after the end of the match; and of official club publications^*
reminding the supporters of the possibility of disciplinary action against their
own club should the supporters misbehave.
  16. Experience of the 1975/76 European competitions has confirmed the
value of these recommendations. The Union of European Football Association
(EUFA) referred with particular approval to the behaviour of the supporters
of the two English Clubs which reached the finals of the EUFA and European
Cup Winners’ Cups last season, and British diplomatic representatives abroad
have also commented favourably on the recommendations’ success. The
Working Party too wishes to record its appreciation of the preparatory work
of the many British clubs and supporters’ Clubs, and of the responsibility
shown by so many of their supporters.
   17. There have, nevertheless, been occasions on which the stewarding and
control of parties visiting European cities for away matches has been less than
thorough. Effective stewarding—particularly important as supporters travelling
abroad have had to cope with unfamiliar currencies, price levels, procedures
and so on is again the responsibility of the Clubs and official supporters’ organ­
isations. I f they do not arrange the travel and stewarding directly they must
ensure that their approved travel agencies provide effective stewarding on theua^
behalf. The issue of leaflets etc. containing basic information on the country t ^ P
be visited may also be worthwhile.
   18. We have been in, close touch with EUFA and I have had a particularly
helpful and constructive exchange of correspondence with their President, Dr.
Franchi. We are glad that many of EUFA’s revised recommendations to
member associations are very much on the lines of our own advice as far as
crowd control and travel arrangements are concerned. But I have expressed the
Working Party’s serious concern that EUFA’s new recommendations still
allow supporters to purchase tickets from sources other than their home clubs,
whether in advance or on the day of the match. This prevents individual clubs—
whom EUFA hold responsible, and punish if necessary, for the behaviour of
their supporters—from maintaining full and effective control over the dis­
tribution of tickets. I shall be discussing the needed stricter ticketing arrange­
ments with EUFA.
                                       36
   19 The Working Party have called a conference o f all the British Clubs
which will be competing in Europe during the 1976/77 season to discuss our
recom m endations as re-emphasised by this circular. Clubs which parucipatec
in the 1975/76 European competitions have been invited to attend.

REVIEW
  20 The Working Party proposes to keep their recommendations, both or
domestic and for European matches, under continuous review.

Dear Sir,

The Role of Public Service Vehicle Operators
in Helping to Combat Football Hooliganism

  1. You will know that the Secretary of State for Scotland set up a Working
Group late last year to study football crowd behaviour and to make reconK
mendations.

   2. The Traffic Commissioners were recently invited to give evidence to this
Group. On that occasion members of the Group emphasised that they had
themselves witnessed many instances of public service vehicles arriving at
football grounds and discharging passengers clearly under the influence of drink.
The presence of empty cans and bottles in the coaches further indicated that
substantial quantities of alcohol had been consumed during the journeys. The
Working Group are firmly of the view that this practice is contributing to
football hooliganism.

   3. The Traffic Commissioners are eager to try to assist the Group in any way
they properly can to combat this aspect of the problems it is studying and have,
therefore, asked me to write to public service vehicle operators in Scotland to
let them know of the Commissioners’ general concern about this, to seek their
co-operation, and to ask them to pay particular attention to this problem
whenever passengers are to be carried in their vehicles to and from football
matches. You will doubtless bear in mind that the good name of the industry is
involved in all this.

  4. The Working Group have asked that mention be made in this letter of the
Traffic Commissioners’ responsibilities and powers under the Road Traffic Acts
about holders of public service vehicle licences and public service vehicle
drivers’ licences. The Commissioners have considered this, and have asked me
to say that whenever they think it appropriate, and if the evidence is strong
enough, they will consider exercising these powers.

Yours faithfully,
D. W. M cD IA R M ID
Clerk to the
Traffic Commissioners

Dear M r. Hook,
                   Working Group on Football Crowd Behaviour

   Further to our telephone conversation; I detail below the guide lines which we
issued to our Area Managers and those concerned with football excursion
trains, and indeed all trains upon which football fans travel:
  (1) Maintain close liaison with Police. Ensure in advance that adequate
      resources are provided and that all concerned have a clear understanding
      of the arrangements.

  (2) Provide adequate control at stations to ensure—
          (a) smooth entry to trains.
          (b) speedy booking of tickets.
          (c) minimum inconvenience to other customers.

  (3) Avoid overcrowding of trains (groups standing in corridors, etc. create
      an atmosphere for unrest and, in addition, obstruct the movement of
      Police patrolling the train).

  (4) Discourage supporters under the influence of drink or who are carrying
      drink. Police to remove or turn away if necessary.

  (5) Adhere to published timings. Delays and slow timings again contribute
      to unrest amongst supporters.

  (6 ) Despatch return trains as soon as possible after the match.

  (7) Ensure that “ Child” tickets are issued only to those passengers under
      14 years of age. (It has been established that youths between 14 and 16
      years of age but travelling in possession of “ Child” tickets are mainly
      responsible for vandalism on trains).

  (8 ) When unexpected numbers of supporters travel on ordinary services,
        warn Control to enable adequate arrangements to be made for the return
       journey.
                                       39
 (9) Contact Police and Control that you suspect trouble is likely to arise.
     PREVENTION of vandalism is our objective.

(10) If you are unable to maintain personal supervision over your local
     arrangements for controlling football supporters at stations and on
     trains, then make sure a responsible official is placed in charge.

 Whilst all point referred to are vital in our attempts to stamp out vandalism,
 none are more important than (3) and (4) and it is reiterated that:—

     (a) under no circumstances should football trains be booked or loaded
         in excess of total seating capacity.

     (b) supporters under the influence of drink or carrying drink are not
         permitted to board the train.

 I hope that this will assist you further in your deliberations.

                                                Yours sincerely,



                                                  (CLIVE ROWBURY)

Fines Enforcement
   1. The Thomson Committee on Criminal Procedure concluded at paragraph
60.13 of their Second Report (Cmnd 6218) as follows:

      •     . we reject their allegations [allegations of witnesses] that there are
    large amounts of fines uncollected or that the system is in danger of breaking
    down. We suspect that some of our witnesses have been influenced in the
    latter views by articles in the press about outstanding fines. In recent years
    at regular intervals it has been the practice of the press to publish statistics
    relating to outstanding fines. The tenor of these articles has in general been
    critical of the instalment system, and although the figures quoted have in the
    main been accurate they have sometimes misled in that they included, as a
    major part, sums which were not then due for payment. Recent research
    into the amount of unpaid fines shows . . . that only a fraction over one
    per cent of the fines imposed were still outstanding after a period of three
    years. Further, this figure includes not only fines against those persons
    whom the police had been unable to trace, but also fines against persons
    deceased, emigrated or incapacitated and companies in liquidation. We do
    not think that this figure could be regarded as an indication that the
    procedure for enforcement was ineffective and in danger of break down.”

  2. The Scottish Council on Crime similarly commented in its Report on Fines
  that:

       “Most fines, as we have noted, are paid in time or without long delay;
    this is because the ordinary fined offender accepts the duty to pay and
    makes arrangements to do so. . . .” (Paragraph 4.1)

      “O f the fines imposed in Sheriff' Courts, just over one per cent are still
    outstanding after a period of three years” (Paragraph 2.4 (10))

  3. The following table summarises information about fines imposed in the
Sheriff Courts over the preceding five financial years:

              Dear Mr. Mallett,

              HOOLIGANISM AT FOOTBALL MATCHES

              In answer to your letter of the 15th November, I am sorry
              you were unable to speak to me this morning on this matter.
              My Chairman had particularly asked me to contact you
              personally, in order that I should give his sincere
              apologies at being unable to meet the County Council's
              Working Party re the above, prior to our League Cup game
              v. Everton., Unfortunately, he is out of the country on
              business from next Monday until about the 10th December;
              at the same time he did feel it was very short notice to
              arrange such a meeting. However, it is firmly his
              intention to meet the Working Party on a mutually
              convenient date.

              As I mentioned to Mr. Victory, my Chairman would have
              no objection to Mr. K.T. Addy and Mr. E. Barron meeting
              some of your members, but this would have to be an
              unofficial meeting; perhaps you would let me know
              if you think this would serve any useful purpose.

              Yours faithfully,



                            VJ
          Secretary.

Further to my letter of 10th October, the County Council is encountering a lM e
difficulty In arranging la the near future for a meeting of all interested parties.

Councillor Thwaites has suggested that, ixk to® circumstances, a meeting between
the O tm ® C ow ell's Working Pasty and you* Club should take place falriy quioldy
aad preferably before the foithoomlng League Ct$» Mateh between your Club and
Everton at tha end of the month.

I should be gjad to know If yoar Directors are to agreemeat with gits suggests®.
S      could you possibly suggest a couple of dates which would be convenient to
your Directors and say whether they would prefer the meeting to take place at
Hillsborough or at the County Hall.

Attached for the information of your Directors and yourself is a copy of the Report
of the County Council's Working Party.

                                      Yours faithfully#

    Thank you for your letter of the 8th November received on the 10th
    November.

    You will, by now, have received our letter of the 8th November
    which I believe answers your enquiry.

    If anything further arises following the meeting with the Minister
    of Sport next week, I shall of course contact you immediately.

    Yours faithfully




       G Kirton

   Dear Sir

   Hooliganism at Football Matches

   Further to recent correspondence, I have to inform you that the
   Crowd Control Committee of the Football Association has now met
   and considered the report submitted by your Council.

   The Committee was able to accept the majority of your report and
   would concur with much of its thinking.

   However, the Committee was not able to support your Council's desire
   to obtain powers for the closing of football grounds on particular
   occasions.

   Representatives of the FA will be meeting the Minister of Sport
   fairly shortly and it is hoped that your report can be discussed
   at that meeting.

   Yours faithfully



                                                                   SOUTH VOnkr.HfRL COUNTY c o u n c il

Dear Mr. Mallett,

HOOLIGANISM

Thank you for your letter of 2nd November, which will have crossed with
mine; in addition, of course, your assistant spoke to me last week and
generally speaking, the points you make are correct.

However, the one point I would raise is a fairly fundamental one to our
Working Party, as I have stressed previously, the City's aims are rather
wider than purely football matches^ for a quite deliberate reason.
Nevertheless, I am anxious to minimise any overlap that may take place.

Yours sincerely,




Head of Department

that tholr response will be that the HlUsbox-ough Stadium
has been used for som e years virtually as an 'interna tiooal"
ground, and that they w ill wish to make fu ether representations
to the Secretary of State.

        Dear Mr. Rlchman,

        Hooliganism at Football Matches

    ^   Following our correspondence earlier this year, the County Council’s
        Working Party on Football Hooliganism met and considered what action
        they could recommend.

        As you w ill se e from the attached copy of their Beport, they have made
        six specific recommendations, a ll of which have been accepted by the
        County Council. At this stage I would especially draw your attention to
        recommendation 4*

        In particular, I understand that Junior Attendance Centres have now been
        se t up in the four main centres of the County for toe reception of boys
        aged 10-16 years, and are available as a sanction for offenders found
        guilty of offences committed at football m atches. I further understand
        that Senior Attendance Centres for youths aged 17 and under 21 are not
        yet available in the county.

        Accordingly, 1 have to request that recommendation 4 be drawn to the
^       attention of your Bench.

        So far as recommendation 3 is concerned, would your Bench be willing to
        be represented at a possible fixture meeting with Licensed Vttualters and
        B rew eries, e tc , to try to agree a procedure for banning the sale of
        intoxicating liquor on certain match days?

                                          Yours sincerely,

 Dear Mr, Pensam ,

 Hooliganism at Football Matches

 (1)     I refer to the Comity Council’s letter o f 14th October, your reply of
          19ft October and the subsequent telephone conversation which a
          member of my staff had with you on 27th October,

 (2)     From what I gather from reports In the m edia, your Council’s
         Working Party Is to m eet outside bodies on their proposals prior to
         m eeting the County Council's Working Party.

 (3)     A s mentioned previously, the County Council’s Working Party
         deliberately avoided meeting any outside bodies until the response
         of the City Council to the original Invitation o f 17th June to join In
         joint working arrangements waa known and the first of the Joint
         Working Party m eetings had been held. A s yet, no reply to the
         dates suggested In the County Council's letter of 3rd October has
         been received.

 (4)   In view of the lapse of time, I am taking the precaution of writing
        on a prelim inary b asis to the outside bodies concerned with the
        recommendations of the County Council’s Working Party.

(5)    Like m e, I am sure you can imagine what ammunition w ill be supplied
        to the c r itics of local government If both the City Council's and County
        Council’s Working P arties m eet essentially the same outside bodies
        to d iscu ss essen tially the sam e subject on separate occasions,

(6)    If your Council's Working P arty's proposals are yet In print, I should
        be obliged to receive a copy.

                                                             Yours sincerely,

        Dear Mr Mallett,

        SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT, 1975

              Than k you for your letter of k October about the request of
        the Council that Hillsborough Stadium should be designated under
        Section 1 of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975-

        2.    This question was considered very carefully when the proposal
        was put forward by the Chief Constable earlier this year, and the
        decision was then taken that there was not sufficient ground   on
        present information for designating Hillsborough Stadium under the
        1975 Act.  This Act, as you will be aware, is not designed to apply
        to vandalism and violence as such, but is concerned specifically
        only with measures to safeguard "safety" at sportsgrounds. While
        there may indee^J be some areas of overlap, there could be no question
        for instance /seeking to take account of problems created by damage
        to property or to anything that might happen outside the ground.    As
        you know it was essentially to enable the sort of disaster that
        happened at Ibrox Park to be prevented that the Act was introduced
        and it is primarily these sort of risks, involving the strength of
        stands, the siting of crush barriers, the position and gradients of
        gangways and accessibility of exits (and control of people using
        them) that the 1975 Act was designed to enable local authorities to
        deal with.

        3.    Within this framework it was agreed that designation of
        grounds should in the first instance be confined to those of the
        First Division clubs and of certain so called "international"
        grounds.  But it is the declared intention that when there has been
       ’time to assess the impact of this first round of designations
        consideration will then be given to the possible extension of
        designation to the grounds of the Second Division clubs.   When the

                                                                                                /tiime

      In the meantime you will of course be aware that the local
authority is able under section 10 of the Safety of Sports Grounds
Act 1975 to apply to a magistrates' court for an order prohibiting
or restricting the admission of spectators to any part of a ground
if the court is satisfied that the risk to spectators is so great
as to justify restriction of numbers to any or all parts of the
ground.

Dear Mr. Pensam,

Hooliganism at Football Matches

I thank you for your letter of 11th October, and copy of the report of your
Working Party.

I note what you aay about the broader issu e of hooliganism and vandalism.
The County Council's Working Party was originally appointed to consider
a ll aspects of vandalism associated with football matches at Hillsboro ugh,
and this w as, of course, mentioned In the tetter from Mr. Mallett to
Mr. Podmore dated 17th June.

The County Council's Working Party has nt>t yet met any outside bodies on
their proposals, as it was awaiting doing so until the response of the City
Council on t he Joint working arrangement was known and, if favourable,
the first of the Joint Working Party meetings had been held.

                                      Yours sin cerity ,




                                      County Secretary

Dear Mr. Harris,

VANDALISM WORKING PARTY

Thank you for your letter of 3rd October enclosing the report of your
Working Party.  Reciprocally, I enclose a copy of the first report
prepared by our Working Party which, of course, is looking at the
broader issue of hooliganism and vandalism and does not wish to confine
its consideration to any one football match or even to football matches
in particular.  For your information, members of our Working Party are -

       Councillor Wilson (Chairman), Councillors George, Moscrop,
       Price and Watson

 I have asked Councillor Wilson about the dates you suggest and we are
 also wishing to meet with a number of outside bodies on our proposals;
 I wonder whether you are proposing to do so, or indeed whether you have
 already done this in the process of your deliberations.

Yours sipgerely,




Head of Department

              REPORT OF VANDALISM WORKING PARTY


The terms of reference of the Working Party include investigating
and making recommendations on all aspects of hooliganism and
vandalism associated w i t h sporting and entertainment events which
involve the attendance of numbers of people.     The Working Party
will have a joint working arrangement with the Working Party set
up by South Yorkshire County Council as necessary.     Discussions
on proposals will also take place with other interested parties.


The Working Party has reviewed the existing controls over such
events and considers these to be:-


    (i)   fragmented between different authorities, and

   (ii)   inadequate to meet modern circumstances.


The one recent control is the Safety of Sportsgrounds Act of 1975
but this deals only with important but limited measures for
crowd safety within grounds and not with circumstances outside
grounds or relating to other events.   There are not sufficient
methods of ensuring that events are properly controlled, both for
the benefit of those attending and those residing in the neighbourhood.
Although it is accepted in the majority of cases that events are
organised and held with no problems, the legal responsibilities
attaching to promoters are limited.   It is considered unfortunate
that the 1975 Act, which may inhibit further legislation, was
passed with its limited controls.   Moreover, no premises in
Sheffield are at present designated under the Act.


Accordingly, the Working Party considers that legislation is required
to provide local authorities with realistic and practical controls
not necessarily to prevent, but to regulate, such events in
consultation with the police, the promoters and other authorities.
It is appreciated that difficulties arise at a minority of highly
publicised events, so that flexible controls are required.  This
will require the preparation of detailed submissions to the
Association of Metropolitan Authorities and central government
departments in addition to wide consultations with the police and
other interested organisations.


The submissions should involve the following principles


    (i)   defining the events as all those sporting and
          entertainment events involving the attendance of
          members of the public.

   (ii)   licensing powers thereover should be vested in
          District Councils, to be exercised after
          consultation with defined bodies in respect of
          events in their areas.

  (iii)   the controls should govern such matters as date
          and time of commencement, maximum capacity, parking
          and nearby traffic arrangements (with of course
          appropriate penalties for non-compliance).
p




    5.   It is appreciated that these matters are national rather than
         local in their effect and require general rather than local
         legislation.  Also, many matters of detail will need to be
         embodied in any draft legislation.  However, the experiences
         of Sheffield with its various venues for events, provide a good
         basis for recommendations of principle.


    6.   The Working Party will undertake a continuing dialogue with
         interested bodies and review of progress.

Safety of Sporta Grounds Act, 1975

The Chief C onstablewas bind enough to let m e know of the contents of the Department’s
letter to him dated 24th August* 1977,

Whilst the County Council appreciate the J>olnta made, the fact remains that the
Hillsborough stadium has In recent years consistently staged sem i-finals of the
F .A . Cup, as well as such other events a s League Cup Final Replays on occasions.

The residents of South Yorkshire, and Sheffield In particular, feel m ost strongly
that action must be taken to combat the mndallsm and violence which has unfortunately
become a feature of many football m atches, especially those Involving certain clubs.
A s a fir st step, the County Council Intends to Initiate discussions with all Interested
parties In an effort to reach a voluntary code o l practice.

In the longer term , It Intends to seek legislation to give It (and all County Authorities)
the power to ban any proposed sporting event where they, having considered all the
Information and evidence available to them, consider there to be a real danger that
persons attending or attempting to attend the event will cause Injury or damage to
persons and property or cause fear or alarm to the residents In the vicinity where the
proposed event Is to tabs place.

In the m eantime, the County Council consider that even though the Safety of Sports
Grounds A ct, 1975 has little relevance to Hooliganism and no relevance to events
taking place outside the ground, a ll stadia (and the Hillsborough stadium In particular)
where large crowds could be attracted should be automatically and properly brought
under the A ct, Only In this way can County Authorities be satisfied that proper
action 1ms been taken within the grounds,

I am instructed, therefore, to request that the Hillsborough Stadium should be
sp ecifically designated fay the Secretary of State tinder Section 1 of the Safety of
Sports Grounds A ct, 1975,

                                                               Yours faithfully,

                      SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL

REPORT OF WORKING PARTY RELATING
TO HOOLIGANISM AT SOCCER MATCHES

1.   The problem of Hooliganism and Vandalism at Soccer M atches has been brought
     to a head in South Y orkshire with the trouble caused during and after the F .A .
     Cup S em i-F inal m atch between M anchester United and Leeds United held at the
     Sheffield Wednesday F ootball Club Ground e a r lie r this year, and in view of that
     trouble, th ere should be no m ore Sem i-Final m atches in South Y orkshire until the
     hooliganism problem has been b eaten .

2.   It m ust be em phasised at the outset that the P olice did a m agnificent job both
     in the forw ard planning and in policing on the day and no c ritic ism of them is
     intended by this re p o rt. However, a num ber of trouble m akers in the crowd
     attending the m atch caused dam age, injury and some alarm to the public and,
     unfortunately, the public have come to expect a certain type of behaviour from
     Soccer m atches of this so rt and, in p a rtic u la r, to expect it from those involving
     ce rta in clubs.

3.   The Working P a rty consider that the m atter m ust be tackled on a National level
     a t the ro o t cause of the problem . C entral Governm ent m ust face up to the
     problem and tackle the causes a t the root.

4.   W hilst the problem needs to be tackled on a National level and may take some
     tim e to solve, the Working P a rty consider that they owe a duty to the poople
     of South Y orkshire to take im m ediate action to prevent wanton violence, damage
     e tc . associated with football hooliganism which people of South Y orkshire, be they
     football fans o r otherw ise, generally deplore. '
                                                             *
5.   On th is b asis the South Y orkshire County Council calls fo r legislation to give
     them the power to ban any proposed sporting event within South Y orkshire where
     they, having consid ered a ll the inform ation and evidence available to them ,
     co n sid er th e re to be a re a l danger that p erso n s attending o r attem pting to attend
     the event w ill cause injury o r damage to p ersons and p ro p erty o r cause fe a r or
     alarm to the re sid e n ts in the vicinity where the proposed event is to take place.

6.   It is considered th at the approach coupled with a re a listic use of the power does
     n ot run away from the root cause n o r does it move the problem onto someone
     e ls e s doorstep in that the pow ers should be available to a ll County A uthorities.

7.   The Working P arty have considered the effect of the Safety of Sports Grounds
     A ct 1975, in p a rtic u la r Section 10, and feel that the A ct has little relevance to
     hooliganism and no relevance to events taking place outside the ground and thus
     co n sid er that th is A ct does not contain the n e c e ssa ry legislative pow ers now
     req u ired . They nonetheless consider that the power of the S ecretary of State to
     designate a stadium under Section 1 should be ex ercised much m ore freely so that
     all stadia w here larg e crowds could be a ttra c te d are autom atically and pro p erly
     broilg!it into those arran g e m en ts, as only in this way can the County Council be
     sa tisfie d that within the ground p ro p er action has been taken. F u rth e rm o re the
     Working P a rty co n sid er that Hillsborough Football Stadium should be specifically
     designated under Section 1 of the 1975 A ct.
8.   The Working P arty went on to consider a num ber of o th er m atters connected with
     s o c c e r hooliganism .

     (a)   The num ber of unruly p erso n s attending so c c e r m atches looking fo r trouble
           is a m inority of the total attendance.             it is likely that these persons are
           not " su p p o rte rs” of th e ir declared team but use the so c c e r m atch as an excuse
           fo r violence and vandalism .

     (b) Separation of fans before during and a fte r the m atch should alleviate problem s,
         in p a rtic u la r the policing.

     (c)   The co st involved can b e m easured in ex tra policing, damage to property both
           public and p riv ate, and personal injuries including ambulance and m edical
           attendances.

     (d) Hooliganism and intoxicating drink in many cases go hand in hand.

     (e) Many fans tu rn up at m atches without tickets and when unable to obtain t i c k c ^
         a re n aturally disgruntled. This fru stra tio n may find an outlet in physical
         violence.

9.   The m a tte rs considered in the preceding parag rap h m e rit am plification in
     consideration of the pow ers now called fo r by the County Council.

     (a) The unruly m inority can be tackled on two fronts. F i r s t th e ir exclusion from
         grounds and special tran sp o rt, secondly th e ir identification if they do a rriv e
         a t the ground w hether o r not they gain adm ission.

           (i)    exclusion of the unruly elem ent could be p a rtially achieved by S trict
                  control of tic k e t allocation especially a t all advance tick et events.
                   Tickets to bonafide club su p p o rters (on the lin es now operated by
                   som e clubs) coupled with exclusion from special coaches and train s
                   of those without tickets may discourage so c c e r hooligans who a re
                   attem pting to get to away m atches.                                           ^

           (ii)   identification of the unruly elem ent can a s s is t the police in preventing
                   trouble a risin g .


     (b) Separation of fans during and a fte r the m atches is already p ra c tise d eg.
         coaches of fans a rriv in g shortly before lack off a t se p a ra te entrances
         etc. High fences inside the grounds to se p a ra te fans can cause problem s
         especially w here coupled with staggered re le a se of fans; the problem s include
         fire and safety facto rs p articu larly w here fans wishing to get out push the
         crow d in front, quite a p a rt from the legal considerations of claim s of false
         im p riso n m en t It m u st also be appreciated th at putting people in ’’cag es”
         m ay aggravate the problem s eg. damage caused when fans b reak out. Ticket
         allocation control can a s s is t also with separation of fans but much depends
         upon the stadium layout, in p a rtic u la r the num ber and location of e n tran ces/e x its.
(c) Policing inside the so c c e r ground is paid fo r by the club but policing outside
    is not. At the M anchester /L e ed s Sem i-Final th e re w ere four tim es as many
    police outside the ground as th e re w ere inside. The costs of these ex tra
    police (many loaned from other forces) falls on public funds. Those p rim a rily
    responsible fo r the c o st of damaged p ro p erly and injury to people a re those
    causing such damage and injury (although the co st of am bulances,hospital and
    m edical tre a tm e n t is usually irreco v erab le). However, quite ap art from the
    difficulties involved in identifying the individuals concerned,those suffering
    from acts of violence and vandalism will generally pursue any rem edy
    against a guaranteed source of finance ra th e r than the individual p e rp e tra to rs
    who may be "m en of stra w ”. In consequence, fo r property damage the claim
    is m ade under the provisions relating to rio t and fo r personal injuries under
    the C rim inal Injuries Compensation Scheme,and hence again the burden falls
    on public funds. The Working P arty how ever, considered that the co st of
    all these m a tte rs should fall upon those responsible fo r attractin g such a
    la rg e crow d in the f ir s t place, although w hether this should be the Football
    A ssociation, the Home Ground o r the Teams involved in the m atches may
    need som e fu rth e r investigation.

(d) D rink should be banned a t Football Grounds, on Special Soccer T rains and
    Coaches, and discussions with M a g i s t r a t e s / L i c e n c e d V ictuallers/B rew eries and
    a ll other in terested parties should be initiated to see whether the closing of public
    ho u ses/o ff licences in the vicinity of the grounds on the day of special m atches
    could be achieved.

(e) To avoid disgruntled fans who a re unable to obtain tickets re so rtin g to
    hooliganism and vandalism, every effort should be made to discourage persons
    attending-without tickets. This involves again the C lub/B ritish R ail/C oach
    O perators in a co-ordinated effort to se e that ticket allocations and tra n sp o rt
    of tick et holding fans produces the d esired resu lt.

The pow ers now sought by the County Council should not be ex ercised in an oppressive
m anner and indeed som e b u ilt in checks (eg. appeal to a M agistrates Court) would
be p erfectly acceptable. In addition th ere should be pow er to the Council to waive
any prohibition notice upon re c e ip t of sa tisfacto ry assu ran ces and guarantees
(breach of which should c a r ry sanctions). Such assu ran ces and guarantees would
v ary in accordance with the circum stances but m ay well include:-

(a) S tric t control of tic k et allocation, distribution and sale.

(b) Code of p ro ced u res and conduct to b e operated by coach firm s.

(c) F ull com pliance within the grounds of all anti-hooliganism m easu res proposed
    by the Police.                         f

(d) Paym ent (covered by insurance) by the relev an t club of all police, ambulance,
    m edical,hospital co sts and com pensation fo r p erso n al injury and p ro p erty dam age

(e) Control of supply of liquor on the m atch day.
11.     It is appreciated that the m ajority of Football fans a re law abiding citizens and
        may oppose such rad ical pow ers a s those now suggested, but it is hoped that people
        w ill accept that the County Council m ust deal with a ll fans according to the sam e
        ru les and no doubt those who a re law abiding will appreciate the necessity for
        the m ea su res now proposed and accept the inherent re stric tio n s on personal liberty
        in the realisatio n that if the m easures a re successful a ll w ill accordingly benefit.

12.     The Working P arty aldo considered the penalties for the various offences caused by
      i so c c er hooligans and welcome the in creased penalties now proposed in the C rim inal
         Law B ill a t p re sen t before P arlia m en t.

13.    RECOMMENDATIONS:

        (i)     A continual approach should be made to the Home S ecretary for the
        Hillsborough Stadium to be designated under Section 1 of the Safety of Sports
        Grounds Act, 1975.

        (ii)     The County Council (possibly involving the AMA) should seek the
        legislative pow ers re fe rre d to in the rep o rt.

        (iii)    F u rth e r d iscussions be held with M a g istrates/L icen sed V ic tu a lle rs/
        B rew eries e tc ., to get ag reed a procedure for banning the sale of intoxicating
        liquor on c e rta in m atch d a y s.                         ,

        (iv)        T hat an im m ediate approach be made to the p ro p er authority
        demanding provisions for stiffe r co u rt sentences to be adm inistered to offenders
        responsible for'hooliganism at football m atches, e .g . detention and curtailm ent
        of le isu re by the adequate provision of properly staffed attendance c e n tre s.

        (v)          T hat the local suburban railw ay stations be m ade available fo r the
        su p p o rters of these ev e n ts.

        (vi)      T hat the County Council follow through th ese recom m endations w ith
        positive action a s siste d by a co-ordinating officer/m em ber/w orking p arty .

Dear Mr. Harris,

HOOLIGANISM AT SPORTING EVENTS

Following on our discussion, I note what you say concerning the Working
Party and perhaps you could suggest three or four dates for the meeting.

So far as the note is concerned, I can assure you that we also want to
go into much more detail, but I was concerned to ensure that this prScis
was factually correct and I take it that this is so.

Yours sincerely,




Head of Department

REPORT OF FIRST MEETING OF WORKING PARTY
RELATING TO HOOLIGANISM AT SOCCER MATCHES

1.           The problem of Hooliganism and Vandalism a t Soccer M atches has been brought
             to a head in South Y orkshire with the trouble caused during and after the F.A .
             Cup Sem i-Final m atch between M anchester United and Leeds United held a t the
             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ground e a rlie r this y ear, and in view of that
             trouble th ere should be no m o re Sem i-Final m atches in South Y orkshire until the
             hooligansiism problem has been beaten.

2.           It m ust be em phasised at the outset that the Police did a magnificent job both
             in the forw ard planning and in policing on the day and no criticism of them is
             intended by this rep o rt. However, a num ber of trouble m akers in the crowd
             attending the m atch caused damage, injuiy and som e alarm to the public and,
             unfortunately,the public have com e to expect a certain type of behaviour from
             Soccer m atches of this so rt and, in p articu lar, to expect it from those involving
             certain clubs.

3.           The Working P arty consider that the m atter m ust be tackled on a National level
             a t the ro o t cause of the problem , and this problem the Working P arty
             identify as the general decline in social m anners and behaviour which is
             considered to re su lt from lack of parental control, falling educational standards
             and the influence of violence p ortrayed in m odern public entertainm ents.
             C entral Government m u st face up to the problem and tackle the causes at the
             root.

4.           W hilst the problem needs to be tackled on a National level and may take som e
             tim e to solve, the Working P arty consider that they owe a duty to the people
             of South Y orkshire to take im m ediate action to prevent wanton violence, damage
             etc. associated with football hooliganism which people of South Y orkshire,be they
             football fans o r otherwise, generally deplore.

5.           On this b asis the South Y orkshire County Council calls fo r legislation to give
             them the pow er to ban any proposed sporting event within South Y orkshire w here
             they, having considered a ll the inform ation and evidence available to them,
             consider th ere to be a re a l danger that persons attending or attempting
             to attend the event will cause injuiy or damage to persons and property o r cause
             fe a r o r alarm to the resid en ts in the vicinity w here^he proposed event is to take
             place.
     V"y .         '                                             A
6.           It is considered that the approach coupled with a rea listic use of the power does
             not run away from the root cause no r does it move the problem onto someone
             elses doorstep in that the powers should be available to all County A uthorities.

7.           The Working P arty have considered the effect of the Safety of Sports Ground
             Act 1975,in p a rtic u la r Section 10, and feel that the Act has little relevance to
             hooliganism and no relevance to events taking place outside the ground and thus
             consider th at this Act does not contain the n e c e ssa ry legislative powers now
             required. They nonetheless consider that the power of the S ecretary of State to
             designate a stadium under Section 1 should be ex ercised much m ore freely so that
             all stadia where large crowds could be attracted a re automatically find properly
             brought into those arrangem ents, as only in this way can the County Council be
             satisfied that within the ground p ro p er action has been taken. Furtherm ore the
             Working P arty consider that Hillsborough Football Stadium should be specifically
             designated under Section 1 of the 1975 Act.
The Working I\i i lv weal on lo consider a number of other m ailers connected with
so c c e r hooliganism.

(a)   The num ber of unruly persons attending so c c e r m atches looking fo r trouble
      is a m inority of the total attendance.           It is likely that these persons are
      not "su p p o rters" of th e ir declared team but use the so ccer m atch as an excuse
      fo r violence and vandalism .

(b) Separation of fans before during and after the m atch should alleviate problem s,
    in p a rtic u la r the policing.

(c)   The cost involved can be m easured in ex tra policing, damage to properly both
      public and p riv ate, and personal injuries including ambulance and medical
      attendances.

(d) Hooliganism and intoxicating drink in many cases go hand in hand.

(e) Many fans turn up at m atches without tickets and when unable to obtain tickets
    a re naturally disgruntled. This fru stratio n may find an outlet in physical
    violence.

The m a tte rs considered in the preceding p aragraph m e rit amplification in
consideration of the pow ers now called fo r by the County Council.

(a)   The unruly m inority can be tackled on two fronts. F ir s t th eir exclusion from
      grounds and special tran sp o rt, secondly th eir identification if they do a rriv e
      at the ground w hether o r not they gain adm ission.

      (i)    exclusion of the unruly elem ent could be partially achieved by s tr ic t
             control of tick et allocation especially a t all advance ticket events.
             Tickets to bonafide club supporters (on the lines now operated by
             som e clubs) coupled with exclusion from special coaches and train s
             of those without tickets may discourage soccer hooligans who a re
             attem pting to get to away m atches.

      (ii)   identification of the unruly elem ent can a s s is t the police in preventing
             trouble arisin g .


(b) Separation of fans during and after the m atches is already p ractised eg.
    coaches of fans arriv in g shortly before kick off at sep arate entrances
    etc. High fences inside the grounds to se p arate fans can cause problem s
    especially w here coupled with staggered re le a se of fans; the problem s include
    fire and safety facto rs p articu larly where fans wishing to get out push the
    crowd in front, quite a p a rt from the legal considerations of claim s of false
    im prisonm ent. It m ust also be appreciated that putting people in "cages"
    may aggravate the problem s eg. damage caused when fans break out. Ticket
    allocation control can a s s is t also with separation of fans but much depends
    upon the stadium layout, in p a rtic u la r the num ber and location of e n tran ces/e x its.
            (c) Policing inside the so c c e r ground is paid lo r by the el ub but policing outside
                is not. At the M anchester /L eed s Sem i-Final th ere w ere four tim es as many
                police outside the ground as th ere w ere inside. The costs of these extra
                police (many loaned from other forces) falls on public funds. Those prim arily
                responsible for the co st of damaged property and injury to people are those
                causing such damage and injury (although the co st of am bulances,hospital and
                m edical treatm en t is usually irreco v erab le). However, quite apart from the
                difficulties involved in identifying the individuals concerned, those suffering
                from acts of violence and vandalism will generally pursue any rem edy
                against a guaranteed source of finance ra th e r than the individual p erp etrato rs
                who may be "men of straw ". In consequence, fo r property damage the claim
                is made under the provisions relating to rio t and for personal injuries under
                the C rim inal Injuries Compensation Scheme ,and hence again the burden falls
                on public funds. The Working P arty however, considered that the co st of
                all these m atters should fall upon those responsible for attractin g such a
                la rg e crowd in the f ir s t place> although w hether this should be the Football
                A ssociation, the Home Ground o r the Teams involved in the m atches may
                need som e fu rth er investigation.

            (d) Drink should be banned a t Football Grounds, on Special Soccer T rains and
                Coaches, and discussions with M agistrates/L icenced V ictuallers/B rew eries and
                all other in terested parties should be initiated to see whether the closing of public
                houses/off licences in the vicinity of the grounds on the day of special m atches
                could be achieved.

            (e)   To avoid disgruntled fans who a re unable to obtain tickets re so rtin g to
                  hooliganism and vandalism, every effort should be made to discourage persons
                  attending without tickets. This involves again the C lub/B ritish R ail/C oach
                  O perators in a co-ordinated effort to see that tick et allocations and tran sp o rt
                  of ticket holding fans produces the d esired resu lt.

  |   10.   The pow ers now sought by the County Council should not be ex ercised in an oppressive
■/)         m anner and indeed som e built in checks (eg. appeal to a M agistrates Court) would
            be p erfectly acceptable. In addition th ere should be power to the Council to waive
            any prohibition notice upon re c e ip t of satisfacto ry assurances and guarantees
            (breach of which should c a rry sanctions). Such assurances and guarantees would
            v ary in accordance with the circum stances but may well include:-

            (a) S trict control of ticket allocation, distribution and sale.

            (b) Code of p rocedures and conduct to be operated by coach firm s.
                                                                                                         ■J:
            (c) F ull com pliance within the grounds of all anti-hooliganism m easures proposed
                by the Police.

            (d) Paym ent (covered by insurance) by the relev an t club of all police, ambulance,
                m edical hospital co sts and com pensation fo r personal injury and property damage

            (e) Control of supply of liquor on the m atch day.                                            I I
It is appreciated that the m ajority of Football fans a re law abiding citizens and may
oppose such radical pow ers as those now suggested,but it is hoped that people
will accept that the County Council m ust deal with all fans according to the sam e
ru les and no doubt those who a re law abiding will appreciate the necessity fo r
the m easu res now proposed and accept the inherent re strictio n s on personal liberty
in the realisatio n that if the m easures a re successful all will accordingly benefit.

The Working P arty also considered the penalties for the various offences caused by
so ccer hooligans and welcome the increased penalties now proposed in the Crim inal
T aw Bill at p resen t before P arliam ent.
                                                                                              :

  Dear Mr. Harris,

  HOOLIGANISM AT SPOBTING EVENTS

  Many thanks for your letter of the 9th August. I certainly agree that
  it will be useful to have a joint meeting as soon as possible and
  perhaps you would be kind enough to suggest three or four dates.

  In the meantime, may I take it that you have no comment to offer on my
  note? It will obviously be helpful if I can have, in advance, the
  recommendations of your Working Party.


                                                                     p( U ~ Lt, A

                      SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL

f&PORT OF FIRST MEETING OF WORKING PARTY
RELATING TO HOOLIGANISM AT SOCCER MATCHES

1.       The problem of Hooliganism and Vandalism at Soccer Matches has been brought
         to a head in South Yorkshire with the trouble caused during and after the F. A.
         Cup Semi-Final match between Manchester United and Leeds United held at the
         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ground earlier this year, and in view of that
         trouble there should be no m ore Semi-Final matches in South Yorkshire until the
         hool-igaiMjsm problem has been beaten.

2.       It must be emphasised at the outset that the Police did a magnificent job both
         in the forward planning and in policing on the day and no criticism of them is
         intended by this report. However, a number of trouble makers in the crowd
         attending the match caused damage, injury and some alarm to the public and,
         unfortunately, the public have come to expect a certain type of behaviour from
         Soccer matches of this sort and, in particular, to expect it from those involving
         certain clubs.

3.       The Working Party consider that the m atter must be tackled on a National level
         at the root cause of the problem, and this problem the Working Party
         identify as the general decline in social manners and behaviour which is
         considered to result from lack of parental control, falling educational standards
         and the influence of violence portrayed in modem public entertainments.
         Central Government must face up to the problem and tackle the causes at the
         root.

4.       Whilst the problem needs to be tackled on a National level and may take some
         time to solve, the Working Party consider that they owe a duty to the people
         of South Yorkshire to take immediate action to prevent wanton violence, damage
         etc. associated with football hooliganism which people of South Yorkshire,be they
         football fans or otherwise, generally deplore.

5.       On this basis the South Yorkshire County Council calls for legislation to give
         them the power to ban any proposed sporting event within South Yorkshire where
         they, having considered all the information and evidence available to them,
         consider there to be a real danger that persons attending or attempting
         to attend the event will cause injury cr damage to persons and property or cause
         fear or alarm to the residents in the vicinity where the proposed event is to take
     . ■ place. '

6.      It is considered that the approach coupled with a realistic use of the power does
        not run away from the root cause nor does it move the problem onto someone
        elses doorstep in that the powers should be available to all County Authorities.

7.      The Working Party have considered the effect of the Safety of Sports Ground
        Act 1975,in particular Section 10, and feel that the Act has little relevance to
        hooliganism and no relevance to events talcing place outside the ground and thus
        consider that this Act does not contain the necessary legislative powers now
        required. They nonetheless consider that the power of the Secretary of State to
        designate a stadium under Section 1 should be exercised much more freely so that
        all stadia where large crowds could be attracted are .automatically and properly
        brought into those arrangements, as only in this way can the County Council be
        satisfied that within the ground proper action has been taken. Furthermore the
        Working Party consider that Hillsborough Football Stadium should be specifically
        designated under Section 1 of the 1975 Act.
The Working Parly went on to consider a number of other m atters connected with
soccer hooliganism.

(a) The number of unruly persons attending soccer matches looking for trouble
    is a minority of the total attendance.      It is likely that these persons are
    not "supporters" of their declared team but use the soccer match as an excuse
    for violence and vandalism.

(b) Separation of fans before during and after the match should alleviate problems,
    in particular the policing.

(c) The cost involved can be measured in extra policing, damage to property both
    public and private, and personal injuries including ambulance and medical
    attendances.

(d) Hooliganism and intoxicating drink in many cases go hand in hand.

(e) Many fans turn up at matches without tickets and when unable to obtain tickets
    are naturally disgruntled. This frustration may find an outlet in physical
    violence.

The m atters considered in the preceding paragraph m erit amplification in
consideration of the powers now called for by the County Council.

(a) The unruly minority can be tackled on two fronts. F irst their exclusion from
    grounds and special transport, secondly their identification if they do arrive
    at the ground whether or not they gain admission.

    (i)    exclusion of the unruly element could be partially achieved by strict
           control of ticket allocation especially at all advance ticket events.
            Tickets to bonafide club supporters (on the lines now operated by
           some clubs) coupled with exclusion from special coaches and trains
            of those without tickets may discourage soccer hooligans who are
           attempting to get to away matches.

    (ii)   identification of the unruly   e le m e n t   can assist the police in preventing
           trouble arising.


(b) Separation of fans during and after the matches is already practised eg.
    coaches of fans arriving shortly before kick off at separate entrances
    etc. High fences inside the grounds to separate fans can cause problems
    especially where coupled with staggered release of fans; the problems include
    fire and safety factors particularly where fans wishing to get out push the
    crowd in front, quite apart from the legal considerations of claims of false
    imprisonment. It must also be appreciated that putting people in "cages"
    may aggravate the problems eg. damage caused when fans break out. Ticket
    allocation control can assist also with sep aration of fans but much depends
    upon the stadium layout,in particular the number and location of entrances/exits,
(c) Policing inside the soccer ground is paid for by the club but policing dutside
    is not. At the Manchester /Leeds Semi-Final there were four times as many
    police outside the ground as there were inside. The costs of these extra
    police (many loaned from other forces) falls on public funds. Those primarily
    responsible for the cost of damaged properly and injury to people are those
    causing such damage and injury (although the cost of ambulances,hospital and
    medical treatm ent is usually irrecoverable). However, quite apart from the
    difficulties involved in identifying the individuals concerned,those suffering
    from acts of violence and vandalism will generally pursue any remedy
    against a guaranteed source of finance rather than the individual perpetrators
    who may be "men of straw". In consequence, for property damage the claim
    is made under the provisions relating to riot and for personal injuries under
    the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme,and hence again the burden falls
    on public funds. The Working Party however, considered that the cost of
    all these m atters should fall upon those responsible for attracting such a
    large crowd in the first place, although whether this should be the Football
    Association, the Home Ground or the Teams involved in the matches may
    need some further investigation.

(d) Drink should be banned at Football Grounds, on Special Soccer Trains and
    Coaches, and discussions with Magistrates/Licenced Victuallers/Breweries and
    all other interested patties should be initiated to see whether the closing of public
    houses/off licences in the vicinity of the grounds on the day of special matches
    could be achieved.

(e) To avoid disgruntled fans who are unable to obtain tickets resorting to
    hooliganism and vandalism, every effort should be made to discourage persons
    attending without tickets. This involves again the Club/British Rail/Coach
    Operators in a co-ordinated effort to see that ticket allocations and transport
    of ticket holding fans produces the desired result.

The powers now sought by the County Council should not be exercised in an oppressive
manner and indeed some built in checks (eg. appeal to a Magistrates Court) would
be perfectly acceptable. In addition there should be power to the Council to waive
any prohibition notice upon receipt of satisfactory assurances and guarantees
(breach of which should carry sanctions). Such assurances and guarantees would
vary in accordance with the circumstances but may well include:-                                              . :




(a) Strict control of ticket allocation, distribution and sale.

(b) Code of procedures and conduct to be operated by coach firm s.                                            f

(c) Full compliance within the grounds of all anti-hooliganism measures proposed
    by the Police.

(d) Payment (covered by insurance) by the relevant club of all police^ ambulance,
    medical, hospital costs and compensation for personal injury and property damage

(e) Control of supply of liquor on the match day.

            11.   It is appreciated that the majority of Football fans are law abiding citizens and may
                   oppose such radical powers as those now suggested,but it is hoped that pfedple
                   will accept that the County Council must deal with all fans according to the sam e
                   rules and no doubt those who are law abiding will appreciate the necessity for
                   the measures now proposed and accept the inherent restrictions on personal liberty
                   in the realisation that if the measures are successful all will accordingly benefit.

            12.   The Working Party also considered the penalties for the various offences caused by
                   soccer hooligans 9 -nd welcome the increased penalties now proposed in the Criminal
                   I aw Bill at present before Parliament.



            13.   R E C O M M E N D A T IO N S :

                   (I)        An immediate approach should be made to the Football Association,/Minister
                              of Sport to ensure that no further Semi-Final matches are held in South
                              Yorkshire.
'   m   .
                   (ii)       An immediate approach should be made to the Home Secretary for the
                              Hillsborough Stadium to be designated under Section 1 of the Safety of
                              Sports Grounds Act 1975.

                    (iii)     The County Council (possibly involving the A.M .A.) should seek the
                              legislative powers referred to in this report.

                    (iv)      Further discussions be held with M agistrates/L icenced V ictu allers/
                              Breweries e tc ., to get agreed a procedure for banning the sale of
                              intoxicating liquor on certain match days.

                    (v)       That the County Council follow through these recommendations with positive
                              action assisted by a co-ordinating officer/member/working party.

                   (vi)       That an approach be made to the Football Clubs staging matches
                              necessitating the attendance of police over and above the number generally
                              deployed, regarding a financial contribution from the Club towards
                              the cost of police provision outside the ground.

                   (V i i )   That an immediate approach be made to the proper authority demanding
                              provisions for stlffer court sentences, e.g. detention and curtailment

     Dear Mr, Peasam,

     Hooliganism at Football Matches

      Thank you for your letter of 4th August,

     You will recall that my tetter of 17th June to Mr. Podmore suggested
     a joint working arrangement between our two Authorities, fit the absence
     of a reply sad as the County Council wished to proceed as soon as possible,
     they appointed a Working fsarty to look into Hooliganism at Football
     Matches* This Working Pdiiy has met twice and come up with certain
     recommendations, which are to be considered at the Group Meetings on
     12th September.

     It is still the County Council’s wish to have Joint working arrangements with
     the City Council, if this can be achieved. Tour comments as to the
     possibility of a joint meeting some time after the 12th September, would

Dear Mr. Harris,

VANDALISM AT SPORTING EVENTS

Further to our previous correspondence, you will note that the City
Council has been trying to arrange a meeting with a number of interested
parties on this question. This was in fact left in abeyance until the
end of the holiday season because of difficulties with the football
organisations. However, the City Council has now set up a working party
to consider the problem generally and in reply to your enquiry, we are
of course happy to liaise with you on this question.

I gather since our correspondence, that the County has produced some sort
of report and any further information you could let me have would be
appreciated. I should mention one specific point, namely that our
concern is with sporting events generally and their regulation, rather
than banning and it may be that there is some divergence between our
objectives!

 I should be interested to have your comment# and enclose a copy of a
 draft note I have prepared.

Yours sincerely,___________




Head of Department

DRAFT REPORT

VANDALISM AT SPORTING EVENTS

This note is intended to set out briefly the existing (and fragmented)

controls over sporting events, in the light of the City Council's

desire to obtain a realistic and unified means of controlling all such

events.   The following provisions appear to be relevant to the problem.

1.   The Police have    considerable general control under legal provisions

     which are not necessarily confined to sporting events.    The maximum

     size of crowds and times of events are often agreed with the

     organising bodies where there are potential difficulties, but it is

     reasonable to say that much of the control depends upon a spirit of

     co-operation.

2.   Local authorities in general have some control over the structures

     of grounds by means of the Building Regulations.    However, these

     controls largely relate to new or altered constructions in a

     situation where the vast majority of grounds are well established.

     The Regulations do not, of course, relate to events that take place

     outside the grounds.

3.   Licences for the sale of alcohol within grounds are of course

     controlled by the Licensing Justices in the same way as all other

     such licences.

4.   The Safety of Sportsgrounds Act 1975 provides the greatest single

     control over sporting events, but it must be said that this piece of

     legislation arose from a disaster in the ground at Ibrox Park,

     Glasgow and the Act is slanted very much towards safety provisions

     within grounds, rather than general controls over events or factors

     outside grounds.    Briefly, the Act requires certain standards to be

     achieved and enables County Councils to inspect grounds, to require

     works to be undertaken and in the light of this, to limit the

     capacity of grounds.    The Act applies only to certain grounds designated
   by the Secretary of State and neither the football grounds nor

   other sporting venues in Sheffield are so far included and moreover

   I understand that there are no proposals to designate further grounds

   at the moment.

   In fact, this Act may serve to inhibit further legislation containing

   broader controls that may be required to contain hooliganism in and

   around the venues for major events.   This is borne out by inquiries

   of the AMA and DE, which do not reveal any proposals in the pipeline.

   I suggest the first tasks of the working party should be to analyse

   the extent of the problem in Sheffield, with the other bodies concerned

   and to decide whether it is best tackled within the existing law

   or by the longer-term step of new legislation.

Dear Member,
 Hooliganism at Football Matches
I refer to the meeting which took place on 6 th July, 1977. The
Working Party indicated that they hoped that it would be possible
to submit some recommendations to the Policy Committee at
their meeting on Tuesday 19th July. I enclose a note which has
been prepared following the first meetingJbryour consideration.

At the request of the Chairman of the Working Party a meeting
will be held at 2.00 p. m. on Monday 18th July in the Committee
Room, County Hall, to consider the note.

^                                          Yours faithfully,
                                        ■Hif .

    Working Party
                   SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL

DRAFT REPORT OF FIRST MEETING OF WORKING PARTY
RELATING TO HOOLIGANISM AT SOCCER MATCHES

1.     The problem of Hooliganism and Vandalism at Soccer Matches has been brought
       to a head in South Yorkshire with the trouble caused during and after the
     • F. A. Semi-Final match between Manchester United and Leeds United held at
       the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ground earlier this year.

2.    It must be emphasised at the outset that the Police did a magnificent job both
      in the forward planning and in policing on the day and no critism of them is
      intended by this report, however, a number of trouble makers in the crowd
      attending the match caused damage, injury and some alarm to the public and
      unfortunately the public have come to expect from Soccer meetings of this sort
      this particular type of behaviour and in particular to expect if from those
      meetings involving certain clubs.

S.    The Working Party consider that the m atter must be tackled on a National level
      at the root cause of the problem and this problem that the Working Party
      identify as the general decline in social manners and behaviour which is
      considered to result from lack of parental control, falling educational standards
      and the influence of violence portrayed in modem public entertainments.
      Central Government must face 15 ) to the problem and tackle the causes at the
      root.

4.    Whilst the problem needs to be tackled on a National level and may take some
      time to solve, the Working Party consider that they owe a duty to the people
      of South Yorkshire to take immediate action to prevent wanton violence, damage
      etc. associated with football hooliganism which people of South Yorkshire be they
      football fans or otherwise generally deplore.

5.     On this basis the South Yorkshire County Council calls for legislation to give
       them the power to ban all proposed sporting events within South Yorkshire where
       they, having considered all the information and evidence available
       to them, consider there to be a real danger to persons attending or attempting
       to attend the event will cause injury or damage to persons and property or cause
       fear or alarm to the residents in the vicinity where the proposed event is to take
       place.

6.     It is considered that the approach coupled with a realistic use of the power does
       not run away from the root cause nor does it move the problem onto someone
       elses doorstep in that the powers should be available to all County Authorities.

7.     The Working Party have considered the effect of the Safety of Sports Ground
       Act 1975 in particular Section 10 and feel that the Act has little relevance to
       hooliganism and no relevance to events taking place outside the ground and thus
       consider that this Act does not contain the necessary legislative powers now
       required. They nonetheless consider that the power of the Secretary of State to
       designate a stadium under Section 1 should be exercised much more freely so that
       all stadia where large crowds could be attracted are automatically and properly
       brought into those arrangements, as only in this way can the County Council be
       satisfied that within the ground proper action has been taken.

8.   The Working Party went on to consider a number of other m atters connected with
     soccer hooliganism.

     (a) Hie number of unruly persons attending soccer matches looking for trouble
         is a sm all minority of the total attendance. It is likely that these persons are
         not "supporters” of their declared team but use the soccer match as an excuse
         for violence and vandalism.

     (b) Seperation of fans before during and after the match should alleviate problems
         in particular the policing.

     (c) The cost involved can be measured in extra policing, damage to property both
         public and private, and personal injuries including ambulance and medical
         attendances.

     (d) Hooliganism and intoxicating drink in many cases go hand in hand.

     (e) Many fans turn up at matches without tickets and when unable to obtain tickets
         are naturally disgruntled. This frustration may find an outlet in physical
         violence.                                                                  ^

9.   The m atters considered in the preceding paragraph m erit amplification in
     consideration of the powers now called for by the County Council.

     (a) Hie unruly minority can be tackled on two fronts. F irst their exclusion from
         grounds on special transport, secondly their identification if they do arrive
         at the ground whether or not they gain admission.

         (i)    exclusion of the unruly element could be partially achieved by stric t
                 control of ticket allocation especially at all advanced ticket events.
                 Tickets to bonafide club supporters (on the lines now operated by
                 some clubs) coupled with exclusion for special coaches and trains
                for those without tickets may discourage soccer hooligans who are
                 attempting to get to away matches.

         (ii)   identification of the unruly element can assist the police in p re v e n tin g
                 trouble arising.


     (b) Seperation of fans during and after the matches is already practised eg.
          coaches of fans arriving shortly before kick off at seperate entrances
          etc. High fences inside the grounds to seperate fans can cause problems
          especially where coupled with staggered release of fans. The problems of
          fire and safety factors particularly where fans wishing to get out push the
          crowd in front quite apart from the legal considerations of claims of false
          imprisonment. It must also be appreciated that putting people in "cages”
        . may aggravate the problems eg. damage caused when fans break o ut Ticket
          allocation control can assist also with seperation of fans but much depends
          tqpon the stadium layout in particular the number and location of entrances/exits.
                                                                                                           1

       *
                    (c) Policing inside the soccer ground is paid for by the club but policing outside
                        is not. At the Manchester /Leeds Semi-Final there were four times as many
                        police outside the ground as there were inside. The costs of these extra
                        police (many loaned from other forces) falls on public funds. Those prim arily
                        responsible for the cost of damaged property and injury to people are those
                        causing such damage and injury (although the cost of ambulances hospital and
                        medical treatm ent is usually irrecoverable). However, quite apart from the
                        difficulties involved in identifying the individuals concerned those suffering
                        from acts of violence and vandalism will generally pursue any remedy
                        against a guaranteed source of finance rather than the individual perpetrators
                        who may be "men of straw ”. In consequence for property damage the claim
                        is made under the provisions relating to riot and for personal injuries under
                        the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme and hence again the burden falls
                        on public funds. The Working Party however, considered that the cost of
                        all these m atters should fall upon those responsible for attracting such a
                        large crowd in the first place although whether this should be the Football
                        Association, the Home Ground or the Teams involved in the matches may
                        need some further investigation.

                    (d) Drink should be banned at Football. Grounds, on Special Soccer Trains and
                        Coaches, and discussions with Magistrates /Licenced Victuallers and other
                        interested parties should be initiated to see whether the closing of public
                        houses/off licences in the vicinity of the grounds on the day of special matches
                        could be achieved.

                    (e) To avoid disgruntled fans who are unable to obtain tickets resorting to
                        hooliganism and vandalism every effort should be made to discourage persons
                        attending without tickets. This involves again the Club/British Rail/Coach
                        Operators in a co-ordinated effort to see that ticket allocations and transport
                        of ticket holding fans produces the desired result,

           10   .   The powers now sought by the County Council should not be exercised in an oppressive
                    manner and indeed some built in checks (eg. appeal to a Magistrates Court) would
                    be perfectly acceptable. In addition there should be power to the Council to waive
                    any prohibition notice upon receipt of satisfactory assurances and guarantees
                    (breach of which should carry sanctions). Such assurances and guarantees would
                    vary in accordance with the circumstances but may well include: -

                    (a) Strict control of ticket allocation, distribution and sale.

                    (b) Code of procedures and conduct to be operated by coach firm s.

                    (c) Full compliance within the grounds of all anti-hooliganism m easures proposed
                        by the Police.

                    (d) Payment (covered by insurance) by the relevant club of all police ambulance
                        medical hospital costs and compensation for personal injury and property damage

                    (e) Control of supply of liquer on the match day.

11.     It is appreciated that the majority of Football fans are law abiding citizens and may
        oppose such radical powers as those now suggested but it is hoped that it is
        appreciated that the County Council must deal with ail fans according to the
        full rules and no doubt those who are law abiding will appreciate the necessity for
        the measures now proposed and accept the inherent restrictions on personal liberty
      • in the realisation that if the measures are successful all will accordingly benefit

  Dear Mr Hodgson,

  SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

        Thank you for your letter of 16 June commenting on the
  proposals that the grounds of the three clubs promoted to the First
  Division should be subject to safety certificatesand that those of
  the three relegated clubs should remain on the list of designated
  grounds. We have has already received the agreement of the others
  who were approached on this matter.

   2.    On the points made in the second paragraph of your letter
  about the criteria for designation .of grounds, I take your point
  that it might have been possible to use as a basis the number of
  spectators.   But, as Ministers announced during the passage of the
  Safety of Sports Grounds Bill, and have reaffirmed their intention
  since then, the general principles advocated by Lord Wheatley in
  his Report of the Inquiry into Crowd Safety (Cmnd ^952) accepted
  (although the phasing has been modified);   and it was accordingly
  on this basis that the first round of designations comprised the
  First Division grounds and those regarded as international grounds,
  with the declared intention of extending this in due course to the
  Second Division grounds.   For convenience, you may care to have the
  Hansard reference:   the announcement was made by Dr Summerski11,
  Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, Home Office last October
  during the debate on the prayers against the first designation
  order - Official Report: 25 October 1976: column l65»

  3»     On the wider question of criticism of the Act generally, I
  am not entirely clear how it is thought that the certification
  procedures for which the Act provides are an impediment to measures
  for the control of hooliganism.   For there is nothing to prevent the
  conditions attached by the licencing authority to the issue of a

                                                                                               / certificate
certificate from including measures directed towards prevention
of violence within the ground:  Section 2(1) defines the scope of
the safety certificates very broadly in terms of "such terms and
conditions as the local authority may consider necessary or
expedient to secure reasonable safety at the stadium        This
would not of course cover measures to be taken outside the ground
since this would not ordinarily presumably be within the control
of the owners of the ground to whom the certificate was issued.

k.    We should, however, always be prepared to consider any
specific proposals that your Association may wish to put forward
in connexion with the operation of the Act, either generally or
in relation to the designation of a particular ground.  In the mea
time, you will appreciate that in the light of what I have said
above and the agreement reached with the other interested bodies
shall proceed on the lines already indicated.

                        Yours sincerely,

 Dear Caulcott,

                                   Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

      Thank you for sending me a copy of your letter of the
 16th June to Miss Owen of the Home Office.

      Our own response to the proposals was to agree with what the
 Home Office had in mind.   I see the logic of what your own
 Association are saying but the application of designation
 to first division clubs has always seemed quite a rough and
 ready rule to go by.   As soon as one starts to consider less
 readily defined criteria one risks diverting an enormous
 amount of effort into disputes about who is, or is not, to be
 included and there is delay in bringing the legislation into
 practical effect.

      I hope I am not being too unhelpful in suggesting also that the
 time for objection of the basic philosophy was really rather
 earlier in the proceedings.   The principle of designating
 first division grounds in the first instance was, if I recall,
 settled a year or more ago.   All that is being discussed now
 is what to do about promotions and relegations and it would be
 hard to attack^the logic of extending control to new Division 1
 sides but keeping in those who have been relegated and whose
 safety provision has, therefore, presumably been adequately
 set up and certified.

                                                      Yours sincerely,



                                                                  secretary               ^

                  ON HOOLIGANISM/BEHAVIOUR AT SOCCER MATCHES
                                     18th July. 1977

PEE SENT: Councillor R. Thwaites (in the Chair)

Councillors: W. Circuit, G. H. Moores, A. Waugh

The Chairman recalled that at the first meeting it had been decided that a report should
be prepared for submission to Policy Committee on 19th July; and asked the members for
comments on the draft report before them.

The members were all agreed that the document was very well written bearing in mind the
difficult nature of the subject m atter.

The report was considered in detail and it was suggested that the following recommendations
should be included in the redrafted report:

(i)     An immediate approach should be made to the Football Association /M inister of
        Sport to ensure that no further semi-final matches are held in South Yorkshire.

(ii)    An immediate approach should be made to the Home Secretary for the Hillsborough
        Stadium to be designated under Section lo f the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.

(iii)   The County Council (possibly involving the A.M. A .) should seek the legislative
        powers referred to in this report.

(iv)    Further discussions be held with Magistrates/Licensed Victuallers/Breweries etc. to
        get agreed a procedure for banning the sale of intoxicating liquor on certain match
        days.

(v)     That the County Council follow through these recommendations with positive action
        assisted by a co-ordinating officer/member/working party.

  Would you please do a le tte r to go to the members on this Working Party along the following lines

  Dear Member,
  I refer to the meeting which took place              The Working Party indicated that they
  hoped that it would be possible to submit some recommendations to the Policy Committee
  at their meeting on Tuesday, 19th July. I enclose a note which has been prepared following
  the first meeting for your consideration.


  I will contact you further in a day o r so to see whether you would like to have a further meeting
  prior to the Policy Committee in order to revise the note. I presume that some members are
  likelyto be at County Hall on Monday, 18th July for the meetings alreacjr arranged for that day
  and possibly half an hour on that day might be convenient.


  Yours




  Someone must obviously contact the members and in particular Mr. Thwaites to see if they would
  want to come in. We must get Mr. Peters to find out from Mr. Mead whether there are any
  significant alterations to be made to the note before it is distributed. If so, amendments can
  be made. If the points are just to improve the note we can do that outside the meeting.

                                SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL

            DRAFT REPORT OF FIRST MEETING OF WORKING PARTY
            RELATING TO HOOLIGANISM AT SOCCER MATCHES

            1.   The problem of Hooliganism and Vandalism at Soccer Matches has been brought
                 to a head in South Y orkshire with the trouble caused during and after the
                 F . A. Sem i-Final m atch between M anchester United and Leeds United held at
                 the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ground e a rlie r this year.

            2.   It m ust be em phasised at the outset that the P olice did a m agnificent job both
                 in the forw ard planning and in policing on the day and no c ritism of them is
                 intended by this rep o rt, however, a num ber of trouble m akers in the crowd
                 attending the m atch caused damage, injury and som e alarm to the public and
                 unfortunately the public have com e to expect from Soccer meetings of this s o rt
                 this p a rtic u la r type of behaviour and in p a rtic u la r to expect if from those
                 m eetings involving c erta in clubs.

            3.   The Working P arly consider that the m a tte r m ust be tackled on a National level
                 a t the ro o t cause of the problem and this problem that the Working P arty
                 identify as the general decline in social m anners and behaviour which is
                 considered to re su lt from lack of parental control, falling educational standards
                 and the influence of violence p o rtray ed in m odem public entertainm ents.
                 C entral Government m u st face up to the problem and tackle the causes at the
                 root.

            4.   W hilst the problem needs to be tackled on a National level and may take som e
                 tim e to solve, the Working P arly consider that they owe a duly to the people
                 of South Y o rk sh ire to take im m ediate action to prevent wanton violence, damage
                 etc. associated with football hooliganism which people of South Y orkshire be they
                 football fans o r otherw ise generally deplore.

            5.    On this b asis the South Y orkshire County Council calls for legislation to give
                   them the pow er to ban all proposed sporting events within South Y orkshire w here
                   they,(upon advice receiv ed from the Chief Constable of the South Y orkshire
                 ^ P o lic e ) consider th ere to be a real danger to persons attending o r attem pting
                   to attend the event will cause injury o r damage to persons and property o r cause
                   fe a r o r alarm to the residents in the vicinity where the proposed event is to take
                   place.

            6.    It is co nsidered that the approach coupled with a re a listic use of the power does
                  not run away from the root cause nor does it move the problem onto someone
                  elses doorstep in that the pow ers should be available to all County A uthorities.

            7.   The Working P arty have considered the effect of the Safety of Sports Ground
                 A ct 1975 in p a rtic u la r Section 10 and feel that the Act has little relevance to
                 hooliganism and no relevance to events taking place outside the ground and thus
                 consider th at this Act doete n(ot contain the n e s e s s a w legLslative^ow ers now
                 required,                                          U W ' iu_                          ^

                            ^                  X   L   -                        1

  8   .   The Working P arly went on to consider a num ber of other m atters connected with
          so c c e r hooliganism .

          (a)    The num ber of unruly persons attending so c cer matches looking fo r trouble
                 is a sm all m inority of the total attendance. It is likely that these persons are
                 not "su p p o rters" of th e ir declared team but use the soccer m atch as an excuse
                 fo r violence and vandalism .

          (b) Seperation of fans before during and after the m atch should alleviate problem s
              in p a rtic u la r the policing.

          (c)    The co st involved can be m easured in ex tra policing, damage to properly both
                 public and p riv ate, and personal injuries including ambulance and medical
                 attendances.

          (d) Hooliganism and intoxicating drink in many cases go hand in h an d

          (e)    Many fans tu rn up at m atches without tickets and when unable to obtain tickets
                 a re naturally disgruntled. This fru stratio n may find an outlet in physical
                 violence.

  9.      The m a tte rs considered in the preceding paragraph m e rit am plification in
          consideration of the pow ers now called fo r by the County Council.

          (a)    The unruly m inority can be tackled on two fronts. F ir s t th e ir exclusion from
                 grounds on special tran sp o rt, secondly th eir identification if they do a rriv e
                 a t the ground w hether o r not they gain adm ission.

                 (i)   exclusion of the unruly elem ent could be p artially achieved by s tric t
                       control of tick et allocation especially at all advanced ticket events.
                       Tickets to bonafide club supporters (on the lines now operated by
                       som e clubs) coupled with exclusion fo r special coaches and train s
                       for those without tickets may discourage soccer hooligans who a re
                       attem pting to get to away m atches.

Q C               (ii) \ identification of the unruly elem ent (whether known hooligan or otherw ise)\
                u       j can a s s is t the police in preventing trouble arising perhaps by police
                       (^infiltration of unruly gangs.                                              — '

          (b)    Seperation of fans during and after the m atches is already p ractised eg.
                 coaches of fans a rriv in g shortly before kick off at sep erate entrances
                 etc. High fences inside the grounds to se p erate fans can cause problem s
                 especially w here coupled with staggered re le a se of fans. The problem s of
                 fire and safety facto rs p articu larly where fans wishing to get out push the
                 crowd in front quite ap art from the legal considerations of claim s <^f false
                 im p riso n m en t It m ust also be appreciated that putting people in "cages"
                 may aggravate the problem s eg. damage caused when fans break out. Ticket
                 allocation control can a s s is t also with seperation of fans but much depends
                 upon the stadium payout in p a rtic u la r the num ber and location of en tran ces/e x its.
                                 - 3 -

      (c) Policing inside the so c c e r ground is paid for by the club but policing outside
          is not. At the M anchester /L eed s Sem i-Final th ere w ere four tim es as many
          police outside the ground as th ere w ere inside. The costs of these extra
          police (many loaned from other forces) falls on public funds. Those p rim a rily
          responsible fo r the co st of damaged properly and injury to people are those
          causing such damage and Injury (although the co st of ambulances hospital and
          m edical treatm en t is usually irreco v erab le). However, quite ap art from the
          difficulties involved in identifying the individuals concerned those suffering
          from acts of violence and vandalism will generally pursue any rem edy
          against a guaranteed source of finance ra th e r than the individual p erp etrato rs
          who may be "m en of straw ”. In consequence fo r property damage the claim
          is m ade under the provisions relating to rio t and for personal injuries under
          the C rim inal Injuries Compensation Scheme and hence again the burden falls
          on public funds. The Working P arty however, considered that the cost of
          all these m atters should fall upon those responsible for attractin g such a
          la rg e crowd in the f ir s t place although w hether this should be the Football
          A ssociation, the Home Ground o r the Teams involved in the m atches may
          need som e fu rth e r investigation.

      (d) Drink should be banned at Football Grounds, on Special Soccer Trains and
          Coaches, and discussions with M agistrates /L icenced V ictuallers and other
          in te rested p a rtie s should be initiated to see w hether the closing of public
          houses /off licences in the vicinity of the grounds on the day of special m atches
          could be achieved.

      (e)   To avoid disgruntled fans who a re unable to obtain tickets re so rtin g to
            hooliganism and vandalism every effort should be made to discourage persons
            attending without tickets. This involves again the C lub/B ritish R ail/C oach
            O perators in a co-ordinated effort to se e that ticket allocations and tran sp o rt
            of ticket holding fans produces the d esired resu lt.

10.   The pow ers now sought by the County Council should not be ex ercised in an oppressive
      m anner and Indeed som e built in checks (eg. appeal to a M agistrates Court) would
      be p erfectly acceptable. In addition th ere should be power to the Council to waive
      any prohibition notice upon receip t of satisfacto ry assurances and guarantees
      (breach of which should c a rry sanctions). Such assurances and guarantees would
      vary in accordance with the circum stances but may well include:-

      (a)   S trict control of ticket allocation, distribution and sale.

      (b) Code of p ro ced u res and conduct to be operated by coach firm s.

      (c) Full com pliance within the grounds of all anti-hooliganism m easures proposed
          by the Police.

      (d) Paym ent (covered by insurance) by the relevant club of all police ambulance
          m edical hospital co sts and com pensation fo r personal injury and pro p erty damage

      (e) Control of supply of liq u er on the m atch day.
It is appreciated that the m ajority of Football fans a re law abiding citizens and may
oppose such rad ical pow ers as those now suggested but it is hoped that it is
appreciated that the County Council m u st deal with all fans according to the
full rules and no doubt those who a re law abiding will appreciate the necessity for
the m easu res now proposed and accept the inherent restric tio n s on personal liberty
in the realisatio n that if the m easu res a re successful all will accordingly benefit.

                       POLICY WORKING PARTY
            ON HOOLIGANISM/BEHAVIOUR AT SOCCER MATCHES

                                    6th July, 1977

PRESENT: Councillor R. Thwaites (in the Chair),
Councillors: Sir Ronald Ironm onger, G. H. M oores.

1.   Appointment of Chairm an

     Councillor R. Thwaites was appointed Chairm an of the Working P arty.

2.   Background

     The Chairm an recalled that the Working P arty had been se t up following
     Representations made a t a meeting of resid en ts from the vicinity of the
     Hillsborough Football Stadium. The resid en ts w ere concerned at the apparent
     growth in acts of vandalism and associated disruptive activities in the a re a
     which occurred when football m atches w ere being held a t the Stadium and which
     had been p articu larly serio us a t the F .A . Cup Sem i-Final held in April between
     M anchester United and Leeds United.

3.   Response to R epresentations

     The Chairm an rep o rted on the re su lt of the resid en ts' representations to the
     M inister of Sport, the M embers of P arliam ent representing the Sheffield a r e a , the
     City of Sheffield M etropolitan D istrict Council, and the Chief Constable of the
     South Y orkshire Police. All w ere sym pathetic to the views expressed but felt
     that there was no single sim ple solution to the problem .

      The Chief Executive rep o rted that to date, the County Council's invitation to the
      City of Sheffield M etropolitan D istrict Council to join in joint working arrangem ents
      had not been considered form ally, and a reply was s till awaited from the Football
     A ssociation's Crowd Control Committee in response to the County Council's request
     fo r th eir com m ents.

4.   P ossible C ourses of Action

      The Working P arty heard from the Chief C onstable's representative of the plans made
      and precautions taken at the recen t sem i-fin al, and discussed possible co u rses of
      future action. The view was expressed that a ll political p arties had for the la st 30
      y e a rs pandered to the w orst in m an, but this could only be rem edied in the long term .
      The sam e applied to what seem ed to be a lack of home influences which had previously
      resu lted in an accepted code of personal conduct.

     In the sh o rt-te rm , it was felt that possible m easu res such as close and advance liaison
     between the Football Clubs, the Police, B ritish Rail and the coach o p erato rs to achieve
      s tr ic te r control over tim ing of journeys, the prohibition of alchohol on the tra n sp o rt,
     and its sale at the stadium and licensed p rem ises in the vicinity of the stadium to
     reduce drunkeness, the segregation of fans (both physically and by m eans of proper
      allocation of tickets), the departure of fans by different routesi, •acceptanceof
     responsibility by the Football A ssociatioa and the in d iv id u a l clubs concerned* aiid
     new legislation w ere a ll possible courses of actioa. It was agreed that in its present
     form the s a f e t y a t S ^ t s ^ o u n d ^ Act, 1975 would not be of assistance..
Initial Recommendations

The Working P arty w ere full of p raise fo r the police in tackling what was obviously
a difficult task. It was agreed that only a m inority of the total number of fans
attending caused the tro u b le, but the time had come when steps had to be taken
to prevent people in th eir own homes being terrifie d by football fans. Innocent
c ities and police fo rces had to be protected. Accordingly, the Working P arty
wished m ore detailed re p o rts to be compiled as a m a tte r of urgency on the
following points which they would like to see implem ented

(a)   That no m ore SemiTFinals should be played in South Y orkshire unless
      assu ra n ces can be given as to the proper allocation of tickets; close and
      advance liaison between the Football A ssociation, Football Clubs, the Police,
      B ritish Rail and the coach o p e ra to rs, and the prohibition of alchohol on the
      tran sp o rt and its sale at the stadium and licensed p rem ises in the vicinity.

(b)   That legislation be introduced so that the Football Association an d /o r Football
      Clubs involved a re obliged to com pensate these persons whose property is
      damaged by football fans.

(c)   That segregation of fans m ust take place by the Football Association an d /o r
      Football Clubs ensuring that tickets a re only issued to bona-fide football
      su p p o rte rs, and by erecting perm anent b a r rie r s inside stadia to physically
      sep arate the fans.

Date of Next Meeting

The next m eeting of the Working P arty should be held in time for a Report to.be
subm itted to the Policy Committee on 19th July, 1977.

Dear Mr Mallett,

HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND

Thank you for your letter of 17 June, You may be aware that the City Council
has been trying to set up a meeting with interested parties to discuss the
problems arising from major sporting events in the city, I think we are now
close to finalising a date. Obviously, it would be sensible for us to work
in harmony on this and I am having a word with Councillor Wilson about the
suggestion which you make.

,cuts • ■ ■ v V
 football train
 trouble
 By Michael Baily
■ Transport Correspondent
       British Rail has largely elimi­
  nated football hooliganism on
  trains after introducing new
  measures last season.
        Damage caused was less .than
  £5,000 com pared with more than
  £100,000 the previous season,
  and instance of o th er passen- ,
  gers being terrorized bv su p -.
  p orters were relatively rare.
        Even m ore impressive,_ th e
  im provem ent _ was            achieved
  while increasing football travel,
 .instead of curtailing it as Mr
  HmveiM, M inister of State foir
  th e Environm ent, was urging
  d ie railways when vandalism
   was a t its height in the w inter
  of 1975-7S. .
        Credit goes largely to Mr
   Hum phrey Todd, British Rail’s
   inter-city m anager, who has a
   surprisingly relaxed attitu de to
   the Football supporters com-:
   pared with some. “ They are
   no t angels, but they are not ;
   anim als, .e ith e r”, b e says. ;
   “ Many a re uneducated an d i
   illiterate, b u t they are hum an j
   and personal, an d th eir propen­
   sity to violence is th;e same as
   th at of th e average male.”
     . Faced with te rrifie d p a s s e n ­
   gers, .ripped ou t seats, paint
   spray dam age an d broken win­
   dows the previous w inter,
    B ritish Rail worked ou t a seven-
   point plan last sum m er of which
   a key elem ent was getting th e
   greatest possible num ber of
    supporters         on    to   football
   “ specials ” and off ordinary
   Saturday trains.
         “ This was not some evil kind <
   of ap a rth eid ”, M r Todd says,
   “ b u t simply a recognition that
   boisterous loud-mouthed young
   m en an d quiet elderly ladies:
   ju s t do no t mix.”                 :
         I t is also good business for
    British Rail if clubs can f ill' ■!
   whole trains, especially if they
   ch a rter them and look afte r ,
    ticketing and supervision with
   th e ir own supporters’ club
    stewards.                       <
      • The sale of alcohol was
   banned oil football train s and
   occasionally a t stations. '             \
         The main elem ent of success !
    was a sharp increase in policing
   on football train s in a plan i
    worked out with M r Basil *
    Nicholls,         deputy    chief _ of ;
    British'        T ransport.     Police. ;
    Selected         railway    policemen
    p u t in • long hours of Sat- j
    urday        o v ertim e; not, M r '
   Todd emphasizes, to p u t on a j
    show of force, but to look after
    th e trains “ in the best tradition
    of English policing, which is not
    like th a t of some other coun­
    tr ie s ”.
       ■ By having the same policemen ;
    with the same clubs each tim e, j
    relationships w ere b u ilt           up 1
    through which provocation was I
    avoided and trouble defused be- e
    fore it spread. Fewer than six |
    policem en w ere needed               on i
    train s carrying m ore than 600 C
    supporters an d practically no n
    trouble was experienced.                 t)

                       We demand that steps be taken to:-


1.        prev en t the occurrence happening again by eith er playing sem i-finals on a
          home and away basis a t the grounds of the particip an ts, o r by playing
          sem i-fin als at Wembley

2.        pay com pensation to those people who have had damage done to property, and
          to shop owners who have lost business.

3.        make the football clubs responsible for the cost of any damage done by fans
          and the cost of the ex tra policing required

COMMENT

           T hese a re m atters substantially for consideration by the Football A ssociation,
           who have been asked for th eir com m ents. An acknowledgement has been
           received stating th at the m atter is being brought to the attention of th eir
           Crowd Control C om m ittee, and that the County Council will be inform ed of any
           decision taken. The County Council does not have any statutory pow ers over
           such m a tters.

4.        prevent fans travelling by tra in o r coach from entering the town o r city until
           the gates a t the ground a re opened and to e sc o rt the fens to the ground

5.        e sc o rt fans who a re unable to get into the match to the ra il and coach stations
           to make th e ir way home

COMMENT

           The South Y orkshire Police, augmented by contingents from nearby F o rc es,
           put a v ery large num ber of uniformed men into controlling the crowds at
           H illsborough on 23rd A pril. It is , of co u rse, virtually im possible to legally
           prevent people a rriv in g in a town o r city at the tim e they wish to a r riv e . To
           attem pt to legislate on this might create the feeling that there was a substantial
           infringem ent of p erso n al liberty and, in any case, the m ore well-behaved
           sections of the crow ds who come to a special match may, and do, link th e ir v isit
           with legitim ate shopping and entertainm ent activ ities.


           One of the main problem s the Police have in these so rts of circum stances is
           that a considerable num ber of people always turn up a t a m ajor football match
           of this s o rt without tickets and in the hope of acquiring one. It is believed
           th at som ething like 2,000 people fell into this category on 23rd A pril. They
           cannot be prevented from coming and, when they are in the town, th eir coaches
           o r tra in s will obviously not re tu rn for two o r three h o u rs. T his is an issue
           which the Home S ecretary and the Home Office a re looking at carefully, as
           indeed they a re into the whole question of football hooliganism .
6.        prevent s tre e ts being used by fans fo r c a r parking within the vicinity of
           the ground by re stric tin g parking to resid en ts on a p ass system

COMMENT

          The Police have pow er to ban parking, but this is difficult to achieve other
          than on a total prohibition b a sis. The County Council has pow er to make a
          R esidents Parking Scheme, but the problem occurs mainly it is understood
          only a t the special m atches.

7.        hold a public enquiry into the circum stances

COMMENT

           It is suggested that this would be a m atter for the Home S ecretary o r the
           M inister of Sport.

8.        give local authorities s p e d a l re se rv e pow ers to ban, if need be, any
          match where a club’s fans have a reputation for vandalism

COMMENT

           T his suggestion would require general legislation, and it is open to doubt
           w hether it is a re se rv e power which local authorities generally would welcome.
           It is difficult to see where the local authority concerned would get its
           inform ation from before it considered w hether to ban a match o r not and what
           c r ite ria it should adopt. F o r instance, would e ith e r the County Council or
           the Sheffield City Council on the basis of the inform ation available p rio r
           to the m atch on 23rd A pril, knowing of the g re a t public in te re st in the match
           and the extensive Police precautions, have banned the m atch?

9.        prevent the media from publicising these a c ts, which give encouragem ent to
          o th ers.

COMMENT

           T his point also r a is e s consideration of public policy and also the possibility
           of p re s s censorship.

GENERAL COMMENTS

           The foregoing com m ents could be regarded as the legalistic view, and do not
           cover any inform al working arrangem ents which might be agreed with the
           Football Clubs, SupportersCTluhs, Football A ssociation, B ritish R ail or
           Coach firm s.

                   SAFETY OF SPOBTS GROUNDS ACT, 1975

1 .____ G eneral

At the moment, the Act applies only to the grounds of Clubs In the F irs t Division of
the Football League and those of the International A ssociation ofBu^jy Union Football.
As the title im plies, the Act is concerned with safety a t sports grounds, and covers
m a tte rs such as the num ber of sp ectato rs to be adm itted, entrances, ex ists, crush
b a r r ie r s and fire precautions.

2 .____ Designation of Hillsborough Stadium under Section 1

The Chief Constable has already suggested to the S ecretary of State that the Stadium
should be designated on the ground that it is occasionally used for im portant gam es,
and has received a reply to the effect that it is not the only Stadium in this position,
and that it w ill be n ecessary to look " ra th e r carefully" a t any case for exceptional
treatm en t.

3 .____ Action under Section 10 of the Act

The court m ay, on the application of the local authority, prohibit or r e s tr ic t the
adm ission of sp ectato rs to all o r any p a rt of a Stadium, if they a re satisfied that any
r is k to sp ectato rs ju stifies it. However, up to the present, the m em bers of the
officers* Working P arty have taken the attitude that they a re sufficiently aw are of
facilities a t Hillsborough to say that in th eir view th ere is no ris k to sp ectato rs which
would justify Section 10 action being taken.

If it is d esired to take Section 10 action in resp ect of one p articu lar fixture, tim e
is usually the enemy - fo r exam ple, Cup Sem i-Final grounds a r e not decided until
the 6th Bound has been played and the sem i-final clubs a re known. This leaves
only a very sh o rt period to inspect the ground, obtain Committee authority, and go
to Court, bearing in mind that the Club A uthorities need tim e also to p rin t tickets
etc . and se ll them in adequate tim e before the gam e.

4 .____ Other P ossible Action

It has been suggested that the Stadium should be inspected, decide what works would
want carrying out if it w ere designated and an application for a Safety’C ertificate had
been m ade, and then ask the Club to carry out such works in consideration of our not
taking Section 10 action. Even if this course was m orally defensible it is questionnable
w hether it would go very fa r to solve the problem of so c cer hooliganism .

A le tte r from Sheffield, on which the Chief C onstable's com m ents a re awaited, suggested
c erta in m easu res including segregating riv al su p p o rters, and at the end of the gam e
releasing each in turn, escorting one to th e ir departure point before releasing the
o ther. It is very questionable, fo r a num ber of reasons w hether this could be done -
spart from the obvious w earing of colours, how does one identify which team a person
supports, and keeping one section of supporters in carcerated in a ground m ight well
provoke even m o re hooliganism and vandalism . Again, how can supporters be forced
to leave town if it is th e ir intention to "make an evening of it".
                                           2.



In any event, the g re a te r p a rt of the problem Is obviously what happens a fte r the
sp ectato rs leave the ground.T his is something outside the scope of the Act, and
p a rt of the g en eral problem of vandalism .

      Dear Mr. Mallett,

                                                      Football Hooliganism

                    You may remember our conversation several days ago when I
      mentioned that I had noted the setting up of a working party on the County
      Council to look into the problem of hooliganism at football matches* I said
      that I would be interested in hearing of any conclusions reached by the
      working party, and at the same time indicated that if its members would
      like to discuss aspects of it, and to sit in on the trial of a case
      involving football hooliganism I would be happy to meet them and make
      arrangements.

                  The majority of defendants who cane to court arising out of the
      trouble at the Manchester United v. Leeds United Semi-Final have already
      been dealt with, the most recent, for assault on the police, being imprisoned
      for three months on 13th June, but the following are still to come, and are
      pleading not guilty to offences of threatening, abusive and insulting
      behaviour:-

Dear Pan!,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975/Sooaer Hooliganism

Thank you for your letter of 16th June - as you say you are supplying
os with a steady stream of matters to look into to keep us busy . . . .

On the particular point you raise the office here ©an eope quite easily
because the County Council too were very disturbed at the effect on
Sheffield on staging the recent |\ A . Cup Semi Final at B&isborougb
(referred to to your repost) and haw established a working party of
members to look into the matter generally ■with a view t® making
recommendations to all the appropriate bodies as to what might be
done. I think, therefore, I can quite simply send you a copy of the
woifcing parly’s findings when available (! feel sure that this was
intended by them in any event) and this will provide the paper you
have refliitt^ied*

I am not quite sure how quicMy the work will proceed here but
hopefully I can come back to you before too long.

                            Yours sincerely,

ap a working party of six members to investigate all aspects of
hooliganism and vandalism associated with football matches at
Hillsborough and make recommendations. The Policy Committee
would be pleased to work jointly with the City Council m this subject
and perhaps you eould let me know whether your authority wish to
have a joint working arrangement.

     Dear 3ohn

     SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975
     SOCCER HOOLIGANISfl

.. I enclose a copy of a paper which we put to the Basting yastorday of the
   Association's Police and Fire Committee. Ths two issues it covers i.e.
   how to deal with vandalism including in particular "soccer hooliganism”,
   and whether or not the Safety of Sports Grounde Act is already inadequate
   or worse, and whether we should make representations as proposed in
   paragraph 9, were matters which our Committee containing as it does a
   preponderance of new members felt unprepared to grapple with at this
   meeting. Instead, they asked whether the Legal Panel would be willing
   to disentangle these matters and prepare a further paper for the
   Committee*8 consideration.

     I write therefore to ask whether you would be willing to take this on and
     if so I will write to the chief constable and fire officer advisers to
     the Committee asking if they will send you their comments on the subject.

     I hope you will not feel that we are abusing the Advisory Panel‘system -
     rather a lot seams to bs coming your way, but then you did volunteer to
     help thie particularly active Committee!

     Y ourp'si^icerely



     P Hodgson
                                                                      Item Np. 15

       AMA P&F 77 52

       SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975:    SOCCER HOOLIGANISM

       1. The purpose of this Act was to implement the recommendations of the
       Inquiry into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds (1972); it requires safety
       certificates from the local authority for designated grounds.

       2. The first designation order was made last year and named the grounds
       of clubs in the First Division of the Football League and those used
       for international matches.

       3. Ministers announced that Second Division grounds will not be
       designated until the effects of the first prder have been reviewed and
       the Home Office are not at present contemplating any further major
       extension of the existing range of designated grounds.

       4. West Yorkshire consider that other grounds in the area of the County
       Council possibly constitute a greater risk to the public either because
       the ground was not designated to sych a high standard or because outbreaks
       of violence and vandalism were more likely and therefore should be
       designated. West Yorkshire realise the costs associated with designation
       are high but believe that public safety outweigh cost considerations.
       They have asked the Association to support them and make representations
       for an extension of the current Designation Order under the Act so as
       to enable local authorities to ensure that safety is maintained at
       further sports grounds.

       5. Sheffield feel the Act in some ways an impediment to getting local
       legislation to control hooliganism at sporting events. Since it deals
       principally with safety provisions inside grounds rather than, e.g.,
       control of numbers for reasons of the surrounding districts. They have
       had strong protests against staging F.A. Cup semi-finals at Hillsborough
       and ask if other authorities have had similar representations.

      6. More particularly on the "football hooliganism" aspect, West Yorkshire
      Police Authority commissioned a special study on the involvement of police
      manpower at football matches and at public gatherings so far as the
      incidence of violence and vandalism is concerned. Enclosed is their
...   report, already sent to the Home Secretary and to the Minister for Sport
      and Recreation: West Yorkshire feel the report is of sufficient interest
      to be discussed by the Police and Fire Committee.

      7. The ACC invite AMA support for representations to the Home Secretary to
      review the present treatment of offenders by making sentences a greater
      deterrent, to study further the effect of the media on football hooliganism,
      and to provide for local authority elected member representation at meetings
      with representatives of the football organisations, Government departments,
      British Rail, the police service and others; and to the Minister with
      responsibility for sport to include local authority elected member
      representation bn the Minister's working party on crowd control. (ACC
      action is consequent on representations from Nottinghamshire).

      8. On 25 March during a debate in the House of Commons the Minister of
      State, Home Office, said that football hooliganism "is not an easy problem,
      not susceptible for simple remedies, but is best sorted out by those who
      are most closely concerned, by arranging counter-measures locally,
      requiring co-operation of football clubs, supporters' clubs, transport




      2299/77                           3.
 undertakers, and the relevant police forces." The Minister outlined the
 practical g*teps now being taken by seeing e.g., that transport arrives
 shortly before a game and departs shortly after it, that the consumption
 of alcohol is ^pictly controlled; he referred to the need for grounds
 to have safety certificates, and to the increased penalties prpposed
 in the current Criminal Law Bill.

 9.   The following points are therefore for the Committee's consideration

        (1) Dq they wish to make representations for extending the
        present designation order urider the 1975 Act as suggested
        by West Yorkshire?

        (2) Do they feel the Act a hindrance to obtaining further
        powers of control over ’’football hooliganism" inside or
        outside a sports ground?

        (3) Have they any specific qpnpents on the report from
        West Yorkshire?

        (4) Do they support the ACC representations for review of
        the treatment of offenders; and for greater involvement of
        local authority representatives in on-going studies of the
        problem and at "ad hoc" meetings with the parties concerned?

Dear Roy,
       I enclose a letter from Denis Howell
on the subject of football hooliganism
which you .raised with me in your letter of
the 3rd May.
       This is not particularly satisfactory,
and I think a lot of public campaigning will
have to be undertaken if we are ever going
to get a sensible solution to this problem.

                         /nnrs     sincerely//_

/   Thank you for your letter of 10 Mav enclosing this one from
    Councillor Roy Thwaites o f ________________  Sheffield, about
    the action requested, by local residents to prevent misbehaviour
    by supporters attending football matches at Hillsborough.
    He also sent me a copy of his letter direct and I am replying
    in similar terms.
    I sympathise with the inconvenience and distress suffered by ^
    people who live near football grounds. It is, of course, quite
    intolerable that innocent ueople should have to suffer because
    of the activities of so-called football supporters. But
    holding the FA Cup semi-final and other special matches elsewhere
    would only serve to transfer the problem to someone else*s
    doorstep when our aim should be to bring hooliganism under
    control. It may be that we can ensure that an allocation
    of tickets for certain matches can be confined to visiting
    supporters whose good conduct can be guaranteed.

    I have asked the Football League to let me have their views
    on the possibility of football clubs insuring against damage to
    property in the vicinity of their grounds arising from acts
    of hooliganism.
    The Working Party on Crowd Behaviour, which I chair, has
    constantly emphasised that a systematic.approach to the problem
    involving all the organisations concerned, is essential. There
    is no substitute for effective planning before each match and
    we have recommended close and advance liaison between the
    football clubs and the local police forces (including the force
    in whose area the visiting team is situated), railway and coach
    operators and responsible supporters’ organisations.

    The Working Party has advised that supporters travelling to away
    matches should, wherever possible, be encouraged to travel in




                                                                                   1
trains, or coaches chartered by responsible supporters’ •
organisations, and that all transport should be effectively
stewarded throughout the Journey. It also favours strict control
over the timing of journeys to matches so that the supporters
arrive and depart within a reasonable time of the beginning
and end of the match. Such control over transport makes the job
of the police in shepherding visiting supporters between
the setting down point or railway station and the ground that
much less complicated.

Some recent and serious incidents which have taken place where
the Working Party's recommendations were disregarded have
perhaps brought home the message that all concerned must accept
their share of responsibility in tackling the problem of
hooliganism.
I quite agree that the way in which the news media publicise
incidents of hooliganism and prophesy further outbreaks may
exacerbate the situation. Although I deplore the sensational
treatment which incidents frequently receive, a press is an
integral part of a free society and one can only hope that more
responsible attitudes will gradually prevail.

My Working Party will be meeting again soon to review the events
of the past season and to examine the scope for further initiative
against hooliganism. I hope that we can improve our strategy
to minimise the opportunities for misbehaviour of the type
which has occurred in Sheffield and other cities.

Thank you for your letter of 30 April, forwarding a resolution
on the action requested by local residents to prevent misbehaviour
by football supporters attending matches at Hillsborough. You
also wrote to Frank Hooley MP to whom I am replying in similar
terms.

I sympathise with the inconvenience and distress suffered by
people who live near football grounds. It is, of course, auite
intolerable that innocent people should have to suffer because
of the activities of so-called football supporters. But holding
the FA Cup semi-final and other special matches elsewhere would
only serve to transfer the problem to someone else's doorstep
when our aim should be to bring hooliganism under control. It
may be that we can ensure that an allocation of tickets for"
certain matches can be confined to visiting supporters whose-
good conduct can be guaranteed.

I have asked the Football League to let me have their views on
the possibility of football clubs 'insuring against damage to
property in the vicinity of their grounds arising from acts of
hooliganism.

The Working Party on Crowd Behaviour, which I chair, has
consistently emphasised that a systematic approach to the oroblem
involving all the organisations concerned, is essential. There
is no substitute for effective planning before each match and we
have recommended close and advance liaison between the football
clubs and the local police forces (including the force in whose
area the visiting team is situated),railway and coach operators
and responsible supporters' organisations.

The Working Party has advised that supporters travelling to away
matches should, wherever possible, be encouraged to travel in
trains, or coaches chartered by responsible supporters'
organisations, and that all transport should be effectively
stewarded throughout the journey. It also favours strict control
over the timing of journeys to matches so that the supporters
arrive and depart within a reasonable time of the beginning and
end of the match. Such control over transport makes the job of
the police in shepherding visiting supporters between the setting
down point or railway station and the grounds that much less
complicated.
Some recent and serious incidents which have taken place where
the Working Party’s recommendations were disregarded have
perhaps brought home the message that all concerned must accept
their share of responsibility in tackling the problem of
hooliganism.

I quite agree that the way in which the news media publicise
incidents of hooliganism and prophesy further outbreaks may
exacerbate the situation. Although I deplore the sensational
treatment which incidents frequently receive a free press is an
integral part of a free society and one can only hope that
more responsible attitudes will gradually prevail.

My Working Party will be meeting again soon to review events of
the past season and to examine the scope for further initiative
against hooliganism. I hope that we can improve our strategy
to minimise the opportunities for misbehaviour of the type which
has occurred in Sheffield and other cities.

 Thank you for your letter of 19 May about
 the meeting proposed by the City of
 Sheffield Council to' discuss football
•vandalism.

I have told the Council that I am content
for the Football Association and Football
League to put my views to the meeting —
both organisations are represented on my
working party on crowd behaviour. - and 'to
report back to me, but that I should be
glad to arrange for one of my people
to attend if the Council.feel this would be
helpful.

Dear Roy,

     Herewith latest on soccer hooliganism from
Merlyn Rees. I thought as you chaired, the
meeting you should be the one to receive copies
of correspondence.

                                 Kindest regards,
                    SLC^fj.

       O j , OJ


       : Thank you for your recent letter seeking a Government .Committee
   of Enauiry into soccer hooliganism. Since writing you will have
   received Lord Harris5 letter of 9th Hay (in reply to your earlier
   letter) in which he describes some of the measures being taken to
   deal with this problem.
         On 13 th May I chaired a further meeting with the police,^
   football organisations and transport undertakings to review the^ _
   position and to encourage the existing co-operation with, the polxee
   by the organisations who can help to deal with -this unpleasant
   ■ohenomenon. Enclosed is a copy of a- paper which we discussec;,
   and which sets out the main steps which we have taken.

        You will know that together with my ministerial colleagues'a
  keep this subject under constant review and that, in addition to my
  meetings, Denis Howell the Minister for Sport, has a Woritxng -sr;~y_
  on Crowd Behaviour where problems and initiatives are discusser;. «l
  and my officials also have frequent discussions with the police.
  All these efforts have helped in a. variety of ways. This dcesjizt
  mean of course that I am satisfied that we have found the s0 iUt2.cn
  or that there is any complacency on my part or by thcse_who^have ~o
        the practical measures to deal with the problem. But ^1
  thfpe is a real .awareness by all concerned of the nature of the
  difficulties .and the ways in which they can help to _overcome
  ia%>rder to protect the great majority of people - including          Vwd -

  siipporters      who are justifiably angry about the -behaviour of •~sa.
 .ht*ol,ican '.minority.
           In these circumstances I do not think an official enquiry woulc
  be profitable: the nature of the problem is known and all_ccncsrnei
  B 2?e* t 2?ylng to achieve the right combination of measures which,-if^
  it will .not cure the condition, may at least keep it under ccntr-c^.

       I hope you will not consider this a negative response. I fully
 'share the concern felt by you and your constituents,^and hope you wi
  agree:that the continuing efforts which I have described'are a
 .sensible approach to the problem.

       FOOTBALL HOOLIGANISM -'MEETING ON FRIDAY, 1.3 MAY 1977



GENERAL                                                        .'V .


      At the meeting on 14 December the measures being taken to
counter football hooliganism were examined and it .was agreed that
the police needed the help and co-operation of the football
authorities, football clubs, supporters’ organisations and transport
undertakings in.planning counter-measures for particular matches.
The purpose of this note is to remind those attending of the main
areas covered at the previous meeting and to review developments
since.            ...                              ;V


PENALTIES   -   . .                                 ' ■ ■ ■ W' v ' . -      •'


      (a)   In December the Home Secretary said he was reviewing the
powers available to the courts in the light of suggestions that had been
made. .                            .... ' -
      (b)   Offenders aged under 17 may already be taken out of
circulation on J&turday afternoons if they are ntaue the subject of a
junior attendance centre order.    There are 60 such ccntres In the
main centres of population in England and Wales.    The Home Secretary •
has decided to expand those centres and consultations are in hand
with the 'Department of Health and Social Security, Chief Constables
and the courts about where new centres might be needed roost.

      Cc) Offenders aged over 17 may, subject to certain conditions,
be made the subject of a community service order in areas where scherr-es
are available.   In most areas the bulk of community service work is
carried out at week-ends, including Saturday afternoons.

       (d) The Criminal Law Bill now before Parliament proposes
 increases in the maximum fines for criminal damage and unlawful wounding
 and assaulting a police constable etc. to £1,000 for an adult, £200 for
 a young person, and £50 for a child.   It also increases the amounts
 payable by offenders in compensation and provides better sanctions for
.the enforcement of fines payable by juveniles.   The Bill also proposes
'to make it easier for an attendance centre order to be made against a
 juvenile convicted by a court in an area away from his house.
       (e)   In view of the positive powers which are already available
taken together with the changes the Criminal Law Bill proposes, and of the
strain which a new power to order offenders to report to police station
on Saturday afternoon would place on the police at times when they are
alreadi' busy, the Home Secretary has decided after very careful consider­
ation not to seek the creation of such a new power.
      (f) As regards particular offenders, it remains, of course, a
matter for the courts to decide how to deal with them.
TRANSPORT


      (a) The control of supporters on transport to and from
matches has been recognised as a necessity.    The police need
information from supporters* clubs and transport undertakings
(including British Rail) about the movements of supporters in
connection with particular matches.         •;

       (b) The Secretary of State for Transport has asked the
 Chairman of British Rail to ensure that the policy on the
•stewarding of all chartered trains, and on the control of. sales
 of alcohol at buffets and off-licences on trains and stations when
 trouble is anticipated, was fully understood by all senior local
•management.   The Chairman has assured the Secretary of State that
 this policy is known and adhered to.           -

       (c) Many coach operators voluntarily provide the information
needed by the police and the Secretary of State for Transport has
made .it clear that the good offices of the Traffic Commissioners are
available in cases of difficulty.

      (d) The police face problems resulting from their difficulty
in making contact with supporters clubs from areas outside that of
the team they support.   Good links with coach operators should help
to overcome those problems.   In addition, the Minister of State for
Sport is planning to include the subject on the agenda of the next
meeting of his working party on crowd behavior.


 DRINK


       Clubs and supporters’ organisations can do much to control
 drinking inside the grounds and on specially chartered transport.
 They, and the transport undertakings, can also help.to reduce drinking
 by ensuring that supporters do not have to spend long periods before
 and after an away match with nothing to do.


 SUPPORTERS AT AWAY MATCHES


      The Minister for Sport announced in Parliament on 6 April further
measures which the football organisations were taking to deal with
supporters going to away matches.   Matches in which Manchester United
play away were to be all-ticket matches, and tickets would not be
available to Manchester United supporters.   Similar restrictions have
since been made in respect of the Chelsea club.

                Working P arty on Vandalism




                I am not su re when we a re intending to call this together f irs t, but perhaps
                you can have a word with me on that. I have had Mr Richman, Clerk to
                the Sheffield M agistrates, on the phone, saying that they a re of course
                in terested in hooliganism and our working p arty to consider the issu es.
                He has spoken to his Chairm an, and v ery inform ally they a re suggesting
                that they too a re concerned about the hooliganism problem and have been
                thinking about it and would welcome any approach we made to them and be
                delighted to give any help they could. In p a rtic u la r Richman wondered
                w hether our working p arty would like to attend Court when a num ber of
                 outstanding hooliganism cases a re on, arisin g out of the Hillsborough Cup
                 S em i-F inal incidents. Apparently they s till have a considerable num ber of
                 th ese cases. As soon as a few guilty pleas»svere sent to priso n or to
                 detention centre, the others all changed th e ir pleas so they now have a lot
                 of cases to be dealt with to dates stretch in g w ell into July. They a re also
                 in terested in the Community Service O rder Scheme which has made
                 sp ecial p ro g re ss in South Y orkshire, and Attendance C entres fo r the
                  17 to 21 age group, which don't exist in South Y orkshire. They a re
                  concerned about the influence of liquor licences on the whole subject.

Dear Sir,
The County Council’s Policy Committee recently considered a letter and
enclosure from County Councillor Boy Thwaltes regarding a recent meeting
of residents bom the vicinity of Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground called
to discuss the growing concern at acts of vandalism and associated disruptive
activities in the area which occurred when football matches were held at
Hillsborough Stadium and which had been particularly serious at the recent
FA Cup Semi-Final. Members gave long and serious consideration to the
issues raised and amongst the recommendation eventually made was a
decision to acquaint you with the feets and ask for your comments thereon.
1 accordingly enclose a copy of Councillor Thwaltes* letter and enclosure
and shall be grateful if you will let me have your observations as soon as
possible.
For your information, a working party is to be set up to investigate every
aspect of this miry disturbing situation awl your early comments would
accordingly be of great assistance.
                                     Tours faithfully,




                                     Chief Executive

F. A. Cup Semi-Final - Hillsborough Football Stadium
April 83rd, 107?                                                             24.5.77

I understand you require a briefing note on tbe above to assist you at the Exeoutlve
Meeting on Friday of this week. A copy of Councillor Thwaltes' totter (and your
reply thereto) is attached to this memo and I do not propose to relate tbe filets of
that unfortunate Saturday again.
1,      Safety of Sports Grounds Act
At tbe present time In this situation, the above Act does not help os at all. It only
applies to certain designated grounds (1st Division Football Clubs, Wembley Stadium
and certain Bugby International Grounds Uke Twickenham and Cardiff Arms Park)
and frouads like Hillsborough are not included. Accordingly we have no specific
powers to impose requirements regarding fencing and numbers in the ground on
tbe Sheffield Wednesday Football Cli* In the conditions of a Safely Certificate.

There is a contingency provision In Section 10 of the Act which allows the enforcing
authority (i.e. the County Council) to eater a ground not designated If they feel there
la a reasonable amount of danger for spectators attending that ground. There has
been much discussion at the Officers* Working Group on Safety of Sports Grounds
about whether or not this Section should be used against the smaller clubs in the area
suob as Doncaster. It was felt that if they had an important Cup game there against,
say, perhaps, a local first division team such as Leeds United, then a targe crowd
would be expected and safety provisions at a small ground such as Doncaster might
have to be looked at very carefttlly. However, it was felt by the O fficers that Section 10
should not be used against any of the local grounds at this stage and ! would suggest
that at Hillsborough, where farge crowds or Cup Semi Finals a re' not jxffiommon, that
there is not a sufficient degree of danger Inside tbe ground for action to be taken
under this provision.

In any caae, I do not really think that the Act has been specifically designed to deal with
this type of problem. It would appear here that the trouble arises from fens unable
to enter the ground and rampaging through tbe streets in the neighbourhood! The
Act seta out to deal with specific exits, crush barriers, sign posting of exits, the
surfeoe of terracing etc. and was not intended to tackle the problem of hooliganism.
Nevertheless, I would accept that some usefel action could be taken in this case
and'a letter from Sheffield (also attached) refers to this - see third paragraph of that
letter. ■
I understand that Mr. Barratt has written to the Home Office asking them to consider
Sheffield Wednesday*s Ground being designated to be included under the 1978 Act and
they have replied to say that they are lovestlgatiog this matter. I would imagine that
our Members would want to accelerate any official procedure by bringing pressure
to bear upon the Home Office (via the AMA ?).

F. A. Cup Semi-Final - Hillsborough Football Stadium
April 23*d, 1977                                                             24.6.77


I understand you require a briefing note on the above to assist you at the Executive
Meeting on Friday of this week. A copy of Councillor Thwaltes' letter (ami your
reply thereto) is attached to this memo and I do not propose to relate the &ots of
that unfortunate Saturday again.

1.      Safety of Sporta Grounds Act

At the present time in this situation, the above Aot does not help us at all. It only
applies to certain designated grounds (1st Division Football Clubs, Wembley Stadium
and certain Rugby International Grounds Uke Twickenham and Cardiff Arms Park)
and grounds like Hillsborough are not Included. Accordingly we have no specific
powers to impose requirements regarding fencing and numbers In the ground on
th© Sheffield Wednesday Football Club in the conditions of a Safety Certificate.

There is a contingency provision in Section 10 of the Act which allows the enforcing
authority (i.e . the County Council) to enter a ground not designated If they feet there
is a reasonable’amount of danger for spectators attending that ground. There has
been much discussion at the Officers’ Working Group on Safety of Sports Grounds
about whether or not th!«i Section ihould be used against the smaller clubs in the area
such as Doncaster. It was felt that If they had an Important Cup game there against,
say, perhaps, a local first division team such as Leeds United, then a targe crowd
would be expected and safety provisions at a small ground such as Doncaster might
have to be looked at very oarelblly. However, It was felt by the Officers that Section 10
should not be used against any of the local grounds at this stage and ! would suggest
that at Hillsborough, where large crowds or Cup Semi Finals are ootjjueommon, that
there la not a sufficient degree of danger Inside the ground for action to be taken
under this provision.

In any case, I do not really think that the Aot has been specifically designed to deal with
this type of problem. It would appear here that the trouble arises from fans unable
to enter tip ground and rampaging through tbe streets la the nelghbourhoodl The
Act sets out to deal with specific exits, crush barriers, sign posting of exits, the
surface of terracing etc. and w«a not Intended to tackle the problem of hooliganism.
Nevertheless, 1 would accept that some useful action could be taken In this case
ao^'a letter from Sheffield (also attached) refers to this - see third paragraph of that
lefcter.

I understand tint Mr. Barratt has written to the Rome Office asking them to consider
Sheffield Wednesday's Ground being designated to be Included under the 1975 Act and
they have replied to ja y that they axe Investigating this matter. I would Imagine that
our Members would want to accelerate any official procedure by bringing pressure
to bear upon the Horae Offloe (via the AMA?).
M r. Mfcllett                                                    24th May, 1977
                                       2.

2.        The Riot (Damages! Act 1886

We have received various claims under this little knows legislation for compensation to
be paid to residents in the Hillsborough area for damage that occurred on the day to their
property. This Is mostly for damaged glass door panels, damage to windows, damage
to front doors and to cars parkfcd In the road outside residents* houses.

There have been one or two cases on this and one of the latest ones was In 1975 when
some 150 Chelsea supporters ran amock in the Fulham Road and caused a great deal
of damage. Claims for £10,000 from local shopkeepers, businessmen and residents
in the area were sent to the District Receiver of the Metropolitan Police Force who
is responsible for policing that area.

To be successful, there are five criteria in law that the claimant must meet to establish
that a riot has token place. These axe as follows:

1.        number of persons not less than three
il.       a common purpose
ill.      execution or Inception of common purpose
lv.       Intent on the part of a person engfged to assist each other
           by force If necessary
v.         force or violence displayed so as to alarm at least one person
           of reasonable firmness and courage.

Judging by previous cases and the peports of the events of that day I would think that
most of the claimants would he able to meet these criteria at Hillsborough. I have
discussed this aspect of the matter with both Mr. Mead (Assistant Cbtef Constable Operations)
and Mr. Thompson (Insurance Officer In oar Treasurer's Department). In the normal
course of the events suoh claims as these would be passed straight through to our
Insurance Officers and would be dealt with by our company. Mr. Thompson believes
that in these cases the Insurance company would meet the claims.

However, because of the publicity which this matter has received and the involvement
of the police they, quite rightly I believe, wish to maintain some sort of involvement.
Accordingly, I understand that they are writing to us to say that thev do not believe a riot     .
in the technical sense took place on that day and secondly, the police on auty at the ground
and outside, did all that they oould to restrain disorderly behaviour. If these two points
are accepted and noted, then Mr. Barxatt has no obgecttof to any claims being settled
by the Insurance company. Obviously, the danger to which all must be aware is that             -v\; •



a few successful claims may precipitate a deluge of applications for compensation under
this Act, genuine or otherwise*

1 await the letter from Mr. Mead at Police Headquarters and on receipt of this, will
arrange for the Insurance procedure to be commenced and prepare a report to Inform
the new Polloe Committee of the situation.

3 * _      g fia f ia l-   •

I do not think we have any powers to close football grounds, ban games or prevent people
from walking on the streets. Indeed, I would q» stion whether we would obtain such
powers from Parliament and, further, would doubt If these powers are at alkdeslrable.
As for as disturbances around the ground are concerned, the police are thrown back to the
general law on breach of the peace; usually, of course, conduct such as this leads to a
further charge (suoh as assaulting a policeman in the course of his duty) when the police
tackle boisterous Bans.
The D epartm ent had been advised that the gap in pow ers did not preclude
the Rotherham and Sheffield D istrict Councils from subm itting tenders for
work providing it was made c le a r as a condition of any tender that it could
not be accepted before the powers w ere resto re d .

RESOLVED - That the position be noted.

14 ._____ V andalism e tc . - Complaints from resid en ts a t Hillsborough

Consideration was given to a le tte r and enclosures from
Councillor R. Thw aites regarding a recen t m eeting of residents from
the vicinity of Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground called to discuss the
growing concern at a c ts of vandalism and associated disruptive
activ ities in the a re a which o ccurred when football m atches w ere held
at Hillsborough Stadium and which had been p articu larly serious at the
rec en t F .A . Cup S em i-F in al.

The Chief Executive also subm itted a copy of a le tte r in reply to
C ouncillor Thwaites which outlined the m ain statutory provisions open
to the County Council to deal with such behaviour.

RESOLVED -

1.       That a copy of C ouncillor T hw aites' le tte r and enclosure be
forw arded to the Football A ssociation and th e ir com m ents sought.

2.       That consideration be given to the various pow ers of the County
C ouncil relevant to the problem and that the whole aspect of hooliganism
and asso ciated behaviour a t soccer m atches in South Y orkshire be
considered by Policy A dvisory Sub-Com m ittees 'A' and fB \

15.      Employm ent Prom otion P rogram m e

C onsideration w as given to a joint re p o rt of the Chief Executive, County
T re a s u re r and County Planning O fficer originally considered by the
Planning Com m ittee on 11th A pril, 1977, on the Employment Prom otion
P ro g ram m e and in p a rtic u la r the County C ouncil's participation in the
Tham es R iv er Pageant and associated p ro je c ts.

Dear Councillor Thwaites,                                                      '        •

F. A. Cup Semi Final Hillsborough, Sheffield

I refer to your letter of the 1st May, 1977 "to the Chief Executive, which
has been passed to me for my attention in view of the legal implications
of some of the points you raise.

Basically, I feel that the present problem is not one that lends itself
to a simple or convenient solution.    One way may be by way of legislation,
and in this connection, I would draw your attention to the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act 1975 which was brought into effect on the 1st September,
1975*   Whilst it must be admitted that the Act at present is primarily
concerned with safety within the Sports Ground the principles therein
could, no doubt, be extended to cover aspects of safety within the
immediate environment of the Sports Stadium.    Moreover, even within its
existing framework it might be possible, by taking steps such as perming
within the Stadium, restricting the numbers admitted, and complete
segregation of rival factions to avoid certain of the present difficulties,
particularly, if different sections of the Sports Ground were released
at different intervals with the Police ensuring that each group was well
dispersed before the next was released thereby avoiding rival crowds of
supporters forming outside the ground.

However, whilst the Act provides that it can apply to any Sports Ground
having accommodation for more than 10,000 spectators before it actually
applies to any particular Sports Ground that ground must be designated
by order of the Secretary of State, and unfortunately, the 1976 Safety
of Sports Ground (Designation) Order which came into effect on the 1st
January of this year did not include within the 27 Sports Grounds set
out therein the Hillsborough ground.   It may well be that it is intended
to include it within a subsequent list but I am not aware of any official
indication to this effect.   However, as the administration of this Act
is an obligation placed by the statute upon County Councils I shall write
to the Chief Executive of the South Yorkshire County Council who may be
more aware of current proposals with regard to this ground.


                                                                                      continued

Turning now to paragraphs 6 and 8 of the Resolution enclosed with your
letter, and, in particular, to paragraph 6.     Whilst clearly it is
possible in theory to implement this system you suggest I doubt
very much .whether it will ha.ve any real effect upon the problem in
question.    At best it can save the residents in the immediate vicinity
of the ground a certain amount of transitory inconvenience but inevitably
such restrictions can only operate over a limited area and people will
simply park on adjacent unrestricted areas.     In effect this means that
the problem of parking has been transferred from the immediate vicinity
to areas slightly further removed.     Moreover, it would not be practical
to have such a system on a permanent large scale basis as this might
have far reaching effects upon, among-t other things, the local shops
 and shopping areas.

So far as paragraph 8 of the Resolution is concerned, in its present form,
I would respectfully suggest that it is somewhat impracticable, and X
do not feel there is a possibility^ of local authorities being granted
such a wide reaching power.    Moreover, in the unlikely event of such
power being given it is fairly likely that it would be coupled with a^
statutory right to compensation in the event of the poxfer being exercised.

I would add that I have a great deal of sympathy with the residents, and
that I shall continue to investigate every possibility of dealing with
these problems.   As indicated I am taking up the matter of the Safety
of Sports Ground Act with the County Council and perhaps something
useful will result from such approach.   I will, of course, keep you
informed of any developments.

.Yours sincerely,




 Head of Department.

Sheffield S6



Dear Roy,

        Thank you for your letter of the 3rd May.

        I have every sympathy with the pfeople who
suffer from soccer hooliganism.   I will draw your
letter to the attention of Denis Howell, but I
think it would not be a bad thing if the residents
of Hillsborough organised a few public demos
themselves.
        One technique might be to get hold of a
few old lorries and old cars and block the entrance
the next time a match is on.
        It is time somebody made a major counter­
attack on the football gangsters.


                               /Yours^sincerely/,?

CHIEF CONSTABLE                                          10th May, 1977




       Councillor R. Thwaites,

        SHEFFIELD.       S6




        Dear Councillor Thwaites,

        In your letter of 1st May, 1977, you sought my views on a number
        of points contained in a resolution adopted by residents who live
        near the Sheffield YJednesday Football Ground. Before giving my
        comments I should like to make two points. Only a relatively small
        proportion of football supporters are trouble makers and any
        controlling measures must, of necessity, have to apply to all. One
        is thus faced with the problem of not recommending measures which
        many might consider to be oppressive. As you will know, there are
        five Football League grounds in South Yorkshire and it is not
        uncommon for four local teems to play at home on the same day.
        Although there is no other 'Hillsborough', police supervision on a.
        greatly enhanced scale would be necessary to meet the residents'
        proposals and many police officers would need to be diverted from
        other pressing commitments. In giving my remarks on the resolution
        I will utilise the same paragraph numbers.

         1.       This is a matter for the Football Association who are
                   responsible for the rules and organisation of the F. A. Cup
                   Competition.

        2.        There is provision for recompense to be paid by the Police
                   Authority in respect of damage which occurs strictly within
                   the provisions of the Riot (Damages) Act, 1886, as amended;
                   there is no provision to pay compensation to commercial
                   interests for loss of business and one can readily foresee
                   difficulties in making reliable assessments.

         3.       You will appreciate that Football Clubs already pay for
                   policing inside the ground; to make Clubs responsible for the
                   cost of damage and extra policing outside the ground would
                   require legislation.

         4.       The police, by close liaison with British Rail and the coach
                   operators, endeavour to minimise the period of time which
                   football fans are on the streets near the ground but there
                   would be practical difficulties in ensuring that all entered
                   the ground even though the gates were open.   Many supporters
                   travel to matches by ordinary service trains and 'buses, as
                   well as by private transport - it would be virtually impossible
                   wholly to control their movements.



                                                                    continued
The provision of the large number of police officers
necessary to enforce this arrangement would be most
difficult. Many of the fans who are unable to get into
matches have generally travelled by trains and coaches
which leave after the game at a specified time. As I
have indicated, the police would not have the resources
to shepherd the large number of people which would be
involved if the residents' objective were to be
secured.

If the police were to prevent streets in the vicinity
of the ground being used for car parking then this would
undoubtedly throw the problem elsewhere. It would, in
effect, be moving the problem from one place to another.

To hold a public enquiry into events connected only with
the F.A. Cup Semi-Final at Hillsborough on Saturday,
23rd April, 1977, would put the situation which prevailed
on that day entirely out of perspective when viewed
against conditions elsewhere. I have no comment to make
on the holding of a public enquiry of more general
application except to remind you of the actions already
being taken by the Home Secretary and the Minister of
State with responsibility for sport.

Legislation would be required to give local authorities
reserve powers to ban a football match; one can foresee
practical and other problems in using such powers.

Whilst one may have critical views about the mariner in which ■
certain sections of the press deal with football hooliganism,
I do not think any form of censorship of the press is to be
encouraged.

Yours sincerely,

                Dear Sir,

                SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT, 1975
                HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM                                                        •

                Thank you for your memorandum of 3rd May, 1977.

                In my letter to the Home Office, to which you refer, I took
                particular care to mention only that part of Section 1 of the
                Act which relates to the powers of the Secretary of State. The
                powers of the County Council were not touched upon. A point
                of principle is involved which goes beyond the boundaries of
                South Yorkshire, a situation recognised by Home Office in their
                reply to me. Chief Officers of Police, individually and
                collectively, raise issues direct with Home Office and I saw no
                reason, as I was not touching upon any local powers, to pursue
                the issue via the County Council. My letter clearly sets out
                a personal view point and is not binding in any way on anyone
                else.

                I shall, of course, always refer matters concerning the County
                Council's powers under the Act to the appropriate committee
                unless there are issues in which the Chief Constable has a
                personal standing in accordance with the Act's provisions, e.g.
                Sections 5(3) and 10(4).

                The attitude of the Working Party to the Section 10 procedure
                is one I wholeheartedly endorse. To attempt to use the procedure
                for Hillsborough would, I suspect, expose us to some ridicule
                having regard to the many capacity crowds which have attended
                there over the years without great risk to spectators.

                Yours faithfully,

Dear Mr. Thwaites,

Thank you fo r y our la tte r of the 1st May about the vandalism at the FA Cup
Sem i-Finn! at Hillsborough. I w ill arra n g e fo r this to be subm itted to the next
convenient Policy Com nitttee of the County Council.

to the meantime perhaps I might make one       op   two comments on the points
raised in the resolutions.

Nos. 1.2 & 3

I think th ese ai’e m a tte rs substantially fo r consideration by the Football
A ssociation and what I think your m eeting Is saying is that you would wish the
Football A ssociation and the Individual clubs to be responsible m orally,
financially and legally fo r football hooliganism . Whilst this Is som ething
which I expect the County Council w ill have a view on, It is clearly outside
th e ir statu to ry pow ers to do anything about at p resen t.

Nos. 4 & 5

The South Y orkshire Police* augmented by contingents from nearby F orces,
put a v e ry larg e num ber of uniform ed men into controlling the crowds at
Hillsborough on the 23rd A pril. I t is of-course v irtu ally im possible to prevent
legally people a rriv in g in a town or city Tit the tim e they wish to a rriv e , to
attem pt to leg islate m th is m ight c re a te the feeling that th e re was a substantial
infringem ent of p e rso n al lib erty , and in any case, the m o re well-behaved sections
of the crowds who come to a Cup F inal m ay, and do, link th e ir v isit to the match
with legitim ate shopping and entertainm ent activ ities, which I am su re we would
a ll wish to encourage. Cne of the m ain problem s the P olice have in these so rts
of circum stan ces is that a considerable num ber of people always tu rn up at a
m ajo r football m atch of th is s o rt without tick ets end in the hope of acquiring m e.
I believe that som ething like 2,000 people fell into th is category cm the 23rd A pril.
They cannot be prevented from cem igg and when they a re in th e town, th e ir

carefully, as indeed they a re into the whole question of football hooliganism.

No. 7 ■

I think th is would be a m a tte r fo r the Home S ecretary o r the M inister of
Sport.

No, 8

Tills suggestion would of co u rse re q u ire g en eral legislation and I am not su re
w hether it is a re s e rv e pow er which Local A uthorities would welcome.
I hove no doubt th e County Council w ill have a view on th is. It is difficult to
»ee w here the Local Authority concerned would get its inform ation from
before it considered w hether to ban a m atch o r not, and what c rite ria it
should adopt. Would the County Council o r the Sheffield City Council on the
b asis of th e inform ation available p rio r to the m atch on the 23rd A pril,

This point a ls o r a is e s consideration of public policy and I can se e the
question of censorship of the p re s s being ra ise d .

D ear Mr. H iw aites,

Thank you for your letter of the 1st May about the vandalism at th* FA Cup
Semi-Final at Hillsborough. I will arr-nge for this to be submitted to the next
convenient Policy Committee of the County Council.

In the meantime perhaps I might mrke one or two comments an the points
raised In the resolutions,

Nfli, 1.2 & 3

I think these are matters substantially for consideration by the Football
Association and what I think your meeting is saying is that you would wIsh the
Football Association and the individual clubs to be responsible morally,
financially and legally for football hooliganism. Whilst this is something
which I expect the County Council will have a view on, it is olearly outside
their statutory powers to do anything about at present.

IflSi i.fc.5
The South Yorkshire Police, augmented by contingents from nearby Forces,
put a very large number of uniformed men into oontrolllng the crowds at
Hillsborough on the 23rd April, ft is of course virtually impossible to prevent
legally people arriving in a town or city at the time they wish to arrive, to
attempt to legislate on this might create the feeling that there was a substantial
infringement of personal liberty, and in any ease, the more wellHhehaved sections
of the crowds who come to a Cup Final may, and do, link their visit to the match
with legitimate shopping and entertainment activities, whloh I am sure we would
all wish to encourage. One of the main problems the Police have in these sorts
of elroumstanoes is that a considerable number of people always turn up at a
major football matoh of this sort without tickets and in the hope of acquiring one.
I believe that something like 2,000 people fell Into this category on the 23rd April.
They cannot be prevented from corolgg and when they are in the town, their

coaches or trains will not return for two or three hours. I know that this
is an issue which the Home Secretary and the Home Office are looking at
carefully, as indeed they are into the whole question of football hooliganism.

No. 7

I think this would be a matter for the Home Secretary or the Minister of
Sport.

No. 8

This suggestion would of course require general legislation and I am not sure
whether it is a reserve power which Local Authorities would welcome.
I have no doubt the County Council will have a view on this. It is difficult to
see where the Local Authority concerned would get Its Information from
before tt considered whether to ban a match or not, and what criteria it
should adopt. Would the County Council or the Sheffield City Council on the
basis of the information available prior to the match on the 23rd April,
knowing of the great public interest in the match aad the extensive Police
precautions, have banned the whole of the match?

No. 9

This point also raises consideration of public policy and I can see the
question of censorship of the press being raised.

I am not sure that what I have said is of any help and In any case tt Is only my
personal thoughts. As I say 1 will report this letter to the Policy Committee.

Yours sincerely,




Chief Executive

    the ground of Sheffield W e dn e s d a y F C .

              We are looking into your suggestion that Hillsborough should be
    designated under the 1975 Act as requiring a safety certificate and
    will write to you as soon as a decision on this matter is reached.       At
    this stage I would wis h only to make the point that in so far as
    Hillsborough Stadium is not alone in being a ground that is occasionally
    used For important games, although the clubs is not itself i.n the
    F i r s t Division, we shall, have to look rather carefully at any case for
    exceptional treatment.

           For the attention of                                                                                   30 March 1977
           Mr N Maclaine


           Dear sir
                                                                                                                     1
           H OME OFFICE CIRCULAR N O . 130/76

           I refer to the above Circular which was issued on 26 August 1976 in
           connection with the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975, and also to
           SI 1976 N o . 1264 which designated under the Act, with effect from
           1 January 1977, the International Association of Rugby Union Football
           Grounds and those of the Clubs in the First Division of the Football
           League.

           As you will be aware, the replay of the final of the Football League
           Cup was staged at Hillsborough Stadium, the home of Sheffield
           Wednesday Football Club currently playing in the Third Division." As
           you will also know, the FA Cup semi-final between Manchester United
           and Leeds United is to be staged at the same venue on the afternoon
           of 23 April 1977.   Indeed, for many years it has been customary to
           stage important games of this nature at the Hillsborough Stadium.
           P'or the League Cup Final there was a crowd of 55,000 and it is
           expected that the same number of persons will attend the match on
           23 April.

           Whilst I understand the reasons at this stage for only designating
           grounds in the First Division of the Football League, it does seem to
           me that consideration ought to be given to designating other grounds
           having regard to the nature of the matches which are likely to be
           played there rather than the Division of the Football League in which
           a Club currently plays.

       Perhaps you will be kind enough to take into account my observations
       when the extension of the general safety certificate requirements are
       being considered.

       I am sending a copy of this letter to the Chief Executive of the South
       Yorkshire County Council.

       Yours faithfully




       Chief Constab'

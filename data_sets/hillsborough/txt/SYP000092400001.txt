              the    following.

              I left the West S ta n d seating area via the stairs at the                                              rear of the

              stand.      i. w ould estirriate the t a.me to be about                                   p"\ z>'<dz>s   nours

              two metres        from the       tunnel         entrance w hich was              Vo my      left.         Directly        in
Gvr           front    of me almost as you got to the end of                                   e stairs         1 saw a youtn

              of about 25 years.               He was white                 or medib^m p uild.          I think he may

              have    had a moustache.               I cannot           remember any more             of his d e s c r iption

              He was     lying w ith his head towards                            the tunnel    entrance,          flat       on his

              back    on the floor.            His       face was           chalk white and my first                    impression
                   was    that      life was        extinct*        I leaned over              ttfe    y outh and felt       his

                   fo r ehead which was              stone      cold*      This    con/irrned my fear              that the man

                   was    dead.           l was sudde n l y aware          of a He i i ca officer and another                       fan

                   beside me.              I also    saw    lying    beside A h e         man a black           personal     stereo

                   and    cannot          remember      the make     but    ik    contained a tape.                I thought         the

                   stereo       b elonged with the d e c e a s e / so              I placed            it in my    pocket and the

       lofe        officer and I carried the youth J to a w a i ting a m b u 1ance and                                   pIaced h i m

                   directly         in front        of the tunryei.           No one       in the vicinity of t m s

                   bucket       of water        next to him.            1 placed my hands                in the water arm

                   rubbed them over his                  face    in an attempt            to    revive     him.     He was

                   breathing         but ob v i o u s l y    in great       distress.             1 left him w ith the              police

                   or two young             fans who were         crying.         I knew that 4 or 5 fans were                       dead.

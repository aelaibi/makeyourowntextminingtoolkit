           HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - CRUSH BARRIER 124A

           I refer to your letter dated 1 December 1989 in which you indicate you
           are satisfied with the work carried out by the Health and Safety
           Executive.

            In the light of your response I am now writing to the Director of Public
            Prosecutions to say that the barrier, or parts of it, can now be released
            for the purposes of further examination, subject to the Director of
            Public Prosecutions having a representative present, who may be you.
            After tests have been completed by the interested parties then the^
            barrier will be returned to the custody of the criminal investigation
            until the Director of Public Prosecutions has decided whether or not to
            issue proceedings.

            If the Director of Public Prosecutions is to involve you we will contact
            you in due course.  In the meantime, may I take this opportunity of
            thanking you for the work you have so far completed and have done so
            promptly.

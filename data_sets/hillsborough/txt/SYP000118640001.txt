                       1■          9.45am Saturday 15 April        1989

                       2.          Serial 1 Perimeter track - serial Sergeant 454 Chapman

                       serial Inspector Darling.

■   / \                3.          Duty point - Gate 6 in front of Spion Kop was marked on

           /^7         attached map.      I took up that position after briefing etc.

                       Only deviation was that about 1.30pm at the direction of PS Chapman,

                       I went to the gymnasium for a meal,          following which I returned to my

                       point.

                       4.          During the briefing I had been told that a large number of

                       Liverpool fans had purchased tickets for the Spion Kop, which was

                       intended to be only for Notts.         Forest fans.      It was estimated that

                       over 1000 Liverpool fans had Kop tickets and some problems were to be

                       anticipated.

                       It had been decided that the area I ’ve marked in red on the attached

                       map would be "fenced o f f ” by using Police officers as a b a r r i e r .

                       Accordingly any Liverpool fans on the Kop should be sent to that

                       area.    I was told that under no circumstances would Liverpool fans be

                       escorted from the Kop to either the West or North stand.

                      .■..Explaining, this to the fans at the gate kept me quite busy.          I was
         ■   ■                                                     . PAGE ;. .2
                                                                           R225

amazed at their attitude which was abusive insulting and aggressive.

Even though the tickets quite plainly stated that it was for a Notts.

Forest supporters area the Liverpool fans had bought them.            I

explained about it being an all ticket match etc.           and that there was

not sufficient room for transfers etc.            Usually this explanation was

met with insults,      threats,   spitting etc.

A couple of the more "reasonable” Liverpool supporters explained to

me that they felt they were always cheated on the ticket allocations

so they (the rest of the fans),        this pair were from Manchester,       just

bought tickets for anywhere in the ground.            Then once inside asked

for a transfer.       Usually this happened,      if it didn't then they'd

agitate against w h o e v e r ’s stand they were on until the Police had to

move them for fear of causing trouble.

Whilst there was space to move on the Kop a large number of Liverpool

fans did get to the allocated area.         But once the Kop had filled

several came back to the gate complaining t h e y ’d been picked on.

Once more I told them that there was to be no transfers.           This was met

with abuse insults and threats.         Some started spitting towards me,         as

usual these were the ones at the back of the group and whilst some of

it did come through the fence most of it fell on their own "mates” in

front.       I merely moved away from the gate.

About 10 minutes prior to kick off I remember looking towards the

west stand and remarking to a passing Chief Inspector           (Mr. Greenwood

I think) w h o ’d stopped to ask if there were any problems that there

were more Liverpool      fans on the Kop than over there      (the West stand)

as there was still      large expanses of empty stand,     compared to the Kop

and South stand which were jammed full.

The game started,      following a couple of minor squabbles behind me on

the Kop,     I ’d started to wonder if perhaps we'd have been better of

escorting the Liverpool fans off the Kop after all, as there seemed
                                                                          '■ PAGE

to be so much space on the West and North stands.            I d i d n ’t have a

radio so I was unaware that they were all outside.

5.             Perhaps 10-15 minutes into    the game something happened on

the pitch      which started a fight just    behind me.

Gate 6 is adjacent to the access road to the pitch and a number of

pffleers had gathered there.        I called to them and we went onto the

Kop, as we did so the fighting stopped,         so rather than provoke

further confrontation we went back onto the track.            Whilst I was

closing the gate I was approached by two Liverpool fans who wanted

out.     I told them there was no chance of getting onto the North

stand      but if they wanted I could let them out of the ground.           After

a few seconds discussion they said they wanted out so I let them onto

the track and started to guide them up the access road.             As I did so

I looked towards the West stand and saw a large crowd had gathered at

the back of the goal and that fans were running across the pitch over

the track and up into the North       stand.    As we left the pitch area one

of the youth said to me       that he felt   sorry for us because " t h e y ’re

fucking mad,     t h e r e ’s going to be some right trouble".    Little did I

know how right he was.

I let the two lads out through gate          ’O ’ and onto Penistone Road.         As

I returned I saw that a number of mounted and dog handlers were

gathering at the head of the access road.

I went down onto the Perimeter track,          looking towards the West

stand.      I saw what appeared to be a major pitch invasion with lots of

people running, pushing etc.        The Police officers at that end

certainly seemed to be overwhelmed and I realised what all the dogs

etc, had been gathered for.

Around the edge of the pitch were erected a continuous row of wooden

advertising boards about 2 ’6 ” high.        These boards are nailed together

and then their support arms are pegged to the floor with foot long
                                                                            • '■PAGE ' ■
                                                                               R225 '

staples.      Effectively putting a 2 ’6" high barrier between the

perimeter track and the pitch.

I felt that if the horses and dogs were called onto the pitch to deal

with the crowd these advertising boards would present a problem.                   So

together with a couple of stewards and some British Transport Police

(no idea where they had come from)             I started to take the boards down.

W e ’d cleared a gap about 30-40 feet wide when the St. Johns Ambulance

came down the ramp and onto the pitch.

A short while later it returned,             either just before or just after it

a large number of Police officers were deployed across the pitch.

Gradually      a number of injured people were assisted towards my

position I noticed          that     a few appeared to   be dead.   Other fans

started to tear down the advertisements for makeshift stretchers.                   At

this time      I didn't know what had happened.          I h a d n ’t got a personal

radio and      c o u l d n ’t hear   the tannoy system   because of the noise from

the K o p .

I assisted several         injured people to the gymnasium some just in shock

others more seriously injured.

One male who was on an ambulance trolley was having difficulty

breathing,    a female Special Constable was attending him,            together we

took him to the gym, where we made him as comfortable as possible in

the circumstances,        whilst doing so we were approached by a man

claiming to be a Doctor who took over the care of the man.                The

Doctor asked us where the medical supplies were.              At that time no one

person seemed to be in charge.              I told the Doctor that the St. Johns

Ambulance had gone presumably to hospital and that the First Aid Room

was just outside.         It must have been a shock for any of the medical

staff that came forward to help to find that football grounds are not

equipped like the Casualty Department of a hospital, where they just

shout for something and it appears complete with two nurses.
                                                                              PAGE    5
                                                                              R225

The Special and I then took the stretcher back out onto the pitch.

As we left the gym I noticed that there was about 8-10 bodies laid on

the floor.      O n c e   onto the pitch some lads dropped the body of a white

male 20-25 years overweight,           short hair,   jeans and white shirt,    onto

the stretcher and made off.           We took the body back to the gym as we

arrived I noticed that even more bodies were outside.              I was told by

some CID officers that we had to take ours inside and one of us stay

with it.     We went       into the gym and unloaded the stretcher.      I asked

the Special     if she minded staying,       she was physically exhausted and

just nodded and sank to the floor at the side of the man we had just

brought i n .

I took the stretcher back out and loaded up with another injured man,

together with some youths we took the man to the gym, where I left

him with some girls who said they were nurses.              I noticed that there

was also a number of fire officers using resuscitation equipment on

injured people.

As I again left the gym I noticed the female Special still sat on the

floor with her head in her h a n d s .       T h e y ’d started to cover up the

bodies with white paper tablecloths.              I hadn't realised there were so

many dead in t h e r e .

I took the stretcher out onto the pitch and was called to the track

in front of the North stand.            An off duty ambulanceman was with a

youth assisting him to breath.           We put   the lad onto the stretcher and

carried him      towards the gym.      As we did so we noticed an ambulance

that was open it was short of one stretcher so at the crew's

direction we put the lad straight           in and he went straight off to

hospital.     The next bit is a little blurred I'd been running around

for a while      now         and   can remember being very breathless.    I went into

the gym and      saw dozens of white sheets       on the floor.   Police officers

were crying,      people shouting or just sat with vacant expressions.
                                                                              PAGE        6
                                                                              R225

Somewhere in all this I met Special Constable Pearson,              he was with a

uniformed ambulanceman,        they were giving resuscitation to a lad on a

stretcher.     I helped them towards the gym.         The ambulanceman said

that the lad had gone once and had to go to hospital             immediately.        So

we went straight to the main Police access road where the ambulances

were pulling in.      At the top of the access were two ambulances,            one

full and blocked in by another which was empty.             We put the stretcher

in and the ambulanceman started to hook up and fit the resuscitation

equipment whilst the Special helped.           I tried to find the crew but

c o u l d n ’t, an ambulance co-ordinator    {?) started to shout about moving

the lad to another ambulance.          I suggested that it made more sense

for me to drive this one so that it freed the areal got the lad to

hospital and the guy operating the resuscitation gear could keep

working on the lad.          He agreed so I drove the ambulance up to the

Northern General Hospital,         I had to get there anyway because setting

up and manning the Hospital Liaison Officer            is part of my duties in

CLD.    On arrival the lad was taken to the Intensive Care Unit where

he died some 20-30 minutes later.           I d o n ’t know his name I d i d n ’t

want to at the time,         if required I could find it out.

At   the Northern General I met with Insp. John Bennett, WPC Fletcher

and PC Horn and set up the liaison links with the incident unit at

the training s c h o o l .    I then spent the rest of the afternoon and

evening obtaining and verifying information about the injured talking

to relatives etc.      etc.

I went off duty at 2.30am Sunday 16 April           1989.

6.           One dumped on stretcher I was carrying whilst on the pitch.

Taken to gymnasium left there with female Special Constable.                 White

male,   overweight 20-25 year, short hair,         jeans, white shirt.

7.           Once I'd realised what was happening and that I w a s n ’t

going to find myself         in the middle of a 5400 strong pitched battle
   ■"V"-                                                        PAGE   '           7
                                                                        ■ R225

the fear side of it left me.      When I first saw them going onto the

pitch the scenes from Hyezel went through my |aind and I wondered if

yet again Liverpool were going to excel        themselves.    Especially with

having some 1000 plus in the Kop behind me.

For the week following the event m y own f e e l i n g s _________________

                                                                          I hope

the next time Toxteth blows up that the loyal, peaceful,          decent, well

behaved Liverpool supporters will go to the assistance of the

Merseyside Police because,     after pome of the comment attributed to

them in the press with,     to my knowledge,    no denials from them I for one

would think twice before going on a PSU to help them.

At the actual time of the incident it was very frustrating,            nobody

seemed to know what was happening or what they were suppoed to do.

We all rehearse the evacuation procedure just as Po pp le we l1.           But

then what?    Who does what? Where? I don't suppose anybody has ever

thought that far in front.       I certainly haven't before.      And yet it

is so obvious once a disaster like this has occured that the

vacuation is only the start of the problem and that the serials

really do need a disaster role allocated to them.

I was one of the lucky ones.       I knew that once I c o u l d n ’t do anymore

at the actual scene I knew what to do next,        ie get to the Northern

General and set up the liaison mechanism.

A s I was reversing the ambulance out of the access road onto

Penistone Road it occurred to me that it really is quite sensible to

have Police officers driving ambulances at such incidents to free

better qualified medical staff/ambulance personnel           to operate

resuscitation equipment or give first aid at the scene.            This flash

Of inspiration came mainly because as I backed out there was about 10

ambulanpes all double crewed waiting to get in and I thought what a

waste just sat there waiting,      when you could be inside helping.
                                                                                     PAGE ■ ■!€

8.          I have over 8 years service in the Police all of which I

have spent at F Division.         During that time I have frequently worked

football duties at Hillsborough,          Barnsley, Rotherham and Brammall Lane.

A t Hillsborough there if a policy of forking the same area or duty at

each match.    I have worked the Leppings Lane turnstiles up to going

on the Crime and Vandal unit,         during those 3 years I spent match

duties as a reserve serial and had to become familiar with all the

areas of the ground.

Over the last 8 years I think I ’ve worked every major match,                     since

April 1988 I have been in CLD.          During this time my         match     duties vary

between the South stand and the Perimeter track.

At the end of the day I think the thing that upsets                 me is the

hypocracy behind it all.        Not just by the press who           one minute are

calling for these football hooligans to be caged,                segregated etc,

then the next waxing lyrical about the feelings of being on the stands

with such a good bunch of lads.           But the TV, other Police forces,

churches,   etc.,   all joined in after a while.            I started to wonder

whether w e ’d ever had such problems as the Red Army,               the Intercity firfl

and all the rest.       Above all that though is the blindness by the

Liverpool people t h e m selv es.     I wonder why no one has asked Why did th^

Liverpool fans keep pushing forward?             What made them? They w e r e n ’t             ,

running from   fire,    e x p l o s i o n , not even being chased by p o l i c e .

So just what   did motivate them to charge through an open gate through

an expansion   area,    wheel   left and right and then force themselves down

a 12-15 foot   wide tunnel.      Finally to pressure the people on the

stand forward with enough force to crush the better part of 300

people,   killing 94.    Was    it because they were 10 minutes            late?      Wanted

a better view? Frightened to miss a bit of a match they could see on

telly or what?      Or just simply their own lack of respect for each?

The other day I watched some video tape of the Liverpool                   fans
                 r              :   •- ;        .                         .      ■   PAGE   ■

*        behaviour at Hyesel.       They d o n ’t seem to have changed,       I realise a

         lot of this is perhaps of no use to the investigation but its done me

         good to write it down.

not    sufficient                room       for       transfers                etc.           Usually             this     explanation                was

usual       these         were     the          ones          at       the    back       of     the         group     and       whilst          some       of

About       10 m i n u t e s       prior             to       kick       off       I remember                looking           t o w a r d s the

West       stand         and     remarking                to       a    passing          Chief          Inspector              (Mr.       Greenwood

I think)          who'd          stopped             to       ask       if    there          were       any       problems           that       there

were       more     Liverpool               fans          on       the       Kop    than        over         there        (the       West       stand)

as    there       was       still          large          expanses             of       empty          stand,       compared              to    the       Kop

further          confrontation                      we    went        back        onto          the       track.           Whilst          I was

closing           the       gate       I was            approached             by t w o             Liverpool          fans          who    wanted

of    the       youth          said       to     me       that        he f e l t     sorry               for    us    because          "they're

I    let    the        two      lads        out         through           gate     *0*          and       onto       Pfenistan# R o a d .               As

I    returned             I saw        that         a    number          of   mounted                and       dogh a n d l e r s      Were

gathering              at      the     head         of    the       access         road.

I went          dowri o n t o          the      Perimeter                track,         looking                towards       the       West                      !

stand.           I saw          what        appeared            to       be   a    major             pitch       invasion             with       lots       of

people          running,             pushing             etc.         The     Police                officers          at    that       end

certainly              seemed          to      be       overwhelmed               and       I       r e a l i s e d w h a t all 'the'dogs

etc,       had    been          gathered                for.                                                                                                 '

Around          the     edge         of     the         pitch       were      erected                a    continuous          row          of    wooden

advertising                 boards          about         2*6"       high.           These               boards       are    nailed             together

and    then       their          support                arms    are        pegged           to       thefloor          with          foot        long

staples.              Effectively                   putting          a    2 ’6 "     high            barrier between                   the
perimeter          track                and    the       pitch.

I felt      that           if       the       horses          and    dogs       were          called          onto       the       pitch       to       deal

with    the     crowd               these          advertising             boards             would       present             a    problem.              So

together        with            a       couple       of       stewards          and       some       British             Transport             Police

(no    idea, w h e r e              thsy       had       come       from)       I started                to    take       the       boards          down.

We'd     cleared a                  gap       about       30-40       feet          wide       when       the       St.       Johns       Ambulance

came    down       the          ramp          and    onto       the       pitch.

A   short     while             later          it    returned,             either             just       before          or       just    after          it

a   large     number                of    Police          officers             were       deployed             across             the    pitch.

Gradually          a       number              of    injured          people          were assisted                  towards            my

position        I noticed                      that a         few    appeared            to be        dead.             Other          fans

started       to       tear             down       the    advertisements                      for    makeshift                stretchers.                 At

this    tiro©      I didn't                    know what            had   happened.                  I h a d n ’t g o t            a     personal

radio     and      shouldn't                   h ear the        tannoy         system           because            of     the      noise           from

the    Kop.

I assisted             several                injured          people          to    the       gymnasium                some       just       in    shock

others      more           seriously                injured.

One    male     who         was          on    an    ambulance             t r o 1 1ey         was       having          difficulty

breathing,             a    female             Special          Constable                was       attending             hirfi,     together             we

took    him     to         the          gym,       where       we    made       him       as       comfortable                as    possible             in

the    circumstances,                         whilst          doing       so    we       were       approached                by    a    man

claiming        to         be       a    Doctor          who    took       over          the       care       of    the       man.        The

Doctor      asked           us          where       the       medical          supplies             were.           At    that          time       no    one

person      seemed              to       be    in    charge,              I told          the       Doctor          that          the    St.       Johns

Ambulance          had          gone          presumably             to    hospital                and    that       the          First      Aid        Room

was    just     outside.                      It    must       have       been       a    shock          for       any    of       the    m e d i cal

staff     that         came             forward          to    help       to    find          that       football             grounds          are       not

equipped        like            the       Casualty             Department                of    a    hospital,             where          they       just

shout     for      somethiifg                  and       it    appears          complete             with          two    nurses.

TJie S p e C i a l         and          I then       took       the       stretcher                back       out    onto          the    pitch.
As    we    left,      the     gym       I noticed           that       there       was       about        S-10       bodies          laid          on

the    floor.            Once       onto       the    pitch        some       lads       dropped           the    body          of    a white

male       20-25       years        overweight,              short       hair,          jeans        and    white          shirt,          onto

the    stretcher              and    made       off.         We    took       the       body       back     to    the       gym       as       we

arrived          I noticed           that       even       more     bodies          were          outside.            I was          told       by

some       CID    officers           t h a t , m ®,, h a d    to    take        ours         inside        and    one       of       us    stay

with       it.      We    went       into       the    gym        and    unloaded             the       stretcher.               I asked

the    Special           if    she       minded       staying,           she       was       physically           exhausted                and

just       nodded        and       sank    to    the       floor        at    the       side       of     the    man       we    had       just

brought          in.f

I    took    the       stretcher           back       out     and       loaded          up    with        another          injured             man,

together          with        some       youths       we     took       the     man      to       the     gym,    where          I    left

him    with       some        girls       who    said        tfiey w e r e         nurses.              I noticed           that          there

was    also       a .number          of    fire       officers           using          resuscitation                 equipment                on

injured          people.

As    1 again          left        the    gym    I noticed              the     female            Special        still          sat       on    th e

flo<ir w i t h         her     head       in    her    hands.            T h e y ’d      started           to    cover          up    the

bodies       with        white       paper       tablecloths.                   I hadn't             realised          there          were          so

many       dead     in    there.,

I took       the       stretcher           out       onto     the       pitch       and       was       called        to    the, t r a c k

in    front       of     the       North       stand.         An    off       duty       ambulanceman                 was       with       a

youth       assisting              him    to    breath.            We    p ut      the       lad     onto       the    stretcher                and

carried          him     towards          the    gym.         As    we       did    so       we    noticed        an       ambulance

that       was    open        it    was    short       of     one       stretcher             so     at    the    crew's

direction           we    put       the    lad       straight           in a n d        he    went        straight          off       to

hospital.              The     next       bit    is    a     little          blurred          I ’d      been     running             around

for    a while           now       and    can    remember           being          very       breathless.                  I went          into

the    gym       and     saw       dozens       of    white        sheets          on    the       floor.         Police             officers

were       crying,        people          shouting           or    just       sat       with, v a c a n t        expressions.

Somewhere           in    all       this       I met       Special           Constable             Pearson,           he    was       witK'a
uniformed                a m b u l a n c e m a n , they       were       giving          resuscitation                to    a    '.Lad o n       a

stretcher.                    I' h e l p e d    them       towards       the       gym.        The       ambulanceman                said

that          the    lad       had     gone         once    and    had       to    go    to    hospital             immediately.                 So

we     went         straight           to      the    main    Police          access          road       where       the    ambulances

were          pu\ling          in.        At    the    top    of    the       access          were       two    ambulances,                one

full          and    blocked           in      by    another       which          was    empty.           We    put    the       stretcher

in a n d        the       ambulanceman                started       to       hook       up    and     fit      the    resuscitation

equipment                whilst        the      Special       helped.              I tried          to    find       the    crew       but

couldn't,                an    ambulance             co-ordinator             (?)       started          to    shout       about       moving

the      lad        to    another           ambulance.             I suggested                that       it    made    more          sense

for      me     to       drive       this       one    so    that       it    freed          the    area,       got    the       lad       to

hospital             and       the     guy      operating          the       resuscitation                gear       could       keep

working             on    the       lad.        He    agreed       so    I drove             the    ambulance          up       to    the

Northern             General           Hospital,            I had       to    get       there       anyway          because          setting

up     and      manning             the     Hospital         Liaison          Officer          is     part      of    my    duties          in

CLD.           On    arrival           the      lad    was    taken          to    the       Intensive          Care       Unit       where

he     died         some       20-30        minutes         later.           I don't          know       his    name. I d i d n ' t

At     the      Northern             General          I met       with       I n s p . John         Bennett,          WPC       Fletcher

and      PC     Horn          and    set       up    the    liaison          links       with       the       incident          unit       at

the      training              school.              I then    spent          the    rest       of     the      afternoon             and

evening             obtaining             and       verifying       information                about          the    injured          talking

to     relatives               etc.       etc.

I went          off       duty       at     2.30am         Sunday       16 A p r i l         198 9.

the    next          ti\e    Toxteth             blows        up t h a t        the       loyal,             peaceful , decent,                      well

behaved          Liverpool                supporters            will       go       to    the       assistance              of       the

Merseyside             Policte            because,         after        some         of    the          corfimemt a t t r i b u t e d            to

would       think          twice          b^^)re        going      on      a    PSU       to     he^Zp t h e m .

At    the       actual        time         of    T^ie      incident            it    was       w ry          frustrating,                 nobody

seemed          to    know       what          was    Happening            or       whatr t h e y            were    suppoed              to    do.

We    all       rehearse             the       evacuation          procedmns                just         as    P o p p l e w e l 1.            But

then       wh-at?          Who       does       what?       WhVre?         I ydfon't           suppose             anybody           has       ever

thought          that,       far      in       front.         I cV^yainly                 haven't             before.            And       yet       it

is    so    obvious           once         a    disaster         1ime^this                has       occured          that        the

really          do    need       a    disaster                le a l l o c a t e d          to      them.                                                      -

           At    i\llsborough                 there        is     a    policy          of       working       the       same       area       o r d u t y at

           areas       of     the   Vround.

           Over       the     last       Svears            1 think            I ’ve        worked          every                   match,          since                 ,

           At    the     end       of    the       day \        think           the thing             tha#T u p s e t s m e         is    the

           whether          w e ’d e v e r         had     such         pr aJal e m s 3^5 t h e R e d A r m y ,                   the    XnterCity             firrr

           Liverpool           people           themselves.                   I wonder             wtrW no        one       has    asked          Why    did       the

           Liverpool           fans          keep      pusbpCng            forward?              What \ ^ d e          them?       They       weren't

           So    just       what        did     moJni v a t e         them      to     charge          througlV an open                  gate       through

      next to consult with and advise Jackson/Duckenfield/Marshall/Murray.

b.    Counsel, Mr Woodward, assisted by Mr Limb, to attend Police Headquarters
      at 2.00 pm the same day for case conference.

c.    Other points covered see methodology of obtaining police evidence, copy
      of West Midlands statements - self serving statements.

d.    Previous mention in letters regarding solicitors obtaining evidence from
      licensees etc. by questionnaire now cancelled.

e.    Statements required from senior officers   'F' Division regarding football

f.    Operation manuals to be highlighted re. important issues.

All the above confirmed by fax received at 6.25 pm - copied immediately to
Chief Supt Wain.

At 6.30 pm in presence of Chief Constable, spoke with Miss Norcliffe, re.
principal officers involved having sight of photographs, videos, transcription
of videos and information available from de-briefings involving themselves and
other officers to help prepare their own evidence.

Explained how above information now available on Anacapa and asked that
officers see this also.

Miss Norcliffe agreed it eminently sensible for them to have all that
information made available to them and if Counsel expresses concern over this,
which she doubts, we will be notified immediately and given new instructions.



25.4.89

11.15 am DCC had discussion with Chief Supt Wain concerning production of
proof of evidence.  Chief Supt Wain asked DCC to contact Mervyn Jones (ACC(O),
West Midlands Police) re. the following points

      a.    to inform Mr Jones that SYP completing self-serving statements
            covering officers down to inspectors per se and also all
            officers at the Leppings Lane end of the ground;

      b.    ask if we could have sight again of our:-

               i)   videos
              ii)   photographs
             iii)   any logs, notes or briefing reports West Midlands have seized
              iv)   completed location questionnaires

                           CLIPBOARD 11 - INSURERS


     c.   Suggest to Mr Jones the benefit of him appointing a liaison
          officer with regard to Chief Supt Wain's task thereby
          avoiding the need to contact Mr Jones unnecessarily.



12.45 pm - DCC spoke with Mr Jones re. the above.

He said that Mr Dear is currently with the Judge considering our request which
will include everything in which the South Yorkshire Police have property and
certainly include all the items referred to above at (b - 25.4.89) which I
read out in detail.

Concerning the intention to obtain self-serving statements down to the rank of
inspector and from all officers involved at the Leppings Lane end of the
ground, he saw no problem with that whatsoever, understands that we need to be
getting on with this quickly, has no worries over this*but thanked us for
informing him of our intended action.

Forgot to mention liaison officer arrangement - Chief Supt Wain to arrange
this himself.

                  Further to the questionnaire                    I completed earlier              last year    in respect

                  of my visit to the Hillsborough Football Ground,                                 I can assist you with

                  the following          information regarding persons that I assisted.                            At about

                  five to ten past three                (1505 to 1 5 1 0 ), I was on the pi tc h? I think

                  the time is about              right,    it was within minutes of the match finishing.

( \^oo            clothing.         I obviously spent some time assisting with these                             persons.

                                                                                     S3769

             have since seen myself os                                              My
           personal description is               of medium build,   black short curly hair

                                              a pair of blue denim jeans, a light or

          natural       colour   "T* shirt,   short sleeved with three buttons at the top

          and a small       collar.



          If,   in the future,        it would be necessary to view police videos in an

          effort to complete continuity,           then I would certainly assist.

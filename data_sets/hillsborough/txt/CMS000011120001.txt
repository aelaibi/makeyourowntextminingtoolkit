Dear

Thank you for your recent letter to the Prime Minister which has
been passed to this department in view of our responsibilities
for the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.   I apologise for the
delay in replying to you.

Lord Justice Taylor recognised, in his Final Report on the
Hillsborough Stadium disaster, that there is no single solution
to achieve crowd safety and cure all the problems of crowd
control.   However, he was satisfied that seating does more to
achieve these objectives than any other single measure. He also
considered that moving to all seated accommodation was consistent
with the policies of both FIFA and UEFA.

I understand your feelings and those of many others who wish to
stand at football matches. However, Lord Justice Taylor said in
his Final Report:

"I am not convinced that the cherished culture of the terraces
is wholly lost when fans are seated. ... The communal spirit is
still there and finds ready expression.   To such extent as the
seating limits togetherness or prevents movement, that price is
surely worth paying for the benefits in safety and control."

This is a view with which the Government is in agreement.

Lord Justice Taylor also commented that it should be possible for
clubs to plan a price structure which suits the cheapest seats
to the pockets of those presently paying to stand.     He pointed
to Ibrox where seating is £6 and standing is £4, which he did not
consider to be a prohibitive price or differential.    Therefore,
the fears of many spectators that they may no longer be able to
afford to attend football matches may be unnecessary.

                                            Yours sincerely


                                            Steve Bilbe

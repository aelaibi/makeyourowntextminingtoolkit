            I am a single, man I live at the above address with my parents.                              I am a

              £yy-lr     f
           Liverpool SuppopCers Club.  I have been a member now for about 4 or 5

            years.

            On Saturday 15th April             1989 (150489),           I went to the F.A. Cup semi

            final at Hillsborough between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.

           On the Saturday morning,                  I had to meet the supporters       club coach

           outside the Rocket           pub in Coventry City Centre.               I made my way there

            on the bus,         on my own, and arrived just before 10am (1000).                    The coach

           was already yhere wiyun
                             ..    some >£eopie on£it.                      I got on and met my

           The       coach was from Lloy                 Nuneaton.   I sat in the middle of the

            coach,      on the left hand/jfide,           next to the window I was sitting next

                                                                      a

         door to                                The coach left shortly after 10 am (1000).

         The   coach V o pped at 3 pick up points, Nuneaton, Hinkley and Leicester,

         at which varying numbers of supporters got on.                      I recognised some from

         usual    coach trips to matches but did not know any of them to talk to.

         In fact the only people I spoke to were my four mates,

               ]and
                                             /S/<£>2S
         I remember the two lads, Cai-A 'and Nich^^is HEWITT getting onto the

         coach at Leicester,           but iMrannot remember where they sat.               I did not

         talk to them.

         On the journey,                           the supports       club Secretary handed out the

         tickets, Mine was a cfeppings Ln standing area ticket,                       costing £6.
                                                     t c _
         The only traffic delay was one of 45 mins to half an hour on the M1,

         due to roac^wo i^nKs, but nothing serious.

         We arrived i n Sheffield just after                    1pm (1300) and parked in a side

         street,      off Leppings Ln, a b o u ^ 1 5 mins walk from the ground.               There

         were some police where we wn'ked, warning us about having no tickets

         but they were not escftrt^ig us to the ground ^                      0-^. % \ -

         When we got off the coach, me,                                      land             left

         everyone e/se and madgr our way straight to the ground.                        I never saw

         the HElpJI/T brothers^.'fter I left the coach.

         We arrived at the turnstiles to^Cfje ground at about                       1.30pm, and at

         this time,      there w e r e ^ a b o ^ y ^ Q Q     people queuing to get in. We all

         joined a queue for a turnstile but as we were about to go in, a

         policeman told us that we were at the wrong one so we had to go to

         find the corrarct one.  As we were going in t h a ^ o n e , turnstile B, we

         were searctyd.   I did see one or two stewayfis outside the turnstiles

         but   I c a n ’t remember where.

         As I went throught the turnstiles,                    the operator had my ticket from me

         and ripped off the stub.               I did not see any exit gates from the ground

         open,    nor did I witness the opening of any gates.                   I did not witness

           I did not see any police or stewards controlling people.                        I did not

           see anyone       drinking alcohol in             the ground.

           When I got       to the stand,           itwas>quite full,      however we were able to

           make our way into the crowd tjo                  where we wanted to go.     We went     into

           what    I now    know to be a perf             3.     We were about 3 yards from the front

    .0.£   fence and ab^lft 5 yards from the dividing fence on our l e j r f .                   This was

           about 1.45jmnr (1345) and at this time,                    it was quite ccunfortable.       I

           was s           with

           Things began to get worse                   it before kick off timeySs more and more

           people began to come ijn.                We got packed in and Jrfound it difficult to

           went forward towards the / ^ n c e and at one stage,                   I was aware of

           people walking over                     top of me.      The game had started by this

           stage.

           I received cuts ana bruis * about the head and body,                       but did not

           attend hospital         in,             eld.    I did not see anyone dying,

           Eventually I manageVr to                get to      the back of the stand after a lot      of

           pushing.        This would be           at about 3.20pm      (1520).

           I was    concerned about my mates                   and did not assist anyone   who was

           injured.        I met             and               at the back of the stand    and we began

           to look for                 and                 We waited until about 4.15pm     (1615) when

           we eventually left the ground.                      We still had not found them,   so we

           made our way back to the coach, where they were waiting.

           All during the time the crush was going on,                      I cannot remember seeing

          * anyone from our coach in the stand.                I on^y knew that the two HEWITT

              brothers were missing when I got back j f o           the coach.

              I would like to add that during the/aime I was being crushed,                   I was
C/Yf
flOUCfc       shouting at the policemen on th^^>itch to open the gates but it took
/VT           them about      15 minutes   to po   iy .   I also thought at the time that there
Q e w a t L
              were    policemen on the fenc^/toaving at fans to stop them getting on the
F<WC£
              fences.       They could have been waving at the fans at the rear to stop

              pushi n g .

              After the game was stopped,          I think that e v e r y t h ^ g   that could be

              done, was done,      except that there was not muchrfirst aid equipment

              available.       I think that the cause of t h i s ^ n c i d e n t was bad

                     Ver ’ a *s0      stewards.     The f enyf is the main cause of the

              problems,      especially in that the gaftes were too small. The Liverpool

              fans should never have been g\v^n the small amount of tickets that

              they were.

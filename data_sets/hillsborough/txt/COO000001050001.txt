                                                                  AGAINST DELIVERY
                   THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

            STATEMENT BY HOME SECRETARY:         17 APRIL 1989



With     permission,     Mr    Speaker,   I    should     like        to     make    a
statement     about    the     disaster   at   the     Sheffield           Wednesday
Football    Club    ground at Hillsborough           Stadium on Saturday.
Everyone has been        horrified by this           incredible       tragedy       in
which 94 lost their lives and 174 were injured.


Shortly after the start of the match there was a surge of
spectators on the Leppings Lane terrace which crushed many at
the front against the perimeter fence.                  This accounted for
most of the deaths and injuries.


The match was due to start at 3 p.m.             To help ensure orderly
access, the gates of the ground were opened at 12 noon.                             At
2.30 p.m. most of the Nottingham fans were in the ground, but
many of the Liverpool supporters were still arriving.                         It was
clear to the police officers in charge that there was ample
capacity still        to be filled in some parts of the enclosure
allocated to Liverpool.


At about 2.45 p.m.            there was a large crowd            of        Liverpool
supporters at the turnstiles in Leppings Lane behind the West
Stand.     There was difficulty in coping with the pressure on
the turnstiles and the police used loudhailers to urge the
crowd to be patient.



                                                      /At about 2.50 p.m.
At about 2.50 p.m. more Liverpool supporters arrived and the
numbers       in        front   of     the      turnstiles        increased.             Some
supporters         started      to     climb     the walls      and    turnstiles         and
those at the front of the crowd outside                           the stadium were
under considerable pressure from those behind.


The senior police officer present considered that there was a
possible danger to the lives of the spectators at the front
of the crowd outside the stadium.                        In order to relieve the
pressure he arranged for an exit gate near the turnstiles to
be   opened        to     let   a     section       of the    crowd    through.           The
relationship of that action to the disaster on the terrace
shortly     afterwards          isclearly       a     central     question          to     be
investigated.


My Rt Hon friend the Prime Minister and I yesterday visited
the football            ground and      the two Sheffield hospitals which
received      casualties.            I would        like to pay        tribute       to all
those     involved         in   the     rescue       operations        at     the    ground,
including the many spectators who gave their helpj                             and to
those     others,        including      the hospital          staffs        and voluntary
agencies who have since been working so hard                                 treating     the
injured and consoling the bereaved.                          We heard many accounts
of courage exerted on behalf of others.




                                                              /I have asked
I have asked for further factual reports from the police and
other     services,              the     local           authority           and        the     Football
Association.           Inquests will be held in due course.                                    But over
and     above       this,        there       is     clearly        need       for        a     full   and
independent inquiry to identify the causes of the disaster
and     to examine what needs                      to be done            to prevent such an
accident        happening          again.            I     have        therefore             asked    Lord
Justice Taylor to carry out an inquiry, with the following
terms of reference:


          "To       inquire       into        the events           at Sheffield
          Wednesday football ground on 15 April 1989
          and to make recommendations about the needs
          of        crowd     control          and        safety        at     sports
          events".


Mr Brian Johnson,                 the Chief              Constable       of        Lancashire,         has
agreed         to     assist           the        inquiry         as     an        assessor;           and
arrangements will be made as necessary for other qualified
assessors to be appointed and for the inquiry to be provided
with     technical          advice and support.                        I am asking             that    the
inquiry should proceed with all possible speed.                                          Lord Justice
Taylor         will     visit            Sheffield           tomorrow              to        begin     his
investigation.               I     am        grateful        to        him    for        agreeing       to
undertake this task.



                                                                        /However, we need ...
However,           we need also to take a wider view.                     The Government
believes that the future of football in this country lies in
a national membership scheme in designated grounds and now it
seems also in providing all                        seated accommodation at major
football           clubs.         This     would     involve     the   disappearance     of
terraces           at those grounds.          It might         also involve amendments
to     strengthen           the     Football       Spectators      Bill    so   that    its
provisions           for     the         licensing     of      grounds    matched      this
concept.           We shall be considering these matters urgently and
bringing changes forward as soon as possible.


An appeal fund is being set up by the civic authorities of
Liverpool, Nottingham                    and Sheffield.         The Government will be
contributing Â£500,000 immediately towards this fund.


This was a devastating tragedy.                        Our      deep sympathy goes to
the families of those who died, to those recovering, and to
those still fighting for life and health.                              We owe a duty to
these passionate supporters of football to examine urgently
and thoroughly the causes and background, and to do all                                  in
our power to prevent such a thing happening again.                               We have
to set our sights high and find a better way                                 for British
f o o t b a l 1.

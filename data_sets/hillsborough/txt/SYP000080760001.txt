    majority         were        driniy^jwf f r o m               cans,       one     had     a    bottle          of    Martini           and       I

    also     saw     a     bottle       of     Sherry.              Some       of     the     group          were       sat    on       the     floor,

    one    was      lying        on    the     floor          and       the    rest        were        stood       up.        They        were

    laughing,             singing       and     chanting,                generally            in       high    spirits             as     opposed

    to    drunk.           Empty       beer     cans          were       littered           around           them.

    To    pass      the     group       we     had      to        walk    in     the       road.

    Along       W a d s 1ey      Ln    1 noticed              a    large       amount         of       empty       beer       cans        in    the

    road     near         the    kerbside,           in       gardens          and     scattered              on    the       pavement.

    At    the    end       of    W a d s 1ey    Rd      at        its    junction           with        Middlewood             Rd       I saw        more

    fans      congregated              around        the          shops       and     in    the        shops.           It    was

    noticeable             that       around       this           area    I saw        more        fans

    than      I'd    seen        earlier.            All          seemed       in     "high        s p i r i t s '1 a s

    opposed         to     drunk,       but     it      was        obvious           they     had       been       drinking.As                 we

    entered         Leppings           Ln    I saw        a       large       group        scattered           along          the       roadway

    from      the    traffic           lights        to       the       ground        end     of       the    bridge.              These        fans

    were     walking            away    from       the        ground          towards         Middlewood                Rd,    causing              us

    to    weave      our        way    through          them.            On    our     way        through          these        people          I

    overheard             conversation             re     the       availability                  of    tickets.              1 he      fans

gateway             for     a    f r i e n d of ________ , w h o                    was      bringing             the       tickets             for    us.

Whilst          waiting              there         a    number          of    p<p 3.i c e m e n     approached               us       and       asked       if

moving          on     those            without.                 Also    whilst        there           on    two       occasions                Liverpool

cannot          say       wHether              they         were    offering           tickets              for    sale          or    trying          to

buy      thero/Sh o r t l y               after         2    pm    (1400)        the      tickets            arrived             and       we    went       to

tha      turnstiles.                      I cannot               recall       which       one       we      went       to    but       there          was
           —        -----------------


no N | u e u e       at     it.           We    went         through          and    once         inside          we    got       a    programme

and      then        went        up       the      stairway             to    the    seating.                I did          see       some       police

officers             and        stewards               in    the    courtyard             area         and     more         at    the       top       of    the

stairs.              We     went          to    our         seats       which       were       some         four       rows       from          the    front

and      more        or     less          central            to    the       goal.        It      would        have         been       about          2.20

pm    (1420)           when          we      sat       down.                     sat      between                           and       me    and       they

were      both         on       my      left.

The      seating            at       this       time         was    only       half       full,          whereas            the       seating          I had

expected             to     be       quite         full.           On    looking          round          the       ground          the other

stands          seemed           fairly            empty.           I    d i d n ’t     paym u c h          attention             to        the

standing             area        below          but         it    did    appear        fairly            full.

We    sat       there           and       at    about            2.35    pm     (1455),           two       men    were          directly             in

front          of    me,        on      the     row         in    front       blocking            my     view      of       the       pitch.           One

was      actually               sat       on    the         seat    and       the    other          was      trying          to       sit       himself

between             that        seat         and       the       next.        The    man       on      my    right          asked          him    to       move

which          he    di d.

Shortly             after        that          I saw         the    players           come        out        of    the      tunnel and                onto

the      field.             At       this       time         I saw       the      people            in    the      front          row, s o r t         of

crouched             over        the         wall       and       appearing          to      be     looking            down       as       opposed          to

the      pitch.             At       first         I d i d n ’t, p a y         too     much         attention               to    it       but    not

                                                                                                                                                     S2502

very          long       after,           probai                less         than    a minute,             I saw           fans       on       the    pitch

clutching                their          chestsJ             A   t appeared               to    me    they'd             been        crushed.

I then             saw    some          p ol i c a / o r i H T c e r s e s c o r t i n g            fans       from        the       pitch       to    my

left.              I overheard                conversation                    about       a    pitch       invasion                 but    1    pointed

out       to       the    man       next        to     me       that         people       were       holding             their        chests.

At       this       point          I,     like        the       majority            of    people          stood          on     the       seats       to

look/down                on    the       standing               area.          I could             see    people           sat       behind          the

    'al, people                being          pulled            up     and     into       the       seating             a nd    to    my       right,

p/eopj^'appeared                        to    be      crushed            against          the       fencing.              The        game       was     still

going          on       but    then          I saw         a    policeman            run       onto       the       pitch           t owards         th e

referee.                 His       arms       were         spread            out    as    if       trying          to    explain           something.

I    could          hear       'booing"               echoing            around          the       ground          and     heated          exchanges

around             me    about          the     booing              e tc .     People          were       bumping              into       us    and     I

became             very       scared          as      I thought               fighting             was    going          to     break          out.         I

kept          hold       of                   hand.             I wanted            to    leave          but       due    to        the    people           in

front,             behind,          etc       X c o u l d n ’t           really          move.           I also          felt        that       it    was

only          a minor          stoppage               and       the      game       would          restart.

I slowly                became          aware         of       more      and       more       people       on       the        pitch.           Some        were

stood,             some       sat       down       and         others         were       lying       down.              Also        the    seating

area          was       also       becoming            very          full      due       to    the       numbers           coming          up    from

below.

I saw          a    young          man       aged      2 0 *i sh ,           average          height,          thin        build,          fair       hair,

sfryoulder              length,          wearing               blue      jeans       and       a    scarf          tied        to    each       wrist ,

    un    to       the    Forest             e n $,    gesticulating                     at    the       Forest          f a n s , taunting

         m,    and       I overheard                  someone            say       something             like       "Therss           people          dying

down          there,          he    shouldn't                  be     chasing        him."           He    was          obviously              referring

to       a Policeman                chasing            this          fa n.

On       hearing          this          I was         now       aware         that       there       was       a    serious           problem

below          in       the    standing               area.            People        were          still       coming           up    from       below

over          the       wall       and       then      I saw           an     ambulance             arrive          on     the       pitch,          which

had    great          difficulty                   getting         through          to    the       end    below          m e.       On    the

pitch       I could             see       fans,          po 1 i^demen, S t           Johns          and    stewards              a i l helping

people.           Some          were       ^.i v i n g/rooujm            to    mouth,          some       pumping           chests,          and

generally             helping             peopLe

policemen             a s s i s t i n g ' people              over       et c .      It    was       a    hive       of     activity,

I    could       also          see    press           cameramen              just    taking          photos,          n ot       helping         more

getting          in       the       way    of       everyone            else.        I    cannot          say    how        many       but      there

were      quite           a    few.

About       this          time       I saw          people         tearing          down       the       hoardings             for     makeshift

stretchers.                    People          w e re       he 1 pi ng       out    where       they       could          and       p eo pie

(injured)             were          being          carried         of f.       I beared             an    announcement                 over      the

loudspeakers                   requesting                cn?ople        to    clear       the       pitch,       and        it      appeared          to

me    that       nobody             off               pitch        knew       what       was    going       on.

down.

On    looking             down       onto          the      pitch       I could          see    that       all       t he      remaining

hoardings             were          being          moved      out       of    the    way       and       I assumed             that       the    match

wjs'ald     restart.                 I then           saw      several         people          at    the    back          of     the      goal       area

and    to    the          right,          who       appeared            to    be    dead.           Their       faces          were       covered

with      scarves,              towels             e tc .

1 did       see       a       fan    and       a    policeman            pumping          a mans          chest       for        several

minutes          (t en )        but       he       was      obviously          dead       and       the    fan       put       his     black

leather          jacket             over       his       head.

They      were        a       few    yards          to      the    right       of    the       goal       and    a    little           way

forward.              The       dead       fan        was      well      build,          pot    bellied          and        seemed         tall,

he    was    wearing                blue       jeans         and    a    light       coloured             shirt,          which        was      up

around       his          neck.           The       fan      helping          or    trying          to,    was       also        tall      and       well

Up    where          we    were       in       the     stand       people             were       easing           back        and    things

became          easier.                              ,ook                to       the       toilet           and     also          looked          to   see

if w e      could          get    out.           A while           later          she       returned              and     we       left       some

five       minutes          later.

As    we    were          passing          a    r e f i ^ shijxyit       stall             at    the      back       of       the    West          Stand

 :risps         from       boxes       on               f/oor.           1 think                the      front       was       open       but       I

c a n ’t be          sure.        I did          no?        see    anyone             in    the       stall.             I got       the

impression                that    there          had        been       masses          of       people         doing          it    from       the

number          of    empty       boxes.              I could           see       around            ten      or     more       large          boxes

( 2f t     square)          which          I belLvl              hold    two          dozen         or    so      packets.           In m y

opinion          ij'te y w e r e                     i iw.        I was       too          interested               in    leaving             to

O u t s i de     the       road       was       cld|sed/to             traffic             and      I saw         lots        of    policemen             as

well       as    ambulances                et c.

Near       the       crossroads,                Leppings           Ln    and          Catch         Barr       Ln    I saw          about          four

policemen             stopping             the       traffic.            I saw             one      f an ,     aged       mid       thirties,

sandy       hair,          collar          length,           who       was    wall          drunk         (plastered)                and       being

held       up    by       two    or    three          friends.               he       kept       falling            about          and    I    heard

him      shouting           " m u r d e r e r s , m u r d e r e r s ” at                   the      police.              He    was       also

swearing.                 The    police          ignored           him       and       his       friends,            who       appeared

embarrassed,                led       him       away.

We    got       to    my    sisters              <                at a b o u t         4.30         pm       (1630)       and       along          the wa y

In m y      opinion             I feel          that        there       was       a    l a c k V f f cyirnuni cat i o n                   between

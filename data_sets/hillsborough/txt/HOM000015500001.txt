Perimeter Fences at Football Grounds

I listened with     some care to your statement to the       House earlier this week,
in the immediate aftermath of the terrible tragedy at Hillsborough;         and I
was disappointed to hear that you were giving no strong guidance to Clubs
in relation to the removal of perimeter fencing.       Indeed, you seemed to- be
implying in your statement that you were inclined to encourage it to stay.
I hope that you may perhaps by now have had time to reconsider this point.
As you will know, Highbury - the home of Arsenal - has had no perimeter fencing
at any stage, and I believe this has demonstrated that a ground can happily
exist without it, and without any severe adverse impact on hooliganism
control or security.     I believe that in the last four years there has been
only one "pitch invasion" at Highbury, and that seems to be a small price
to pay for the more civilised - and ultimately less dangerous - way in which
spectators there are marshalled.
I know that a number of other Clubs are now removing their fencing, in an
immediate response to Hillsborough; and doubtless the Inquiry now established
will have something to say on the issue. But I do hope that the relatively
good experience of Highbury will be borne in mind, and that the signals you
send out on this issue will be perhaps rather less indicative of support for
fencing than they were on Monday.
I look forward to hearing your views and thoughts on this issue.

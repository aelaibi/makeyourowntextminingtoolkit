           I am a married man and I live at the above address.              I am the father

           of twin boys David and             BENSON who were born



           As a result of the disaster at Hillsborough S t a d i u m , Sheffield,        on

           15th April      1989 150489 when Liverpool        played Nottingham Forest,   in the

           FA Cup Semi-Final,      my son David BENSON lost his life.

           On Tuesday 18th July       1989 180789, at my home address,         I delivered to

           PS APPLETON and PC             of the West Midlands Pol i c e one colour

           photograph of my son       David BENSON.

           I understand that this photograph is to be used to assist with the

           visual   identification of David on video film or photograph and will                be

           returned to me.

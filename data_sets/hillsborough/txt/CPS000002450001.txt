Subject:            Hillsborough

I've again spoken to Matthew Pyne of the Home Office. He is (ipdble to find a copy of any reply to Dru's letter
(which is on their file). He is making an approach to the clerk to Lord Justice Stuart- Smith to see if the judge
remembers anything about the matter.

I shall keep you informed.

               morn in g
               Hi              we    t ra v el l ed    in three     cars,   I drove my own p r                w h ic h    is a red

       '       £F or d Esc o rt       in the      car w i t h me was my brother                in law

                    s married        to my sister and his two               brothers                    ana               J

                             still      lives     in                wit h his mo th er and                         lives      in

                                                                                  but    I don't       know the number

               d o n ’t really know the                 other     lads and their         gi rl fr ie nd s     in the other

               two     cars.

               A fter we        left St He le ns we went               straight       to Sheffield,           we    d i d n ’t stop

               a n y w h e r e on the way an d we d i d n ’t get                 caught       up in any traffic               jams or

               a n y th i ng    like that.             It was about       half    one to quarter             to two t hat we

               got     into S h e f f i e l d     itself and we stop pe d for a drink at a boozer                                  I

        1(%y    hink     its name was            the    ’Blue Sal 1 ’ /I ’m sure about             that       ’B a l l ’ but       it

    LO         was     d e f in i te l y    ’B l u e ’ som et hi ng w he n we were            in the    pub there were

               other      fans       drinking         in there as well         but    e v er yb od y was well            behaved.

               We     then got        back     into     the    car and drove         towards     the ground and               I don't

               remember         seeing any            fans    drinking    out of      cans     or a ny thing        else

               for that matter.                 We m a n a g e d to find a parking              space    on a side            road,

               what     name        I c a n ’t remember and           it was     just after       two w hen we            left the

               car     I c a n ’t be any more                d ef in it e than that      but whe n we did            leave         the

               car     I c o u l d n ’t see an y         p o li ce me n on the       street and        none     came to us at

               all.       The walk          to the      gr ou nd must     have    taken us about             fift ee n m in ut es

               an d during           that    time      I didn't     see an y f ig hting         or anything          like      that

               and     c ertainly          I c a n ’t remember a n yb od y        being       really drunk         e verybody

               was     in a bououest m oo d on the way to the match.

               E v e r y b o d y from all        the     three     cars w a l k ed down to the Leppinqs                    Lane

  3--          t ur ns ti le s      and we must          have    got there at a bout            twenty five          past two            by

               this     time        I had been g iven a ground ticket                    by            and    I was      looking

               for     the     ’B ’ turns ti le s/ a n d        there were       no orderly       queues at all               outside

               the     ’B ’ turns ti le s         it was       just a crowd of          people    it was just            chaos         so

               we went         up to the        *C ’ turn st il es       because     there were         no crowds          in front
                                                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                                                  SSI 23

of that       just    people      queui ng          up, we found a t urnstile and asked                           the

bloke      inside     it we       could get          in on a      'B ' ticket         because       of the        crush

but he said no so we had to go p a c k                           into the       *B * c rowds        I    cannot

remember          seeing any       coppers          outside      the    "C*    turnstiles.

W h e n we got       to the blue metal                main gates         in front       of the          *B *

turns ti le s       there were          two    po li ce me n on h o r s ^ e c k        t here;      their        horses

were    led on to us but m ov i ng                   from side         to side and          I thought           that    they

were     trying      to stop       people walk in g             past them and          I think          they

w ere   telling       people      to wait           but   I c a n ’t be sure.           T hen one of them

s ta r te d to walk         off    into       the    crowd and the space               he    left       behind     people

had to try and get                nearer       to the      t urnstiles         and because          of that        the

other      pol ic em an star te d to make                 his    horse       run round       in a short           of

circle and there were                   crowds all         a ro u nd the horse,             including me and

we had to          push back as          far as we         could because we             couldn't          go back

because       of the       crowd behi nd us so              I w a it e d until         I saw a space and                 I

do dg ed     past him,       through          the gates         behind       the horse and          I was        stuck

inside the          crowd a g a in w h ic h seemed to be getting w orse                             by the        second

then     I saw that         one    of    the girls         in our group who was                in the           crowd

looked       like she was         going        to faint         so together wit h a few of the                         lads

we    sort    of made a circle                round her a nd           pushed back          just to give           her

some    space       like   but     it was about            this    time       that    I got split              up from my

group,       so    I d e ci de d to just            concentrate         on getting myself                into     the

gr ou nd because           I've been          in similar         things       before and they a lways                   had

cleared and          I thought          that was what was               going    to happen this                 time but

I still       felt a little             crushed and         I saw fans          getting       onto a wall

b et we en the       *B* and the          *€'       t urnstiles        and    I made my way over                 to that

side    because       I thought          it got that            bad I could get             onto the wall

my se lf     but    once    I got       over    that way         I deci de d to stay           in the           crowd

because       if I got on the wall                   the Police might            think       I was       'Bunking        in'

and     chuck me out so            I co nt in ue d        pushing my way             through the          crowd and           1

remember          seeing       two    police       horsemen.          I c a n ’t remember            if they were

the       same    two    I had seen           earlier        by the       t urnstiles         they a p p e a r e d to be

p anicking         by the       look       on their       faces and          I could hear the            crowd

shout i n g       and s we aring at            them an d        I think that            got      to them but        I

m a n a g e d to get to the                tur n st il es     in the        ’8 ’ s e ct io n w hi ch was        nearest

to the        * C ’ sect io n a n d         I sho we d my ticket and got                      the one    part back

and       I got    into the ground.                 Whilst       1 was waiting             in the     crowd I c a n ’t

remember a n y b o d y a c t u a l l y             "Bunking      I n ’ also        I d i d n ’t see any Stewards

by the turns t i l es             either       inside        or outside.

Once       inside       the    gr o un d    1 looked for my mates and                      I saw some        of them by

the e n t rance          to the tunnel             w hi ch    led     into the L ep pings Lane Terracing.

    I   knew that       because       I had been there                before       not because         1 saw any

signs       because       I c a n ’t remember             seeing a ny signs at all                   showing        fans

w here      to go and          that.        I s tood by the e nt ra nc e                to the tunnel          for a

couple        of minu te s w a it i ng             for my mates and during                    that   time    I d / d n ’t

see an y         coppers       or stewa rd s a ny wh er e             near       the entrance        to thexAunnel.

T he n     it must       have     been about            five to three,             because        I remember        looking

at my w a t c h and            t hi nking      that       I should get            into the match,           whe n       I saw
t                                                                            /
over       the heads          of the       people       coming      in that        the big /hetal        doors

d i r e c t l y o pp osite        the      tunnel       entrance       was       being opened but           I d i d n ’t

a c t u a l l y see who         op en ed      it    but      it was    f ully opened and there was                      the

first       little       rush of        people       through        it and then that sl ow ed down a bit

to what          I w o u ld d es cr ib e as a fast w a lk in g                   pace and e v e r y bo d y a c t u a l l y

    in that      part of       the    gro un d      that      Iwas        in a p p l a u d e d   the d ec is io n to       let

the gate          be opened          because        people could have              been hurt         outside        if that

had not          have happened.

E3ut because            I still       h a d n ’t seen                 I sort of stepped              into    the middle

of the oncoming                crowd to see             if I could see him but                    because    there was

so m a n y       people       I d e ci de d    I ’d better          get     in so     1 sort of went w ith                the

crowd a l t h o u g h         I. felt      that    if    I w a nt e d to go back out of the tunnel                            I

could have        done so        I just w a I k ed t,hrough at              the    pace of the         crowd not

being     crushed or a n y t hi n g            like that w hen          I got     to the other         end of the

tunnel     I remember           seeing        the    letter     'A*    on my     left and the         letter       ’B ’

on my     right       so    I stuck      to    ’B"    side an d w h e n     I got out        of the tunnel           I

saw there was a metal                 fence         running     down the middle and             I went     to the

right of this              fence a s I was           looking at        it a nd    into the      terracing,

I felt         really w e ir d       like       .1 was    f lo ating    like so    I wal ke d out         to the

were     sitting            that    had got out of the te rr ac in g            so     Iwent back     to         have

a look         but    I      c o u l d n ’t find any of my mates so          I w al ke d    back to the

                                         there was a sort              of a pause before           I grab be d

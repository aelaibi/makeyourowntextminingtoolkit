IF R E Q U I R E D .

A GM N ST THE FRONT WALL AT THE TURNSTYLES. WHEN I EVENTUALLY GOT THROUGH THE
Tl^STYLES I THROUGH MY TICKET AT THE STEWARD, THE FRIENDS I WAS WITH, NO
PERSON CHECKED THEM AT ALL WHEN THEY ENTERED THE GROUND. IT WAS ABOUT 2.50
WHEN WE GOT INSIDE. I SAW POLICEMEN AND STEWARDS STANDING ROUND. PEOPLE
WERE TELLING THEM THAT THERE WAS A CRUSH OUTSIDE THE TURNSTYLES AND THE
SITUATION NEEDED SORTING OUT BEFORE SOMEONE GOT INJURED. THEY APPEARED TO
TAKE NO NOTICE OF WHAT THEY WERE BEING TOLD. WE ENTERED THE TUNNEL AND AS WE
NEARED THE STANDS THERE APPEARED TO BE ALOT OF PEOPLE BEHING US AND OTHER
SUPPORTERS WERE SAYING THAT THE GATES OUTSIDE HAD BEEN OPENED. AS WE WENT
INTO THE STANDS WE WALKED THROUGH THE CROWDS OVER TO THE LEFT SIDE, AS IT
APPEARED TO US THAT THERE WAS SPACE OVER ON THAT SIDE. IT BECAME APPARENT TO
US WHEN WE GOT THERE THAT THERE WAS A FENCE PREVENTING US GETTING INTO THE
STANDS NEXT DOOR WHICH WERE RELATIVELY EMPTY. WE WERE NOW STARTING TO GET
REALLY CRUSHED. WE CARRIED ON MOVING FORWARD TO TRY AND FIND SPACE. I GOT
SPERATED FROM THE FRIENDS I WENT WITH. I WAS NOW ABOUT 9 TO 10 FEET AWAY
FROM THE FRONT FENCE BEHIND THE GOAL. THE CRUSH HERE WAS FRIGHTENING AND
EVERYBODY HERE WAS HAVING TROUBLE TO BREATH AND EVEN STAND UP. PEOPLE WERE
SHOUTING FOR HELP. I FELT SOMEONE GRAB MY LEG. I BECAME AWARE THAT SOMEONE
WAS ON THE FLOOR TRYING TO PULL HIMSELF UP ON ME, I TRIED TO PULL HIM UP BUT
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE ROOM. I WAS STRUGGLING FOR BREATH MYSELF. THERE
WERE ARMS REACHING UP TOWARDS US FROM THE GROUND FROM PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN
DRAGGED DOWN IN THE CRUSH, BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO TRY AND HELP THEM THERE
WAS NO ROOM TO MOVE. IEVEN TRIED TO PULL SOMEONE UP BY HIS HAIR BUT THAT WAS
UNSUCCESSFUL. SUPPORTERS WERE TRYING TO CLIMB THE FENCE, THAT WAS MADE
DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF THE TILT ON THE FENCE. I WAS PANICING MORE THAT EVER
NOW I COULDNT BREATH AND WAS NOT ABLE TO HELP THE PEOPLE WHO WERE REALLY IN
TROUBLE. YOU COULD SEE THAT THE SUPPORTERS AT THE REAR OF THIS STAND WERE
BEING LIFTED OUT OF THE CRUSH UP INTO THE WEST STANDS. DURING ALL THIS THE
POLICE WERE TELLING EVERYBODY TO MOVE BACK. THE PENS AT EITHER SIDE OF US
WERE REDICULOUSLY EMPTY. AFTER A SHORT WHILE THE CRUSH APPEARED TO EASE,FROM
THE REAR. THE GATES AT THE FRONT WERE THEN OPENED AND PEOPLE WERE HELPED OUT
BY THE POLICE AND ST JOHNS AMBULANCE PEOPLE. THERE WERE TWO MEN LYING ON THE
GROUNG BELOW ME, BLUE IN COLOUR, NO MOVEMENT. I GAVE MOUTH TO MOUTH BUT
UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS TOO LATE. SOMEONE CAME UP TO ME A POLICEMAN OR AMBULANCE
MAN AND TOLD ME THAT I HAD DONE ALL I COULD AND HELPED ME OUT OF THE
TERRECES.                                                  GOING BACK TO
WHEN WE FIRST ENTERED THE GROUND THE STEWARDS WERE TELLING PEOPLE THAT THERE
WAS PLENTY OF ROOM IN THE WEST TERRECES, WHICH WAS OF COURSE UNTRUE. IN MY
OPINION THE TUNNEL SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSED AND SUPPORTERS DIRECTED TO THE
EMPTIER PENS BY MARSHALLS OR STEWARDS.
                           HE IS EMPLOYED AT THE LOCAL HOSPITAL

               ENTRANCE B, THAT IS NOT THE GATES FEATURED ON TV AND THE PAPERS.
               THE GATE I WENT IN WAS A SLIDING GATE, DIRECTLY OPPOSITE THE
               TUNNEL. HAVE GOT IN BEHIND THE STANDS THERE WERE POLICE OR
               STEWARDS TO DIRECT US AND I HAD NO WAY OF KNOWING WHERE TO GO

PEOPLE FUNNELLED DOWN THROUGH THE TUNNEL BECAUSE IT WAS THE ONLY VISIBLE
ENTRANCE. ONCE INSIDE THE PEN AREA, I WAS IN THE CENTRAL PEN AREA AT ABOUT
2.55, AND FROM THE GREAT SQUASH, I DECIDED TO MOVE TO THE RIGHT AS I WAS SO
UNCOMFORTABLE. I CONTINUED TO MOVE 0 THE RIGHT IN THE BELIEF THAT I COULD
REACH THE CORNER, BUT I CAME UP AGAINST THE FENCE. I SHOUTED OVER TO PEOPLE
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE TO HELP US OUT, WHICH THEY DID AND I GOT INTO
THE PEN WHICH WAS BARELY FULL. THIS WOULD BE AT ABOUT 3.10. THERE WERE
ALREADY FANS CLIMBING OUT ONTO THE PITCH, BUT THERE WERE NO POLICE OR
SjfcARDS TO HELP OR DIRECT US - PEOPLE WERE GOING IN ALL DIRECTIONS. NOTHING
W ho DONE FOR SOME TIME TO HELP AND DURING THAT PERIOD PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND
SERIOUSLY INJURED. THE TICKET ALLOCATION WAS RIDICULOUS. I APPROCHED THE
GROUND FROM THE CENTRE OF TOWN WITH THE FOREST FANS. THE ROADS INTO TOWN WERE
BADLY CHOSEN, AS THEY CAME DIRECTLY THROUGH DIVERSIONS AND ROADWORKS, SO WE
WERE IMMEDIATELY INTO A TRAFFIC JAM. THEY USED THE WRONG EXIT FOR TRAFFIC.
THE LICENSEE WHO WAS ON TV INFERRED THAT THE FANS WHO WERE DRUNK WERE
LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS, BUT I PARKED BY HIS PUB, AND ONLY FOREST FANS WERE
ALLOWED TO DRINK IN THERE - THERE WAS A SIGN SAYING NO LIVERPOOL FANS.
I SUGGEST THE FANS WERE NOT LATE IN ARRIVING - IT WAS BECAUSE THERE WERE TOO
FEW TURNSTILES TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO GET INTO THE GROUND QUICKLY.
THE POLICING OUTSIDE THE LEPPINGS LANE END WAS INADEQUATE. THERE SHOULD HAVE
BEEN AN INITIAL TICKET CHECK AT THE OUTER GATE, AND THERE WAS NO ATTEMPT TO
MAKE THEM FORM ORDERLY QUEUES. THE START OF THE MATCH SHOULD HAVE BEEN
DELAYED. THE P.A. SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED TO DIRECT FANS HOW TO GET INTO
THE OTHER PENS. THE TICKET GROUND PLAN NEEDS CLARIFYING - THERE ARE NO SIGNS
TO DIRECT YOU, SO A PLAN IS NEEDED ON THE TICKETS.

I WAS WITH                      PHONE          AND M S SISTER, BUT I DON'T
KNOW HER DETAILS.

FOR THE MIDDLE PENS, SO EVERYONE WAS GOING THROUGH THERE. ONCE WE GOT IN
THERE IT WAS A MUCH GREATER CRUCH THAT I HAVE EVER BEEN USED TO AND I WAS
PUSHED TO WITHIN TEN FEET OF THE FRONT FENCE. AT ABOUT TEN PAST THREE I
FINALLY GOT TO THE FRONT AND WAS ABLE TO GET OVER THE FENCE ONTO THE PITCH.
WHILE I WAS IN THE PEN, I WAS BY WHERE THE BARRIER COLLAPSED, ABOUT THREE
FEET TO THE LEFT OF IT, AND THERE WERE A PILE OF BODIES IN FRONT OF IT,
STOPPING US FROM GETTING OUT. WE STAYED THERE UNTIL ABOUT HALF PAST FOUR, ON
    PITCH, BEFORE WE MADE OUR WAY TO OUR CAR. I STILL HAVE MY FULL TICKET -

m   NE CHECKED IT. WHEN WE WERE STILL OUTSIDE, THERE WAS A POLICEMAN TRYING
    TO GET PEOPLE THROUGH THE GATES. I THINK I MUST HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE FIRST
THROUGH THERE BECAUSE THERE WASN'T A GREAT CRUSH AT THAT TIME. I WASN'T
INJURED AT ALL.

I WAS WITH TWO FRIENDS:

THEY DID TAKE MY TICKET AS I ENTERED THE GROUND.PROBLEMS CAUSED BY LACK OF
SIGNS,LACK OF POLICING AND LACK OF DIRECTION FOR POLICE.ONLY SAW ONE STEWARD
ALL DAY AND POLICE COULD HAVE BEEN MORE ORGANISED.THERE WAS A CROWD PROBLEM
AT 14.30 WHICH WAS NEVER RESOLVED.WE COULD SEE IT AND THOSE IN OFFICIALDOM
FAILED TO MONITER THE SITUATION.COMPLETE CHAOS.POLICE SEEMED VERY INACTIVE.
THEY SEEMED TO THINK THE PEOPLE COMING OVER THE FENCE WAS A HOOLIGAN ELEMENT
WHICH IT WASN'T.THE CROWD WERE VERY ANGRY AS SOME OF THE FANS WHO CLIMBED
W R  THE FENCE .CAN'T UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM OF ASSESSMENT.

PEOPLE OR SO MUCH DRINK BEING CARRIED BY THE FANS.
I REALLY WANTED TO SAY ABOUT THE DRUNKENNESS OF THE FANS AND THE SHEER VOLUME
OF NUMBERS. WHERE I WORK IS ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES FROM THE GROUND AND THERE
WERE STILL A GREAT MANY FANS WHO WERE MAKING NO MOVE TO GO TOWARDS THE GROUNS
AS LATE AS HALF PAST TWO.
THE NEIGHBOURING SHOPS CAN TELL SIMILAR STORIES.

             OF THE MATCH THERE WERE A LOT OF LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS IN THE PUB
             HAVING A DRINK. THEY WERE ALL GOOD NATURED, BUT THEY DIDN'T LEAVE
             THE PUB UNTIL 2.30 SO THEY MUST HAVE CUT IT FINE TO GET TO THE
             GROUND IN TIME FOR THE KICK OFF.

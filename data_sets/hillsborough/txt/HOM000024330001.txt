       PRESS RELEASE

       FROM: TDK PENDRY MF'j         Chairman of t h e      All     P arty        Football
       Comm ittee

       Re:  M eeting between Officers of All Party Football Committee
       and Lord Justice Taylor* Home Office, 14 November 1989



        Tom Pendry MP> Chairman of the All Par ty Football Committee
        and who led the delegation of Officers to give further
        evidence to Lord Justice Taylor before he completes his final
        report on the Hillsborough tragedy, was disturbed to read the
        comments made in several newspapers by John Carlisle
        concerning this private meeting.

        Mr John Carlisle, MP for Luton North, was specifically
        invited by me in order to give the kind of broad
        reoresentation requested by  Lord J ustice Taylor, to present
        the view in favour of ID cards, Mr Simon Hughes was also
        included to give the delegation greater political balance.

         The Officers of the Committee regret very much that Lord
         Justice Taylor has beer, embroiled in such an unnecessary and
         unwarranted dispute.   This is all the more true since the
         Officers felt the even-handedness shown by the judge was
         exemplary and that the remarks published in the press bore
         little resemblance to what actually happened in what was a
         constructive two hour meeting.

         Mr Carlisle, who is a member but not an Officer of the
         Committee,  seemed to be somewhat confused as tD the actual
         terms of the e n q u i r y ’s remit.

                 On    the       way      to   Sheffields            we    stopped             at     a     motorway        service           station        for

   We were       not delayed and we arri ve d at S h e f f i e l d at about                   13=45 hrs

   j1345).         The     coach    parked on a hill about             10 minutes      walk    from the

   ground.



   Myself' and                went to the          chip shop on the way to the            ground■        i. saw

   about      10 people       drinking       on the way to the          ground.



   There were            police    officers    on street       corners      telling    us to get down to

   the ground.



   We got to the ground at about                     14.05-1410 hrs         (1405)    (1410).        It took

   us a bout       10 minutes        to get    to the      turnstile.       There were        orderly

   queues.         W hen we got to the             turnsti ies we were        told we were at the

   wrong      t urnstiles and we            could not go       in.     We had to go to the other

j ^ t ur n st i le s .     By the other       turnstiles       there    was just a mass         of    people

   no queues.            We were     in the    crowd and we were            getting    crushed.        Some

   time      between       1445 and    1455 the g a t e on the          turnstlie was         closed hy

   the steward on the turnstile.                      He   said that       it was    full and    no one

   else      could come       in.     There were       police    officers      by the    turnstile

   gate.        I said to them         1 have       got a ticket and         it can't be full.          Some

   police w it h horses             came    then and       cleared the front         of the    concertina

   gate.      I could see at          least    one    police    officer      using his    radio.       People

   were      shouting       that they were getting             squashed.       At about       1455 hrs

    (1455)      the gate was         opened and everyone went               through.     1 was       still

   w i i-h               We went     through the       gate.     We still      had our    tickets,       no

   one a sk ed us for them.                 Once    inside   the ground we tried to get a

   programme         but    could    not.     We had not been to the ground b e f o r e , so we

   did not know where               to go,    all we saw was         the    tunnel    and wa    presumed

   that we had to go that way.
                                                                                                            PAGE
                                                                                                            S-i /-i-Lj

 We did not see any stewards                   or    police        officers        by the tunnel.         There

 were a lot of          people    going       through the t u n n e l .             We were walking           first

 but near      the end we were           pushed from behind and we went                         into the         pen.

 We were      pushed     into    pen 3.        We went straight               down the middle         to about

 half way down the             pen.

 More    people were       coming       in and we were               getting more and           crushed and we

 were    being    pushed ar ou nd at one              stage.          1 was     being      pushed up against

 a barrier       and    I felt    pain on the side                 of my     chest.        1 could hear

(-'people    s creaming at the front.                People were             being    sick where       they

 stood.       I did not see any of the match.                             I could see       people   climbing

 over the       Fence    to get o u t . One         of the first             over    the    fence was       put

 back    into the       pen by the       police.



 I was      so s q ua sh ed and       crushed       in the         pen that     I thought       I w ould not

 get out.        I was    having trouble            breathing.              e v e n t u a l l y the fence at       the

 front was       pulled down and          I was       pulled out            by^a    policeman.                   wa<

 also    pulled out.           We w al k ed over       by the nprth stand a bout                   half wav

 leather      jacket and s pair of A dd id a s                     trainers.        He was alive.           He    said

             white male about               with ginger      hair.      He was        in his     late 2 0 ’s,

             w ea ri n g a Liverpool      shirt atyl Jeans.          He just       lay on the hoarding with

             nis eyes        open he did not /say anything,            I   saw his hands moving and              I

                 rea.   We    put them dowjn in the gymnasium.



             We then went and sat          back to the side          line by the half-way             line and

             sat down.         i heard over     the T an n o y that    the      coaches were        ready to

             leave and ws went         up through the        north ,stand and out of the ground
                                                                   /
             that way and back         to the bus.



             On the way out we saw three fanj/ f i g h t ing wit h each other.                         As we    got

             near them they stopped and wa/ked out.

             Once we were        back on the     bus we heard on the              radio that about 7 or 8

             people     had died.      That was!the       first    I had known about              people dying.

             I think that        the   police   took a long time           to    react to what was

             happening.         Once   it was   realised     just what was          going       on they all

             s eemed to get       stuck   in and help.           /

             There      should have     been more       police outside          the ground       to keep   people

             in orderly queues.

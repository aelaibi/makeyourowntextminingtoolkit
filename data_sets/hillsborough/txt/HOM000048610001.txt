                Dear Ms Addlington
                Thank you for your letter of the 27th November 1997,
                My staff have been unable to find a transcript of the business meeting of the 6th March
                1990. W e believe that our copy of this may have been sent down to Lord Justice Stuart
                Smith. If you wish to approach Mr Bone, I am more than happy that he supplies you with a
                full copy direct.
                With reference to Dr Walker’s statement, I can confirm that a copy of this is contained in
                the body file for Lee Nicol.
                Finally, I have not yet received the letter from Dr Forrest, although i believe it has been
                dictated.
                I believe this concludes the outstanding matters, i note that Lord Justice Stuart Smith is to
                stop taking representations later this week. Have you been given any indication of when
                he is likely to report?
                Yours sincerely




                 C
                 HM Coroner

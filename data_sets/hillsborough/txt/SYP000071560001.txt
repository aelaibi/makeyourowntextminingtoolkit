           I am the above named person and live at v h^ above address with parents

           and one brother.                I am employed as a

           At    1230 hrs approximately on S aturday                          15th April    1989 (150489)   I set

           out from my girlfriends address at

                                                                                             field.

                                                                                                            from

                                          and

           any of the house numbers.                   We set off in                   car which is a

           Vauxhall Cavalier and travelled to Sheffield via the Ml south.                                     We

           didn't stop on the way and we d i d n ’t encounter any undue traffic

           problems.               There was a large volume of traffic,                    this due to the semi

           final.At            1400 hrs we parked about one mile from the football ground

           and all of us walked to the ground.                                                iidn’t have a

ticket so he went to one of the coach parks to get a ticket and

rejoined us a short while        later with        a ticket before we entered the

ground.    Upon our approach to the ground,            the street was almost       full

with Liverpool     supporters from side to side.            We approached the

turnstiles from L e p p i ngg Ln w h i c h ^ s
                                      where our tickets were for and we
                                          S<3 6
arrived at the blue perimeter fences \ t 1430 h rs and I did not see a

queue but a large number of people were moved outside tryng to get                       in

Two of my friends started saying about going               in but I suggested we

wait a short while

                                     Also,   I d o n ’t like large crowds and would

have felt happier to hang back for a short              period of time.        After a

bit,    the crowd seemed to get        larger not smaller.                         then

decided not to wait so they joined the mass.                Me and _______still

decided to wait for        a while     longer to see    if the crowd would still go

down.     It d i d n ’t so I thought we might as well        start queuing or we

would not get a place to see the match.                          oined first and I

followed up to entrance        ’8*    in Leppings Ln end.        At this    point even

more    people joined the back^N^f the mass and I began to feel                pressure
                                                   fa J- L.L..
on me at this stage.        I saw two            cemen an horses    in front of me who

were trying to form the crowds           into orderly queues but as there were

so many people     in the crowd,       they seemed to be very ineffective.           It

seemed as though we w e r e n ’t moving but slowly we began to make our way

to the turnstiles.       At one stage I was pushed up against a police

horse and then I eventually was pinned against the turnstile wall with

the entrance to my left and right but I c o u l d n ’t move either side

because of the pressure from the crowd.               I began to panic at this

stage because I get slightly claustrophobi c so I felt as if I d i d n ’t

want to go,     I wanted tcK^et to the back of the queue.                  At this stage

I was very scared a n d felt a go oil deal of pain and a policeman who was

in the right hand turnstile grabbed me and pulled me through with him
                                                                                   PAGE      3
                                                                                   S 1582

to help me.        Once through the turnstiles       I met up with all three of

my friends.        At this   stage there seemed to be a l u N    in the c r o w d a n d
                                                                       soe 77 5 itMtj
it seemed almost         clear.   I would estimate    it would be ^Hbout 1445 hrs

at this stage.          I then saw the signs for standing directing us to go

through the tunnel and this          is where the majority of the crowd was

going to so we followed.           I thought you might be able to go around the

sides once through the tunnel to the edge of the standing area which

is w h e r e N   wantwl to be to avoid any crush.        We hadX^ree passage

along the tumneiNal though it was dark and emerged int o \ e n               three.

The    pen appeared to be very full and the people were shoulder to

shoulder.        This   is the most full   I have ever seen a pen in any of the

football matches         I have ever been to.    We all had our backs to the

wall    ii'Kpen three and edged our way along away from the tunnel exit.

T h e game rt^af just started when I saw a 1.argSs- surge of people .just

flood through the tunn el into the pen even though there was no where

to go.     At this point      I saw several   spectators    climb over the front

fence of the pen to get onto the pitch.              I thought that these people

were try^sqg to get onto the field just to m a ^ trouble as I didn't
                                                                     f O L    p o y V rr )
realise what 'Was going on down the front.             I sawM h e   police pushing

the fans back       into the pens and appeared to be telling the fans to

get back     into the pens and stop messing about.           The people      climbing

over the fence became more and more until            the police c o u l d n ’t stop

them any more.          The referee then stopped the game and we decided that

it was time to change our viewing          position so just             and me made

our way back to the tunnel and tried to get back out.                There were a

large number of people still trying to get             into the ground so I had

to literali^yfight my way tjo the tunnel.            I noticed that there were a
                      GrtT         J)
few people on trre floor of Trie tunnel         trying to get up but being

knocked down by the rush of the crowd.           Some of the people on the

floor seemed very dazed as if they didn't know what was going on and
                                                                                 PAGE     4

some of them may have been dead but I can't say.               Everybody I saw on

the floor of the tunnel was moving and showing signs of life but                   it

was utter    confusion.     Once I got to the top of the tunnel          I saw

several    big lads who were emotionally ^           and crying and I knew

there must have been somet^T'kng very wrong aVN^his stage.              I4e then went
                                   \    ,    cAT          \
right and round the back to peirv^even where t h e r e x a s a lot of space.

So much space not one of the fans were touching each other.                 We went

to the back of the stand at the top.           I still    saw people    climbing over

the fence to pens three and four and I thought they were daft as we

didn't    realise what had happened.        I saw some fans and police trying

to rip the blue caging away at the front obviously to release some of

the pressure.     I saw a policeman who was standing on the fence,                lying

over the top grab the back of a mans jacket,             the man appeared lifeless

and was handed over the top of the fence,          ripping the rear of his

jacket.     I couldn't see what else the man was wearing.              The policeman

then laid him on the side of the pitch by the goal and gave him mouth

to mouth resuscitation and possibly heart massage as well.                 I can't be

sure.     After a few minutes    I saw the    policeman stop and put a coat

over the mans head and I presumed he was dead.                I then saw the

spectators break down the advertising boards and they were being used

as stretchers.     I also saw my two friends       in pert three,

got lifted up into the seating area above.

There were many people lying on the grass,          quite a few of them being

dead as they had their jumpers         pulled up over their head,        these were

two males.     I remember    I saw a man with a 'press'        bib and a camera

come up to one of the bodies and pulled the jumper down and took a

picture of the dead man,       this horrified me.        A few fans at this stage

realised what he was doing and began to attack the man for what he was

doing.    The man was     rescued by a policeman and escorted from the

ground.     People were approaching the camera man on the way out and

         I left at about 1630 hrs upon direction of the police and 1 also want

         to say that I can't be exact as to the time that these    incidents have

         occurred.

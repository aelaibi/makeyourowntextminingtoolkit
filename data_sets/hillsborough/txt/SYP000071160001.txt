            I am a Liverpool       football   club supporter a/td on Saturday,     15th April

            1989    (150489),    I atten/fed the match between Liverpool and Nottingham

            Forest being staged /at Hillsborough/Football Stadium,           Sheffield.

            I went to the groj/nd,        in private transport,    with a friend

                                                         We got our tickets from Anfield with
                         V
            our season tickets.          They were £6.00 tickets a nd were for the Leppings

            Ln standing ar ea» r We left for the ground at about          12.00 midday.   We

            d i d n ’t stop on route biit we did got lost because we travelled via

            Huddersfield.        wfe arrived at Sheffield at 2 . 4 0 pm/f 1440)and drove up

            side streets until we found somewhere to parb

            At this area w h s r e V M    parked there were ve/y few policemen directing

            people to the ground but there were a la/C of policemen positioned on

            the outskirts of Sheffield well away <-f/om the ground and not doing a

great d e a l .

After    parking the car, because of the time,            we jogged towards the

ground and on the way we d i d n ’t see any sign of fighting or drunkness.

As we were jogging down we were more or less stopped bv^a policeman

who said that we did not need to rush because the game had been

delayed for a while.        Because of this we slowed drawn.             , (■*   / i ~ i . /.

We arrived at the turnstiles at about 2.45            (1445)    to 2.50pm        (1450)

having stopped on the bridge over the river to have a look at the

turnstiles to see what the crowds were like.                From there we could see

the turnstiles.        Turnstiles   ’A ’ was on the Jta.r side,       turnstile     ’C* was

in the middle /and turnstile        ’B ’ was closest to us.

After lookit/g we decided to join the cr^owd which was a total mass both
                                              u J L I Kou_a^cc]
outside an<£ inside the gates.  T h ere <^as two horses stationed outside

the gates and as at matches at Anfield it seemed that they

were there to funnel       the crowd.    We went between the two horses,               which

pointed us towards the turnstiles          ’A ’ & ’C * but as ywe passed through

them we we re in just as big a crowd as bef ore.             Jrtere w e r e n ’t any

orderly queues as I thought there would be.                W,e made our way to the

right,   by jostling through the crowd,        and over towards the turnstiles

*B* for entry in the terraces.          We came up on the river side of these

and could see that the crowd around these were               in queues and w e r e n ’t

very deep.        Continuing from the wall at the side          of the terraces

tunstiles    is a low blue crush type barrier,            my friend              ducked

under this and joined the end of the queue.                I was about to follow him

when a policeman said,       <lJuy€'" go round the side*1.

I called               He docked back under and we went round the side.                      I

saw a blue co nc ert in g type gate which was open.            We both/went through

it together witK a/few others.          No-one at the gate asked us for our

tickets although there was someone there.             I c ou ldn ’t say if it was a

Steward or a Police Officer.          I d o n ’t recall    seeing any Stewards on
                                                                                              PAGE        :■

the Lepping Ln side of the turnsti V e s .

I am not aware of any other gate/s being opened and I cannot say if any

of the fans, climbed over the turnstiles or walls                             into the ground,
                              -tucJ   .         .
I have retained my ticket,                     i/h tact.      It is for the Lepping Ln area.

£6.00 Serial LL1                          and entrance     ’B ’ .     I can produce it.   On the

rear side of this ticket                     it shows a plan of the ground indicating that

there are five entrances,                     A, B ,( 1 >, B (E >, C and D whereas to my

knowledge there are only 3 and they are lettered as I have previously

said,       A, C and B.

Immediately as I got through the gates                              I saw a tunnel with a large

letter       *B’ over it.             I assumed that if there were other entrances                 they

would have been as big, and lettered,                          therefore as     I had ’B ’ on my

ticket       I headed for that tunnel.                   There were no stewards or police

officers       in that area to say otherwise or directing fans to other

ent r an ee s.

I didn't see any problems with the fans                             in this area nor did I see any

one drinking although I w a s n ’t looking for any.

As we actually started to go into the tunnel we were suddenly

cortf^jrtled\with a w h o l o t                 of farts, both in front of us and behind

us. It      d o n ’t know tffie re they came from but all of a sudden they were
        I      '          V
thenej.      we/entered the tunnel and                               was by my side, and the crowd

of u s \ w a \ k ed through possibly about                  10 people wide.       We were all

singing and in high spirits.                        We were walking        slowly but purposefully.

Half way through it was quite dark so,                          to stay together,     I caught hold

of                 arm,

As the crowd exited from the tunnel                         it came to a stop,      presumably,

because they had to mingle with the ones already in the terraces and

it was a slow process.                     At this point I was unable to move             in any

direction but I was expecting to move forward again very soon.                                There

the crowd dispersal.

I was stuck there and the pressure was building up.                    This must have

been about S minutes to 3 and I could see the players out on the

pitch.       The game had obviously not been delayed at all.                  At this time

I could see people at the front,              climbing over the fence at the front

and I heard several shouts,              from the crowd in front of me, of         *GET

B A C K ’.

Because of the pressure,          which was continuing to build up on me,             I was

unable to move to assist           those at the front,          At about this time,        I

had a sharp pain in rny chest as though I was experiencing

                taut this only lasted for about half a minute.

All this occurred as I got to ^ position marked atiyftg in pen 4 on the

grid plan.                          /

Eventually the crowd star/ed to move forward again at a very slow

pace,    like as if someonfe stood on your foot and you moved it slightly

to get out of that f o n t ’s way.           I ended up with my hips against a

crush barrier and| \yy left leg on the metal              stancheon with the

stancheon against my inner thigh.              I moved,   to    try to get both my        legs

on the same side of the          stancheon, to my right         and in doing so I must

have    ripped my jeans near the pocket because I could feel my money

falling down my leg.        I    could move to retrieve it,          but because of       the

crush I was more intent          to pushing back on the crush barrier to

relieve the pressures on my hips.               It seemed at the      time that    I was

there for about 5 minutes although              itcouldn't have       been that    long.

The    pressure on my hips was becoming unbearable so I started to shout

for help.       In that position no-one was able to help.               I continued to

shout and scream and kept on screaming at the top of my voice hoping

something      could be done from other sources.               I really thought at that

time that my time was up.

After a few minutes      I felt the pressure ease slightly so                 I decided to

drop down on my knees and go below the bar.           I felt bad at that

because my position was taken up immediately by another           person.      All

through this, and because of the pain I had felt,          I h a d n ’t paid any

attention or ever thought about                  who had been at my side all

the time.     It was only when I got myself below the crushbar and was

able to get some air into my lungs, which cleared my head a little,

that   I thought about            .   I was able to move better so I turned

and saw him in the same predicament that I had been in.            As I looked I

saw him lower himself slightly and then stop with his neck on line

with the barrier.       I was afraid for him for a split second but I saw

him moving down again.         He then dipped below the barrier and joined

me. I. then thought we were out of it but again the crowd closed in on

us and we were again pushed forward towards the fence at the front and

it became unbearable again.        I looked forward and I saw some people

climbing    up the fence.      There were some policemen on the pitch side

of the fence shouting at the crowd to move backwards but I knew they

wouldn't be able to.       I saw those same policemen pushing the people,

who were    climbing,   back   into the crowd.

As I was being forced forward I remember thinking of seeing the fence,

and because    I was being     pushed forward and to^the   left I also became

aware of an opening      looming up in the feryce in front and to the        right

of rne.

I had seen, at some stage,  policeman pulling people up out of the
                                X/
crowd and in particular one, who I remember as being bald and without

a helmet.     I saw him pull several     people out and I thought     "Great

Someones doing something" and then         all of a sudden there was no-one

agai n.

There must havfe been otihers doing something but my direction of sight;

which had been rt^iit, plainly through the crush,       which was by now

pushing me backwards,      having turned me around to a position where          I

was facing towards the rear wall.

Whilst       I was being pushed backwards towards the pitch.            I moved my

feet to to step down and I felt it come up against an obstruction as I

first thou ght .      I lifted my foot up to get over the obstruction and

when I went to put it down I realised^ because it was soft and well

above step level,      that    it w a s a ba/fy.    I brought my foot down in front

of it again and tried to get tfcw/ crowd to stop by shouting,                 t h e r e ’s a

body here.      "Someone said,    "Lift him up.      "   I bent down to do so and

caught hold of a leg which was trousered I moved it but it was limp.

I just dropped it again,         It scared me really bad.

I d i d n ’t want to step on it but the            crowd was pushing me      so much that

if I hadn't have done         I would have     been pushed to the ground also.

Having done so it seemed to me that there was more than one that I

stepped on or over.         By this time I         was getting   close to    the fence at

the front and I was putting my feet                down to the sides as      well.

At one stage, my left leg was caught up when I tried to move                   it to the

left and was caught between                  and another     person.    My foot was

about fence high as the pressure built up I thought                it was going to

br e a k .

I must have appeared frantic to one man, about 27 years old, who was

immediately in front of me and was face to face with me.                    He started

to talk to me,      quite    rationally,   to calm me down.       It was the calmness

in his voice which brought my attention to him and he did in

fact have a good calming         influence upon me.

On his advice      I got my leg out slowly and was able to stand properly,

agai n .

Both             and myself had spoken earlier about getting towards and

out of the gate.       2    had got now to a position which I have marked as

M8 on the gritl ^pilan, and side on to the fence and by stretching over .1

was able to touch it.         I saw a few people      coming over our head to get
                                                                                 PAGE

out and on two occasions       I was kicked on the head.        The once was by a

youth in his late teens who was going       like a rocket over us.           He

seemed as though he had really cracked.        It was probably good that he

was getting out.     It probably saved his life and possibly that of

others in the crowd.

1' had my hand on the fence,     which asured me a bit and I was          looking

towards the gate.     As I had one hand free the same fellow who had

calmed me down earlier told me to put my hand on his shoulders and

climb up the fence.     I was unable to because        I couldn't dislodge my

right arm from the    crowd.

A few seconds after that I lost my hold on the fence and another

person came between me and the fence.        I was dislodged by another and

with the force of the crowd I allowed myself to be turned slightly to

have my back to the pitch again.

I decided then to try to get towards the side rather that force my way

through the crowd towards the gate.        It was,    surprisingly easier,             to

work my way that way mainly because you could get behind people                   by

side stepping them thereby,      as they moved into your space you moved

into theirs so thats the way I did it.

that direction I was able to see spaces

At one time I got to a space and saw twc            dies t                        quite

obviously dead,    but I c ou ld n’t really say aooui      tne otner one.         mere

were four or five people holding the crowd off them and there was one

trying to give the kiss of life.        I didn't    pay much attention to them

other than to say that one of the bodies was a big guy.

I continued to move steadily to the fence and when I did reach a space

all   I wanted to do was sit down because     I was totally d r a i I                  went

to do so and I was aware of a man saying,          "Get over the / e n c e . "     He

then moved someone out of the way and grabbed a hold/of me.                He lifted

me up with another    couple of fellows and literally out me over the

fence.     I was too weak to even help myself then but there

were other fans on the other side of the fence who caught me.

I was sat down on a step and felt my head pushed between my knees for

about a minute or so.       I said,   "I’m okay,    "He said,    "1111 do you

good." Having got free      I was feeling worse.       He, and another       lad,    led

me down to the gate in the fence of that pen.            As I ’m getting walked

down,    there were others,   already at the fence trying to get out.                I

heard a policeman say "No. No more."         I didn't say anything but the

lad who was helping me said,      "This one has to come through."            The

police man looked at me and said,        "Yes"     They assisted me to the steps

and the policeman helped me out onto the pitch.            The two lads stopped

i.n.

The policeman just walked me over to the pitch and lay me down.                     he

called a couple of nurses over who examined me.            They said that       I was

alright and left soon after.

A couple of lads come over then and asked if I was alright.               The

policeman said that I was but could they look after me for a

while.     They stayed until    I got my breath back and was able to sit

up.     It was at this point that            found me and he, also was

clearly upset.     We both sat there for some time.

Somewhere in the region of 3.40 to 3.45 we were approached by a

policeman who asked us to move off the pitch because they wanted to

restart the match.    (I h a d n ’t seem it stopped).     We moved over to the

side but didn't get off the ptich.        We must have been asked again

because we moved off      it and sat on the gravel      patch.   It was at     this

stage that I heard a      tannoy announcement saying       that the match was

abandoned.

At some stage I was aware of Liverpool           fans rushing toward the Forest

fans area.     I didn't   know why but I now believe       it was because they

were singing.     I saw   a line of policemen cordon       off the centre line to

block   it.

         and myself made our way eventually towards the West terraces

and went back into pen 5.     We must have walked up to the top and

turned right because we went out via pens 6 and 7.         We left the ground

and walked back towards the car.      We heard from various    radios

being played that the number of dead was increasing.

When we got back to the car, a lady came out of the house and asked us

if we wanted to use her phone which I thought was        really good of her.

I phoned but both my parents were out.               phoned his and after

explaining asked them to keep trying my parents until they answered.

The woman then sat us down and o f f e r e d / s a cup of coffee which we

Since   returning home




With regards tp-^t h e po 1 y c i n g of the match I think that^iX could have

been handled forybetjfe/ than what    it was.   Outside the ground it was

totally inadequate and also the tickets showing a plan of the entry

points was totally wrong.

I feel that because of the inadequate      policing outside the ground,      the

opening of the gate to ease t^e c rowding outside was shortsighted and

not thought out enough.     i.e. With the amount outside,     where were they

going to go if they were let in on mass.

It also struck me that there was a lot of policemen in and around

Sheffield.    Enough to have been able to funnel     the fans at the ground

had they have been positioned correctly.        It also appeared that the

policemen inside the ground d i d n ’t react quickly enough having      regard

to what the crowd were telling them about the problem inside the pens.

I was very impressed by the way that total strangers,        albeit that    it

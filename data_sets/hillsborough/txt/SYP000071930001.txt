             My name i s                       and I live with my mom and dad two brothers

             and one sister.
                        O/VT
             1 am a Liverpool ^supporter and have supported them since 1974.

             Although I donjH, watch them play very often I would say that I have

             been to see t/nem about six times ^this y e a r .               I especially wanted to

             see them play against Nottingham Forest in the semi cup final and so I

             travelled to Sheffield without a ticket

             I left my house in                        early on Saturday 15 April     1989 and caught
                           CArT
             the 8.30am traij            T^'e train changed at Cheltenham and arrived in

             Sheffield at ^11.20am. / . I was on my own and luckily managed to catch a
              c_ / V T ~
              supporters b u s ’ fr^fi the station to Leppings Lane next to

             Hillsborough Stadium.           The bus was full of supporters and was

             supervisied by itwo uniform police officers who escorted the bus to the
                                                                                               PAGE      2

          ground.     All the people on the bus were Liverpool supporters.                     I

          got off the bus at about 11.45am               and there was quite afew people

          about wearing Liverpool scrafs.                I d o n ’t think at this stage that the

          ground was open.         Because of this and because I d i d n ’t have a ticket I

          hung around outside for a while.               I stayed in the general vicinity

          of the Leppings Lane section of the ground.                        During this time I saw at ,

          least four police officers on horseback and numerous police officers

          on foot.        They were walking around          in the streets.         At no time did   I

          see any footbal 1 fans drinking                       streets aj^ftough I saw a
                                                                    v
          han d f ul 1 of Liverpool    fans drinking out o f n t                glasses outside a

          local    pub.    The atmosphere was quite gydTd it was a sunny day and I

          d i d n ’t witness any fighting betweejr the two sets of supporters,

          At about    1 ■ 15pm I was straight Jfack to the Leppings Lane end of the

          stadium and was approached^J^ a white man who offered to sell me a
QVi
          ticket to see the gam£.        j t   d o n ’t think there was a special          reason
TIC <£T
          for him coming up to m/Sthen the fact that I/was hanging about outside
■ m O P
          the ground.        I d o n ’t remember exactly whft was said but I remember him

          asking    if I needed a ticket to the ma*fch a\id when I said yes he

          offered me one for £30.          I d i d n ’t ^ m i n k       that this was an unreasonable

          price to ask for and so I gave p rim £30.

          I cannot describe the man w h o x s o1d me the ticket and I cannot say

          what accent he had.         I then^walked back to the turnstile section o f

          Le ppi ngs L a n e .   I've no jjfea how many^f^olice officers or stewards were

          on duty at the turnstiles but I dp/remember there was only about

          two or three people going thrc^Sfgh the same turnsti le as m e .                   I think I

 U        went through the turnsti le/fnarked ’J ’ .                    The time was now about a

          quarter to two.         I ent§/ed the ground after handing my ti cket to the

          man on the turnstiles.         Looking ahead I could see a tunnel and could

          see the pitch beyond.   I believed t-nis to be the>Hily entry point to

          I had easy access via the tunne                  tand                  There was a

           ine of people lined acros                                          deep.      I could

         see a gap in the centre of the stand                                pie at the front

         of the pen.      I would say that                                   imeter fencing

         at the front of the stand pre                                         the pitch who

         stood in the middiie of the pen.         I took a couple of steps forward and

          looked up into the stand above.         I w a s n ’t sure if it was for seating

         or not and so I walked back up the tunnel and looked for a sign.                    I

         saw the staircases       leading to the area above pens three and four and a

         sign which indicated that it was a seating area.               In view of this I

          returned to pen three.        I walked to the far right of the stand and

         stood about half way up the stand against a set of railings.                    My view

         was still    partly obsecured also I only spent about five or ten minutes

         here.    I then walked to the front of the pen and stood against the

         blue perimeter fencing.         At this time I was standing about fifteen to

         twenty feet from the fencing separating          pens three a n d J ^ n x r .   The pen

         was still filling up and some of the people           in our o€n were

         singing.     I remained where I was u n t i 1 about 2 . Fpm
                                                                  pm when I first

         no ticed that people behind me were beginningyfo get closer to me.                      I

         thought nothing of it at this time.          I h a y r stood on the Spion Kop at

         Liverpool    before and realise how crowded certain matdjfis can be.                I

         d i d n ’t feel threatened in fact I had a ce rtain,^ifnount of room,           I

         fencing and I pushed back,              '"or twenty seconds later I was pushed

         again but a little harder,         'This time the chap behind me was pressing

         against my back and I b&tf to push harder against the fencing witj^my

         arms.     I could hear people cursing but they d i d n ’t appear to

          particularly frightened by what was happening.             Seconds 1-=

                     forejffms up in f ront of m e .           This t ime I could not push back.               I

                     ccftild hear people shouting to the police who were standing outside the                              ,

                     perimeter fence.            I heard someone shout,       'There's people being crushed

                     I heard another shout,            'There's people dying in here*.

                     Evert though it was a strong crush I knew people were in a lot of

                     discomfort but not that people were dying at that time.                         I could see

                     to my right and could see police officers dotted along the

                     perimeter track.            I could also see what      I presumed to be a senior

                     officers were turning and looking into the crowd/' I then saw a small

CAT                  gate in the perimeter fencing about twenty                          from me open out
C fA T e S           towards the pitch.            I don* t know who a p a m e d   it, I just saw it swaying

                     open.     I saw about four or five peoj^Te get out onto the pitch through
■e a g j   m s

   f f x ijE     -   the gate and two or three policaroen try to push the gate shut.                           I

                     don't think they were succeeding though because the supporters were

                     pushing against it.            By now it was getting harder and harder to

                     breathe and I shouted out,             ’Come on get this gate open*.             My vision

                     got hazy and I felt as if I was dying.                 I co uldn’t breathe and I c a n ’t

                     remember any more

                     and coming round again.             I remember someone chec^^fg me over and

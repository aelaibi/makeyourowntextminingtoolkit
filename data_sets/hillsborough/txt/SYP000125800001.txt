I WENT BY TRAIN AS I WORK FOR BRITISH RAIL SO I GOT THERE VERY EARLY,ABOUT
12.30PM IT WAS A NICE DAY, BY 2.30PM THE PEN WAS FULL AND WE WERE CRUSED
TOGETHER THEN, WHEN THE MATCH STARTED WE WERE PUSHED AT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE AND
PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO GET OVER THE BARRIERS BUT THE POLICE WERE PUSHING THEM
BACK, WHEN THE MATCH WAS STOPPED THERE WAS JUST PILES OF BODIES
I WAS NEAR A BARRIER THAT SNAPPED IN THE SURGE.

WHEN THEY OPENED THE FRONT GATES PEOPLE PANICED TO GET OUT OF THE PEN AND ON
TO THE PITCH WHICH CRUSHED MORE PEOPLE. I WALKED BACK OUT THROUGH THE TUNNEL
AND THE FANS WERE HELPING THE INJURED MORE THAN THE POLICE OR STEWARDS. I SAW
AN INJURED PERSON AND I ASKED A POLICE OFFICER TO HELP HIM, HE REPLIED THAT
HE DIDN'T KNOW ANY FIRST AID AND HAD TO FIND A FIRST AID PERSON. I TRIED TO
GET TO THE PITCH TO FIND MY FRIEND BUT THE POLICE OFFICER WOULDN'T LET ME. HE
SEEMED TO HAVE NO CONCERN THAT I WAS WORRIED SICK ABOUT HIM.

I TRAVELLED TO THE MATCH ON MY OWN, BUT MET A FEW FRIENDS AT THE GROUND*
THEIR NAMES ARE                               BUT I DON'T KNOW THEIR
ADDRESSES.

OF PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE GROUND WHO SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THERE.
I WENT INTO THE GROUND TO WATCH THE GAME AT 2.40 AND FROM THEN UNTIL 2.55 YOU
COULD SEE PEOPLE STANDING UP AT THE FRONT OF THE FENCES TRYING TO GET OVER
ONTO THE PITCH, AND THE POLICE WERE JUST PUSHING THEM BACK. I THINK THE
PQ MCE WERE VIOLENT. AT THE TIME I COULD SEE THAT THE MIDDLE SECTION WAS
OllRCROWDED. THE MIDDLE SECTION WAS HEAVING, ROCKING, AND YOU COULD SEE
PEOPLE STRUGGLING, WANTING TO GET OUT.
I DON'T WANT TO SLAG THE POLICE OFF, AND ANYWAY YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT REALLY
INTERESTED IN THAT.

ANY FATALITIES AT 3.05 BUT TURNED AROUND AND SAW A FRIEND UP IN THE WEST
STAND, HE HELPED ME CLIMB UP INTO THE WEST STAND BUT UP THERE THERE WAS JUST
CONFUSION, I DON'T THINK THEY WERE AWARE OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE INCIDENT
THEY WERE JUST ANNOYED THAT WE WERE UP THERE WITHOUT SEAT TICKETS. I WENT
LAST YEAR TO THE GAME AND IT WAS EXACTLY THE SAME THEN ONLY IT DIDN'T GET THE

SCREAMING, HE COULD NOT GET UP, I KEPT TRYING TO BEND DOWN TO GET HIM, BUT
THE CROWD WAS SO GREAT, THERE WAS NO ENOUGH ROOM TO BEND DOWN, PEOPLE WERE
WALKING OVER HIM, EVENTUALLY I BENT DOWN AND PEOPLE WERE WALKING OVER MY
BACK, I WAS SHOUTING FOR THEM TO GET OFF I COULD NOT BREATH, I COULD NOT GET
THE BOY BECAUSE HE WAS BENT ROUND THE UPRIGHT OF THE CRUSH BARRIER, A WOMAN
GOT CRUSHED AGAINST THE BARRIER AND WAS SCREAMING FOR HELP, ME AND OTHERS
MANAGED TO GET HER UNDER THE BARRIER, IT WAS THAT BAD THERE WERE PEOPLE
S K I N G ON TOP OF OTHERS IN THE CROWD, I THEN LOST SIGHT OF THE LAD. THERE
ms A POLICE MAN AT THE FRONT OF THE FENCES , AND PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO CLIMB
OUT AND HE KEPT PUSHING THEM BACK.
I COULD NOT BREATH AND I THINK I LOST CONSCIOUSNESS, I WAS PUSHED TO ONE OF
THE SIDE FENCES WHERE I WAS DRAGGED OVER THE FENCE BY TWO SCOUSERS AND A
POLICEMAN. I THINK THE POLICEMANS NUMBER WAS 300, THAT POLICE MAN RISKED HIS
OWN LIFE TO GET PEOPLE OUT, HE OFFERED TO TAKE ME FOR TREATMENT, I TOLD HIM
ABOUT THE YOUNG LAD, AND THE POLICEMAN WENT INTO THE CROWD, WITHOUT THINKING
OF HIMSELF TO HELP THE BOY AND ANYONE ELSE HE COULD, HE SHOULD BE TOLD HOW
GOOD HE WAS.

THERE WAS NO MARSHALLS INSIDE THE GROUND CHECKING TICKETS OR ASSESSING THE
SITUATION IN VIEW OF OVERCROWDING. THE WEST STAND WAS FAR TOO SMALL FOR THE
AMOUNT OF PEOPLE ATTENDING THE MATCH. I SAW ALOT OF PEOPLE AT THE REAR OF
WEST STAND BEING PULLED UP INTO THE SEATING TERRECE TO AVOID BEING CRUSHED.

I WNET TO MIDDLE. I WAS CONSTANTLY GETTING PUSHED AND SHOVED. IT WAS ALREADY
PACKED. I SAW A GAP BY A FENCE TO THE RIGHT OF ME SO I CLIMBED UP ON THAT AND
SO IT WAS ONLY MY LOWER BODY BEING PUSHED. I SAW THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE CRYING
OUT IN AGONY. A GROUP OF LADS BY ME WERE ASKING FOR A STRETCHER BUT THAT WAS
IGNORED. I SAW THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE DOWN IN FRONT OF ME THAT WERE DEAD BUT
STILL STANDING BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT ANY ROOM FOR THEM TO FALL DOWN. THERE
WAS ONE LAD THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY DEAD BECAUSE HIS HEAD WAS ROLLED BACK AND
BLOOD WAS RUSHING FROM HIS MOUTH. PEOPLE FROM THE STANDS WERE PULLING PEOPLE
INTO THE STANDS. THE POLICE WERE TRYING TO STOP THE FANS FROM BREAKING THE
BOARDING ALTHOUGH THEY WANTED TO USE THEM AS STRETCHERS.

OUT OF THE CENTRE PENS AGAIN, THE SAME AS LAST YEAR. THE TEAM STARTED TO COME
OUT THEN AND PEOPLE WERE STILL TRYING TO CLIMB OUT OF THE CENTRE PENS ON MY
RIGHT AND TO THE FRONT OF THE CENTRE PENS. AFTER A SHORT TIME THE POLICE WERE
HELPING TO RIP THE FENCES DOWN WHEN THEY REALISED THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE
EVENT. A LOT OF POLICE CAME FROM THE BOTTOM LEFT HAND CORNER OF THE GROUND
AND FORMED A BARRIER ACROSS THE GROUND. THERE SEEMED TO BE A LOT OF
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT THE POLICE SHOULD DO AND CHAOS PREVAILED. THEN
EVERYTHING HAPPENED SO QUICKLY AND DEAD PEOPLE WERE BEING LAIN ON THE PITCH
DIM3CTLY IN FRONT OF WHERE I WAS. I COULD SE IT ALL HAPPENING BUT THERE WAS
N ® A Y I COULD HELP AT ALL. THERE ONLY APPEARED TO BE A VERY SMALL GATE FOR
PEOPLE TO GET THROUGH, SO THERE WAS NO WAY PEOPLE COULD GET THE CRUSHED
PEOPLE OUT OR GET IN TO ASSIST THEM.

HORSE. HE WAS PUSHING HIS HORSE AGAINST THE FANS AND SHOUTING AT THEM "GONE
KILL YOURSELVES THEN" HE KEPT SHOUTING THIS. AT 5 TO 3 WE ACTUALLY GOT
THROUGH THE TURNSTILLE AND INTO THE PEN. THE GATE WAS NOT OPEN. WHEN THE
PEOPLE WERE BEING KILLED THE POLICE DID NOT REALISE WHAT WAS HAPPENING. THE
FANS WERE RIPPING THE BOARDS AWAY TO USE AS STRETCHERS. I WAS UPSET BY A
PHOTOGRAPHER WHO WAS TAKING PICTURES OF THE DEAD AND INJURED. I THOUGHT THIS
WAS QUITE CALLOUS.

POLICE WERE SHOUTING TO THE CROWD TO GET BACK. THERE HAD BEEN NO POLICE OR
STEWARDS TO DIRECT FANS WHEN THEY GOT INSIDE THE GROUND. THE GAME WAS
STOPPED. I COULDN'T SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON BUT I SAW PEOPLE BEING LIFTED UP.
THEN THE BARRIERS WENT. PEOPLE WERE LYING DEAD AND SQUASHED ALL AROUND ME. I
TRIED TO HELP PEOPLE AND MOVE THE BODIES BUT HAD TO LEAVE AT ABOUT 3.45, I
COULDN'T TAKE ANY MORE. I HELPED CARRY ONE BODY OUT WHEN I LEFT. PEOPLE WERE

FlfST ONES I'D SEEN SINCE I WENT IN THROUGH THE TURNSTILES. THEY WERE
STOPPING PEOPLE GOING IN SO THE AMBOS COULD GET IN. THEY WERE RIGHT TO OPEN
THE GATE OUTSIDE, THERE WAS MORE DANGER OF PEOPLE BEING KILLED OUTSIDE,
CRUSHED AGAINST THE WALLS. THERE WAS FALLING MASONRY ASWELL.

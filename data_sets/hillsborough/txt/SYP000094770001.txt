             On that day I together with PC                               w a s carryimp out duties       in

             connection with the Barnsley Football                  Match.   As a result of a request

             from ops'    room for operational        support we attended in L.e p p 1n g s Lane at

            about 3.03 pm <1505).         Neither of us entered the ground and were

             shortly afterwards deployed to the Sheffield City Centre where                        1

            arrested a man from Notts for fighting.                     However whilst   in Leppings

            Lane myself and other officers were subjected to verbal abuse from rnan;|

            Liverpool     fans.   Many fans were distressed but 1 could not believe the

            apparent number of people showing the symptoms of drunkeness.

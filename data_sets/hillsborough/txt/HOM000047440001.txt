          Mr Lock (club security officer)
          Inspector (?Chief Inspector) McRobbie (who was round and about the police control

  2.      In the case o f the police officers mentioned above we would also like to see any
  earlier versions there might be o f their statements, and their ‘questionnaires’ if such exist. It
  would help if you could action this request urgently.

  3.    I am (all too!) aware that we owe you responses to a number o f letters you have sent
  us over the last couple of weeks. Please accept my apologies for that - as you know, we have
  been busy elsewhere recently. The replies will be with you soon.

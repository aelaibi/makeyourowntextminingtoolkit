     Dear Sir and Madam

     Re: Hillsborough Disaster

     Thank you for your letter of 16th September 1994. I am enclosing a copy of the letter I
     wrote to your solicitors, Messrs Atkinson and Firth, on 6th April 1993, which sets out the
     conditions on which the copy video material was supplied. After that I had a further
     exchange of letters with them in which I agreed that the video cassettes could be viewed
     by Dr Iain West of Guy’s and St Thomas’s Hospital.

     I recall mentioning to your solicitors that making tapes available could be time-consuming
     and, consequently, costly and that when the BBC supplied the tapes in relation to a quite
     separate matter (not to do with Hillsborough) a charge of £1000 had been made. In the
     particular circumstances of your solicitor’s request, however, you will see that the BBC
     only made a nominal charge of £80 for copying the cassettes. However, I did mention to
     your solicitors that it would be necessary to charge an economic rate in dealing with any
      other matters that might arise in the future, and that would have to be based on an hourly
      rate for the time of whoever might be involved in such inquiries.

      I am afraid I that I have no knowledge of the details you have requested other than the
      details which I supplied to your solicitors when I sent them the tapes. May I suggest,
      therefore, that your MP gets in contact with your solicitors from whom, I suspect, he/she
      will be able to get most of the relevant information. If, after that, you MP still requires




                                                                                              PRINTED O N RECYCLED PAf'i
further specific details, he/she is welcome to contact me to explain precisely what is
required and I can look into the matter. Unfortunately, however, it may be necessary to
make a charge for this, so it is best not to spend time on things which are not strictly
necessary or useful.


Yours faithfully

Dear Mrs Hedar,

Re : The Hillsborough Disaster - Gary Church Deceased

Thank you for your letter of 1st April 1993, and I refer to our telephone conversation this
morning.

As arranged, I am enclosing, on the conditions outlined below, four VHS cassettes
containing what I understand to be all the Hillsborough material retained by the BBC. I
also enclose three A4 sheets containing notes and a plan which, I believe, should cast some
light on the contents of these tapes, although it was prepared some years ago now. I
propose to charge £80.00 plus VAT as a nominal figure to cover the copying of these
cassettes and the cheque should, please, be made payable to "British Broadcasting
Corporation". No formal invoice will be issued, but the BBC’s VAT number is 333 2894
54.

Theconditions on which these cassettes are supplied are as follows :-

1.     That they are on loan to be used only in connection with the research and
preparation of the case concerning Gary Church (Dec’d) outlined in your correspondence
with me.

2.     That they are not to be copied without specific prior permission o f this Department.
In particular they are not to be allowed out of your firm’s possession in circumstances
where any copying might take place.

3.     That they are not to be shown to persons other than your Clients, their legal advisers
concerned with the case and appropriate expert witnesses.
4.     That they are to be returned to this Department at the conclusion of (or earlier
decision not to pursue) the case.


Once you have had an opportunity to consider the tapes it may be that there will be a need
to liase further in relation to the identification and timing of the recorded material. As I
have explained, the BBC would need to charge and economic rate for time spent in dealing
with such matters as it may be able to assist with. I suggest, however, that we deal with
that if it arises once it becomes clearer what and who will be involved.

Yours sincerely,




Roger Law

    The aim of the meeting was established as being to look at what work had been
    done by the different agencies in response to the Hillsborough disaster, whilst
    needs could be identified as a result of the work, and where future events need
    to be Dlanned for.

                said that last November when contingency plans for a possible
 disaster were discussed the Police thought that it was their job, but nothing
Kas happened.

    Updated the meeting on the work of the Hillsborough Task Team.
_




    They are working with a small number of individuals, some groups, and will
    be holding a public meeting. They are also issuing publicity to encourage
    further referrals and educate the community as to the likely effects.

Isaid that Cruse had been working in two main areas
_




      a) requests from Liverpool    people to maintain contact with   counsellors
         they were involved with on the weekend of the disaster; and
     b) looking after their own     staff.
 They were also being used by professionals who didn't feel that they could
 use their own agency or department for help.

    It was generally agreed that many people may not be able too offload any
    work for fear of being seen as inadequate.

    The Red Cross's involvement with Hillsborough ceased after seven days,
    which is their organisations policy.            said that all their own staff
    had been debriefed and counselled. He said that there were no apparent
    problems but admitted that fear of seeming 'inadequate' may be a factor.

    Dr. |      |said that the St. John's Ambulance service had 30 staff present on
    April 15th, consisting of young cadets as well as experienced staff. The
    cadets were removed from the scene when the seriousness of the situation was
    realised. Afterwards they received help and advice from their Bradford staff.
    A service held at the ground was found to be therapeutic, as well as the
    Cathedral service. Counsellors were on hand at the next match and only one
    or two required help. This was felt to be sufficient organised 'grieving'.
    One or two staff were involved in the inquiry which was stressful.
Mr, |
    ________ pf the Fire Service said that some volunteers and fringe workers
were affected. He thought that the 'maCho' attitude of firemen could be a
factor in preventing them from asking for help,             s department is
available if needed.

     of the Samaritans said that they were still getting calls from people
who were at or around the ground or who were T.V. viewers. The experiences
of their colleagues in Bradford was that it really only started to hit some
people A of 5 months after the event. This included Firemen and ambulancemen,

___________ (informed the meeting of a survey being organised of NHS and Counci
employees to assess the medium term effects and indentify needs.

Particular occasions to be prepared for in the future were thought to be the
start of the new season, the first visit of Liverpool to Sheffield Wednesday
on November 29th, and the coraoer's inquest, the latter was expected to be
particularly emotive for the police, who-are not being permitted to seek
outside help.
                                                           }■
It was suggested that other groups experiencing difficulties may include the
MedicoLegal Centre workers, and the WRVS who are saying they can cope.

The group felt strongly that the agencies should be careful not to compete
and that we should have a mutual open-door policy, so that people can have
a variety of agencies to choose from. To this end, it was suggested that the
counselling agencies consider sharing publicity and advertising. These agent;
would meet again on 25th August at 10am to discuss this.

It was proposed that the whole group meet again to reassess the situation,
examine the work of the survey, and look at preparations for the inquest.


Next meeting Tuesday 19th September 2.30pm at Hillsborough Library.

This meeting had been set up to look at the possibility of the counselling agencies
sharing some form of publicity about their services, particularly now that the new
football season had started. As a significant number of representatives from
agencies had been unable to attend the meeting, it was agreed that the Hillsborough
Task Team should take the initiative about the form and worBing of such an advert
and then approach all the interested agencies to see if they wished to be included -r
for their comments. It was thought that the advert should be placed in the local
paper sometime in September.
It was also suggested that if the 'Coping after Hillsborough' was remodelled then the
various agency numbers could be included on the back.
The members in attendance fed back how much work they had at the moment as a result
of the Disaster.
                    said that things were fuiet now with no referrals coming from
the Fire Service. However she plans to go back to the Fire Service to assess how
the situation is now.               told the meeting of his plans to contact the
Secretary of the Fire Brigade Union and the Secretary of the Union to the Ambul­
ance Service. The purpose of this is to look at ways information about help and
counselling could be passed on to their members independently from the employers.
              ill be contacting                    to discuss the outcome of this
meeting with the Fire Brigade Union.
               informed the meeting that they have no ongoing work at the moment
connected to the disaster. They do however continue to have formal and informed
meetings with the Police through their work and would be prepared to offer help
if requested .
The Hillsborough Task Team members updated the meeting on work being done by them,
including recent approaches to and work with residents around the Sheffield Wed­
nesday Ground, and the setting up of a training day in October for those likely
to be involved with the Inquests.
The next meeting of the full Co-ordinating Group is on Tuesday 19th September at
2.30pm at Hillsborough Library.

  Dear Sir

  I would like to invite you to an interdenominational meeting of Sheffield
  5 and 6 clergy to discuss the response of the local communities and
  individual need to the Hillsborough disaster. This team has been established
  by the Sheffield council's Family and Community Services Department to
  respond to Sheffield's needs following the disaster. In order to make
  appropriate offers of help to individuals and the community, could you
  come to a meeting at Hillsborough Library at 2 pm on Thursday 27 July.

  Thank you for your co-operation.

  Yours faithfully

Dear Sir,

     I have just received your letter of 10th July inviting me
to a meeting of Sheffield 5 & 6 clergy to discuss the response
of the local community to the Hillsborough disaster. This is
certainly something that I feel very concerned about, and would
have earnestly wished to attend. Unfortunately I have a prior
engagement on Thursday 27th July at 2pm.

     Would you please give my apologises. I am very keen to be
involved in any planning of contingency plans to cope with any
further disasters, and would therefore be grateful if you could
keep me informed of any decisions and actions, and be sure to
include me in any plans.

     I hope that you have a good and successful meeting.


                          Yours faithfully

Dear Rev. Jeans
After meeting with other members of the local clergy, I felt it would probably be
beneficial if we could meet separately, fhere are a number of issues that we could
usefully discuss as well as informing you of the outcome of that meeting.
I have tried to telephone with no success, therefore if you could telephone me we
might be able to arrange a mutually convenient time.

Yours Sincerely

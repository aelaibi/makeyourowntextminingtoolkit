    a    couple     of y a r d s        away       from       the       turnstiles.               They        seemed, to           be

    watching        the       fans      that       were       climbing           over        the o u t s i d e w all.               In fact,

    going     into       the    gro u n d .          The      steward           I saw w as         having          a discussion                with

    two    policemen and                standing             by a       large        exit       gate     to    the      right       of    the

    I looked        back       momentarily               for       my     friends          and    waited          about       a minute          or

    a bit     longer          for     them.          I didn't             see    them       so    I went          to    go    into       the

Whilst       in P e n 3 the               crowd         serged         me     down       to     the    front         and     then        there

seemed       to    be a       bit       of    relief          then       suddenly              the    serge        came      even        harder

and    there       was    no      r elief.              The      crush        got      harder         and     h ar d e r .

I did       not    see    a    lot       of     drink         being         consumed            o n l y a few           having       a     couple

        Inside          the     ground          in P e n 3,         I did       see     people       climbing           o ver       the      f e nce

        into      the        ground        and a        policeman          push        them     back      into     the        crowd..

        However,,            I particularly                remember            three     policemen,             two     of w h i c h         were          on

        the      pitch.            O ne    of    these        policemen          I saw        pull     open       the     front        g a te         to

        Pen     3,      after         he   had     been       on    the    fence        shouting          to    the     crowd        to      get

        b a ck.         After         he   got     the     gate         open    he     started       to     pull       people        out.             He

        saw     the         young      policemen           continually               carrying        people        out        onto     the        field

        it.       I only           saw     the     gate       at    the    entrance           being       open     by a P o l i c e m a n

        just      o nce        and     t h at    is w h e n        I was       looking        for    my f r i e n d s         and    on      that

        occasion             I only        saw about           a dozen          people        walk     through          it a n d m o s t

        of     them were              people       with       children.

        After        everything              had      happened,           I went        b ack    into       P e n 3,      looking            for       my

            brother         and     we   soon        found      each    other.      I didn't       personally        know anyone

            who     d ie d .      W e r e rna i n e d     i n s i d e t h e g r o u n d u n t i I a bout   4.3 0    < 1630 ) a n a

            then     left      of    our       own accord.

            I    think      there        was    a     lack     of    organisation      after     the m a t c h     was    stopped

            with     only      some       police        helping        and   others   standing       around.         I think         if

            the     organisation               before         the    match   had   been   ri ght    this    would        not    have

            happened.

             From        noon onwards           I saw a steady            build up of traffic and at about                           1310

             hrs        I saw standing           traffic         from G r e n s i d e      traffic:    lights       to a point on

             the A61           near   to H o w b r o o k    Cross      roads,     a distance           of 2 miles.              I saw

that      there were        officers      at    the   traffic       lights and these                 officers

were      giving       priority      to vehicles       on the A61          but    the volume           of traffic

was     such that        vehicles       were    only going        through the j u n ction               slowly,

this      in turns was          causing    a backlog and            in turn standing                 traffic-              1


made a check            on the A 61& and         saw that        the    road was         clear       of traffic.

X rode       from the       gr o u n d to Dee pear and found only                  light     traffic-              I

rode      back along        the A61 sand saw that               there was        still     standing          traffic

 iround the H o w b r o o k Cross          rcs^ds.       I rode        to the     junction           of the A61
                                                            t f g n i
and A 616T and after              liaising       w 1 IsfcaJ 1 nsp 13R Q W H I d i v erted        traffic along

the A 6 1 6 T      to the Deep c a r      j u n c t i o n and    down the A616 to Sheffield-

Other       officers      brought       signs and traffic:               in both d i rections was then

d i v e r t e d along     the A616.        Traffic       along          the A 616 was     constant           but       with

1   Ar g e g a p s „

At               ^345 h rs      1 saw    that    traffic: along           the A 616 from M a n c h e s t e r

had eased and            I saw also       that    numbers        of ve'ni cles from the                direction

of the Ml m o t o r w a y        had also       eased.

At     1400 h r s I left         the A & 1 6 T and      road to Hi 1 1 sbo r o u g h „           1    saw that

vehi cles were moving                freely and there            were     no vehicular           problems

around       the    ground.       I c o ntinued on to            the A61 and         to the          j u n ction with

the A 6 16 T .         I saw that       on this       road traffic         flow had eased and

vehicles        were making          good speed.         The     d i v e r s i o n was    removed,,

At     1430 hrs        I patrol led the A 61& at O u t b r i d g e            and found the             road and

area      quiet.        I ?^md       it to be quieter            than a normal           Saturday.            I rode

to H i 11 s b o r o u g h and sV*w that a l t h o u g h          large     numbers        of vehi cles were

parked off          streets     no    prcsblems were        caused.         I rode        back along          the

A 616 and saw PC            1419 and PC £090            (a 1so motor        cyclists)        near       to

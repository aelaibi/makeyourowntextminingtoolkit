Dear Sir,

lhank you for your letter of the 6th instant, the contents of which I note.

I have now heard from Dr Popper and enclose a copy of his letter herewith which
has also been sent to Mr Mervyn Jones. I also enclose a copy of my letter
to Mervyn Jones and trust that that adequately sets out the position as far
as you are concerned.

The Bulletin goes out to members this weekend so you may be receiving requests
sometime from next week onwards.

Yours sincerely,

Dear Mervyn,

You have received a copy of the letter sent to me by Dr Popper with regard
to witness statements.

In the light of that letter it seems that in the restrictive circumstances
set out he has no objection to the release of witness statements but does
warn that due to pressure of work there may be some delay.

I am including in the Bulletin to our Solicitor members the fact that the
statements are now to be made available through the West Midlands Police
provided th^ are statements of the Solicitors own client or a witness who
signed authority is included.

I have also contented that at least whilst the Inquests are there may be some
delay in dealing with that.

Every good wish.

Yours sincerely,

         Re:    Release           of Witness       Statements.

         Tha nk you for your letter of the                              5th of November.     I am sorry ab ou t   the delay
         in replying.

         I note that you are res tr icting y o u r request to witness sta te m en t s of your
         cl ients togeth er wit h those st at em ent s of witn es se s wh o have gi ve n a signed
         a u t h o r i t y for release to a p a r t i c u l a r solicitor.

         S p e ak i n g for myself, I do not hav e any pa rt icu lar o bj ec ti on to copy
         sta te m e nt s of this nature being relea sed to the solicitor co nce rne d, though I
         m u s t say that just at the moment, w e may be physica lly unab le to co mp ly with
         any requests.

         I suggest that if you can w ri te to the West Midlands Police w i t h the names of
         the peo ple w h o you have in mind.   The y wil l then look into the matter, and no
         doubt w i l l deal wit h it as far as they can.

, Sheffield.



 The    journey to S he f f i e l d       took about 2-3 hours and the                 roads,       a lt h o u g h

 busy,       were   fairly    clear      until we neared Sheffield,             when        it got     very

 busy.        We used the Ml        north bo un d and then foil owed the d e si gn at ed

 route for football            traffic.          We never    stopped on the journey,                 neither

 did we witness any fans mi sb eh av in g                  or drinking at        this       time.      Prior

 to a rr iv ing at the stadium               I parked my      car at     the top of a hill               in an

 industrial,        estate about a         15 minute walk         from the ground.



              and myself      wa lk ed straight        down to the ground asking                   various

 F orest S u pp or te rs      for   tickets as we had           passed through near                to the top

 end of the ground.             We were       unsuccessful        in our attempt            to purchase

 tickets       and due    to the Police           having    closed off all           the side streets

 we were       directed by a Police Officer all                  the way     round the stadium

 towards Leppings            L n , the    time w ould be a p p r o x i m a t e l y    12 noon       <1200).



 On    reaching Vere Rd near              to soa^e small      shops     I saw a b o u t six ticket

 touts,       holding wads       of tickets./ Thev a pp e a r e d to be o rganised                     by a

 man who was seated            in a
                                 V T " C 7
                    He spoke with a Lormon                 cent/am^ a pp e a r e d to be organising

 the other five men who were all                    from Liverpool.          E ach time one of               the

 five    sold a ticket         they w o ul d      return to the                       and    confer with

 the Londoner.           On seeing        this    I a pp ro a c h e d one of the men and was

 quickly       s urrounded by two others,              they all a t t e m p t e d % a       sell    me a

 ticket a nd        I e ventually        bought    two for £50 fron                  of them,        I later

 found out these          same men were selling              the tick                       0 each.



 H av in g    purchased the two tickets w hich had a face value of £6.00,                                    for

  the Le pp in gs Ln standing a rea we                then made      our wa y to the          stadium
                                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                                  S3166

entrance at the L ep pings Ln.                  I never saw any fighting               or d runkenness

at this      time.



On a rr iving at the turnstile                 ent anc/,        the    time would be a b o u t 1310

hours     (1310),       there w e r e    o r d e r l y q/aues    outside and both myself and

           *iere s ea rched by a Po 1 i aeyt)f f^«-er^pr io r to going                    through the

turnstile.          I handed my ticket           over to the operator and                 passed through

into     the ground area where              I was again searched             by another Police

Officer.          1 cannot      recall    seeing any stewards at              this   location,

neither      did    I witness any gates            being    opened or any          illegal     entry to

the    ground.



Once     through the turnstiles              I carinot /remember          seeing a ny dir ec ti on

I en te red the L ep pings Ln standing area through the tunnel                               and had

free     passage along          into the     central      pen area.         1 saw two stewards

either     side of the tunnel             who were di r/oylng fans               either    into the

tunnel     or up the stairs             to the West s                  sating area.        I do not

recall     seeing any Police Officers at this                         location,    neither was     there

disorder         of any kind or drunkenness.

I was     in P en No.      3.     I was    not s ubjected to any             crush at this time,

t he r e we re only about 2 — 300            people sitting            or standing ar o u n d .    it was

a general        good atmosphere.



A fter    this     point    there was a gradual            build up       in the     pen and    I can

recall       saying     to              there     is a lot of people              in here and         it was
                                        J          /
a r ou n d   this     t i m e , about    14.30/hours,, (1430)           that     I heard an

a n n ou nc em en t    over    the tanr                      ~eg.uesting fans at the front                     of

the    pens      to move forward to a                     fore fans       in behind.         I thought          this

was    ridiculous as we              could not move any further                  forward,     people were

shouting at us from behind to move                         forward.



At this stage           I realised the           pressure a ro u n d me was a lot worse                    than       I

have    ever      experi en ce d before.           I began to be extremely                  concerned about

my g i rl fr ie nd and         I pulled her        in front        of me     in an effort        to protect

her.



At about         14.43 hours         <1443                 ter    the L i v e r p o o l /     ers     came onto

the f ield for the w arm up and everyone                          cheered a nd        _______       f wa r d

The    pressure was so              intense that         people a ro u n d me were^jjMlfut i ng they

c o u l d n ’t breath.         1 had no       control      over    the movement a ro u n d me as                the

crowd s urged for wa r d , we               rema i ned    in that      pos i t ion we d i d n ’t move           back

again.                   was    still       in front      of me and       I had hold of her w it h my

left a r m , we were           side     on to the        pitch and      I could not move my other

arm to assist           her any further           it was     jammed down beside m e .

became       hysterical        at    this    point as we were forced further                    forward. I

could hear fans shouting at the steward                             to open the gate w hi ch was

d ir e ct l y    in front of us.              He seemed to hesitate mornentar i l y , I think

he m ay have          even a s ke d a        Police Officer what              to do, and on his          return

he o pe ne d the gate,              let about 3 or 4 people               out,     closed the door and

w al ke d off.         At this       point    I was      in front     of the barrier at             position

(1),    there were about              two    people      between myself          and the b a r r i e r .       I

saw a young           lad of about 9~1 0 yep.rjt>,/ he was, w it h in arms                  length       o-f me.

He must         have been pushed down after VfTe                    surge as       I cannot recall

seeing him standing                 beside me earlier.              He called out for           help but his

              cries were muffled,                fans   tried to pull         him to safety but          no one     could

              raise      their arms        up.       I saw his face       turn jfl ue    in front of me a nd his

              cries faded a w a y »           I w ould describe          him /as thin b u i l d , probably about

Ml            could hav a survived.



              The      next thing        I remember       is seeing a Police/) pf f i c e r open the gate                    the

              st ew ar d had earlier             closed and attempt          to tfull      a^s   out of the

              pen,                     and m yself were       g radually      pushewr f orward nearer         to the

              gate      in the     position       I have ma rk ed      (2)   on the grid.          I believe       the

              players         had just k ic ked off and the              time w ou ld be a b o u t 3.02       pm

              (1502).         My main     p riority was       to get               out and myself and two

              other      fans were        in the      process    of pushing her         through the gate when

              s ud d en l y the fans        b ehind me were        thrown      forward.      I can only assume

              the barrier          had given way.             I do not    recall    hearing the barrier             snap

              but      sud de nl y found myself          further     back     in the    crowd further away              from

              the      gate.      On    looking up I saw                     had gone,     clear    of the gate and

              was sate



              S h o r t l y after       this more Police O fficers a r r iv ed and               I m a na ge d to       pul.

              m yself     up a nd out th ro ugh the gate,                where   I rejoined                        ne

              behind the goal.              I looked towards           the    pe^n I hap just e sc ap e d from and

              the      pen to my right           (Pen 4) and      I could' see      taps    fjy&s^ied w ith    their

              faces tight          up a gainst        the fence,     they were      bWe     in th\^ face and were

              not saying a n y t h i n g .           I w o u 1d be about      six feet awa y from them.                 At

* this    point the Police were working                fr an ti ca ll y   pulling fans    over the

 perimeter       fence and through the gate.                 I saw an old man wit h grey

 hair,    being    pulled over the fence,              two Police Officers           carried him to

 the     corner of the field        in front of Pen           1, they examined together w ith

 a St.    John A mb ulance man and then put a blanket all                        over his body and

 head.      It was at this        point    I realised there were                people dead.



 P ol ic e Officers      ushered us towards           the front      of the N orth S t a n d     in

 order    to a llow the     em er ge nc y services         through.        I saw Police and fans

 ripping    up the hoardings         to assist with           carrying the dead and            injured

 away.      I wanted to help but                      wa nt ed me to remain w it h her.



 I was    not    injured as a result         of this       incident       but           r eceived ba d

 bruising       to her   left   leg and feet,          neither    of us a tt e n d e d hospital.



 I w ould say the main          reason for the tragedy was a culmin at io n of

 various     incidents,     one   being     the fact       that   for one        I bought/ tickets,

 al o ng w ith other      fans , w hi ch was a cont r i buto ry factor . /THe re                     re

 too m a ny Police Officers          inside     the ground and not\eno/igh ^ u f f y d e              the

 ground    checking      supporters       tickets.       I feel     that L i y ^ r p o q y supptrrters

 sho ul d have     been given the         larger      end of the ground.            There was    a

 d elay   in the a ttendance       of the emergency services who once they

 arrived     performed brilliantly.



 I never saw anything w h ic h            1’ w ould    consider     to be a criminal       offence.

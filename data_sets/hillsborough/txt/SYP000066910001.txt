               I am Special            Con st ab le                        serving      in the S Y o rk sh ir e Police

              F or c e and based at H a c k e n t ho r pe Pstn.                 I have    been a special           C o ns ta bl e

               for a p p r o x i m a t e l y    two and a half years.



              On S a t u r d a y    15th April,       1989     (150489)       I commenced duty at 094 5 hrs my

               posting       being a traffic          point at P e ni st on e Rd at ij^s j u nction wi
                                                                          /7tS 7 ? v
              H e rr ie s Rd S.          I was     in company wit h P C1 78 3 B r o ug h an and SC

                                 I a r ri ve d at my traffic           point at about           1030 hrs.         At this

               time    the traffic was             fairly quiet.           I remained at this           point      until

               1200 hrs         until    I relieved another            traffic        post at Halifax Rd a t it's

               j u nc t io n w ith Clay Wheels Ln for 30 minutes.                         The     traffic at this          time
                                                                                                         PAGE           2
                                                                                                         S1117

was    fairly heavy,          both vehicular            and      pedestrian.



At about          1230 hrs    I returned to                                              Rd..    By this         time

the    flow of traffic           had started to                increase a lt ho ug h this was          normal

for a day when a good football m at ch was                              being    staged.        In my opinion,

the    traffic       flow was       stea dy and was             being    polictfa adequately.            I was

on duty at the FA             cup semi-final in 1988 a n ^ a l t h o u g h at a different
                                   --------------------
traffic       point,    it seemed to me that                    the    traffic was       flowing more

ea si l y this year          than    last.



My traffic          posting was          towards     the S pi on Ko p end of the H i l l s b o ro u gh

F oo tball        ground.     T h er ef or e    the suppo rt er s         of N o tt i ng h am F o r r e s t ’s

football          team were    the only          people        I was    really    in contact with.               The

L iverpool         supporters       a p pr o ac h ed the ground from the L ep pi ng s Ln end.



I can say that at about                   1450 hrs,        I noticed an increase                in the number

of    supporters w a lk in g         to the ground.               I saw that a number             of those

suppo rt e r s were         in p osses sion of           cans of alcohol           and    I can say that

m an y were        in high spirits,            a l t ho u gh    I w o ul d not describe          the behaviour

as d r u n k en or disorderly.                 The fans seemed            to be both N o tt i n g h a m

F o r r e s t and Li ve rp oo l      fans a l t ho u gh the Liverpool                fans were      smaller          in

number.           I am unable       to    comment on why              there was an       increase     in the

number       of    persons making          their way to the ground at this time a l t h ou g h

can say that          I e x pe r i e n c e d no traffic           d i ff ic ul ti es and am not aware                of

any    traffic delays w h ic h might                 have h in de re d       the fans.



W hi l s t   on duty    I was       not    in p ossession of a personal                   radio,    a l t h ou g h

PC B r o u g h a n and SC                      both had         radios.



It had been our             i ntention to         remain at our           traffic     point until        approx.
                                                                                                   PAGE         3
                                                                                                   S 111 7

1510 hrs         but at about        1506 hrs        I was made aware that something               was

wrong and that something was                   happening        inside   the ground.        I did not

know any details             of what was happening              but PC B ro ug ha n asked me        to

remain at the            point whilst        he went     to the ground.         This   I did,      and    I

i^jemained at the           point    until    1715 h r s .



Between         1506 hrs and        1715 hrs my main          priority was      to keep Herries           Rd

S,   clear       in both direc ti on s        because e m e r g e nc y services were using               this

road     in both dire c t i on s        to feed the N o r t h e r n General Hospital.

Therefore,          P e n i s t o n e Rd towards City was         used to ferry all         other     non-

essential          traffic.       I e xp e r i en c ed no    particular     problems      during    this

time.



I did not witness              any dead or       injured      persons     and did not a c t u al l y

attend         the H i l l s b o r o u g h ground.

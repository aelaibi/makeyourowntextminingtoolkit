WORLD CUP 1990

1 . LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR AND MEMBERS OF THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
INQUIRY TEAM VIS ITED ITALY FROM 2 - 6 DECEMBER.        THEY WATCHED A HOME
MATCH BETWEEN AC         MILAN AND BOLOGNA  AND HAD DISCUSSIONS      WITH THE
LOCAL POLICE AND CLUB O F F I C I A L S .  THEY THEN CAME ON TO ROME TO MEET
OF FI CI AL S OF THE MINISTRY OF THE I N TE RI OR, THE I T A L I A N FOOTBALL
FEDERATION, THE I T A L I A N NATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE (WO OWN THE
STADIO OLIMPICO WHERE THE WORLD CUP FINAL IS TO BE HELD) , AND
' I T A L I A 9 0 1, THE LOCAL WORLD CUP ORGANISING COMMITTEE.        THE CONSUL-
GENERAL IN MILAN         ENTERTAINED THEM  TO DINNER, AND  I    HELD  A RECEPTION
IN THEIR HONOUR AT MY HOUSE.

2 . THE COMMISSION COLLECTED A GREAT DEAL OF INFORMATION AND A VERY
WIDE RANGE OF VIEWS (MANY OF THEM CONFLICTING) ON THE -SAFETY AND
SECURITY OF STADIA AS RAW MATERIAL FOR THEIR FI NAL REPORT.        ALL
I T A L I A N S QUESTIONED SEEMED FRANK AND RESPONDED WELL TO THE JUDGE'S
SOMETIMES SEARCHING QUESTIONS.

3 . LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR GAVE A WELL-ATTENDED PRESS CONFERENCE HERE
ON 5 DECEMBER AND LATER IN A TELEVISION INTERVIEW GAVE HELPFUL
PU BL IC ITY TO THE FOOTBALL SPECTATORS' ACT, STRESSING THAT I T COULD
OPERATE ONLY I F OFFENDERS WERE FORMALLY CONVICTED.

COMMENT

4 . I T IS BECOMING CLEAR AFTER MR MOYNIHAN'S AND LORD JUSTICE
TAYLOR'S V I S I T S THAT THE WORD HAS GONE OUT HERE THAT HOOLIGANISM
DURING THE WORLD CUP WILL NOT (NOT) BE TOLERATED, AND I THINK WE
CAN EXPECT SOME VERY TOUGH POLICING INDEED.          THE SECURITY ADVISER
TO ' I T A L I A 9 0 ' (WHO IS A PUBLIC PROSECUTOR WHEN NOT OCCUPIED WITH
FOOTBALL) TOLD THE COMMISSION THAT FROM DISCUSSIONS WITH HIS
COLLEAGUES HE WAS SURE THAT THOSE OFFENDERS AGAINST WHOM THERE WAS
EVIDENCE WOULD BE CHARGED, TRIED WITHIN 48 HOURS AND, I F FOUND
GU I L T Y , IMPRISONED FOR THE REST OF THE COMPETITION, THEN DEPORTED.

  br&J Boh,
VISIT TO MILAN

    Thank you   for your kind letter of 7 December.                      I am glad the
visit to Milan proved so useful.

    1 promised to let you know the rough costs we    incurred on
your behalf. The following list uses the exchange rate L 2050 = £
1. There may be a very slight variation in the rate used in our
monthly account.

    Hilton Hotel                  L 1,434,200                 £ 699.61

    Train tickets                 L      592,000              £ 288.78
    Milan-Rome

    Interpreting                  L      520,000              £ 253.66

    Car hire                      L      523,600             £ 255.41
    (Lancia Thema)


                                  L 3,069,800                £ 1,497.46

    The only outstanding     item is the overtime worked by the
Consul General's driver. I will let you have a figure for this as
soon as possible.     (Overtime  is calculated at the end of the
month). It will probably be in the region of £ 200.

    As agreed we will process these payments in our normal way
but will   send photocopies of the bills      to the Home Office
Accounts Branch so they have some advance notice.




                                                            /VAewfwvv

On Saturday 15 April 19^9 eight officers and horses of ¥ottinghamshire
Cons tabulgry Mounted Section attended Hillsborough., Sheffield to assist the
S Yorkshire Police with the Liverpool v Nottingham Forest F A Cup semi final*


The officers attending were:-
     1.     Sgt 1710 ¥atson
     2.     Pc     790 Eerry
     3.     Pc    1463 Allen
     4.     Pc     560 Marshall
     5.     Pc    459 Hines
     6. ¥Pc         63 Bentley
  ' ■7. TOc        156 Main
     8.     Pc- 1226 Ellis.


Deployment was\as follows - Sgt ¥at^r,             :rry, Hines, Ellis and ¥Pc Main.
performed duty W^enifitone Road.
Pc’s AJ^^^^fatsnail and ¥Pc sentley were at the Railway Station reception - these
officers, were never deployed at the ground.


  e Penistone Road contingent were deployed along with a serial of 3 Yorkshire
 orses in supervising the Forest supporters who were all required to enter the
ground through the Penistone Road turnstiles*


The Forest supporters arriving at Penistone Road, although in large numbers,
were well behaved and policing their entry into the ground presented no unusual
problems*


At 2 50 pm I received a radio message from the match control to the effect that
trouble was being experienced air the Leppings Lane entrance to the ground and
that I was to lake any Mounted Officers that could be spared to this entrance
to assist.       Accordingly I took Pc 790 Kerry to the Leppings Lane entrance via
the back of the South Stand.      Already there were W!Pc 156 Main, 'WPc Wilson (South
Yorks) and I% Mounted Officers from Merseyside.


The Leppings Lane entrance was being -used for the Liverpool supporters to gain :
access to the ground and in particular the ¥esir Standi
Upon our arrival at Leppings Lane I saw a large crowd of between 2 - 3000
Liverpool supporters attempting to gain entrance to the ground through the
turnstiles.   The turnstiles were divided into two sections, a large brick
•wall '^divided the two sections and the approach from Leppings Lane to the
turnstiles had large iron gates across it.


The larger of the two sections had a large number' of people in it but the :
people appeared to be under control.     The smaller of the two however was
packed solidly with people.
                                                      f

This area allowed access to sis turnstiles, on the approach to them the area
was bounded to the left by the above mentioned brick waJJ. and to the right by a
steel barrier.     Many had been trapped in this area and were being crushed by some
of the 2 — 3000 who were pushing them from behind.        I could see that the people
at the front were under extreme and -unbearable pressure against the walls and
turnstiles; in the crush I saw several young children, some of whom were pulled
from the crowd by Mounted Officers and carried to safety.


Many of the large group who had caused the crush had only arrived in the previous
15 minutes, they were badly affected by drink and in a most unco-operative

and foul temper.


Along with other Mounted Officers at the scene I began to use my horse to force
an entry between the element at the back and the innocent people at the front;
during this operation I was genuinely and gravely concerned for the people at
the front, I was sure that if the situation was not resolved then seme people
would be at the very least, badly injured.


Whilst myself and the other" officers were    attempting to move the unruly element
from the back of the people being crushed Pc KEBEY wentto the gates between
the turnstiles and Leppings Lane, he used     his horse to drive back the youths
who were r-ha-rging up behind the people at the turnstile      and then closed the gates.
This had   very little effect as many      them climbed over the fencing at ..the sides
of the gate and into the turnstile area.                  -


In the meantime myself and "the other officers had been partly sucoessful in        /
removing the youths who* had been pushing from the back, however, as previously
stated they were in a state of drunkenness and persistently ran back into the
space we had cleared causing the people at the front to be crushed even further.
 During the -whole time that I was at the scene the walls were under constant siege
 with many .youths climbing them and gaining access to the ground without a ticket.
 The walls were about 1 2 ' high "but this did not deter these youths from climbing
 over and into the ground.    '         '


 The whole incident was barbaric with the'”late arrivals who had been drinking, showir
 no regard for the safety of the people at the front,in fact with the youths climbing
 the walls etc, I would liken the scenario to one of a medieval battle.


 Mary of those at the back seemed to. think it was amusing to push the people
 at the front and I would describe their attitude as being one of having great fun
 at taking part in such a confrontation.                     *


 At one point I had put my horse into the crowd to split it, I then stood him there
 to protect the people at the front from the ones at the back, the pressure from
 the back however was so great that the horse was lifted upwards and had to
 scramble to regain his footing.


 Suddenly a large gate to the rear of turnstiles opened upj I am not aware of
 who gave instructions for the gate to be opened.   As the gate opened Isaw officers
 on foot directing people into the ground    through this gate, this meant that
 within a few minutes most of the crowd had entered the ground and the people
 previously being crushed had been saved.    At the time I thought this was an
 excellent decision as it had undoubtedly saved the lives of some people.


 During the whde of the time that I was at this incident I saw about 200 people
 3 tanding watching the crush, it was obvious that these people did not have      a
 ticket, periodically some of them would sieze the opportunity to run forward,
 and climb the walls into the ground, similarly when the gate was opened all. of
  them ran forward and through the gate. .


 After the 2 - 3000 crowd had cleared at Leppings lane I along with the other
 Mounted Officers at the scene were directed to Gate ’0* on Penistone Road.
- Upon our arrival there we were told to standby on a nearby garage forecourt.        .
 Whilst waiting there it became increasingly obvious that something was terribly
 wrong inside the ground.             - r                                 :s'

  jgp^ealised.. the enormity of what was happ ening

  S*Most. of the local policemen were wandering, about unsure of what to do -sThere
    •was little if any evidence of them being given any leadership or direction.
      Perhaps because they had no bosses to give, them instructions, the three
   .. Notts policemen dived straight into action. ..            z1 ' -V"..  ;     ■"

     Sgt Brazener and PC Walton pulled out a number of dead bodies and then started
     bringing out survivors, giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and heart massage
     where they could. PC Walton in: particular, perhaps because of his recent first
     aid course which concentrated on precisely those techniques, was to the fore
     at this stage.. In addition to playing nursemaid to me, PC Hoad was circulating
     among the injured fans, comforting where he could and calming down some of the
     more exciteable ones.      -

     This continued for between 50 minutes to an hour until the last of the injured
     were carried off the park. During that time they also joined a police cordon
     aimed at preventing angry Liverpool fans charging towards the Forest end of the
     ground.

     Afterwards they attended a debrief in the North Stand before eventually leaving
     the ground.

    . Anyone who witnessed the actions o-f the three officers — who stood out in
      their distinctive yellow jackets -'would have beenimmensely proud of them.. I
      know I was and I know that feeling was shared by a    lotof very grateful officers
      of all ranks from the South Yorkshire force..

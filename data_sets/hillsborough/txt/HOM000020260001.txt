   Dear Mr Humphreys

  HTOLSBORODGH INVESTIGATION

   I refer to your letter of 25 August 1989 in which you requested samples of
   barrier 124A and further information about the barriers. In view of the
   impending criminal investigation, I have been instructed to retain the broken
   barrier in its present condition. Samples cannot, therefore, be made available
^^to the parties involved in civil action and I have been asked to refer all such
^Plrequests to Mr Mervyn Jones, Assistant Chief Constable, West Midlands Police.
   I will forward a copy of your letter to Mr Jones.

  With respect to your request for test results and information on any further
  work, I have been advised by Mr R Whalley, Secretary to the Inquiry, that other
  parties should not be given access to test results, nor would it be appropriate
  for them to witness tests at this Laboratory. As far as HSE is concerned, only
  the data on which Lord Justice Taylor based his Interim Report can be made
  available and I believe you have this already.

  Barrier 125 and parts of barrier 129 were removed frcrci Hillsborough by HSE
  staff on 7 July 1989 for possible use in further tests.

  As far as I am aware, HSE does not have any historical information on barrier
  124A.

  Since I cannot provide further help in these matters, I suggest that you submit
  any further requests to Mr Jones or Mr Whalley.

  Yours sincerely




  P F HEYES

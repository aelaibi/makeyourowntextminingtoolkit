B e t w e en      10.30        (1Q3Q)          and     10.45am         ( 1 0 4 5 ),       we    left f r o m S t P e t e r s

Church,           Kirkby,           and     we    d i d n ’t s t o p       until          about          S miles     outside        of

Sheffield,               at a       pub,       but     I can't        remember             the       name    of     the    pub     or a r e a .

We    all        went     into       the       pu b    for a        dri nk.

We    had        travelled           via       the     Pennines           and       even       up    to the       g r o u n d we    did

not    get        into        any    traffic           problems           causing          delays.

The     pub we w e n t              into,        w h i c h was       a very          small          one,    was     also    serving

other        Liverpool              fans.

We    f i n a 11y a r r ived               in S h e f f i e l d at         about          2.30pm          (1430) and        parked

near     a       supermarket              in L e p p i n g s        Ln.      1 think            it's       a Gateway        Store.

We    l ef t      the     coach and              there       were     police             officers          in the       area     but     they

were     not       giving           us a n y      escort        or    direction                to    the    ground        but    having

said     t hat       we       know       the     way    having        been          to    the       1988    semi-final

at    the        s ame    ground.

Between           the     parking           point       and     the       ground          it s e l f ,     I saw     no    disorder,

drunkeness               or    fighting           from,        or    by,     other         f a n s , wh i ch w e r e        virtually

100% L i verpool                fans.

We    a r r i v e d at         the       g r o u n d at £ . 4 0       pm      (1440).

On arrival               at    the       ground,        unlike        last          year,       there       were     no    organised

queues,           there        was       just     a mass        of    people             from Leppings             Ln     into     the

turnstiles.

From     the       junction              of L e p p i n g s     Ln    to     the         ground          leading     to    the

turnstiles,               there          were     a number           of    police          o f f i c e r s on duty,             including

about        6    mounted           police        officers.

I did        not     see a n y           stewards           on d u t y     but       there          were    so m a n y     people        it

was    difficult.

At    th e L e p p i n g s          Ln    point        of    the     ground,             the    mounted        police       were

letting           100 to        150       people        through a            c o r d o n at          a   time,     but     the     number

of    people       trying          to       ge t    to    the     turnstiles           was       so     great       t h at     1 fel t

myself         being       forced           down     to     the       ground      because          the       people       at      the

front       were      pushing           back        and     those       at    th e    back       were        pushing         forward.

By    this       time,       Steven          R O B I N S O N a n d me         had     got       through         the      cordon         but

had    been       separated             framJ

The    following             process           by    the m o u n t e d        o f f i c e r s was        to     close        the

turnstiles            nearby,           there        were        too m a n y      people         in a        confined          space      and

t h e re w a s     no      organised               queues.

At    about       2.55pm          < 14 5 5 ) ,      I went        through a           turnstile              but    I had         been

separated          from       both Stevens                  by    this       time.         On    going        through          the

tunnel         I made        my way          to     one     of    the    outer        pens       to th e       right         of    the

t u n n e 1.

I did       not    see       any     gates          being        open    or     opened          other        than     the      turnstiles

and    neither          did       I see       anyone           entering         the    ground           by a n y      unauthorised

way.

On    going       through          the       turnstile            I    showed my           ticket        to     the      person

operating          the       turnstile              but     he m a d e       no a t t e m p t      to    take       it    f r o m m e,        he

just       got    the      turnstile               o pen.        This    turnstile              w as    one    of     the      first      t h re e

to    the      left     on    facing           the       turnstiles.              I still         have        my    ticket         and

counterfoil,               details           are     ( L L 2 - 1 8 - 5 5 L e p p i ngs          Ln Standing              - Liverpool

Area - 6.00             pounds          -    number         150489 - E n t r a n c e             8).

On going          through          the       turnstiles               there     were       no    signs        telling          you where

to    go    to y o u r       viewing           poin t,         but     there     was       no    difficulty              in f i n d i n g      a

viewing          poin t      because           there        were       hardly any           people           in the a r e a          between

the    turnstiles             and       the        tunnel        leading        to    behind           the    go al s .

I then went             through             the     tunnel        and went           into       pen one        or     two      (right

of    the      tunnel        on    leaving           it)       and     there     was       no    problem           going       through

the    t u n n e 1 at all            just          before        the    kick     o f f , about           £.55pm          (1455).

There       were      no     police          or     stewards           evident        at    this        moment        in time,           and

I did       not    s ee a n y        disorder             or     other       incidents           from        entering          the
                                                                                                                               PAGE
                                                                                                                               S314

ground       to     the      pens.

Neither        did     I see         anyone        drinking        in the        ground.

I made       my way          from     pen     1 or 2 b ac k         in f r o n t      of    the W e s t           S t a n d by the

opening        of    the       t u n n el,    this       would     be a b o u t      3 . 0 5 pm     ( 1 5 0 5 ).

There      was      then a        r oar      from    the     crowd       and a       surge        of     people from               the

tunnel       which        pushed        into       pen 4 d o w n      to F 7 o n        the       grid you             have     shown

me.

At    this     t ime      it w a s     absolute            chaos.        I did       not    see a n y         of       the

barriers          break        and    I don't        think        I was       near    any       t h at    did      break.

I had      taken       up m y        position        orignally           in    pen    1 at a b o u t          2.55pm          (1455).

Having       moved        into       p e n 4,      I did     not    know anyone             around          me     and,

although          it w a s      chaotic,           I d id    not    witness          any    direct          fighting            or

disturbances              to    cause        any    problems        at    that       time.

I was      in the         crowd       surge        and     crush and          this    would        be a b o u t         3.05pm

<1505).

I believe           the      crowd      surge       was     caused       by    the    roar        when Liverpool                   had

had an attack                on the       Notts      Forest        goal.        Everybody wanted                       to    see     what

was    going        on.

When     this       surge       occurred           with     people       panicking          and        I tried          to    c 1 imb

over     the      perimeter           fencing        onto     the     p i t c h.      As    a     result          of    the    climb

over     1 received a                broken        n ose    but    I am       not    sure       how      t hi s    injury          was

susta in e d .

On    getting        onto       the    pitch        I was     crying          in f e a r    and although                    I didn't

see    someone         di e     I s a w a y o u t h,         in hi s      l at e     teens        he w o u l d         be,    l y in g

in t h e     six     yard       box    and      I knew       he w a s     dead.         He w a s         lying         on    his

b ack,     h is     e y es     were    o p e n a n d hi s         face    was       covered        in blo od.

I said       to a P o l i c e         Officer,           "He's     dead,"       but     the P o l i c e           Officer

said,      "No,      he's       not."

I was      taken       by a P o l i c e         Officer       to    the       first     aid       point      so        I did       not

assist       anyone          on the       pitch.

             I did     not      witness              anything         in     particular             that      was       a factor,            it was

             the     confinement                of    so m a n y      people           in a     small       area        which        caused      people

             to     panic      or    pass-out              or    be   carried           or    knocked         to    the       ground         by s u c h a

             volume       of    bodies.               Once       they       fell       they would           have        no    cha n c e .

             I do     not      know       what        time       I left          the    ground,




             I did     no t w i t n e s s            anything         of a        criminal          nature         at    anytime.

             Once     the m a t c h           was     stopped,          on h i n d s i g h t ,       t he     gates          could      have     been

             open     earlier            to a l l o w        people         on    the    pitch,         but    th e P o l c i e         were     not      to

             know what          had       h a p p e n e d , they            thought          it w a s   an     invasion.

             I would        like         to a d d         that    one       of    the    factors         causing             trouble         outside

             th e    ground         is    the        closeness          of       the    turnstiles            to    each        other        which

             caused       the       queues           to    become       a    solid mass.

             There     was      insufficient                    policing          outside        and     inside          the        ground.

             Last     year      there          were        sufficient             police       to    form      queues           outside        and       at

             t he    entrance            to    the        tunnel.           They were          filtering            f ans       either        side       of

             the     tunnel         and       into        the    tunnel.           This       year      there       was       n on e    of    that.

             In fact,          last       year        they       stopped          people       entering            the       tunnel       when      they

             saw     pens      3 and 4 were                  full.

             I received a broken                          n o s e , but      t h at     was    nothing         when          th e    next     day    I

    I enclose a copy of a letter and newspaper cutting I recently
    received frc)m my constituent,
                  supporting the reservations expressed in the newspaper
    article about the enforced requirement for all-seater football
    stadiums.

    I would be grateful for your comments on the points raised by
                    and by Jonathan Foster's article.

Thank you for your letter of 19 February addressed to
Robert Atkins enclosing one from                  about the

PROCEDURE FOR ISSUE OF INTERIM REPLIES TO MINISTERS * CASES



1.   The responsible officer (RO) concludes that it will be
     possible to submit a substantive reply within the usual two
     week deadline.  In all other cases an interim reply should
     be sent as at 2-5 below.

2.   An interim reply is prepared using the standard layout.
     This should give a date for substantive reply, which should
     normally be four weeks from the receipt of the letter in the
     Department, and five weeks if enquiries are being made
     outside. Officers should bear in mind that a week of this
     period must be allowed for processing within Secretariat
     before despatch. Where there is a specific reason for the
     delay (eg a need to consult with an LEA before replying),
     this should be cited.

3.   The RO sends a signature-ready draft by E-Mail to the
     correct Correspondence Section mailbox.

4.   Correspondence Section signs and despatches the letter,
     returning a copy to the Branch.

5.   If it is not possible to issue a substantive reply by that
     date, a further interim should be submitted on the Yellow
     Cover for ministerial signature, giving full reasons for the
     delay.

AN INTERIM REPLY, HOWEVER PROMPTLY IT IS ISSUED, SHOULD NOT BE
SEEN AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR A FULL RESPONSE. THE DEPARTMENT'S
PRINCIPAL AIM IS ALWAYS TO ENSURE THAT CORRESPONDENTS RECEIVE AS
SWIFT A SUBSTANTIVE REPLY TO THEIR LETTERS AS POSSIBLE.

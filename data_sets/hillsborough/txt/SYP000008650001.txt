    I walked around the goal area facing the West Stand and in particular

    the    left side of the goal                 nearer to the South Stand side of the

think was a Live r poo 1 to p , trapped amongst                 the fans,       I grabbed Hold

of his        left arm and tried to pull him out but the                  crowd moved and          I

had to let him go and he just disappeared,                      1 don't know what happened

t o h ifll,

I then saw that the              po 1 i c:e had f ormedyjflT human cha 1 n with officers at

the front        pulling the bodies o utyrfnd passing them along the line

/-onto the pitch,

I was waiting for tf,he poVTce and fans to pull someone out who was                                in

a bad way but not beyCnd saving so that                      I could help them as best             I

could,        but all       I saw was dead bodies who were          purple and obviously

fae y o n d s a v i n g .

Finally        I saw a person who although he was blue seemed to have a

c h a n c e , he was a yhite male,           20 years of age,       m edium b u i 1d , short

prown hair,          wearing     faded blue jeans,        .1. saw that he nad urinated

himself and was              in a very bad way,       1 fe 1t,*'£or a carotid piuJ.se but

.found nothing.              I checked his breathing and again found nothing,                      So

 I began mouth to mouth resuscitation and cardiac                        compressions at

the    rate of 2 15 or what Vs e emedr 1 ik e ages,             finally he began to cough

and vomit and I found a very weak                   pulse,     I placed him in the

 recovery position and             left him with some other fans,             so that 1 could

go and help someone else..                1 think he had a good chance of survival

but    I have no idea whether he relapsed or not.

 I then went back towards              the goal and saw a policeman bent over a

young     person who was aged about               15 to 16 years or so, he w a s n ’t doing

anything and just             looked at the youth,           I said,     *do you know what

y o u ’re d o i n g ? ’     He said,   ’N o ’ .   He only looked about fifteen to me and

was obviously older but d i d n ’t look it,                  I knew then that would have

to do something and 1 put the y o u t h ’s head back to open the airway

        left him with the               po 1 :i.ceman who who was still                     just knelt there besides

        him.I     then moved further along the pitch and saw another                                           policeman

        next     to a fan           who was hyperventilating.                     The fan was aged 17 to IS

        He had severe            injuries to his right side and I believed them to be

        fractured ribs, 8 or so fans came over and we took him on a stretcher

        to the first aid room where we used a paper bag to slow down his

        breathing.

        there was no resistance when pressure was applied to the chest.

        People        had crushed pelvis's and were massively                                injured,        the stated

        number of compressions went up and down according to how you felt the

                        by w h i c h time m a n y            people    in the       terrace were a l r e a d y        in serious

                        trouble.


                        When       I reached the fence,                there were m a n y         unconscious         casualties.           To

                        my     knowledge         the    gate at this          time was       not ope/,           I went a long    the

                        front       of the        fence      trying    to get       the    casualties        heads    back   in order to

                        o p e n their airways.                This    howe v e r    proveyimpossible              due to the fact

                        that       e v e ryone was so t i g h t l y          packed.



                        A    few    people        had now got        out,    so     I   went    back     on the    pitch to see         if I

                        c o u l d help.           I found one        patient       who     had been       pulled out a n d was

                                                                                                                           S769A

              ha v i n g a s t h m a and h y p e r v e n t i l a t i n g .     He was also         suffering        from

              shock.        I spent a few m i n u t e s w i t h him tr y i n g                  to get his     b r eathing

              back to normal.              He was      semi-conscious             so    I placed him        in the

              recovery       position,         c o v e r e d him w i t h my       coat and        left him w i t h a fan.



              I went a r o u n d the         pitch      looking      for      people     to help but        could only

              manage       to find dead         bodies.         Pe o p l e    kept     rushing up to me a s k i n g             for

             me     to do m o u t h to m o u t h       on someone.              I went    only to find their               friends

              dead.



              I went       back    to the gate w h i c h was             now ope n a n d was very t i g h t l y jammed

              with     people - further             p r e v e n t i n g any esc a p e     from     inside.         I spotted a

         Xf~Pyoung        boy of a bout        10 or     11 y ears       old near        to the gate.          I grabbed

              hold     of him by the ar m w i t h             the hope         of gett i n g him out.              The    crowd

               inside m o v e d s l i g h t l y a n d      I lost grip of the                 boys arm,     losing        him w ith

              the    rest    of the       crowd     inside.        The P o l i c e      had     now fo r m e d a human          chain

              a n d were      pulling      people      out.

Sturgeon and P.D. Smithson for a further term of 5 years.

     Mr. Wharton thanked these Trustees for the time they dedicated to
the work of the Trust.

     Mr. S.W. Taylor raised the fact that so many Trustees would be again
due for re-election in the same year which could, possibly, cause
problems at that time.  It was agreed that this matter be looked at again
in the future.

     In his absence the Trustees accepted, with regret, the resignation
of Mr. R.H.G. Kelly.  Mr. Kelly felt unable to continue as a Trustee due
to his new position as Chief Executive of The Football Association.

discussion by the Trustees.

£2,192,754.71 as at 30th November, 1988 subject to unpresented cheques.

Trust's income would be increased as from 1st January, 1989* Mr. Foster
reported that the figures produced were on the cautious side and did not
include interest earned on   the capital. It was further noted that the
grant to Newcastle United had, in fact, now been paid in full.

     Mr. Foster indicated that there would be an amount of approximately
£300,000 out of taxed income available for distribution in grant aid.

     After discussion it was decided to invest £1 million on longer term
investments with Barclays Bank.

     A list of accounts paid since the last meeting was received and
noted.


878    MESSRS. POMFRET RUSHTON

     The Trustees were informed that Mr. C. Foster had formed a new
partnership with three of his existing partners from the firm of Pomfret
Rushton. The new partnership would be called "Rushtons".

     It was agreed that the Secretary write to The Football League
Management Committee indicating that the Trust wished to retain the
services of Mr. Foster and would, therefore, recommend that the Trust
move their accounts to Messrs. Rushtons.


879    SAFETY

     Mr. W.H. Carter reported that Safety Claims were running smoothly
and there was unlikely to be a sudden outflow of funds.

     A list of safety grants made since the last meeting was received and
noted.

      A discussion took place on the increasing number of cases where it




                                   -   2   -
was difficult to draw a line between safety work and normal maintenance
or "good housekeeping" work.

     Mr. Foster confirmed that the Inland Revenue were very stringent on
this point and insisted that the Trust's funds must not be disbursed for
items of a maintenance nature particularly electrical work.

     The Trustees were of the unanimous opinion that the Trust's policy
of not grant aiding items of maintenance work should be strictly
enforced. Only safety work which was a necessary requirement of a club's
Safety Certificate was eligible for grant aid.

     Mr. W.H. Carter indicated that he would re-circulate these
instructions to the local offices of Corderoy & Co., to emphasise the
point with his staff.


880    IMPROVEMENTS

     A list of improvement grants made since the last meeting was

     It was decided that the letter of offer to clubs should be very
specific. The letter would state

a)    that grant aid was offered at 10 % of approved expenditure up to a
      maximum figure;

b)    competitive tenders had to be obtained and approved by Corderoys
      before work commences;

c)    work started before approval was given would not be grant aided;

d)    letters would be specific as to whether professional fees were
       included or not;

e)    work could commence after 1st January, 1989.


881   POLICY

     The Trustees felt that the improvement areas now being grant aided
had proved very successful and should be maintained. The decision to
increase the allocation for 1989 was seen to be recognition that the 1989
initiatives were correct.

     It was further decided to increase the Safety Ceiling from £700,000
gross to £800,000 gross in order to maintain parity with inflation. This
increase would be effective from 1st January, 1989 but would not be
retrospective.




                                   -   4   -
     Mr. P.C. Dodds raised the question of the Trust being asked to
contribute towards a National Membership Scheme which could alter the
Trust's financial position drastically.

     It was agreed that a National Membership Scheme was   an Anti-
Hooliganism measure and as such came within the scope of   The Football
Trust and not F.G.I.T.  It was recognised, however, that   F.G.I.T. may be
asked to contribute towards additional turnstiles. This    would have to be
examined if, and when, it arises.

resolved with the Trust being repaid in full plus interest.

      The Trustees thanked the Chairman for his diligence in this matter.


883    GILLINGHAM FOOTBALL CLUB

     It was decided to refuse an appeal made by Gillingham Football Club
in respect of the club's Proposal No. 5 which had been rejected due to
non-compliance with procedures.

     This was not the first time the club had disregarded procedures and
it was felt that the club might benefit from a visit by the local
Trustees.


884   TRANMERE ROVERS FOOTBALL CLUB

     At the request of the Secretary this item was withdrawn from the

885   MIDDLESBROUGH FOOTBALL CLUB

     The meeting received and noted correspondence with Middlesbrough
Football Club with regard to the opening of the Sports Complex.

Football Trust meeting the previous day.


     It was decided to contact the Sports Council to ascertain what
action, if any, they, intended to take in respect of their own
contribution to the complex.   It was felt that F.G.I.T. should align
itself with any action to be taken by the Sports Council.

     It was decided that no further payments would be made to
Middlesbrough until such time as this matter had been resolved.

      It was also decided that the improvement application approved under




                                    -   5   -

made in conjunction with the Trust's financial position.

           about 20 m in ut es          to walk     to the ground.

           these      queues       soon became      untidy as there              seemed to be           poL *< fe on the

 where     she was and so            I tried to shout             to her       but    I couldn't.

 The     crush      continued and          I tried to take            short     breaths          this    became

 d ifficult as         1      could feel pressure             from the sides.

 I con ti nu ed to           take    short breaths and              1 was still       pushed up against

 the     fence where          I— j ^ uld feel _bodies            under my feet            Id o n ’t, know      how they

 not even my head or arms.

 E5y now some         ofthe    fans who       had m a n a g e d to get         onto    the         p i t ch were

 climbing        up the fence and             were       knocking the spikes              down     on the      fence

 so that        people     could get out           of the      pen.

As      people climbed up the              fence my view was            obstructed               by their legs

 and     it was at         this   point     that my head all                 light and       I went      hot and

 passed out.

 The     next    thing     1 remember        is waking         up still        at    the front          of the

 terrace and          lying on top of a pile of                   bodies.

                                                I was       dead or not         so she       had my       head     in her

 hand keeping          it from falling             down     into the         pile    of   bodies,       with     her

 other     hand she was           holding     onto the         fence.

 I told the girl            to get     of* me and some            lads about          17-18 tried to             pull

me a way but my leg was                stuck       u n d e r n e a t h the    bodies      so they then

 managed        to get my feet         free an d         carry me       out    to the      back of the

 terrace,        by this      time    it was       empty.

 The     lads    stood me      up but       I fell       over.

 I could hear          people       telling me to stay awake a n d breathe                          deep    but     I

 couldn't        breathe      due    to the    pains        in my     chest.

 I then     noticed                  standing w it h me and dead bodies                       on the

 terraces,          there were       some at       the    front     near      the fence,          and    there were

 some about          1/2 wa y up the         terrace.            Some    of them at the             front      se em ed

           st ar t ed to help some             people      out     towards       the   tunnel      but    some      lads     took

           disbelief.

           Just    then               s u g g e s t e d that we        ring home       so we    started         to walk

           towards       the tunnel         but some       lads told us not             go thro ug h the            tunnel       as

           we w o u ld be upset at what we w o ul d see.

           E ve n so we w a l k ed        t h ro ug h the     tunnel       and as we       came out        of    it      I saw

           dead bodies           on the gr ou nd w ith a line of                  police     by them and            people

           sitting and           lying    on the     ground,          who were     alive     but    injured.             Some

           were    in shock and some were                  crying saying           things      like,      " I ’ve     lost my

           b r o t h e r ’ and have you seen such and s u c h ’ .

           A p o li c ew o ma n a sked us         if we were alright we said yes and a sk ed the

           p ol ic em an w i th her where            there was a telephone.

           He    showed     us but       there was a queue              right     down the      road so we went

           into s omeones          house and a s k e d them             if we     could use        their    phone         they

           said we       could and we          rung home.

           After we       had used the           telep ho ne s we made            our wa y back          to the       coach

           and just w a i t e d their            until     everyone        come    back,     it was about             6.30pm

           (1830)       w h e n e veryone      from ourt coach had               r et urned and then we               came      home

           That    is about        it but      I would       like to add that            I feel      that       the      police

           could have           done more      to h e L ^ t h e       injured and dying            but they didn't               it

           s ee me d to be all           fans a s s i s t i n g    in this       respect,,

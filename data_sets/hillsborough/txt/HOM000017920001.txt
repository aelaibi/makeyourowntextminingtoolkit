 Dear Sir,

 Although I appreciate that there is considerable pressure for an early report and
 recommendations from your inquiry, I do hope that you will give favourable
 consideration to the possibility of further safety research.

 In Lord Wheatley's earlier inquiry, research was done on movement through exit
 systems, but not on other aspects of crowd behaviour. I hope you will not mind
 me enclosing a brief proposal for new research into safe crowd behaviour. I am
 sure that such research would yield some important improvements to current
 guidelines for the design of football stadia.

 Yours faithfully,




 BARRY POYNER

Safe Crowd Behaviour
 in Football Grounds


      Proposal for new research




                May, 1989

           LONDON NW3 5BA
Earlier research on crowd safety
Until Lord Wheatley's Inquiry following the crowd disaster at Ibrox Park In 1971, there
had been no research Into crowd safety In football grounds. In developing a system of
licensing sports grounds Lord Wheatley decided th at guidelines were required for
determining safe conditions, and a Technical Support Group was formed to make
recommendations. These recommendations were included in Appendix A of the
Wheatley report and were subsequently developed into the Green Guide (Guide to
Safety a t Sports Grounds).
As the Technical Report states: "This report recommends guidelines which are based on
the latest knowledge available, taking Into account research carried out to date and
common usage which h as so far proved safe”. Some detailed specifications for stairs
and handrails etc were based on current building practice and some tests were carried
out on the loading of crush barriers. The only research to be carried out on safe crowd
behaviour was by a research team at SCICON Ltd for which Barry Poyner was the
project leader, responsible for the design of the work and the writing of the report.

The team was asked to develop a method of assessm ent to ensure the design of the exit
system was safe. Careful observations including flow counts and photographic records          a
were made of crowds leaving at the end of m atches under a wide variety of conditions
and at many grounds. The result was the development of the ”7 m inute rule’1. This
rose from the finding that when crowds took longer than about 7 m inutes to empty at
the end of a match, the crowd tended to behave badly - impatiently trying to push its
way out. The crowd would behave badly throughout the period of peak flow once this 7
m inutes limit was exceeded. Pressure would build up within the crowd so th at
Individuals could no longer control their own movement. Under such conditions
people were observed emerging from exits backwards and it was not uncommon to hear
women screaming when they found it difficult to keep their feet at the top of staircases.

When the exit system s had sufficient capacity for the ground to empty In less th an 7
m inutes, crowds behaved quite differently. No pushing occurred and the crowd moved
out through the exit system smoothly with individuals completely in control of their
own movement. In this way the researchers felt able to define a safe exit system which
also reduced the risk of boisterous or hooligan behaviour. This 7 m inute rule was
introduced into the guidelines (see paragraph 56 of the current edition) and seems to
have functioned satisfactorily - no more serious accidents in exits.


The need for new research
Unfortunately no resources were made available a t th at time for research on the control
of crowd behaviour in entry systems or on terraces, primarily because the Ibrox
disaster related to exit behaviour. However, it is clear from the tragedy of Hillsborough
and the earlier disaster at Bolton in 1946 th at excessive pressures can build up a t the
beginning of a m atch on the terraces which are ju s t as serious as those we observed in
exit systems. To date no methodical research has been done on how to control local
densities and pressure from crowd movement. The use of crush barriers is not in itself
a solution. As was stated In the original SCICON report: "Strengthening parts of stadia
to resist collapse can go some way to reducing the m ost serious accidents b ut it fails to
attack the source of the problems - crowd pressure. A more complete solution m ust
involve modifying the form of stadia so th at crowd pressure does not reach dangerous
levels".
Although not specifically referenced in either the Wheatley report or Green Guide, the
study of crowd behaviour in exits was a particularly significant piece of


                                             2
behaviour/environm ent research. Indeed it has often been acknowledged by safety
researchers in other countries such as Canada and Australia.                Now th at the
Hillsborough disaster has led to another inquiry, the time is right to initiate new
research on the control of movement and pressure on terraces and in the entry or
ingress systems. It is also believed th at safely designed facilities a t football grounds
could be largely self-regulating, minimising the need for policing and stewarding.
There is reason to believe th at hooliganism is in part encouraged by the problem of
crowding and crowd instability which seems almost unique to football crowds.

Since working on the original research for Lord Wheatley’s Inquiry, Barry Pqyner has
moved to the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations, where he directs the only unit in
Britain devoted to behaviour and environment research. The unit has extensive
experience of research Into safety, crime and violence, and is used to working with the
police. The Institute would like to can y out new research on crowd behaviour in sports
grounds, and would be happy to prepare costed proposals for any body (or bodies)
interested in funding such work. The exact term s of reference will need to be
discussed. The study will need to look at crowd movement into the ground, the control
of movement within the ground, behaviour on the terraces and safety aspects of all­
seated areas. The Institute is certain th at it will be possible to identify better methods
of managing crowds and controlling movement and pressure, and to propose well
researched improvements to the Green Guide.

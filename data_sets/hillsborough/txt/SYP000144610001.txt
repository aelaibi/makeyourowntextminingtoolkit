      21st April, 1989.

      Dear Sir,

      Re: Hillsborough Disaster


      The enclosed letter for Lord Justice Taylor was received by me on
      the 19th instant together with a covering letter which I also enclose.
      I have not acknowledged them as I prefer to leave it to the Judge
      to deal with the letter as he considers fit.

      Yours faithfully,




jj.   Silve

    Dear Lord Justice Taylor,

    Rt.       Hillsborough Disaster

    I write to offer my services to your enquiry into the terrible tragedy which
    occured last^Saturday.   ~

    r alone with mv Son was sat in the^Sfluth-^tand in the very end seat adjacent to
    thTTifpTnTs Line    Terrace. I W    t T a d d ^ n at both ends of the outside ofthe
    Stadium before the game.

    I know I can make   a valuable contribution not only in terms of the disaster but
    also in the hours   before the game. I also feel I can make a contribution
    regarding the future actions.

    I have followed soccer both sitting and standing for many years at grounds all
    over the Country and have watched Liverpool, in particular, at various venues
    over the last few years.

    My qualifications apart from being an eye witness, are as follows:

    I am a Health and Safety Advisor of many years experience specialising in
    Accident Prevention, Occident Investigation and the Management of S a f e t y . I am
    a Member of the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health and hold the
    Diploma in Safety Management.

    I serve on two major Committees of the Royal Society for the Prevention of
    Accidents as          of the National Occupational Health and Safety Groups
    Advisory Council and a member of the National Occupational Health and Safety
     Committee.

     I feel it important particularly with the Events and Statements of the last few
     days that people with my qualifications and experience are needed if the
     enquiries are to be effective in putting forward a responsible and effective
     plan to avoid Saturday’s situation happening again and also to address many
     other contributory factors and problems in the game, its organisation and
     control.

     If you think I can be of help, please get in touch with me.

     Yours sincerely,
     ,          *________

Hillsborough    Enquiry
c/o The Home    Office
Queen Anne 1s   Gate

SW1H 9AT


20th April 1989


jear Sir
I am writing to you in your capacity as the person responsible
for the Hillsborough enquiry.  I was at the the game on Saturday
15/4/89 and in my opinion in an ideal position to comment on the
happenings, before, during and after the incident.

I am a Financial Projects Manager for the
                         I am forty years of age, married with
two children,       aged 17 and    ~Taged 16. We are all season
ticket holders at Anfield and very keen supporters.  I have never
been involved in any trouble with the police and consider myself
to be an honest and responsible member of society.  I have heard
and seen a number of reports since the incident and although I
have never written a letter like this before I felt it essential
for the ordinary supporter to make their point.

We arrived at Sheffield at Approximately 1.00pm by car after
travelling from Nottingham, where I left my wife with her sister.
Due to extremely heavy traffic, we did not arrive outside the
Leppings Lane end entrance B until 2.25pm.  There I found a large
crowd milling around outside the six turnstiles.  There were four
mounted policemen and two or three policemen on foot.   For the
next twenty minutes we were pushed and knocked backwards and
forwards and to the left and right without making any progress
towards the turnstiles.  There appeared to be a total lack of
organisation and the police were unable to control the crowd or
ensure safe, easy entry to the ground mainly due to the lack of
a queuing system.  At approximately 2.45pm a policeman literally
dragged my daughter away from me.  I protested^but was reassured
by the policeman that "it was OK and to come with him".   This we
did and entered the ground via the large exit gate which was wide
open.  We were not asked for our tickets.  Once we had entered
the ground there were no stewards or police to be seen.   Almost
directly in front of me 1 saw an entrance to a tunnel and
followed the crowd through that tunnel to the terrace.
C o n t/.

The tunnel was very crowded and you could only really shuffle
through.   There was no running or pushing or general bad
behaviour.   When we arrived at the other end of the tunnel we
came out of the dark into the bright sunlight and I immediately
realised that we were directly behind the goal and within twenty
yards of the pitch.   I couldn't believe it and attempted to push
my way to the left to get away from the goal and the incoming
crowd.   The terrace was already extremely packed and it was
impossible to move easily.   Within minutes the crush was
unbearable and I knew we could be in trouble.   Within feet of me
one man was trapped against a barrier and had begun to scream for
help, we tried to push back but it was impossible.   I knew I had
to keep my daughter away from the barrier and the crush just
 -eemed to get worse.  There was another surge and we were thrown
cowards the barrier.   I managed to push my daughter away but I
hit the barrier.   Luckily I was again pushed to the left and
escaped with my life.   I felt a soft feeling under my feet and
knew it was not a concrete step.   We tried to push back and
realised it was a man on the floor.   After two or three attempts
we got him on to his feet and he was safe.   My daughter is not
that tall and kept disappearing as taller men were crushed
together.   She did however keep on her feet although she did find
it difficult to breath and almost fainted on a couple of
occasions.   By this time my son had disappeared but I was unable
to cope with my son and daughters safety, so I was unaware that
he had gone.   I found out later that on one surge he had got his
foot on the barrier and was propelled by the crowd over the heads
of the people in front and eventually passed over the perimeter
fence.   Even with my experience of being in large football crowds
over the past twenty five years I was terrified and unable to
control my own body or protect my daughter as the crush was just
too great.

As the crush died down, the true horror unfolded.   I saw fans and
police pulling at the fence until it was broken and forced open so
that the poor people at the front could be pulled out.    My son
was missing and although I did spot him unhurt behind the goal
after a few minutes, it seemed like hours.   A few minutes later
we attracted his attention and when he knew we were safe he
immediately broke down and cried with relief but I could not get
to him.   He was then involved in helping and assisting others
more unfortunate than himself.   I then went down onto the p i t c h _
via the hole in the damaged fence to contact my son and bring him
back to the terrace.   I had to pick my way through bodies and
injured fans with their distraught friends and relations kneeling
over them.   I saw fans and police trying to revive people by
either thumping chests or the kiss of life but most cases were
hopeless.   There was again a total lack of organisation.
Individual policemen were trying to help but it was too late and
there did not appear to be any direction from senior officers.

In conclusion I should like to make the following points.
C o n t/.

1)     The kick   off should have been delayed.

2)     The police outside the ground should have ensured orderly-
       queuing.

3)     The exit   gate should not have been opened.

4)     Once the decision had been taken to open the gate.   Police
        or stewards should have been on hand to direct fans away
        from the central tunnel.

5)      The side and front fences should have been capable of opening
        quickly to relieve pressure.

o)     With all the new technology around grounds ie cameras and
        radio, good communication and organisation could have
       prevented this tragedy.

7)     Once the decision had been taken to open the gate one
        policeman at the entrance to the tunnel could have saved 95
        lives by redirecting fans.

Although all these points are made with hindsight they should
have been part of standard contingency plans for a well organised
major event like this.

This is obviously an emotional but brief account of events in my
own words and should you require any additional information or
attendance for questioning or interview then I would of course be
willing to help.

Yours faithfully
nth A p r il, 1989.

                                                     Sunday 16th April




Dear Sir,

         I am writing today, Sunday 16th April, whilst events  are
fresh in my memory, to give an account which may b6 of use to you in
any enquiry or investigation, concerning the events X witnessed before
and during the tragedy at Hillsborough on 15th April.

        My first thoughts on arrival at the Leppings Lane end at 2.16
-2.17pm was that surprisingly the queue at turnstiles was larger than
expected but like most supporters I am used the hassle of queuing at
away venues. I began queuing at the very right of turnstiles marked B,
for entry into the uncovered standing section.

        The rear of the queue was approximatly at the position of the
outer gates. There was a large number of supporters ( I couldn't say
how many) at the periphery of these main gates standing talking, some
asking for tickets, waiting for friends etc.I was asked on two
occasions if I had spare tickets.

        The queue was moving very slowly and was soon building up
behind me by increasing number of supporters. Two of the policemen on
horseback closest to me, a grey to my left and a chestnut brown to my
right, were controlling the flow of supporters close to the
turnstiles. At this point the situation seemed normal.

           The following events took place between approximately 2.25 and
2.55 Pm.

        A crush at the front of the queue began to develop as more
supporters from the back pushed forward. The brown police horse
entered the queue in front of me to stem the flow and ease the
pressure on the turnstiles. A tense atmosphere began to develop as
supporters built up fustration believing they would be late entering
the ground.

             The rate of entry   via the turnstiles was insufficient to cope
with the number of ticket        holders arriving at the queue. Queuing
became uncomfortable so I        left with some of my brothers friends, who
by chance       I had iust met   in the queue, to stand a few yards at the
side, out of harms way. (        approximatly 15 feet from the sliding
d o o r s ).


                                       PAGE 1
        We noticed that the police were finding it more difficult to
control the queue. The sliding gate ( I think it was blue-green in
colour) was the focus of attention, since an officer on this gate was
letting in a few, but only very young ticket holders a little at a
time. Beyond this gate at side of ground was a policeman and some
officals, manning a temporary barrier arranged I think to let stand
ticket holders only through. I saw for example Emlyn Hughes go past
towards this barrier.


      At some time during the confusion, loudspeakers announced that
supporters should be patient and that there was plenty of room in the
Leppings End. I commented to my friends that because of the situation
t y should consider postponing the kick-off for half an hour so we
could all gain entry to the ground.

      When the folding gate was temporarily opened by a police officer
to let someone in or out, it was rushed by a few dozen opportunist
supporters, but the flow was quickly stemmed and gate returned to its
original position without damage.

      The police on horseback responded immediately and moved us back,
but by this time more people had arrived in front of the turnstiles
and the way was blocked so we stood close to the fence bordering the
river and were directly opposite the now closed gate.

      The situation was getting out of control as supporters levied
abuse at police who were trying there best to control the queue. X
spoke to an officer who walked quickly passed me and suggested the
outer perimeter gates ought to be closed to ease the pressure on
people being crushed at the front of the queue.

      A young male was struck by a policeman. A opened beer can with
contents was thrown into the queue. The fustration was being felt by
both police and queuing supporters. Supporters were climbing over the
wall to enter ground.

        Police officers on horseback who were trying desperately to
control the situation eventually closed these gates and formed a
barrier. This outer perimeter gate was soon breached and more
supporters flowed in towards the turnstiles. It is my considered
opinion that at this point the pressure on the police became intense
because the situation had got completely out of control. Supporters
were being crushed and police were being implored to remedy the
situation. The folding gates were opened in front of us at about
2. 50 -2.55pm and the sense of relief came upon everyone as we walked
through the gates.

      Hundreds of supporters walked, some ran quickly through the
gates and were not stopped by police or officials.

      X lost contact with my friends as  I went to the toilet.   They,
as I was later told went down the tunnel towards the central


                                PAGE 2
enclosure.   I noticed that the entrance to the West stand was manned by
officials and a temporary barrier was placed across. There was no
official at the tunnel entrance and nobody would have expected
anything otherwise.

      I walked down the central tunnel entrance towards the enclosure
behind the goal. There was singing by supporters as they walked,
Jubilant  that they had entered the ground and drawn by a glimpse of
the players warming up on the pitch before kick—off* unaware as myself
that there were entrances via the wings to less crowded areas.

      When I got to the end of the tunnel keeping to the right, I came
to the main body of supporters at the rear of the enclosure. It did
not seem at first that there was any problem, but after squeezing in
s   then being swept in by a wave of more supporters I soon realised
that I was   in danger. The pushing and overcrowding was very severe as
supporters   jostled to get in position to watch the match, but the
crush was not like anything I had experienced in 26 years of attending
football matches.

 In retrospect now I realised during the short time I was in the
enclosure, there was none of the usual prematch chanting, prevalant
behind the goal area. I began to force my way back through the crowd
towards the tunnel entrance, having first met a barrier that prevented
me from being carried down      further by the force of more supporters
entering through the tunnel. I shouted " get back there isnt room". It
took me t l - 5 minutes to push back up against the seething tide of
supporters to a concrete wall at the side of the entrance, where I
managed to escape as flow subsided.

      I noticed in the crowd a small boy crying and firmly held by a
disbelieving father. I appeared to be the only one trying to get out
of tunnel at the time I left the enclosure. During this frantic time
the match must have started but I hadn't noticed. Futhermore there
were only a few supporters walking down the tunnel towards the
enclosure and only a handful crossing the opened gates. I thought
everyone has got in.

      I walked to the side enclosure (North Stand side) where there
was plenty of room. Very few supporters Joined me there, so most had
gone to the central enclosure. From there I watched the tragedy that
followed.

      I have now learned that one of my brothers friends who entered
the ground with me died in the central enclosure. His three friends
suffered minor injuries.

      There are a large number of questions to be answered but I
consider that the main ones from my own perspective and experiences
of the events.


1. Was the number of turnstiles sufficient to cope with ticket holders
arriving in large numbers after 2.15 pm, to an already large queue at


                                 PAGE 3
the Lepping Lane end ?


2. Did police initially search supporters before they passed through
the turnstiles and cause a build up in the queue?

3. How many police were allocated to control the queue and was this
sufficient ?

4. why w e r e n ’t communications ( radio) in view of the serious crowd
problem, used by police in command in the turnstiles area to:

a) postpone kick-off time so all ticket holders could enter ground
slowly through turnstiles.


and

b) bring in reinforcements to control crowd ?

5. Why weren't the supporters queueing, told or informed of the
seriousness of crush situation at the turnstiles,the decisions made
to remedy the situation, and given reassurance and advice. ( I believe
police are supplied with loudspeakers for crowd control).


6. Why w a s n ’t the loudspeaker communication system inside the ground
not used to proper effect?

The Rt. Hon. Douglas Hurd   Esq MP                       j, 18 April 1989

House of Commons
Westminster
LONDON




Dea" Mr Hurd                                               ..

Unlike many of those who died at Hillsborough, I have been fortunate to watch football

for the past 45 years or so, and feel it my duty to write this letter giving you my

views of what happened at the Semi-Final.




I had been to last year's Match, and having then witnessed the crushing outside the

Ground at Leppings Lane, arrived earlier this year at 2.15p.m.     We had no problem in

getting in, but I was surprised to find the Police presence in the immediate vicinity

of the Turnstiles sparse in relation to 1988.




We took our seats at 2.30p.m. directly above    the Leppings Lane Goal, and therefore,

had an uninterrupted view of the unfortunate    events which followed.   My immediate

reaction half-an-hour before the kick-off was of the grossly over-packed centre section

of the Leppings Lane terracing.   In complete contrast, the wing sections had huge

unpopulated gaps which over the next twenty minutes or so, slowly began to fill up.

The situation in the centre section however, got steadily worse, and fifteen minutes

before kick-off time, waves of supporters were being pushed down the terracing.         Not

once during the half-hour before the kick-off was there an announcement over the

loudspeaker to ask spectators not to push or    to keep away from the centre section.         No

attempt appeared to have been made by Police    or Stewards in front of this section to

get people out and transfer them to the sparsely populated wing sections.      I contrasted

this to the situation at Anfield just over a fortnight ago when at the Evening Match
 against Derby County,   late arrivals caused a crush in the lower section of the 'Kop'.

 Immediately this happened, the Police and Stewards   were on hand to shepherd people away

 and announcements were regularly made over the Public Address System for spectators

 to move away from the section under pressure.




 In the period leading   up to the kick-off, more and more people appeared to be coming

into the centre section which, as mentioned before, was grossly over-populated half an

hour before the Match was due to begin.




I understand that a Gate at the Leppings Lane End was opened to let spectators in

following the dreadful crush outside.     This therefore, had the effect of compounding

what was already an appalling situation.




I have seen the Sheffield Wednesday Secretary on television referring to his computer

telling him that the Leppings Lane End was under capacity.    How can anyone, possibly

rely on a computer print-out in such circumstances?    The only way to marshal the crowds

was to get outside and observe, and it was obvious to anyone with even the slightest

wit, that marshalling of the spectators was sadly lacking.




If, as reported, the Police allowed the Gate to be opened, why weren't the spectators

directed to the wing sections?   Some of the Police appeared to have walkie-talkies.

Did they not co-ordinate their actions with their colleagues inside the ground who were

observing the mayhem in the half-hour leading up to kick-off time?    Surely, Fans should

have been prevented from entering the central section by a line of Policemen,,   or Stewards

being deployed across the tunnel entrance.




I would now like to comment on the Leppings Lane End of the ground.    Whilst, this is

normally adequate for League games, when Home Supporters can gain access to the North

Stand from the Pennistone Road end also, I would suggest that for a Semi-Final where one

of the Team's Supporters takes the North Stand, and the Leppings Lane accommodation, the

arrangement is totally unsatisfactory.    The approach leading to this section of the ground
«




        is on the bend of a road, extremely narrow, and   it is like asking all the Main Stand

    and 'Kop' Supporters at Anfield to make their way through the Shankley Gates and then

    to be faced by a brick wall across the main Car Park.




    I would now like to turn to another section of the ground, which on normal match days,

    because of access from both ends of the ground, is perfectly acceptable, but which on

    Semi-Final days gives many Spectators extreme cause for concern.      This is the landing

    behind the North Stand.     Last year, I was at the 'Kop' end of this Stand, and after the

    match, made my way with my son and nephew out of the ground using this landing.       It

    was        of the most frightening experiences of my life, and there were times when I felt

    that I was being carried by the crowd without my feet touching the ground.      There were

    many Spectators who showed how terrified they were.      This year, I had decided that I

    would make my way out of the Stand at ground level, come what may, but after watching

    the dreadful scenes for thirty minutes, and knowing full well that I was unable to

    help, we left the ground in complete safety, but in utter dismay and quickly reunited

    with my son who, in that dreadful central section, had been one of the lucky ones.




    In addition to following Liverpool Football Club for the past 16 years, I lived in

    Sheffield for 3% years, during which time, I regularly visited both the Brammall Lane

    and Hillsborough Grounds.     I feel therefore, that I am able to contribute with a

    knowledge of both Anfield and Hillsborough, and conclude by expressing my utter

    amazement at the apparent lack of satisfactory marshalling in the Leppings Lane area

    inside and outside the ground.

 My Lord,

 The Hillsborough Disaster


 I am one of those fortunate and bewildered people who now share a survivor
 guilt complex.  I have felt a genuine need to put in writing my personal
 observations following the Hillsborough disaster, although I have deliberately
 delayed doing so in order to gather my thoughts and put forward an objective,
 factual report of the events leading to, and during, the catastrophe.  I
 must state that my feelings are still a mixture of deep sorrow and bitterness.

 I will not comment upon the choice of venue, the allocation of tickets,
 or the condition of the stadium as there will be numerous accounts on these
 points — the conclusion being painfully obvious!  Instead I want to explain
 the events of the disaster as I and thousands of people saw them, mindful
 of many people's opinions that their voice will neither be heard nor
 considered.

 First of all I would mention that I am 27 Y.ears of age, have a wife and
 a 4 year old son, and am employed by a very reputable Liverpool professional
 firm. I am reasonably well educateii, having sat the final part of my
 professional qualifications on 14th April 1989, and I have never been
 convicted for so much as exceeding the speed limit. However, none of this
 makes me any different from the other supporters as I and my colleagues
 have a drink before each game, and basically go out with high spirits to
 enjoy ourselves.  I actually drove to Sheffield and then drank two lagers
 before the game (purchased from an off-licence which closed at 2.00 p.m.),
 but none of the above makes me a thug or a drunken hooligan.

 Now that the character reference is over, I wish to describe the change
 in my nature when I tried to get into the giWHlid a'IT*l^p^roximately^2^3^^ ^ m ^ ^
 ^   ^   a   r   r   i   v   e   c   T   ^   ^   q   u   e   u   e    ^   o   ^    t   °
 stop people from joining the build-up of people at the few turnstiles
 available, and two police horses walking into the crowd and causing panic.
 The attitude of the mounted policemen was absolutely disgraceful, with one
 of them basically acting like a crazed person.  I then found myself being
 knocked about by a horse, which led to my shouting at the police when they
 totally ignored requests from everybody else to sort out the situation.

 Eventually the exit gate was opened at approximately 2.40 / 2.45 p.m.,
 resulting in a rush of people wanting to escape the pressure. Unfortunately
 I, and one of my friends, was in the first group through the gates and ended
 up being hnndi<=»d to the floor, along with approximately twenty other people.
 Having frantically picked ourselves up, in fear of the crowd behind, we
 saw the gates closed with only about fifty people inside (I cannot be
 definite about these figures). The police inside the gates had already
 seen evidence of falling bodies on the first opening — luckily without
 injuries!


                                                                      /Continued
  Page 2.



  I then walked round the ground and entered the terracing by the corner flag,
  due to my experience of last year's game. Last year. I entered the ground
  at approximately 2.00 p.m., went straight through the tunnel behind the
  goal, then came straight out again to go to the corner, as it was completely
  full behind the goal at that time.

  As the game started there was a feeling of unease in the centre of the
  terracing, which as you know turned to screams and angry shouting and which
  was, as you will be aware, initially ignored by the police - even to the
  extent of making spectators re-enter the terracing after they had escaped
  over the fences. At that time I was not aware of the gates being opened,
  for the second time and after seeing the results of the first opening.   I
  must say that the police must have seen the same pictures to which we were
  all subjected by the Daily Mirror, and consequently I can only assume that
  the cries and shouts were completely ignored!

    As the horror of Hillsborough began to unfold before us there was an immense
    feeling of anger about the lack of attention given by the police as spectators
    tried to revive friends, or complete strangers. The human barrier formed
    across the pitch was of no use whatsoever, unnecessary, a complete waste
ia=~nf m uMpMweTr,r aitd' pruliablv taaatifl UUOii Lhe premise that hoolIsttuleJid w a g n t^
    *>«^yarair'gir~the/problem. l am no~f~sayTng that every~poITce"officer was
    useless, or unmoved, as they obviously did what they could in the circumstances,
    but there was no apparent lead from the top, no organisation, there were
    no facilities of any note, no contingency plans - nothing!

  The events seemed to last about an hour, during which time the media displayed
  their true colours in filming, or photographing, as much detail as they
  could. Why on earth couldn't they have acted as normal human beings, put
  down their cameras and. helped? Perhaps people in positions such as yours
  can make this sort of vile conduct the subject of criminal law!  It is also
  worth bearing in mind that those spectators who hit out at the media, or
  the police, were confused, upset and angry, and in the circumstances could
  be said to be justified. This behaviour by a minority of people was
  an act of inherent hooliganism, but one of pure frustration and anger.

  During the hour or so, the public address system was, first of all, used
  to instruct everybody to retain their tickets for a replay, and, secondly,
  to call for people in the crowd with medical knowledge.  However, it could
  hardly be heard, either due to the inadequacy of the system, or the frailty
  of the operator. The only audible message came from Mr. Dalgleish, whose
  words you will be familiar with.

  Before I draw my conclusions, I wish to bring home to you the feelings of
  people on Merseyside concerning this disaster. Before and during the tragedy
  there was genuine and, I feel, justifiable anger which slowly turned to
  sorrow and disbelief as the 15th April gradually expired. On 16th and 17th
  April Merseyside was devastated. On 18th April the disgusting remarks of
  the South Yorkshire Police Federation turned the tide towards anger once
  again, and frankly I believe this feeling will exist for some time. The
  sorrow will never disappear.




                                                                 /Continued
Page 3.



To conclude, I have to say that careless neglect of the planning before
the game should be looked at, the overall lack of reaction, facilities and
liaison on the field appeared to be nothing short of gross negligence, and,
finally, the remarks of the South Yorkshire Police Federation can only be
regarded as criminal!

I acknowledge that the behaviour of some supporters outside the ground may
have been difficult, but please remember the reasons explained above.   I
did not see one act of violence or hooliganism, and saw only a handful of
people drunk. At the end of the day with a crowd of 50*000 people the
police should have learned to expect problems given today’s society. Why
could they not learn from decades of enormous crowds at Anfield or Goodison.
My friends and I always arrive at the Kop late, after having a drink beforehand
(sometimes for about two hours), and accept that we must queue up (even
with Season Tickets), but there is never a problem, and if anybody misbehaves
in the queue he is simply sent to the back!

Finally, turning again to last year’s match, Sheffield police actually
checked tickets before admitting people into the area in front of the
turnstiles. Also, there were stewards and police directing the flow once
inside the ground. The comments of Mr. Peter Wright of the South Yorkshire
Police Federation that there were no "significant alterations" from the
operation last year are not correct (London Evening Standard ■ 21/4/89,
page 2).

You may consider this letter to be bitter, biased and ill-conceived, but
I can assure you it has been carefully thought out after some soul-searching.
It is not a catalogue of bitter accusations - it is fact! A photocopy of
my unused ticket is enclosed.

I and thousands of others do not want the South Yorkshire Police to be
allowed to indulge in any cover-up!

I will gladly give this evidence at any enquiry in order to squash the smear
campaign against the many thousands of good people on Merseyside whose sense
of loss and unity cannot at this moment be described.




Yours faithfully,

                                                           24 April 1989




   Dear Sir,

   Today I was speaking to one of your members at the House of Lords who advised
   me that you were the person to write to. I would like to give oral or written
   evidence at the Hillsborough enquiry because.

   a)     I was present at both semi-finals between Forest and Liverpool, and
          saw the vast difference of Police control at both matches.

   b)     I on both occasions came through the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

   c)     As an ex military policeman of some 10 years standing and trained and
           experienced in crowd control of all nature, including Northern Ireland,
           I feel I can speak from a position of experience.

   I look forward to receiving your reply.

   Yours faithfully,
                                                                  Lancaster.
                                                             18 April, 1989.




    Dear   Mr    Hurd)



     Enclosed with this letter is a photostat of my            ticket      for
last Saturday's semi-final at Hillsborough.   You will notice that
it is for the Leppings Lane End terrace.   You will           also   notice
that  like   thousands of other tickets it is untorn.          I am one of
the luckier ones: I'm sitting here writing this instead of being
dead: I didn't lose anybody: I didn't stand in the middle section
of the terraces. Having said that, maybe I'm not so lucky becfJJ®f.
every two minutes or so my head gets filled with images that
nobody should have to live with in peacetime
     I consider   the  photocopy  to  be evidence enough              of my
credentials   for writing this.  My other credentials are 22 years
of watching football; 19 years of watching L i v e r p o o l . S a t u r d a y 8
game was my ninth FA Cup semi-final and my third at Hillsborough.
Initially   I just didn't feel like talking about what happened at
all. but as the   buck-passing process seems to be accelerating my
anger and disgust has hit the level where I'm not going            to     keep

quiet/bout^it^     Hillsborough  on Saturday with my father and a
friend.   The much publicised reason for the  FA  and the police
choosing Hillsborough    to stage the match was that the Liverpool
fans would arrive from the west and the Nottingham Forest     fans
would   arrive from the south and thus could easily be kept apart.
This was based on the assumption that every Liverpool   fan would
use   the A628   to travel to the ground.  In fact we,  along with
several thousand others decided to use the A57 , a less congested
route. This meant that we parked in the same area as all the Not
tingham fans. When I walked about a mile to the ground at 2.00 pm

                                        THIS PORTION TO BE RETAINED
 I would quess that there would have been roughly two Forest fans
to every one Liverpool fan in the streets on the south side of
the ground.        ^         ^       aggressive atmosphere,       no hint of
violence,  simply good natured singing and banter. Anyone who
knows anything about the game could tell you that there is no an­
tipathy between the two clubs, and that the chance of trouble wa
minimal. Despite this there was a massive police presence in the
streets; clusters of officers on every corner    threatening mil-
tary looking vans, none of them smiling or making any attempt
be helpful as they watched and waited for trouble.
      When we arrived at the Leppings Lane End having                 literally
been    sent round the houses        by p o l i c e seperating us      from the
Forest fans       who we'd just walked the best part of amile with, it
was imediately clear that there were difficulties.
      This was at approximately 2.25.             There was a mob swaying and
surging to try and get to the eight turnstiles.               There has been a
lot of talk       about sixteen turnstiles which            simply isn t true:
there     were    eight gates for the seats and eight for the terraces.
The chaos came as absolutely no surprise because it was                 exactly
the   same last year when it took me 50 minutes to get through the
turnstiles and to my seat          in the     stand     above the    terracing.
Everybody was talking about this,             nobody could believe that the
police had done nothing to improve            the     situation.   Despite   the
hundreds of very visible police all over Sheffield, the only ones
iTi evidence outside the turnstiles were three mounted policemen.
The situation had obviously been going on for some time, and many
fans who had purposely turned up early were               getting understand­
ably    livid.   We were quickly sucked into the centre of the crowd
and there was no doubt that it was             no normal     crush.   I  simp y
decided     to  get out.    Having been in many a similar situation it
was clear from the pitch of the screams and shouts from those                 at
 the front that the situation w a s deteriorating fast. I managed to
 qet   out   of  the main       crush to the side by some railings,          and
 shouted for my friend to do the same.              We decided to wait     there
 whilst    the  situation     eased.    At     this point one of the mounted
 policemen completely lost his cool and barged his way out to                the
 back of the crowd.      I d o n ’t know if the fans in his way were able
 to get their feet out of the way, but I doubt it. I don't know if
 he did anything constructive when he got out of the crush, but
 doubt it.   Everyone was yelling      at him.    and   I accept       that
everyone   is human,   but his shouted response of " You can all go
crush youselves for all     I care!" is something       that he       will have
to learn to live with.
      At   this   point many fans began to climb the gates m order
to get out of the crush.    Almost all of them were showing tickets
to police waiting      on the other side.     The crush w a s n ’t getting
markedly worse as kick off time approached, for the simple reason
that the area around the turnstiles was as crowded as conceivably
possible.   I find the stories of last minute       arrivals     of wild,
drunken   thugs so far fetched that they are quite contemptible.At
this point a small gate was opened in a side wall        and     before    I
knew anything I had been pushed through with about fifty or sixty
others after which they managed to close it.         Straight ahead was
a tunnel leading into the ground.      My friend    suggested      that we
went  in and     stood  behind   the   goals.   The   area     within the
perimeter of the ground was oddly      quiet   and   there was       hardly
anyone going in through the tunnel.
     I told him that         I had once stood there before in a semi­
final against Arsenal years previously and remembered that it was
a bit packed and the view w a s n ’t great.   And so it was that I was
one  of   the   ones who made their way to the edge.        Five minutes
later even our part of the ground had filled up very fast and the
incoming fans told of how a big gate had been        opened     or   kicked
down. And the rest is history.

I would like to make the following points very clear.

1. There WAS a very major problem outside the Leppings Lane End
last year any anyone who claims otherwise is simply not   telling
the truth.
2.  Everyone who   saw the numbers of policemen who came onto the
pitch,  and for the most part stood aimlessly about as  the di s­
aster unfolded could simply not believe why so few had been allo­
cated to steer 10,000 fans through 8 turnstiles which were fenced
in on three sides by an area little bigger than an infant school
playground.  ( Having said that,   everybody also noted  the  few
policemen who unhesitatingly jumped into the middle of the crush
and showed extraordinary courage.)
3    The stories that ace now being brought out about massive n um­
bers of riotous,       drunken fans causing the crush are gross
qerations, which seem to be desparate attemmt to shift the b J-ame.
4 Standard policy at other similar occassions is always to break
down the crowd slowly,to mass the majority in a wide            open   space
like a street        check their tickets and split them into a smaller
bunch,    then form them into queues which move quickly through the
turnstiles.     Above all      the most important thing is to have th
policemen doing the job showing         patience,    smiling   and TELLING
people what       is happening.      Had there been one articulate voice
talking through one efficient         loudhailer   outside the Leppings
Lane End      on Saturday      there may well have been 94 more people
alive today than there are.
        This in my opinion is where the root causes of the problems
that led to      the horror of the weekend are to be found. I am 28 a
graduate and      a company director,      and like most people in England
    I'm     generally treated with politeness and courtesy.          That is
until I go to a soccer match.         Once I an identified     as   football
fan      I am immediately         considered   to   be little more than an
animal.     If I have a scarf out of my car window on route           to   an
away match the police will stop me and search me. When                get to
 the game I get herded around by absurdly           aggressive policemen,
pushed    and    shoved with never a word of apology until I,           a ong
with the rest of the animals,         are safely     locked away     In   ow
 cage,   under    the    scrutiny of both video cameras and hundreds of
 policemen. Of course there are troublemakers at football matches,
 lots of them.      Anyone who claims otherwise is an       idiot    But    to
 treat     two million football fans as if they were all a danger to
 society is absurd.       And now we are being branded as       outcasts
 the extent      we're going to be forced to carry an ID card when we
 go to see a game.       Even convicted murderers out on parole       aren
 recruired to do t h i s .                                                 .
       If you distrust people to this e x t e n t , and   insist on pushing
 them round       like cattle is it really any surprise that            they don
 behave like perfect Edwardian Gentlemen?          A standing Doke amongst
 Liverpool fans when they are pushed         into   a particularly      tight
 space is for them to start mooing at the top of their voices.
       I am     convinced       that it was this ludicrous attitude that
 more than anything else led to the tragedy           of    Leppings    Lane.
 Whoever was running the show obviously felt that 98% of his
 resources needed to be deployed to stop fighting in the streets.
A crush at the turnstiles?    Their problem.  That was why n o b°dy
told us what was happening as if they assumed  that we "ere^ so
thick that we wouldn't understand. That is why we are all haunted
£C     £he sight of policemen beating desperate fans off the fences
when    everyone but them knew that there was a very serious
p r o b l e m . ^    the animai feed industry,      and I sometimes go to
cattle auctions.  The cows are transferred from wagon to pen   to
ring with the minimum of harshness.   Were they tr®ate^        fy
around in remotely the same way that we fans are shoved around by
the police on a Saturday afternoon the RSPCA would have a great
deal     to   say   about it   Which puts me in mind of the words of a
vouna    Doet called Wilfred Owen who 6 0   years     ago   wrote   a   po
£ a S I d P " Antiem foJ doomed youth." Its first line suddenly after
all these years seems horribly topical,

        "What passing bells for those who die like cattle."

ye are a middle aged couple witfftwo teenage daughters. We were
both in^the stand above where all the Liverpool Supporters were
J^XXedS        ‘          '                 --------- -

We left our house at 11.00 a.m. and got into the ground at 2.10 p.m.
At 2-20, p.m. u/e u/ent into our seats and then walked forward to look
o v ^ r u i e balcony at the fans below.   It was obvious to us that there
were too many fans in th                    +h° T 1”1- anH indeed many looked
distressed and many of them were chanting "no more room no more room"
"don't let anyone else in here".         Surely the Police must have had
their surveillance cameras focused on that area and surely if we
could see it was overcrowded at 2.2D p.m. they must have been able
to see it.        Why didn't they tall the Stewards not to let anyone
else into that area and to direct people to the two side areas
where there was room?        Why did they allow people to keep coming
into that area in a steady stream from 2.2D p.m. to 2.50 p.m. WHY ?

 My husband went to the toilet at 2.4Q p.m. and said there were
 thousands outside and he could see a group of about 1DD to 2DD
 being allowed to run down the street as fast as they could towards
 the crowds that were already there.

 Then of course the event which if you wanted to be kind you would call
 "gross incompetence and bad management" but if you were being really
 truthful and honest you would call wicked, was allowed to happen.
 The Police opened a 16 foot gate and let the crowd rush in as if this
 was not bad enough, nobody had their ticket checked to see if they
 had a correct ticket or in fact any ticket at all, this was at a
 match that was supposed to be all ticket, I myself was frisked when
 we went in and my bag was searched and my husband was also searched.
 Then to make matters even worse the Police and Stewards allowed the
 crowd to rush towards the first entrance they saw which was of course
 the tunnel leading directly into the already overcrowded area.

 Why was the gate opened to let sveryone in irrespective of whether
 they had a correct ticket or not ?   Why were they allowed to rush
 towards the most crowded area of the ground ? Why were they not
 directed towards areas with more empty spaces ?

 Now we have heard the Police opened the gate to alleviate pressure outside
 which we just cannot comprehend was a valid reason knowing the
 state of the ground ineide.   Why was there so much pressure outside ?
 Why couldn't the Police control it ? Isn't that what they are there for.
 Why weren't there more Police outside ? Why were 1DD to 200 fans allowed
 to run down the road towards the rest of the crowd trying to get in
 to the ground ?   Why did Police on horseback not make the croud queue in
 an orderly fashion as the Police at Anfield do weak in and week out in
 far worse conditions i.e. the alleways to the laop and the main road
 outside the ground ? Why were the Police outside the ground if not to
 control the fans ?    Why didn't the polica inside communicate the position
 to the Polica outside ?
Lastly of course there is why were Liverpool allocated less tickets
than Nottingham Forest.    We have twice as many regular supporters as
N ttingham Forest and were given 4,000 or whatever less tickets than
them.   In fact people who got into the ground when the gate was
opened by the Police had tickets which they had bought from Nottingham
Forest fans.    The Police say it was easier to control us and the
traffic^ if we were given the Lickers Lane End#    This has been proved
to be totally untrue as there was no crowd control outside and most of
the people arrived late because of traffic problems, not to mention
Police holding up coaches and checking for alcohol, and being made
to walk d ies from their coaches to the ground.   This has happened
many times to us, most recently at Coventry and prior to that at
Aston Villa when Liverpool played Arsenal in the Littlewoods Cup.
So there is no way giving us fewer tickets can be justified.

liie will never forget the scenes we saw and people being dragged out
of the paddock below us and thrown on to the pitch and left to die.
People trying to get out through totally inadequate gates and being
pushed back by the Police at first.     People being carried away on
hoarding by the Fans not ambulance men, policemen or stewards.
Why weren't the stretchers there where were they ? Where were the
 ambulances ? Why weren't wire cutters used in the fence more quickly
Why didn't the Police react quicker to this terrible situation ?
Why were there no announcements over the loudspeaker made to inform
 everyone who didn't know of the problem ?

WHY was this terrible thing allowed to happen ?

We will never be able to forget it anyone who was there and especially
those who have lost loved ones and friends until we get some answers
to the above questions.

We are enclosing an article which we think answers those questions
but we hope and pray that some one can show us some other reason
to keep us sane.

      As time has gone by X have ^reflected on the matter and I am finding
myself increasingly puzzled by what appear to be contradictory reports from
spectators before kick off time and in official or semi official statements
since.
     Several spectators in the North Stand took their seats near mine (Row
4,11, Seat 102) at about 2,50pm.   They had in their possession,tidrkets. which
were complete and told us that they had entered the ground through a steel
sliding gate, opened by the police at 2.45pm.     This is § quarter of an     hour
earlier than the time given officially and seems to indicate the possibilit
of another gate being openedo      None of these spectators   spoke of surging
crowds, crushing, nor, indeed of any danger outside.     They did, however,
 say that, were large queues at the turnstile i . This view seems supported
 by a report in the Chester Observer, of the experience of a local headmaste
 and his son.   I enclose a photocopy of this article.
      The build up of fans outside the ground could have been aggravated by
 the slow flow through the turnstiles, because many, including me, were
^frisked.' twice, both outside and just inside the turnstile. Once should have
 been enough.
      I believe that many questions must be asked about the organisation
 and policing of this game, not only to ensure that, such a tragedy never
 occurs again but also to prevent blame,, once more, being unfairly directed
 only at supporters.

                                    Xours faithfully,

16 April 1989


Dear Mr Moynihan,


I attended and witnessed the awful and tragic scenes at Hillsborough yesterday.
I hope what I have to say may be o f some value to you in your capacity as
Sports Minister. I would lik e to divide th is l e t t e r into three short se ctio n s;
f i r s t , a description o f what I witnessed; secondly,questions which should
be raised and l a s t l y , my suggestions as a l i f e - l o n g follower o f fo o tb a ll.


The police on duty were, in my opinion, woefully inadequate in both number
and th e ir e ffe c tiv e n e s s at crowd co n tro l.I have spent ten years serving in the
Royal Military Policetwo o f which were served in Northern Ireland whre I
gained a great deal o f experience in             crowd control.
The p olice I spoke to could not even t e l l me where a certain club o f f i c i a l
car park was, consequently I was driving around the ground j u s t adding to the
already alarmingly large crowd. On a r r iv a l, by fo o t, at the Leppings Lane
end o f the ground I was shocked to find only eight t u r n s t ile s open to service
the whole o f the North Stand as well as the West Stand. The time was now
I4.35hrs and the crowd was s o lid from the t u r n s t ile s entrance backing into
the road, a distance o f about ten y a r d s .I t took me ten minutes to eventually
gain access to a t u r n s t il e .
Once tbe other side of the t u r n s t ile s I walked to the l e f t for the North
Stand seating areas. As I looked back I could see the situ a tio n was becoming
more desperate with hundreds o f people arriving by the m inu te.Still only three
mounted policemen were attempting to            control the crowd           outside. I     them   took my
seat in the stand. After k ick -o ff i t        became clear that           far too many people were
confined in too small a space in the West Stand.
The questions which have arisen from t h is incident are:
- why should Liverpool FC, with a far greater following than Nottingham Forest,
  be allocated le s s t ic k e ts ?
- why was the l e a s t supported club allocated the larger standing area?
- l a s t year's semi-final was controlled by s t r i c t marshalling at l e a s t f i f t y
yards from the t u r n s t i l e s . What happened th is y e a r ?
- why was there no       early announcemnt made, to keep both Liverpool and
Nottingham Forest fans informed?
-why were the f i r s t aid services at the ground under-manned and under-equipped
for a major sporting event such as t h is ?



F in a lly , I would lik e to comment th a t, in my opinion, a match o f th is
s ig n ifica n c e and importance should be played at a larger stadium. Could the
sem i-fin als not be staged at Wembley on altern ate Saturdays?
I further f e e l that i f the perimeter fences are not to be taken down at grounds
around the country, small gates should be b u ilt into the structures every three
f e e t or so , with a steward assigned to each gate throuhout the match.



In conclusion, I think a fte r an incident lik e th is i t i s very easy to point
the finger and apportion blame. This i s not my aim - I have j u s t tried to
t e l l you what I saw and r a ise a few p rctical suggestions.



                            Yours sin cerely

        Dear Mr Whalley

        On behalf of                   who is a Probation

                                                                         Date ......................................................

                                                              -.......................... C/0 Kirkby
From: ...................... St-;•-Chads Drive, Kirkby,

Subject:.........................................................................


               Please find enclosed a copy of my observation
               of events at Hillsborough on 15th April.
               These were compiled from rough notes completed
               the same evening and a more careful draft
               drawn up on 16th April.

               Having now seen certain film of events outside
               and talked to others who were present at the
               ground, I think it likely that I may be able
               to amplify some parts of my evidence, especially
               if I were to speak to someone from the Enquiry
               team who had intimate knowledge of the sequence
               of events that day. Sight of any additional
               film from such as the BBC might also jog my
               memory. I am concerned that any evidence I
               might hold is not lost too quickly in the passage
               of time.

                 I have already given my particulars to the
                 press office at the main Sheffield Police
                 Station, clearly indicating the nature of
                 my evidence though not in any detailed terms.
                 This telephone call was made on 17th April,
                 though as yet I have heard nothing further.
                 I was told that Officers would be getting back in
                 touch with me on the same day that I rang.
    My son (15) and I boarded a full Eavesway coach at Ashton-in-Makerfield,

Greater Manchester, which left at 11.45am.     I was told by the company that they

had 3 other coaches going to Sheffield for the match.     At first we assumed

our route would be the usual M62 - Ml, which for last year's semi-final

had brought us to the ground well before 2pm.     The driver, acting on company

orders to avoid anticipated delays on the M62 due to lane restrictions, took

us instead via Sheffield and the Woodhead Pass and the mood on our coach

became angry and frustrated when we were held up in heavy traffic in

Stockport and on the road to Glossop for over lj hours.     Most were resigned

at this stage to missing the start of the match.     Feelings ran high again

when the driver later avoided a more direct route to Sheffield and went

instead onto the Ml to the following junction for the customary police

check, which took place at 2.10pm.   I have since wondered whether the late

arrival of coaches at this checkpoint was communicated to those responsible

for crowd supervision at Hillsborough.     The roads were quite clear by now

and we made easy progress towards Hillsborough.     The driver, under

pressure from passengers, twice tried to stop for disembarkment near the

end of the Leppings Lane but was refused permission by police.     As a result

we had to park about half to three quarters of a mile away to join the line

of other coaches.   The time was now 2.30 — 2.35pm.



     We both jogged towards the ground, which was not easy as we had to

 keep dodging amongst the large number of Liverpool fans who were steadily

 (not hastily) walking towards the ground.     As usual there were numerous

 teenagers enquiring if fans had spare tickets for sale.     Our arrival

 outside the ground was 2.35 - 2.40pm and we immediately split up as my

 son had a stand ticket and we could see that his entrance gates were not

 too heavily congested.




                                     -   1 -
                            \
    I then attempted to find the best way into the terraced section.         This

proved difficult because a wedge of fans seemed stuck by the first set of

gates and entrance looked to be limited to one door-way.         Further ahead I

could see full queues at the turnstiles.         There was no real place to join

the wedge of fans outside as it was not in any way a queue and no forward

movement was taking place.    Numbers did not seem excessive and I was able

to stand freely on the pavement by the stone bridge.         The only immediately

visible police presence seemed to be 3 mounted officers.         In view of the

stalemate nature of the position I withdrew from the crowd and stood m            the

road itself, amongst a number of others, before noticing a few who were stood

at the   top   of a 10 metre highbank on the other side of the road.      From this

position I was able to view the whole area with ease between 2.40 and 2.55pm.




     Just before I went up on the bank, I observed the speedy arrival of a

land-rover, with a fixed outside loud-hailer.         The officer using this loud-

 hailer could well have been the flat-capped officer, an inspector I think,

 whom I saw on the BBfi news, who was then moving on foot amongst the crowd.            (I

 felt this footage must have been    shot prior to 2.35 - 2.40pm as I could

 not see the land-rover and the crowd was far larger than I witnessed on

 my arrival)- I saw him stand on the step of the vehicle and urge the crowd

 on 2 or 3 occasions to hold back and be patient in order to relieve the

 pressure on the gates.    He was also giving instructions to the 3 mounted

 officers but they seemed not to be moving with any purpose or intent.            The

 officer then twice called in an urgent voice, for "the mounted inspector .

 There seemed to be no response to this request.         The crowd were then told

  (2.45 - 2.50pm), on the loud-hailer that an attempt was being made to put

 back the time of the kick-off (3.15 may have actually been mentioned).            None

  of these words had any effect on the crowd position which seemed to have

  remained much the same as when I first arrived, though there was a more

  noticeable build-up of fans (the ones we first ran past) along Leppings Lane.




                                       -   2 -
    The officer by the land-rover then raised himself above the crowd and

gesticulated in what I thought was a frantic manner towards officers who

were behind the blue gates at the side of the terraced turn-stiles.       His

action was an obvious one, stretching his arms out straight, flats of his

hands together, and then opening them rapidly in a scissor-like fashion.

As a consequences of this action, the large blue gates on the right opened

inwards and there were a substantial ingress of fans for about a minute,

possibly a minute and a half.   In that time I could see a solid phalanx

of fans, maybe 10 to 12 abreast, moving quickly through the gate.       The

movement extended back to the gate where fans were being admitted into

the turnsJile area.   In fact this gate and the double blue-door were in a

line with each other, thus assisting the flow of people.       At this time,

there were still queues 20 or 30 deep at each of the turnstiles and many

of these peeled away to join the throng going through the open gates.          I

saw uniformed police tapping these fans on the shoulder and pointing to

the open gates.   I estimated that several hundred fans, possibly more,

entered the ground by this means between 2.45 - 2.50pm.       I did not see

whether these fans entered the terraced area through the central tunnel

or from the side openings.



     Within a minute or two of the right hand gates being shut, I

saw the equivalent gates being opened on the stand turn-stiles (numbered

A to C).   I could see about 8 helmeted policemen then standing in the opening

as fans passed through.   The officers may have been looking at tickets

but I could not be sure of this. I was doubtful if this was the case as

 the movement of fans was again quite quick.      Those fans with or without

 terrace tickets would have had access to these gates, though these were also

 closed after a minute or just over.       There is no question that these two

 gates were fully opened, alternatively, for at least up to a minute between

 2.45 - 2.50pm.


                                       -   3 -
    Having now seen the BBC evening news on 16th April, which showed the

footage of the crowd assembling in Lepping Lane, I am positive that those

scenes occurred prior to my arrival at 2.40pm.         The cameraman must have

filmed from a similar position to my own view from the banking, yet there

was no sign of the land-rover.    The crowd, which was substantially filling

the road, was also greater than at the time of my arrival.         I also saw on

the film the flat—capped Inspector, who I now think retreated from the

scene to commandeer the land-rover with the loud-hailer.          Certainly his

face on the newsfilm looked very familiar to me as the officer I saw

controlling events from the land-rover.          On the film it showed police

at the edge of the gates leading to the turnstiles, lifting a semi-conscious

child out of the crowd and I saw no sign of this during my period of

observation.     The inspector looked to me to be in a beleagured and pressured

situation.



     When the press oC the crowd subsided at 2.55pm, I made my way over to the

first gates, which I was able to pass through with ease.          By this time

there were only a handful of people at the turnstiles and entrance to the

ground was a formality.     As I passed into the turnstile approaches,

uniformed police were ushering about 6 teenage fans out of the ground because

 they had no tickets.    An officer then approached me and said, "you can't

 get in here without a ticket."    He then allowed me through on production

 of my ticket.



      I seem to recall that the roar which always greets the kick-off

 occurred as I was going through the turnstiles and I saw only a few fans

 in the area leading to the tunnel underneath the stand.          In fact I relieved

 myself against the wall outside the toilet (adjacent to the tunnel entrance),

 because so few people were around and there was a sea of urine to negotiate

 before even reaching the proper toilets.          Never having stood on the

 Hillsborough terraces before, I had no idea that there were two side entrances


                                       -   4 -
to the viewing area and simply walked down the sloping concrete ramp underneath

the stand towards the back of the terracing behind the goal.




     By this time the match was in progress, as I could partially observe

by standing 3 or 4 metres back from the tunnel exit and taking advantage

of the slope by looking at some of the pitch between the ceiling and the

tops of people's heads.   For a few minutes I was able to watch play switch

from one end of the ground to the other.          Perhaps a dozen fans came past

me in this 5 minute period, forcing their way into the back of the crowd.

I had already decided against this action because I was uncertain as to the

true position on the terraces.   My apprehension was soon borne out           when 3 or

4 adults extricated themselves from this crowd, with obvious difficulty, and

recovered themselves in the empty passageway.          Two were breathing

excessively and one was sweating profusely.           Someone said it was worse

than Heysal down there.   I then saw, for the         only time, a small squat

man in a dull yellow plastic top, who was evidently a steward.             (This was

printed in small letters on the lower back of his top).            He walked up to the

rear of the crowd, though I can’t recall if he went in or came away.              The

rear of the crowd behind the goal were packed but stationary between 3.00 -

 3.05pm and there was no sign of concern or panic.         None at the back attempted

 to move away.



      Whilst play was still in motion, I pondered whether there might not

 be another entrance to the terraced section and accordingly retreated down the

 passage, turning left past the refreshment kiosk.         I then saw that there was

 an opening   to the terraces by the       corner flat, close to the police control

 box, which   I had seen on previous       visits to the ground.    Again it proved

 impossible to break into the crowd becauseof the throng           and I   think play

 was halted as I approach this section.




                                       -    5 -
       I then stayed in this position until 3-45 - 3.50pm at which point there

was increasing rumour that the game had been abandoned.       During these 45

minutes I saw perhaps 10 - 15 people, many young women, who were coming off

the terraces in distressed states, either caused by physical or emotional

trauma.    I was able to see part of the pitch and saw the frantic attempts

to resuscitate one fan by the side touch-line.       Only at this point did the

thought strike me that people might be dying.       Odd comments from fans

later led me to think that a few people may have died in a crush, somewhere

on the terraces.




       At 3.45pm I moved out of the ground as it was apparent that the

stadium was being emptied.     I took up position 50 yards along Lepping Lane,

in order to look for my son who eventually same along, ashen-faced, about

4.30pm.    He of course had not known that I had held back from entering

the terraces.    During this period I witnessed most of the fans exiting

from   both   stands and terraces.    People filed past me in grim mood.     Many

I would describe as walking wounded, with breathing difficulties or

clutching damaged limbs.     Almost all the females were distraught and being

consoled by their companions.        Other males were talking out loud to

themselves, clearly reliving events, whilst the more vociferous and

emboldened were approaching uniformed and mounted police and berating them

in the strongest manner possible for having been responsible for causing

people to be murdered.     In other circumstances, I am sure police would not

have tolerated such verbal abuse but, wisely in my view, they gave no

reaction to such taunts.     To have done so would unquestionably have

sparked a mini-riot because the mood of some fans was extremely ugly.

Dear Sirs,

Hillsborough, April 15th 1989

I am writing to record my experiences and observations on the above, from the
point of view of a spectator in the North Stand.


The journey across to Sheffield turned out to be a difficult one.                       The traffic
hold-up at the Stockport end of the M63 delayed us for 20/30 minutes, which
might have been longer if I had not taken a diversion to avoid the next section
of the jam.     It was clear that there were a number of cars carrying Liverpool
supporters in the hold-up, which I believe to be a relevant factor in the
subsequent events.


When we got closer to Sheffield          we were running behind time, and at just after2
p.m. were still some 8 miles or          so from the city centre, and in a nose-to-tan
 traffic queue.    We were lucky in finding a parking space at about 2.20 p.m., and
 walked to the Stadium, arriving         in Leppings Lane at about 2.40 p.m.               Although we
 were behind time, there were still many people behind us, both on the road and

 walking to the ground.


 I attended exactly the same fixture last season, i.e. Liverpool v. Nottingham
 Forest at Hillsborough in the Semi-Final.              On that occasion we were in the West
 Stand seated accommodation and queued in an orderly fashion for 4/5 minutes to
 go through the turnstiles, having arrived at 2.20 p.m.


 I was surprised to find a milling mass of fans outside the ground.                      We joined
 not a queue,     but quite simply           a crowd outside the entrance to the North Stand,
 for which we had tickets.      My           party comprised myself, and three lads, one 15and
 two 14, both thelatter being small and slightly built.              After 10 minutes it
 became clear that the crush was getting worse and there was precious little
 progress being made at the turnstiles.            I heard a policemen on foot nearby
  shout that he wanted to "get a horse in here" to his colleagues.                      I don’t know
 whether a horse was moved in or not.
                                                                    Continued:
I was aware that a number of the fans around me were holding tickets for the
West Stand and apparently had been directed to this particular entrance by the
police.     The crowd was shouting and appealing for the exit gates on our
left-hand side to be opened to give entrance to the ground, and relief from the
crush.     At this point I was firmly convinced that the kick-off would be delayed
and mentioned this to one or two people close to me.


Shortly before 3 p.m. when the intensity of the crush had increased and the ■
crowd was moving around alarmingly, I decided ^Itwould be safest to_send_t^ two
you n g e s t n v e r -thaJieads of the crowd, through the turnstiles a n d o u t ^
harm's way.        I am very thankful to the Liverpool fans close to me for the help
they""gave me in doing this, it was certainly not easy to release the lads from

the crowd.


Just after this the exit gate was opened and the crowd moved through this gate
in a reasonably ordered fashion, our party was re-united within the ground, and
we got to our seats to watch the match.        The rest of the events that day are

well-documented.


 I have no wish to set myself up as an instant expert on crowd control, but I do
 feel that there are a handful of observations I could make which I hope will be
useful in identifying what went wrong on that occasion and preventing such a

 disaster happening again.


 1.      The route from the North-West to Sheffield was extremely well-policed in my
         opinion, with officers, cars and motorcycles at every significant
         intersection, plus motorcycles on patrol on the A61 approach road into
         Sheffield.     Wouldn't the police have noted, with their many years of
         experience of staging Semi-Finals at Hillsborough, an early warning that
         the "convoy" was behind time, with the inevitable result of a surge of
         latecomers at the stadium?


 2.      The entry arrangements through the turnstiles to the North Stand were
         chaotic.     In contrast to last year, there was virtually^no direct police
         supervision of the queues and there was no sign of the queue demarcation
                   and barriers. In~iddition, there was no_attempt to search fans on
         nearing the turnstiles, as there had been previously.


          Added to this there were only 4 turnstiles attempting to deal with the
          crowd.     Can it be that the North Stand at Hillsborough, capable of holding
          (I would guess) 10,000 people is accessed by only 4 turnstiles?


                                                                         Continued:
     I have already commended the Liverpool fans for their co-operation in
     getting my two youngest boys out of the crowd.      I was equally grateful to
     the police who opened the exit gate and so saved us, in our position, from
     the very real danger of being crushed outside the ground.      This I believe
     to have been a strong probability as a result of the panic that would have
     ensued from the crowd surging forward when it realised the match had
     started.   The opening of that gate into the North Stand was very definitely
     a sound decision.     i


4.   I have been to football matches before, where, because of problems of late
     arrival of fans, the kick-off has been delayed.     The reaction to this has
     never been describable as positive, but is generally tolerated, particularly
     in a situation where there is good crowd segregation.      Why, oh why was this
     action not taken?


     By virtue of the monitoring of the movement of Liverpool fans into
     Sheffield, I believe that the writing was on the wall as early as 2.00 -
     2.15 p.m., and that the police, with all their experience must have seen
     it, and anticipated that surge of late arrivals.


     In the area where we were, it would have made a considerable difference to
     the demeanour of the crowd outside if a policeman with a loud-hailer had
     stood on top of the turnstile wall and told everybody that the kick-off
     would be delaved-^20 minutes and that it would not start until everybody was
     in the ground.   As I suggested above, I do not believe that the
     announcement would have brought a bad reaction from the spectators inside.


5.   One final point, not particularly related to this catastrophe, but
     nevertheless important.    In our seats, Row 39, seat numbers 31-34, we just
     could not hear the public address announcements above the general crowd
     noise,   u m [y~when
                  y when everybody hushed each
                                          eacTT uLiim
                                                uLliui uuulU
                                                       uuuld Life messages be heard.
     One day, that factor could be vital, in a different sort of crisis.

Dear Mr Moynihan,


I attended and witnessed the awful and tragic scenes a t Hillsborough yesterday.
I hope what I have to say may be o f some value to you in your capacity as
Sports Minister. I would l i k e to divide th is l e t t e r into three short se c tio n s ;
f i r s t , a description o f what I witnessed; secondly,questions which should
be raised and l a s t l y , my suggestions as a l i f e - l o n g follower o f fo o tb a ll.


The p olice on duty were, in my opinion, woefully inadequate in both number
and t h e ir e f fe c tiv e n e s s a t crowd con tro l.I have spent ten years serving in the
Royal Military Policetwo o f which were served in Northern Ireland whre I
gained a great deal o f experience in             crowd control.
The p olice I spoke to could not even t e l l me where a certain club o f f i c i a l
car park was, consequently I was driving around the ground j u s t adding to the
already alarmingly large crowd. On a r r iv a l, by f o o t , a t the Leppings Lane
end o f the ground I was shocked to find only eight t u r n s t il e s open to service
the whole o f the North Stand as well as the West Stand. The time was now
I4.35hrs and the crowd was s o l i d from the t u r n e tile s entrance backing into
the road, a distance o f about ten y a r d s.It took me ten minutes to eventually
gain access to a t u r n s t i l e .
Once tfee other sid e o f the t u r n s t il e s I walked to the l e f t for the North
Stand seating areas. As I looked back I could see the s it u a tio n was becoming
more desperate with hundreds o f people arriving by the m in u te.S till only three
mounted policemen were attempting to            control the crowd           outside. I then     tookmy
s e a t in the stand. After k ic k -o ff i t    became clear that           far too many people were
confined in too small a space in the West Stand.
The questions which have arisen from t h is incident are:
- why should Liverpool FC, with a fa r greater following than Nottingham Forest,
  be allocated l e s s t ic k e ts ?
- why was the l e a s t supported club allocated the larger standing area?
- l a s t year's sem i-final was controlled by s t r i c t marshalling at l e a s t f i f t y
yards from the t u r n s t i l e s . What happened th is y e a r ?
- why was there no       early announcemnt made, to keep both Liverpool and
Nottingham Forest fans informed?
-why were the f i r s t aid services at the ground under-manned and under-equipped
for a major sporting event such as t h is ?



F in a lly , I would l i k e to comment th a t, in my opinion, a match of t h is
s ig n ific a n ce and importance should be played a t a larger stadium. Could the
sem i-fin als not be staged a t Wembley on altern a te Saturdays?
I further f e e l that i f the perimeter fences are not to be taken down a t grounds
around the country, small gates should be b u i l t into the structures every three
f e e t or so, with a steward assigned to each gate throuhout the match.



In conclusion, I think a f te r an incident lik e t h is i t i s very easy to point
the finger and apportion blame. This i s not my aim - I have j u s t tried to
t e l l you what I saw and r a is e a few prctical suggestions.

 following listed comments carefully.

 1)    I am 47 years of age and have worked in the National Health
       Service since leaving school.         I am currently a Personnel
       Officer at                  HealthAntho ^ t v . I*- haVe been~~aT!
      “ardent^Liverpool supporter all ray life. Last Saturday I attended
       the match with my son who is 17 years of age and who has followed
       Liverpool both home and away in a respectable and responsible
       manner over the last few years.

 2)   _Weattended last season's gameand felt it was a        miracle and
      "good   fortune that the disaster did not happen last yea,r.  When
       the draw for the semi-final was announced I was astounded that
       the Police did not take any notice of the pleas made by both
       Liverpool Football Club and their supporters not to make the
       same arrangements as they had done for the game in 1988.    In my
       view, if Liverpool had been allocated the Kop End this tragedy
       would not have occurred.    Since the Police were party to these
       arangements I therefore hold them wholly responsible.

 3)     My son I
               ____    was in the area where the disaster occurred and I
        was allocated a stand seat.           was fortunate to be able to
        climb the safety fence and escape quickly onto the pitch.      He
        then began assisting casualties both dead and alive whilst, in
        his words, many Police Officers just looked on.       I feel very
        aggrieved that whilst taking a rest on his knees due to exhaustion
        a Police Officer clipped him over the head and told him to
        "f...off son and get out of the way".    I wonder if anyone could
        justify this Officer's remarks and behaviour.

 Finally Mr.Hurd, I feel it only right that my son should be invited
 and be given the opportunity to detail to anyone involved in the
 enquiry what happened on the pitch itself, since it is these people
 who witnessed the carnage at its worst and the behaviour of the Police
 Officers who, at the end of the day, are your responsibility.

 I trust you will find the time to respond to my letter.

 Yours sincerely,

Dear Sir,                  THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

The day was Saturday 15th      April, 1989, F.A. Cup Semi Final Day.    I
had never been to    a Semi    Final before. I set off with three members
of my family, one was my       thirteen year old son.  He thought we were
going to have a great day.       Two of us were Forrest Fans and two were
Liverpool Fans.   Two would     come back happy and two would be a little
bit dissappointed. That was    far from the truth.

Vhat we encountered we had no idea.    We set off in plenty of time for
Sheffield arriving at 12.30p.m. the match did not start until 3.00p.m.
We had a bite to eat after we had parked about 15 minutes from the
ground.   As we walked towards the ground we were pestered by supporters
asking if we had any spare tickets.      I would not dream of going to
a   football match which was all ticket if I did not have a ticket.

 We approached the ground, there was a barrier across one side with
 Police patrolling.    We asked the Police which was our entrance, they
 pointed about 10 yards beyond but because the barrier was up they would
 not let us through, we had to walk all the way round.    Never mind the
 exercise will do us good.

 We got into the ground and took our seats, it was a magnificent stadium.
  The crowd was beginning to build up, our seats were in the South Stand
  near the Leppings Lane end, just in line- with the by' line.           To our
>4 oft-;— h±gfi— ifp Twas  a Police Observation— PSsfT     Three Officers were
  situated with short wave radios and TV monitors.       The camaras positioned
  around the ground and outside the ground.           All the time monitoring
  the crowd behaviour.       At the Leppings Lane end, this section was split
  into four in the standing area.         The centre two sections were quite
  full at 2.30p.m. with the end two sections very sparse of spectators.
  At 2.50p.m. we observed that there was quite a lot of swaying in those
  two centre sections but the outer two were filling up very very slowly
  indeed.      The game started with all spectators oblivious to what was
  happening.      After a short time we noticed one or two Police running
  along the touch line to the goal at the Leppins Lane end.      It was obvious
  that they thought that there wastrouble as spectators            were   trying
  to get out onto the pitch.          The Police at first appeared to try to
  deter them from        doing this but      then the spectators   swung   quite
  dramatically and       started to climb     up into the main stand and the
  spectators there were trying to pull them free.         They were also trying
  to climb over the divisional partitions into the outer two sections.
  By this time, in between watching the match and observing the Leppings
  Lane end the situation became out of hand and eventually the Police
  started to help the spectators over the barrier which was quite high
  and difficult to get over.       At this point nobody knew what was happening
  or the scale of the problem behind the barriers.        The spectators helped
   each other over the barrier onto the pitch and eventually there must
  have been about        500 spectators who were onthe cinder track behind
   the pitch and there was so many in fact they started to go onto the
   pitch but tried to keep close to the by line.         At this point in time
   a Senior Officer raced across the field trying to catch the eye of
   the Referee.     Play was still going on but obviously it was at the far
end of the pitch.    The referee turned and saw the Police Officer, went
towards him, made conversation and the referee, decided to take the
players off the field.     Once the players were off the field, at least
a hundred Police Officers came into the ground from the far side, from
the Spoin Kop. Totally unaware of what was going on they thought clearly,
that there was going to be a riot so they formed a barrier the full
width ofthe field along the centre line. Still the       fans were coming
over the    barrier, by this time they had managed to break free one of
the gates.     The spectators started bringing numerous casualties out
onto the green turf and laying them out.      Some of them immediately sat
up, others laid motionless on the ground.

At this point in time it must be noted that it was only the Liverpool
supporters who were actually carrying the spectators and helping them
to get free from the     pressure on the Terrace.     The casualties were
laid on the floor and the spectators started on a number of casualties
to try to    resuscitate them, obviously they were unconscious.      There
were two young girls near the corner flag, they tried to revive them
for a long long time and eventually they put a coat over their heads.
There was   one boy who was as old as my youngest son ; 10, he was brought
right near the touch line, there was a young Police Cadet and a Lady
Police Officer assisting with mouth to mouth resuscitation.     They tried
for about ten minutes without any success.       Spectators in the stand
where I was, and in the terrace below watched helplessly. A big spectator
ran over, said something to the Police Officers and they moved out
of the way, he obviously must have been a First Aider or a Doctor or
somebody with Medical knowledge.       He tried frantically for another
five minutes or it seemed that long to me, eventually all the people
crowding round let out a great cheer, he had started to breathe.       All
in the grand stand and in the terraces below started to cheer and applaud,
our jubilance was short lived, within a minute the big fellow was down,
mouth to mouth resuscitation again, the little boy had stopped breathing.
He eventually started breathing again, they turned him into the recovery
position, four spectators around this boy ran for a stretcher.        They
tried to pull away a notice board around the perimeter.        Four Police
Officers went across, and at first it looked as if they were trying
to hinder, but after a few words they started to assist and pulled
this notice board away, it was then taken over to the boy, he was put
on and was   transported right across to the far side.     While this was
going on an ambulance had turned up behind the goal. A number of bodies
were put inside.     It was still not clear at this point in time what
the casualty situation was but it was obvious that there was a number
of fatalities.   Spectators in the front row of the West Stand, started
to dismantle all the notice boards which were beneath them, hand them
down carefully and eventually they found their way onto the pitch.
They were taken to each casualty and then transferred right across
the ground to waiting ambulances that could not really get into the
ground for the situation.

Whilst this was going on the hundred or so Police Officers still on
the centre line, still waiting for trouble, still waiting for a riot,
at this point a number of Nottingham Forrest fans climbed over the
fence at the Spoint Kop and started to dismantle the sign boards behind
their goal and carry them to where they were needed.     They then joined
with the Liverpool fans in conveying the bodies across to the far side.
There were only a few Police Officers helping to carry the stretcher
bound casualties across and help them in reviving the injured spectators.
The control by the Police during this operation was absolutely negative.
No one seemed to be in charge at all, and it was the Liverpool fans
who  took the initiative     in dealing with the emergency situation.
Eventually a full half of the playing area was covered with distraught
Liverpool fans.   The Manager of Liverpool Football Club, Kenny Dalglish
came to the public address system, appealed for calm, there was no
need, they were completely calm, he asked them to move off the field,
those who were not in need of medical attention, they moved to the
side waiting for further instructions.    It is true there were a couple
of incidents, one involving a News Reporter trying to take photographs
of dead bodies.     Distraught and angry fans seized him.     The Police
protected him and separated him by escorting him away.       They should
have taken his camara away, I would have.

Another incident involving some of the fans near the players tunnel,
they congregated round the BBC Camara as you could see from the News
Report, they were not causing problems.    They were voicing their opinion
at the lack of control, why did it happen, who's fault was it, why was
it not averted?     After a very long time when most of the bodies had
been taken across to the waiting amulances and the terraces were nearly
empty it became evident of the horror of the incident.        Steel barriers
capable of withstanding 50 tons pressure were flattened, it was only
then that the injuries became apparent.        As the fans left the ground
the Police in the centre began to disperse slowly.          Behind the goal
all the personal belongings, shoes, boots, coats, scarves were gathered
in one big heap.    We left the ground at about 4.30p.m. passing spectators
in silence.   The Police outside the ground tried to make their prescence
felt    by stopping cars,asking them wherethey were going, stopping
groups of people, single people, asking them where they were going.
  Still they were looking for trouble.       There was no trouble, people
were     too upset by thesituation tothink       about causing trouble.   It
was not until I got back to the car and switched the radio on that
I heard the horrific number of fatalities, 74.          That must have been
everybody who was carried across the full length of the field.            As
the reasons for this disaster unfold,         the responsibility of crowd
observation and crowd control lies fairly and squarely with the Police.
  As they were situated in that control tower using the close circuit
monitors and using radios for giving instructions, it was obvious that
opening a gate and letting fans in would result in them getting into
the ground and seeing the game as quickly as possible.       With the centre
twosections of the Leppings Lane       end being overfull it would      have
been an easy instruction to deploy some of the Police Officers to the
tunnels leading into those two sections and directing the fans into
the end two sections.      Outside the ground at that particular end the
crowd was building up,      two Police Horses     appeared to be doing very
little to try to relieve the pressure.      I believe those Police Officers
failed in their duty to ensure the safety of those fans in that situation
outside the Leppings Lane end.         I also feel that the observation
controller, overriding and overseeing every action and activity around
the ground failed to recognise the problem in the centre two sections,
and deal with it accordingly by averting fans into the end two sections.
The horrific irony is that we had a situation that the Police had no
 idea how to control.      They are just clearly trained in controlling
riot and violence and they were totally unable to control human tragedy.
By being First Aid Trained, they would have been able to make some
 contribution to the situation. Very few did.

Because this gate was opened, many who did not have tickets, gained
entry and contributed to the problem unintentionally.  I have been
to many football matches in my life and by being all ticket it is far
quicker to gain entry into the ground than it is being paying cash.
We now look at the consequences of having Membership cards.   In a situation
like the 15th April, 1989 entry to the ground would have been much
slower causing terrific build up outside.      It is easy to say that by
being a member and having a membership card you must try to get to
the ground a little bit earlier.      We did because we travelled a long
way.   Not everybody thinks the same way as we do.      People get delayed
in traffic which contributes to late arrivals.      If this game had been
by Membership Card the same situation could have happened, spectators
outside without Membership cars, waiting to get in, the pressure builds
up, the gates are opened to relieve what is anticipated as a dangerous
situation and fans who have had their cards taken away from them gain
entry and cause great problems.

The Government must realise the tragedy caused at Hillsborough on Saturday
 5th april, 1989 is due to interference by Government, Local Authority
and Police, in trying to restrict members of the public as spectators
from moving freely and safely around our grounds.       If the divisional
fences and the perimeter fences were not present today this tragedy
would never have arisen, as the spectators would have merely moved
to one side to avert the pressure. Penning in of spectators is a serious
breach of the Health and Safety at Work Act as far as Safe Access and
Safe Egress is concerned, in an emergency evacuation situation. Football
clubs must be left to manage their own business without interference
from outside bodies unless they request specialist advice and assistence.
It will be interesting to see how the Officer in charge of survelance
and deployment of his force will allay the blame for this tragedy.
95 passionate fans do not know the cause. Thousands do.

    Dear Sir                                        UNIT

    I am writing to you
    at the Liverpool v Nottingham Forest FA Cup              Semi-Final,   at
    Hillsborough, which resulted in 95 deaths.

    I attended the match and was involved in some crushing outside
    the ground, eventually taking up my seat in the north stand just
    prior to kick-off.    I was very concerned about aspects of the
    organisation of this match, primarily crowd control. Hopefully,
    a full independent enquiry will find the reasons for this
    tragedy, but I am concerned that the views of spectators will not
    be taken into account due to the large number involved and the
    fact that they are individuals and not from any 'body', hence my
    letter to you.

    To blame the fans is totally wrong and I feel that this could
    happen unless all points of view are aired. I would stress that
    I am not anti-police, but on this day they were the body
    responsible for crowd control and safety.    They were totally
    unprepared and their activities were not co-ordinated.     They
    failed in their duty and got it wrong on the day.

    The problems arose because a large number of people with tickets
    tried to gain admittance at the same time. Impulsive decisions
    were made and could have been avoided as the situation was
    clearly predictable

            a.   the traffic situation on the motorways was well
                 known

            b.   close circuit TV would show the position both in
                 and outside the ground

            c.   the computer controlled turnstiles showed the
                 number in the ground and the number still to take
                 their places

            d.   the problem was evident by merely looking at the
                 Leppings Lane end and was clear to all present.




                                      1
With the known shortage of tickets, the whole situation should
have been anticipated and panic avoided.  At no time did I see
any disorderly conduct,    everybody was good humoured and
apparently in possession of tickets.

Why:

       a.   Why was there no filtering towards the turnstiles
            - as there was last year - to prevent the crowd
            build up?

       b.   Why was the kick off not delayed as has been done
            several times this season, including the match
            involving only 10,000 spectators at Tranmere.

       c.   Why having opened the gate were arrangements not
            made to stream fans to the sides and to evacuate
            those already packed in.

       d.   Why were no     announcements   made,   no   use   of
            megaphones.

I have heard it said that an unruly mob was responsible.  This
was not the case, the sheer weight of numbers, created by poor
organisation, created it.

I understand that a decision was made to open the gate to
prevent loss of life outside the ground.   I feel that this was
a real possibility.      However, the decision was made in
isolation, without regard to the serious problem which was
already clearly evident inside.    The problems could not have
been made clear to the police inside the ground by their
superiors as they were deployed in the wrong places and ill-
informed.   This was clearly illustrated by large numbers of
police with dogs guarding the stands (for the wrong type of
situation) when they should have been elsewhere.

There were plenty of police about (I understand in the region of
800) but in the wrong places at the wrong time. The lower ranks
clearly thought violence was taking place, their superiors would
have known that this was not the case, but failed to instruct
them properly. One young constable, frightened, criticised his
superiors in front of us.

There has been a great deal of media attention and whilst I can
be influenced by various debates or my own emotions, I can
clearly recollect three impressions on that day:-

       1.   On reaching the ground there was no filtering -
             merely all persons allowed to make '%A617 6Wn W&y.

       2.   On entering the ground, one section was clearly
             overcrowded and two othef areas fairly empty.
     3.   A lack of medical facilities and only two
          ambulances were seen in almost one hour of panic.
          Volunteers did nearly all the work.

The police seemed very complacent and the lower ranks harassed,
unco-ordinated and lacking leadership.     There was a complete
absence of planning and direction and I am convinced that this
could have been avoided had a predictable situation been tackled
properly.   The Liverpool police have dealt with large crowds
over many years without incident.

I feel that the planning of such events should take into account
the views of supporters, including various associations which
now represent them.   The recommendations of Liverpool FC were
rejected for this match.

I know a lot of people share my views who attended the match.
Should you feel that I can be of any further assistance, please
do not hesitate to contact me.

I would like to record my admiration for the fans who assisted
the casualties and the attitude of Liverpool FC over the last
few days.

Yours faithfully




P.S. Since starting this letter, I have heard comments emanating
     from the Police Federation alleging that drunken fans
     started this incident. THIS IS UNTRUE.

    There was no evidence of this, the cause was their
    inability to, on a gradual basis, to stream arriving
    supporters, as they had done successfully the previous
    year. For some reason, they failed to do so and this must
    be highlighted.  I am deeply concerned that one isolated,
    inaccurate statement from a recognised body outweighs the
    more accurate reports from so many witnesses.

    Football supporters, unfortunately, are perceived by those
    who do not attend matches as those few seen in newsclips.
    The fans last Saturday came from all walks of life.    For
    example, our party of 4 were 30/40 years of age, married
    with children. We noticed no less than Billy Liddel having
    difficulty - hardly a hooligan!

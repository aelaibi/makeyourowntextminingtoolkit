           I am the above person and I reside at the above address however during

           the summer months      I work at various holiday camps but I can be

           contacted via my house address.

           On Saturday the 15th of April           1989                . and I went to the F.A.

           Cup semi final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough

           in Sheffield.                 also lives     in             but I d o n ’t know his

           address or telephone number.

                   hired a car, a red V.W. Polo from Bristol especially to go to

           the game he was working         in Bristol as a contractor,                 stayed at

           his home in Liverpool on the Friday night and picked me and my

           girlfriend up at about 11 am.

           We all went towards Manchester first to drop my girlfriend off, then

                   and I continued on to Hillsborough.
                                                                          PAGE       2
                                                                          S2524

We arrived in Sheffield at about 2pm we went to a pub,           I can't recall

where   it is or what it was called, we had 3 pints of lager each,           there .

were a few other fans in the pub from both teams,         there was no trouble

in the pub at all.

We had both got six pounds Leppings Lane standing tickets from a

friend in Liverpool.      We left the pub and went to the ground parking

the car on an individual estate about 10 minutes walk from the ground,

we d i d n ’t encounter any travel delays at all getting to or around                    j


Sheffield.

From parking the car we saw Police directing fans to the ground we

d i d n ’t need help though,   I ’d been to the ground on previous occasions, ^

we arrived at the turnstiles at about 2.50 pm, at this time there

w e r e n ’t any queues there was just a mass of people I got into the

crowd and even though I am quite big I felt very uncomfortable            in the

crush, we decided to get out of the crowds but we couldn’t move at all

I got seperated from              in the croj/d.

    ce ^fflcers on horses were .attej^pting to control the crowd, there

        t   enough Police and th</ c /fiw d werent paying any attention to

the Police.

I made my way over to the right and to iron railings that form a fence

to a stream.     I got over the fence to avoid the crush I walked

along the edge of the fence and when I had reached a point where the

crowd had eased I climbed back over the railings.

As I got back over the fence       I saw a large gate that had been opened,

  d i d n ’t see who opened the gate.     I saw about 50 fans walk through

the gate in an orderly fashion.         I went in behind them.     I d o n ’t know

how many more followed me though,        I actually got into the ground just

before 3pm.    I cannot be more accurate than that.

No one asked to check my ticket at all, all the fans made there way

down the tunnel and onto the terrace,        I c a n ’t recall seeing any Police
                                                                                                 PAGE          3
                                                                                                 S2524

           or Stewards between the turnstile area and the tunnel and I d i d n ’t see

           any signs to direct me to the terraces other than by going down the

           t unne1.

           I didn't see anyone drinking alcohol              inside the ground and I didn't

             ?e any^fighting or any trouble.

           /I walked down the tunnel and onto the terrace.                  I had a clear walk

           down the tunnel, at the end of the tunnel I went to the left and onto

           the terrace            (Pen 4),   the terrace was very full and I had to push my

           way through the crowd to get a view,              I could feel the pressure of

           others around me getting intense,              I decided to make my way over to the

           left and try to climb over the fence into the next pen, but because of

           the pressure I couldn't move easily.               I could see more fans

           pouring onto the terrace behind me and I was pus hec^un controllably

           down the terrace and further to the lef\,               l/f</u*fd m y s e l f   crushed

           against a man whose chest was against a barrier

           The barrier was the one in the first row back from the front fence and

           the nearest one to the side fence that divides pen 4 and 5, as I was

           behind the barrier I was at the right hand end of it, nearest to the

           goal,    the game had kicked off,           I coul dn’t pay any attention to the

           game, and I lost all track of time,              the man infront of me, was

           screaming for me to move back as the pressure was getting more and

           more    intense, my arms            were pinned at my side but I did manage          to free

           them and brace myself               against the barrier to help the        old man infront

           of me, however the pressure was so intense I couldn’t hold myself all

                  barrier and 1 was crushed against the man.

SliOvli /\JGr Somehow the old man infront of me            turned round in^^riec/ush and was
                                             ;              .                    . ,, *

”          purple,    the mans back was bent over the b a w i e r and ne continued to go

     ,     further and further back,              I could do nothing to help him at all,             I

           heard people screaming to the Police for help,                 I could see people

            climbing over the front fence ahead of me.

            All of a sudden the man infront of me stoj>ffed breathing,       he became

            very quiet                                                    I

            would say that the man died the«e/and tl-fcwT against the barrier infront

            of me.

            The Police on the touchline    couldn't get in to the terrace to help us,

            all of a sudden people started running over the tops of our heads and

            shoulders and making their way onto the pitch,      I   was finding itvery

            difficult to breathe,    I was gasping for breath.I     w a s n ’t in a panic   I

            just didn't know what    to do, my face was only a

            matter of inches away    from the old man who had just died and I

            couldn't do anything to help.

            All of a sudden,    people infrorit of the barrier I was crushed against

            pulled the old man infront of me upwards,      I don't know where he went

            though.     I went round the right hand end of the barrier and decided to

            get onto the pitch,    the police and fans were pulling at the emergency

            fence.     I saw space on the terrace further back towards the tunnel,              I

            went and sat down to recover, when the fence was far away I got onto

            the pitch,    I lay down on the pitch trying to recover my breathing and

                      found me, he was okay,   there was nothing wrong with him at all.

            Kenny Dalglesh got onto the pitch and made an announcement,           I can't

            say what was said but after about one hour we left together,           going

            back onto the Leppings Lane terraces and out the way we carne in, we

            di^ove home to L i v e r pool together, my chj^^t waj/ causing me great pa\n            ^

            At no time whilst I was at Hillsborough did I witness anything that I

            considered to be a criminal offence.

                                                                                             S2524

          he Police didn't react at all to the fans pleas for help.                      I d o n ’t

         know why, also the organisation of the Police seemed disjointed,

         everyone was running round in confusion.

         I think this disaster was caused by a number of things,                    not just one

         thing or one person.

         I would describe the man who died in front of me A s                   being white,    he

         was in his late 5 0 ’s to early 60 ’s , he had g re jp hair cojnbed back,                 he

         was 5 ’8" or taller with a large beer belly                                ’V ’ necked

         knitted jumper,   he had a ’ T*   shirt on u j w d e r n e a t h   but I c a n ’t describe

         that,   I cannot describe him further,         I think the man was from

         Liverpool as I didn't recognise any particular                     "foreign" accent.

         I would like to add that from me getting round the end of the barrier

         and towards the main fence and returning further back to the space on

         the terrace took about 5 minutes because as the emergency fence was

         torn open everyone went forward to get out and onto the pitch,                      the

         crowd was jostling to get out.         I sat down to recover and as the crowd

         eased I went through the fence onto the pitch,                 indeed I was one of the

         last onto the pitch,      from my section.

                                                                                           SIGNED

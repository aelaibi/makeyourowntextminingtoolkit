        Dear Sir,

        Re; Inquiry into The Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

        Thank you for your letter of the 13th March.

        Please find enclosed a photo copy of your letter of the
        7th February 1990. As you can see no newspaper articles
        were enclosed with your letter of the 7th February.

         It really is ludicrous to ask for my comments at this stage
         on any newspaper reports. Quite clearly this should have been
         done before I was publicly criticised in your Report.

         The sequence of events here is quite clearly ludicrous and
         I do not feel that prolonged correspondence should be entered
         into.

         I will obviously now need to take legal advice on this matter.

         If you wish to send me the newspaper articles allegedly
         enclosed with your letter of the 7th February then please do so.

         It would be far better if an apology was rendered at this
         stage.

         Yours faithfully,




         D.J. Sharpe - Chairm?-.

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

I have now shown Lord Justice Taylor your letter of 30 January.
Lora Justice Taylor has asked me to say that the comments in
paragraph 54 of his Final Report were baaed upon reports in a
number of newspapers, which indicated that convicted Swansea fans
naa been warmly welcomed back on their return from Greece.
Reports quoted you as justifying this on the basis that the fans
had been unfairly treated by the Greek court, a point which Lord
Justice Taylor mentioned.

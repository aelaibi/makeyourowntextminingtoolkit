FA/HILLSBOROUGH

          telephoned. She wondered how she should respond
to the Department of Environment letter to Graham Kelly. I
said we would be phoning her at about 10.30 to discuss this,

Our initial reaction was that a letter ought to be written
back to                 at the Sport & Recreation Division
explaining a report would be given to the Inquiry which he
could pick up on. We did not want to divert resources in
the meantine.

    mentioned that                 at the BBC had two
canister tapes of all the incidents and interviews that
occurred at Hillsborough some of which were put out on Tv
some of which were not. The FA were trying to get their own
copy. The BBC had sent the other canister to the
Hillsborough Inquiry. I confirmed that we would like our
own copy that we could study at our leisure.

She had chased Glen Kirton and Adrian Titcombe for further
papers and we would be getting some more today.

Engaged 15 minutes including dictation

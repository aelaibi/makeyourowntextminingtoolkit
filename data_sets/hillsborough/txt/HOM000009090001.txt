Dear Diane

Re: Hillsborough Scrutiny

You may remember I sent you the letters to the Police Department, Home Office on
19 may 1999. I have had a telephone call from Mr Pyne who wishes to release these
documents to Mr Spearritt and his advisors. I do not see any major problems with
this but I thought I best check with you.


Yours sincerely

          Dear Mr Pyne

          Further to your telephone enquiry I have searched my records. The correspondence
          that I can find regarding Mr Spearritt is in a letter of 5 January 1998. This was in
          answer to a letter from Mr Bone dated 19 December 1997. In this Mr Bone stated
          “the Nursing Record (form G2546) appears to show admission to the CITU at 17.00”.
          In formulating my reply I was taking that evidence contained in the letter as fact and
          therefore if Mr Spearritt had reached the CITU by 17.00 by definition he must have
          passed through the Accident and Emergency Department before then. I know of no
           other information where I could have extracted these times. I enclose copies of both
           documents for your assistance.

          Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Bone

Re:   Edward Spearitt

I have been passed your letter regarding Mr Spearitt.

I am afraid I can give little further definite information to
that contained in the A&E records. We know that Mr Spearitt was
in the department before 5 pm but his exact time of arrival is
unknown.

As far as I am aware all other records have been sent to you
apart from 2 pages that have been sent from Medical Records
regarding Paul David Brady and I enclose these for your
information.

If I can be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to
ask.


Yours sincerely

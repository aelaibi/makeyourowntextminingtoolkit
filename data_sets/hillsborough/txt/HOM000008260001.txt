Funding of West        Midlands Police Inquiry into the
Hillsborough Tragedy

Further to previous correspondence and conversations with
regard to the above matter and your reassurance re funding,
I was somewhat surprised to see the enclosed article in
the Wolverhampton Express and Star, and should be extremely
grateful for your urgent comments, in case the press contact
me yet again.      — — ---

An urgency with regard to this matter would be much appreciated
and meanwhile, I thank you for your assistance.

Yours,

         ' The number of staff involved
      -peaked' when th e information
      ItoQine was set up.

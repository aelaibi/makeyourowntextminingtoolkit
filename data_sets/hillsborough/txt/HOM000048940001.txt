2    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      In case, of course, it was a double
 3        tragedy because you lost both your sons.        Terrible,
 4        terrible state of affairs.         I received a short letter from
 5        you in September and you say you are having difficulty in
 6        obtaining your statements regarding Christopher and
 7        Martin.
 8   MRS. TRAYNOR:   That's right.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Then I received a much longer
10        letter from you today, which I have read.         I do not know
11        whether you would like to say what you want to say to me
12        or whether you would like M s . Adlington to say it for you
13        and raise the various points you want to or whether you
14        would like me to, I shall probably ask you some questions
15        anyway, or whether you want me to ask the questions.          What
16        would you like to do?
17   MRS. TRAYNOR:   I can speak to you or Ann or we could both.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      You talk to me firstly and tell me
19        what you want?             )
20   MRS. TRAYNOR:   First of all, regarding Kevin, the older of my
21        two boys, up until about two weeks ago I only had one
22        statement regarding Kevin and that was only page and a
23        half and it was a police officer who said he looked after
24        Kevin from pulling him out of the pen until 3 o'clock the
25        next morning after my son had identified him.
26             Then we realised, well, Ann noticed that he'd made
27        another statement, which they'd never sent to me.           But
28        about four weeks ago another family, the Brooks family,
29        Louise, the sister of the deceased, showed me a statement
30        which she had regarding her brother, which also claimed
31        that this policeman, a P.C. Howell also claims to have
32        carried Kevin.    D.C. Turner claims he carried him
33        straight into the gymnasium but P.C. Howell states he
34        carried him across the pitch and laid him down on the
35        pitch at the at the Spire Cop end.         What am I to believe?
36        Who carried my son?     One of them is definitely wrong and I

 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          Have you been provided with the
 3         body file in his case?
 4   MRS. TRAYNOR:      They tell me that I have but I have been
 5         chancing these statements since March 1992 and they've
 6         just sent me a couple of police statements, that was all
 7         in 1992.     They       haven't sent me the one of Harold's, where
 8         he mentions he was with Christopher.          I have only got that
 9         from Louise Brooks.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           Have you got copies of these
11         statements for me?
12   MRS. TRAYNOR:       Yes.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           At the moment I do not think I have
14         got them?
15   MS.   ADLINGTON: Sir, if I could just intervene.         The problem
16         was really Joan has requested information in the past from
17         time to time and when the body file was requested the
18         South Yorkshire Police assured that they m e --
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           Would you keep your voice   up?
20   MS.   ADLINGTON: _They assured me that I would receive           the
21         remainder of the file, which together with the information
22         previously supplied to Mrs. Traynor constituted the full
23         body file.       That in fact cannot be correct because there's
24         a crucial statement missing, Norman Langley, the
25         supporter.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           Norman Langley made a statement to
27         the police, did he?
28   MRS. TRAYNOR:       Yes, he made a 13 page statement to the police
29         regarding Christopher.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           We will see what has happened to
31         that statement.          Have you got a copy of what the police
32         say is the body file?
33   MS.   ADLINGTON:       No, sir, just the remainder of the statements
34         which they say comprise the body file.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           They say you have had the whole lot
36         now?


                                             3
 1   MS.   ADLINGTON:    Yes, between both of us.
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       What would help me is if you could
 3         let me have copies of everything they say is the body
 4         file. Then I will check that that is complete.         In
 5         addition to that, as I understand it, you are saying that
 6         there is a statement from P.C. Howell, which is or may be
 7         relevant, and you have seen that through Miss Brooks?
 8   MRS. TRAYNOR:      That's right, yes.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Also Mr. Normal Langley made a
10         statement to Hillsborough which you say is relevant.         It
11         may be that at that stage they were not able to tie that
12         up with your son, Kevin?
13   MRS. TRAYNOR:      No, Christopher.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        That is Christopher, is it?
15   MRS. TRAYNOR:      Yes.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I am sorry w e 're moving---
17   MR.   TRAYNOR SENIOR:       You're at cross-purposes here---
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Let us talk about Kevin first.
19   MRS. TRAYNOR:      Norman Langley was associated with Christopher.
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Howell was associated with Kevin?
21   MRS. TRAYNOR:      Yes, according to the statement that Louise
22         Brooks had, she has given me a copy of that statement.
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Can I have a copy of that?
24   MRS. TRAYNOR:      Yes.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Have you got that available?
26   MS.   ADLINGTON:     Yes.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        So far as Kevin is concerned there
28         is some confusion as to whether or not you have had all
29         the statements that there are relating to what happened to
30         him, where he was taken and so on?
31   MS.   ADLINGTON:     Yes, sir.
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I will try and clarify that
33         obviously.     There are also, seems to be a point that you
34         are making in your letter about the confusion about his
35         weight and size?
36   MRS. TRAYNOR:      That's right, yes.


                                           4
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       This on the basis that he was
 2         described in the post mortem as being 9 6 kilos grams and
 3         so on, 182 centimetres in height and you say he is less
 4         than that.     Is there any doubt in your mind that the post
 5         mortem which was conducted on him was on him?
 6   MRS. TRAYNOR:      It does make we wonder whether it was him
 7         because it was a big discrepancy, especially in his
 8         weight, he was only 16 years of age.            He was a very
 9         athletic type he was an amateur boxer and he used to go
10         training a lot and he was very fit and agile.            There was
11         no way he anywhere near       15.      He was I would say 11 and a
12         half but say 12 stone.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Do you know who conducted the post
14         mortem on him?
15   MRS. TRAYNOR:      I think it was Mr. Underwood.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        You will appreciate the way it was
17         done, obviously nobody knew when the tragedy was happening
18         who was who.       What they did was to give people numbers,
19         then eventually when people           were identified then   they did
20         then by the number.      Do you       know what the number was in
21         the case of Kevin?
22   MRS. TRAYNOR:      57.
23   MS.   ADLINGTON:     I think, sir, if I can assist Mrs. Traynor,
24         the Traynor family, the grief was compounded by the fact
25         that when|________ |and John, two relatives who went to
26         identify Kev in 's body in the temporary mortuary that
27         evening, they in fact wheeled out the wrong body at that
28         stage.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        They what?
30   MS.   ADLINGTON:     They wheeled out the wrong body for
31         identification purposes at that stage.
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Is there any doubt that the body
33         was properly identified eventually?
34                      Yes.
35   MRS. TRAYNOR:      My daughter and son identified them.
36                      We'd identified Christopher first and then the


                                             5
 1          next body they brought was meant to be Kevin but it was a
 2          gentleman who was a lot older, which I now believe to be
 3          Mr. Ray Chapman after seeing his photograph.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       You think you may have identified
 5          the wrong body.
 6                     I said there and then that wasn't the body, this
 7          gentleman was a lot older than my brother and then they
 8          took that body away and then brought Kevin's body, by
 9          which time I was too distraught and my brother took over.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       You did not identify the second
11          body that was brought forward, is that right?
12                     No, I--
13   LORD JUSTICE     STUART-SMITH: No, not you----
14   MR.    TRAYNOR JUNIOR:    Yes, sir.
15   LORD JUSTICE     STUART-SMITH: You did identify?
16   MR.    TRAYNOR JUNIOR:    Yes, sir.
17   LORD JUSTICE     STUART-SMITH: You are not in anydoubt about
18          that?
19   MR.    TRAYNOR JUNIOR:    No doubt whatsoever.
20   LORD JUSTICE     STUART-SMITH: Do you know what number     it was now
21          or not?
22   MR.    TRAYNOR JUNIOR:    I get mixed up, I know one is 57, one is
23          60.
24   MR.     TRAYNOR SENIOR:     One was 60 and one was 57.
25   LORD    JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    I must say I think it isfairly
26          unlikely that they would have confused and done a post
27          mortem on somebody different because it would not tie up
28          with all the other ones.       I will try and look into this.
29   MR.    TRAYNOR SENIOR:    The alcohol levels are different
30          according to their pos.t mortems.     The alcohol in our two
31          sons, according to the alcohol levels the youngest lad
32          Kevin, who was 16, he had a lot more alcohol than
33          Christopher who was 2 6 years of age.
34   MRS.    TRAYNOR: It was     only slight though that one.
35   MR.     TRAYNOR SENIOR:     It doesn't matter, it was still   the wrong
36          alcohol levels.


                                           6
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I follow your concerns about that,
2          I will try and find        out what happened about that. The
3          difficulty, as I am        sure you will appreciate that looking
4          into these matters now, eight years afterwards, bearing in
5          mind the confusion that there was at the time is not
 6         particularly easy to sort these things out, but obviously
 7         as I know what your        concerns are I will try and do so.
 8         Is that what you want to say        about Kevin?
 9   MRS. TRAYNOR:        I have requested the VRM2 regarding Kevin.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        This is the film.
11   MRS. TRAYNOR:        In the gymnasium, this was several weeks ago and
12         then when I phoned them up last week, Mr. Ken Greenway, he
13         said, he promised he would send it to me and then last
14         week when he phoned up he said,       "There are other people on
15         that photograph, so we'll have to take them off and we
16         will send it."        I am still waiting on that.
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Do .you really want to see that?
18   MRS. TRAYNOR:        Yes.
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I mean I have seen that video
20         footage.       I don't think you will actually
21   MRS. TRAYNOR:        I only want to see the one to make sure it is
22         him, I just want to satisfy myself.
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I am not sure that you will be able
24         to see that from it.
25   MR.   BONE:        I think what Mrs. Traynor wants is just a still
26         from the video.
27   MRS. TRAYNOR:        All I want is a still, I don't want to see the
28         v id e o .
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Is that on the body file?
30   MS.   ADLINGTON:        Just an identification photograph.     In the
31         early days they were actually releasing full body files
32         which were quite helpful in terms of the West Midlands
33         police summary of evidence at the front of the file which
34         indicated the page numbers, the different witness
35         statements, and, clearly, you knew you had a complete
36         file.        I have had complete files but there are no video


                                           7
 1         stills from the temporary mortuary on those files.
 2   MR.   TRAYNOR:      Nobody has been able to identify Kevin on the
 3         video or on the photographs.        We haven't when we viewed
 4         the videos and we've viewed them several times,        I'd say I
 5         viewed them personally about 10 to 12 times trying to find
 6         him, we haven't been able to find him.        But there is
 7         nothing at all on Kevin, not even a photograph.         That is
 8         why I want to see if that's him.         P.C. Turner says he
 9         can't identify himself but he can identify himself on that
10         one in the mortuary and that's the only one, there is no
11         other one at all.
12   MR.   BONE:       Have you been able to pick out your other son,
13         Christopher, on the videos?
14   MRS. TRAYNOR:        Only on one photograph,   I haven't been able to
15         pick him out on a video yet.        We have been looking for
16         eight and a half years now.
17   MR.   BONE:       Obviously Kevin was not there, near him?
18   MRS. TRAYNOR:        They went in together so I should imagine they
19         must have been together.
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I will look at the body files to
21         see if these photographs help at all.         The problem is,
22         something that I said this morning, that obviously in some
23         cases the history and the sequence is much better
24         documented than in others and this is, I am afraid, just
25         the way it is.       Because of the confusion, and so on, in
26         some cases there is very little, in other cases there is a
27         great deal.
28                 I        do not think at this length of time we are going to
29         find anything more other than possibly if there is any
30         more on files.       I have got the point about PC Howell.      Is
31         there anything else?
32   MRS. TRAYNOR:        We have very little on Kevin and then we come
33         across Louise's statement regarding him.         I think that's
34         all on Kevin.
35   MR.   TRAYNOR:      (Junior)   They were placed in different places.
36   MRS. TRAYNOR:        In PC Turner's statement he stated that he


                                           8
1          pulled Kevin out from pen 3, from the gate just to the
2          left of the gate.       But when he put thesticker   on   the map
3          it's further back from the pen.
4    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Sticker on the map?
5    MRS. TRAYNOR:      Yes, he   put it in a different place towhere      he
 6         said he picked him up from.
 7   MR.   BONE:    This map is a diagram of the terrace?
 8   MR.   TRAYNOR:   (Senior)    Pen 3, yes.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       That is a slight discrepancy.      What
10         is the difference?
11   MRS. TRAYNOR:      He was just inside the gate to the left, that's
12         where he picked him up from but he puts him further back
13         by where the barrier w a s .
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       The barrier that collapsed?
15   MRS. TRAYNOR:      Yes.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       We are talking about 10 feet.       That
17         may or may not be significant.
18   MR.   TRAYNOR:   (Senior)    He's says on the left but the barrier's
19         on the right.
20   MRS. TRAYNOR:      It was on the right of the barrier looking from
21         the pitch.
22   MR.   BONE:    That discrepancy is something we can look at very
23         easily and see whether in the Scrutiny it is significant.
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Just going to pick up one point on
25         your letter, if I may, you say,      "Not one person or body
26         has been held accountable for the Hillsborough tragedy”,
27         that the inquest was farcical, and so on.
28                 It is quite right that nobody has been prosecuted for
29         manslaughter.       I tried to explain this morning that when
30         prosecutions for manslaughter are .considered you have to
31         look at the individual responsibility of a particular
32         person and you cannot lump together the failings of the
33         police or the Club or whatever it may be.        So that is a
34         problem so far as prosecution is concerned.
35                 So far as the inquests are concerned I absolutely
36         understand that you were disappointed, as everybody else


                                          9
 1       was, that there was not a verdict of unlawful killing and
2        one of the things that I am looking at is whether or not
 3       there is any fresh evidence which might affect that
4        verdict of accidental death.
5             To say that nobody has been held accountable is not
 6       really, if I may say so, correct.     I would not want you to
 7       go away with the impression that it was correct because
 8       Lord Justice Taylor made it quite clear who was
 9       accountable for this tragedy.     I do not know whether you
10       read the report, I expect you probably did, but he made it
11       clear in no uncertain terms that the police were largely
12       responsible and that the Club and Sheffield Council bore
13       some responsibility as well.
14            It is one of the difficulties about the whole thing
15       and one of the things that makes the prosecution so
16       difficult is that there were complex causes of what went
17       wrong.    So there is no doubt that Lord Justice Taylor in
18       the Inquiry which was designed to find who was accountable
19       did so.
20            Equally, as I tried point out this morning, the fact
21       that there has been no formal admission of liability is,
22       to anybody who really knows anything about it, actually
23       neither here nor there.     The fact is that police have paid
24       on a full liability basis, so they have been held
25       accountable in civil proceedings for what went wrong.
26            There just is a significant difference between civil
27       negligence and criminal negligence.      I am sure you do
28       understand that but if you do not I am       sure Ms. Adlington
29       will explain it to you.     I do not know    that I can put it
30       any more clearly than that but to say that nobody has been
31       held accountable is only correct in the sense that nobody
32       has been convicted of a criminal offence.       In that sense,
33       of course, that is right.
34   MRS. TRAYNOR:   That's what I mean really.      We were told by a
35       senior officer in the West Midlands police that with all
36       the evidence that they had there would       definitely be


                                      10
 1         prosecutions and he is a detective and I took his word for
 2         it.
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     It was not his decision,   I am
 4         afraid.
 5   MR.   TRAYNOR:   He told us that twice actually, he told us at
 6         home, in our house.
 7   MRS. TRAYNOR:    When he was in our house, when he came to see us
 8         and he said there definitely would be prosecutions with
 9         evidence they had.    I'm wondering now how much evidence
10         goes to the DPP and was any of it suppressed.
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     The evidence that went to the DPP
12         was the evidence which was before Lord Taylor.
13   MRS. TRAYNOR:    If all the evidence did go to —    that they
14         collected all the evidence to go to the DPP.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I can look into that but I am
16         pretty certain it did.
17   MRS. TRAYNOR:    I was very upset over that and also I was upset
18         that Mr. Duckenfield and Mr. Murray were able to retire,
19         which was brought up this morning, because I had a
20         conversation with the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire,
21         Richard Wells, after Duckenfield had retired and I asked
22         him what would happen to Mr. Murray and he said to me,      "I
23         can assure you, Mrs. Traynor, that Mr. Murray will face
24         disciplinary charges", and about a week later it was
25         announced that he was retiring.    He must have known at
26         that time that he was going and yet he told me a blatant
27         lie on the telephone that he would definitely face
28         disciplinary action on his own.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     It is unfortunate that Mr. Wells
30         ,should say that because it was not his decision, it was
31         the Police Complaints Authority's decision.
32   MRS. TRAYNOR:    I thought it had to go through the Chief
33         Constable, he had to send his resignation to him.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     His resignation, yes.   But the
35         reason why Mr. Murray was not subject to Police Complaints
36         Authority was that the Police Complaints Authority took


                                       11
 1          the view that it was unfair to take proceedings against
 2          Mr. Murray when he was the junior of the two officers and
 3          when their cases should have been looked at jointly.
 4          Whether or not you agree with that or whether or not I
 5          agree with that that is the decision that was taken.        It
 6          was the subsequent to that that Mr. Murray retired.
 7   MRS. TRAYNOR:       Why didn't Mr. Wells be honest with me and tell
 8          me that    instead of trying to fob me off that he would?
 9   LORD   JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I do not know, I am sorry.
10   MRS. TRAYNOR:       I think for a Chief Constable,   I thought that
11          was bad really for a Chief Constable to tell a lie like
12          that.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       If he did say that it was not a
14          sensible thing to say because, as I pointed out, it is not
15          his decision.     Is there anything else that you would like
16          to say?
17   MR.    TRAYNOR SENIOR:     To a certain extent as regards Kevin,      not
18          about this thing the wife's got, but in 1988 him and Kevin
19          and Paul, another of our sons, they went to the same match
20          in 1988 and when they got their tickets, I think the wife
21          went over here to Liverpool and got the tickets for this
22          1989 match.     Paul was working so he couldn't go and them
23          two lads went.     Kevin said to me:   "Not Leppings Lane
24          again, dad, after last year we got crushed."       They're my
25          son's own words to me.     "Not Leppings Lane again, we got
26          crushed last year."     This year he got crushed and never
27          came back.
28                  That says something to me about either Sheffield
29          Wednesday or the police or the F.A. for that matter for
30          allowing that end —     why didn't they put the,match at
31          Manchester knowing they had trouble the year before
32          getting crushed.     They crushed that first year in 1988 and
33          as a matter of fact it was brought up this morning at the
34          meeting, at lunch time someone brought it up, I think it
35          was Les Jones said the same thing about 1988, getting
36          crushed.


                                         12
 1                 They're the words my own son said:   "Not again, dad,
 2         not Leppings Lane again, dad."      This time he never came
 3         back.     It's obvious to me in my own opinion I blame the
 4         F.A. and the police and Sheffield Wednesday.      I blame all
 5         three.     That match could have been delayed when they saw
 6         the crush outside.     The Secretary of the F.A. was there,
 7         he could have turned round and said:      Right, delay that
 8         match by a quarter of an hour, by half an hour for that
 9         matter, but they never and all those people died, 96
10         people died.     There was no need for any person to die
11         whatsoever.     I blame all three, not one individual.      I
12         blame the police, the F.A. and Sheffield Wednesday for not
13         delaying or changing ends or another venue.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I think I said this morning that
15         one of the questions I was going to look into was to what
16         extent Sheffield Wednesday contributed to the settlement.
17         I do not believe that the F.A. were ever a party to the
18         proceedings.
19   MR.   BONE:     No, they were not.
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      .The criticism of the choice of
21         ground was investigated by Lord Taylor and he had some
22         observations to make about that.     But, as I say, the club
23         I think were definitely in part responsible and that is
24         what Lord Taylor said and that has been borne out I think
25         by the fact that they have contributed to the settlement.
26         I do not know how much they contributed.      I am actually
27         quite interested to find out how much they did contribute.
28
29   MR.   TRAYNOR SENIOR:     Paul said, as I said he didn't go this
30         year, he said when they went in 1988 they had stewards
31         across the gate into pens 3 and 4.      This year according to
32         the videos they didn't have one steward there to direct
33         them to pens 1, 2 and 5.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      For what it is worth I agree with
35         you that the Club were quite seriously at fault.      The
36         Leppings Lane end and the turnstiles were quite inadequate


                                          13
 1         to deal with a crowd like t h i s .   This was bound to happen
 2         sooner or later it seems tome.        Is there anything else you
 3         want to say?
 4   MRS. TRAYNOR:      Yes, there is something else on Christopher
 5         actually.     At the mini-inquest we were told that
 6         Christopher was taken into the gymnasium at 3.15, that was
 7         in the oral evidence and in the visual evidence he was
 8         identified on the pitch at 3.34.       Now neither the Coroner,
 9         our legal representative or the police noticed that
10         discrepancy,    I had to point it out to them.
11   MR.   TRAYNOR SENIOR:     That's the mini-inquest.
12   MRS. TRAYNOR:      Yes, I said the mini-inquest and Doug Frazer
13         when he pointed it out to them and said: this not a
14         criticism from the Traynor family and Mr. Popper turned
15         round and said:     "If I thought it was a criticism I would
16         not pursue it."
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Would not what?
18   MRS. TRAYNOR:      "If I though this was a criticism I would not
19         pursue it."     I didn't think that was a very nice thing to
20         say and that is in the transcript.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Did he pursue it?
22   MRS. TRAYNOR:      He was supposed to but the only explanation I
23         got was that it was a legal document and they couldn't
24         alter it.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      That is something that I will look
26         at on the file.
27   MS.   ADLINGTON:     There is an addendum to that effect, which
28         referred to the relevant part of the transcript at the
29         mini-inquest.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Is this an addendum--
31   MS.   ADLINGTON:     That is the exchange of conversation which
32         took place with Mr. Frazer and the Coroner over that
33         particular issue.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Which day is this?
35   MRS. TRAYNOR:      I think it was some day in March, was it?     I
36         think was 27th March.


                                        14
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      We can probably identify this.
 2         Thank you.
 3   MS.   ADLINGTON:     It was 27th April.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Thank you very much.     Is there
 5         anything you want to say, Ms. Adlington on this?
 6   MS.   ADLINGTON:     On one of the more general points, sir, on the
 7         issue of the inquiry conducted of the D.P.P.       This is a
 8         commonly held concern of all families, the fact that the
 9         families were not presented with the evidence which went
10         to the D.P.P.
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      They never would be.
12   MS.   ADLINGTON:     They are not aware of what the D.P.P. -- and
13         they strongly held the suspicion that not all the evidence
14         was presented to the D.P.P.       That is a general point that
15         is felt by a lot of the families.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      What--
17   MS.   ADLINGTON:      There's no disclosure obviously.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      This is just a suspicion based on
19         the fact of how else could the D.P.P. not prosecute?
20   MS.   ADLINGTON:     In view of the conversations which most
21         families had with West Midlands Police officers where they
22         were apparently re-assured constantly there would be
23         prosecutions.     I accept the decision would not be the
24         decision of the West Midlands Police but they certainly-
25         led families to believe there would be prosecutions.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      What I can tell you is that I have
27         read the joint opinion to leading counsel on the question
28         of prosecution and so I know the reasons which were given
29         for not doing it.     There is no reason to suppose that they
30         did not have access to all the evidence that was before
31         Lord Taylor.     As has been pointed out to me, everybody
32         seems to be content with Lord Taylor's investigation.          The
33         fact of the matter is that the D.P.P. came to the
34         conclusion on the basis that they usually do, namely, that
35         there is less than a 50 per cent chance of a successful
36         prosecution.


                                        15
     1              Whether I think that is right or wrong is not
     2         actually material.     I have got to see whether there is
     3         fresh evidence which might affect that decision.
     4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Is there anything else that anybody
     5         wants to say?
     6                      Just the lack of co-ordination, like Louise had
     7         the statement referring to Kevin but you d i d n 't know
     8         anything about, if we hadn't have had a conversation with
     9         Louise w e 'd have not been aware when he said:     "Are you
    10         the Traynor family, I've got something in my statement
    11         about my brother referring to one of your brothers."        I
    12         mean the West Midlands Police didn't, even when they
    13         investigated afterwards, didn't pick up all of these
    14         things and they weren't all put together.       I feel as
    15         though we were let down by them as well.
    16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      What is this?
    17   MS.   ADLINGTON:      That is the Howell statement.
    18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Thank you very much indeed.

Throughout               my    presence        in. the        a r ea,         f ans    were          a r r i v i n g in a g o o d

natured,            orderly           fashion,       and      without            a r r e s t . All     turnstiles                  in the

car    p ark        had       been     allocated          to N o t t i n g h a m         Forest        supporters.

About      1430          hours,        as    the    result          of a       radio        m essage        together          with

which      had        been allocated                to L i v e r p o o l         supporters.

Upon     arrival              I saw        large    numbers          of       fans     running         through          an    e xi t     gate

into     the        ground.            I formed         the       opinion           t hat    I p js S " g a te    had       been     forced

by    supporters               in a n       effort      to     gain       e a s y y ttc cess.          In    view       of    this       1

used     the        horse        to    stem    the      flow        of    f an s      and    shouted         to       nearby       f oo t

It was         t h e n n e ce ssary           to    use      t h e hpr s e i n a n e f f o r t t o r e d u c e                     the

subsequent               congestion.               Mounted/officers                    present         slowly          moved       back

the    fans,          towards          Leppings         Lam e .          At    t his     poin t      I could           see    that

there     was         severe          compression            of     people          q u e u e :i.v>g at     the       turnstiles,

attempted             to      use     the    horse      to    e as e      the       crusJi but         as    people          parted          I

found     my way              blocked        by a, hor.izont^^/tfar^ at w a i s t                         height.            T his

served         to     exacerbate             the    situation             by     restricing            any       lateral       movement

of    people          in a       congested          situation.                 I shouted          at      people        at    the      rear

to    ease       off,         but     my    directions            were        ignored        or a n s w e r e d        with    abu se.

In v i e w       of      the     non-cooperation,                   I was        obliged again               to       use    the     horse

together            with       o/Cher M o u n t e d       officers             to     try and        reduce           the    pushing

and    r e s u l t a n t /crush.              As   we     continued              this       process,         I could          see      that

the    crowd was®in                   angry    and      very a g i t a t e d           st ate ,      it w a s ^ . p o s s i b l e           to

slower         than        one      would     expect         in a n al l            ticket       game.           At    one    poi nt        a

               MUTUAL AID, SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE
  Subject:-
  ______           LIVERPOOL v NOTTINGHAM FOREST



       I have to report that on Saturday, 15th April, 1989,
  I was part of the Merseyside Mounted Department which was
  sent as Mutual Aid to assist South Yorkshire Police.


       At 1200 hours on Saturday, 15th April, 1989, I was
  deployed by Inspector Hand-Davies of the South Yorkshire
  Mounted Department, to patrol the area of the Directors
  car park at Sheffield Wednesdays ground Hillsborough Park;
  the occasion being the F.A. Cup semi-final, Liverpool v
  Nottingham Forest.  The other mounted officers in this
  area were Constables 3920 Evans, 4886 Nareyvand Constable
  2613 Lindsey of the South Yorkshire Police.


       I accompanied Constable Evans In half section and we
  patrolled the car park. This area had been allocated to
  Nottingham Forest supporters, although there were sone
  Liverpool fans amongst the crowd who were waiting for the
  team coach to arrive. These fans were very well behaved.


         At 14.10 hours the Liverpool team arrived by coach,
  myself and Constable Evans positioned our horses near to
  the players entrance, so as to keep the fans away from the
  doorway, to allow the teams free access. After they had
  alighted, the coach moved away, Constable Evans and 1 also
  moved away from the players entrance.

         At 14.20 hours the Nottingham Forest team coach
   arrived. Once again Constable Evans and I positioned
   ourselves by the players entrance in front of the coach.

                            -   2   -


       Throughout my presence in the area,   fans were
arriving in a good natured,orderly fashi'on, and without
arrest.   All   turnstiles in the car park had been allocate<
to Nottingham Forest supporters.


   — About 14.30 hrs, as the result of a radio message
together with Constable 4365 Edge, I went to the Leppings
Lane end turnstiles, which had been allocated to Liverpoo
supporters.

     Upon arrival I saw large numbers of fans running
through an exit gate into the ground. I formed the
opinion that this gate had been forced by supporters in a
effort to gain easy access. In view of this I used the
horse to stem the flow of fans and shouted to nearby foot
officers, who in answer to my request, eventually secured
the gate.  It was then necessary to use the horse in an
effort to reduce the subsequent congestion. Mounted
Officers present slowly moved back the fans, towards
Leppings Lane. At this point I could see that there was
severe compression of people queuing at the turnstiles;
attempted to use the horse to ease the crush, but as
people parted I found my way blocked by a hori2ontal bar
at waist height. This served to exacerbate the situation
by restricting any lateral movement of people in a
congested situation. I shouted at people at the rear to
ease off, but my directions were ignored or answered with
abuse. In view of the non-cooperation, I was obliged
again to use the horse together with other mounted
 officers to try and reduce the pushing and resultant   p
 crush. As we continued this process, 1 could see that £h
 crowd was in angry and very agitated state, It was     J|
 impossible to gain any cooperation. Entry via the       ;|
 turnstiles was significantly slower than one would exp#§|
 in an all ticket game. At one point a small boy of ftbBjjil
 4 years was passed to me from the crowd and I was able
 pass to safety near the rear of ther crowd, he was
 obviously terrified and in a distressed state.

              SIR JOHN WHEELER MP'S FOOTBALL (OFFENCES) BILL
                  't
              You and copy recipients will be aware that Sir John Wheeler
              presented a Bill yesterday which seeks "to define offences and
              prescribe penalties in respect of certain conduct at football
              matches; and for connected purposes."  Sir John has nominated
              Friday 15 February for the Bill's Second Reading.

              It is unlikely that the Bill will be debated on 15 February
              but Members can attempt to carry Bills unopposed at the end of
              Private Members Business.  Assuming that we would wish the
              Bill to be blocked at Second Reading, a letter recording this
              view should be sent from the Home Secretary to the Chairman of
              Legislation Committee (John MacGregor), copied to other
              members of LG, and any other Minister with an interest,
              First Parliamentary Counsel, and the Secretaries to
              LG Committee.  If on the other hand we propose to support or
              be neutral towards the Bill it would be necessary for the
              matter to be considered by HS Committee.  This could be
              achieved by means of a letter from the Home Secretary to the
              Lord Privy Seal (Lord Waddington). To save time and avoid the
              Bill having to be taken as a separate item of business by
              LG Committee, any letter to members of HS should be copied to
              members of LG.

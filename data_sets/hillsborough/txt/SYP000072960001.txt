 We    were       dropped           by     the    coach          somewhere               in the         town    centre          and       then

 I had         free     passage            along       the       t u n ne l.         At     the     e nd of         the       tunnel        I went

 straight            ahead       towards          the      fr ont,         gradually               pushing          my way          through             the

 I am      unable        to      say w h e t h e r         I w as         in    pen 3 ary

 I think          it w a s       about       3    pm       ( 1 5 0 0 hrs)           at tj/is        point.

      ssisted           in    passing           the m a n       towards            the      f r o n t , he        then went           to     the

    I could           see     t hat       his     f a c e w as        blue        in c o l o u r      but      in      the p a nic          that

    followed            I c a n no t         describe           him any            further.

    remember            t h at     I fell         onto       the      concrete           and was            under         the     barrier.

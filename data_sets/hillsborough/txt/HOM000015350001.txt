 Dear Mr Whitcomb

 HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER : FILM VIDEO COVERAGE

^ u e Mitchell of the Home Office spoke with you earlier today about ITN's coverage
  of the Hillsborough disaster, and asked if all ITN's footage taken last Saturday
  could be retained in view of its potential value to the public inquiry.

 I understand that the BBC in fa-t had exclusive rights to filming the match and will
 have all the film shot inside the g r o u n d . Any footage taken by ITN outside the
 ground and any footage subsequently obtained by ITN of events inside the ground may
 also be of value and it would be appreciated if this too could be retained until
 the inquiry has reported and the subsequent issues resolved.       This would include
 footage which may not have been transmitted.

 As you may know, the Home Secretary made a statement to the House of Commons on
 17 April about the disaster, 'during which the question oi" the film footage and of
 any photographs taken being made available to the public inquiry was raised.    I enclose
 a copy of the relevant extract from Hansard which you may be interested to see.

                                                             Yours

      Dear Sir

     Hillsborough

      I have recently received a letter from Mr Jones the Assistant
      Chief Constable conducting this investigation.  I enclose a
      copy of this letter and should be grateful if you could place
      it before Mr Williams and Mr Birts for their attention.  It is
      possible that they have already received a copy of this letter
      direct from Mr Jones.

      If it appears that there are any difficulties in so far as
      Counsel being able to attend the meeting on 12 April I should
      be grateful if you would contact me.  I have timed this
      meeting for 4.30 pm although I understand that if Mr Williams
      commitments in court change that the meeting can be brought
      forward at reasonably short notice to 10 am on that day.

      Yours faithfully




      M G Kennedy
      Police Complaints Division

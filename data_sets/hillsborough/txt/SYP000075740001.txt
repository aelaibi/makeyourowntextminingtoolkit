  of    the     Liverpool            fans       was       good,       and although                 fans         were     drinking          in

  local       pubs       I saw       no    evidence             of     ba d     behaviour.

  I saw       quite       a    number          of P o l i c e        en    r o ut e       and     I saw         various        people

  asking        for      directions             to    the       ground and                the     Police          were      directing

  people        without         any       resemblance                of    or de r .         I saw        one      Policeman          on a

  pushing          and    get       back.         Eventually               out       of     pure       frustration             he    withdrew.

  I was       by    now       getting          nearer        to      the      turnstiles               and      the     pressure          was

j^eft the       g r o u n d a nd jxt&X m y            friends             at     the     car        a n d we      came      home.

During       the     incident            I sustained               bruising            to m y         back      and my         k n e e s _____




I believe           the      Police       response            to      the      tragic         events           w a s at     first       poor

in t h a t     they appeared                 slow     to      re act        to    t he       situation.                  But     once      they

did    get     involved            and    I believe              t ha t     on the w h o l e              they       did    their       best.

I saw     no    evidence            of    drinking            inside           the     stadium            or    bad      behaviour.                 I

believe        t ha t     lessons         should          have        been       learned            from       the      year     before's

Cup    Semi     Final        while        I understand                 from       others            were       almost       as      bad.        I

also     believe          t h at    the      attempts            at    crowd          control            outside         the     g r o u n d w as

poo r.

I also       believe          t h at     supporters              should          have        been made            aware        of    the

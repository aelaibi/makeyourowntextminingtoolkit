                 Further to the questionnaire          I have       completed concerning the tragedy

                 at Hi 1lsborough on Saturday 15th April               1989,     I would    add the

                  f ollow ing .

                  I am aware that the brothers,         Ni cholas and Car 1 Hewitt died in the

                  disaster.       I knew neither   of them well      but they were         regular traveller

                  with the Heart of England Supporters Club and I knew them both well

                 enough to pass pleasantries with. On t he day of the tragedy they were

                  both seated behind me on the coach.

                 When I alighted from the coach in Sheffield that was the last time                          I

                  saw either of them.

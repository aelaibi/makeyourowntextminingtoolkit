               I am Trevor Higgins,
               _______ —m; __________t■


               lentil July 1988                  (000788)   I was a Police                Sergeant   in the South

               Yorkshire Police stationed at                        Wombwell, of Barnsley Division.
                      ••••   .   ' _.y   ' -                   -


               ,0n Saturday 9 April                   1988 (090488)      I was detailed to supervise a

                erial of constables                   performing duty at Hillsborough Football

               Stadium.                   The two football    teams taking               part were Liverpool ani

               Nottingham Forest.

               The serial was delegated duty at the rear of the West S#and and in

               particular to control                   fans entering          pens 3 and 4, tnat          is the centre

               pens of the stand.

               During the game and because of the amount of fans within/pens 3 and

               4,   I received instructions to                      close the gates to t h e entrance and

               thereafter direct fans to the                        two outer pens of the stand.                 I cannot

               recall where the                   instruction came from.                  Under normal   circumstances

               instruction came from a Serial                      Inspector or via radio from control.

               I cannot say from which the instruction came.

               Bearing              in mind the time        lapse and having attended several matches at

               Hillsborough,                   it is difficult to relate detail                 regarding this

           Further to my statements dated S . 6.89 and 10.7.89,       relating to Crowd

           Control    duties at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club on 9.4.88? as

           previously mentioned in these statements whilst performing my duties

           at the Leppings Lane end of the ground,       I received instructions to

           close the gate of the tunnel which led to the central         pen of the

           terrace, and as previously stated it was a police instruction,          but I

           could not remember whether       it was via control or directly from a

           serial    inspector.     There were definately no S.W.F.C Stewards in the

           immediate area at the location where       I was performing my duty.

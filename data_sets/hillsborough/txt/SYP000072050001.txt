             I am a single man and live at the above address with my parents.

             On Saturday April        15th 1989    (1504^)     I went to Hillsborough,

             Sheffield,        to watch my team    L i vj ^ p o o l play Nottingham Forest in the

             F.A.   cup semi final match,

             I travelled to the ground on a normal scheduled t r a i n ^ rom Preston

             Station the Police        put us onto special buses to^Take us to the ground,

             we had to pay a pound for this which incldfclecythe return bus journey

             to the station.

name of it but I remember walking through a park to get there.               There

was a lot of Liverpool fans drinking        in the pub, so much so that the

Landlord closed the doors.       He was letting people out,     but   not

allowing anyone else J tn .    I didn't see anyone drinking in the streets,

We arrived at the ^entrance to the tjround at about g.QQpm (14Q0)

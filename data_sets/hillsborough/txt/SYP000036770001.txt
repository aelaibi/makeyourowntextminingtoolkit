      Dear Sirs

      FRANCIS JOSEPH McALLISTER - DECEASED

      I acknowledge reciept of your letter of 31 July 1989, concerning Mr McAllister
      who died as a result of injuries sustained in the Hillsborough Football Stadium
      Disaster on 15 April 1989.

      In   reply I would advise you, Mr McAllister’s death as with all the other deaths
      at   Hillsborough is still under active enquiry by the West Midlands Police acting
      on   behalf of Dr S Popper, H M Coroner for South Yorkshire (West District) to whom
      we   will be reporting in due course.

      Any request for information should therefore be directed to Dr Popper at the
      Medico Legal Centre, Watery Street, Sheffield, S3 7ET, although it must be said,
      it probably will not be available until after the conclusion of the inquest which
      is due to commence on 15 January 1990.

      Your9\ faithfully

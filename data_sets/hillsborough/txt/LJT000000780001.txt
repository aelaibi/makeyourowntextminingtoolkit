      FOOTBALL LICENSING AUTHORITY - APPOINTMENT OF CHAIRMAN


 The Home Secretary, the Rt Hon David Waddington QC MP announced
 today that Mr Norman Jacobs is to be appointed as the first
 Chairman of the Football Licensing Authority.

 Mr Jacobs, aged 59, who has recently retired from practice as a
 solicitor   with Messrs   Slaughter  and May,   has   had  a long
 association with sport.    He is a steward of the British Boxing
 Board of Control, was concerned with the setting up of the Sports
 Aid Trust, is a Member of the International Bar Association's
 Committee on Sports Law, and a Member of the Sports Council.    He
 is currently undertaking an enquiry for the British Amateur
 Weightlifting Association into drugs and weightlifting.   He has a
 keen and wide ranging interest in all sports, is a member of the
 MCC and has had many connections with football both as a lawyer
 and as a spectator. He was educated at Christ's Hospital and
 Exeter College, Oxford and is married with four children.

 The Football Licensing Authority     (FLA)  is established under
 Section 8 of the Football Spectators Act 1989, and the statutory
 provisions enabling the appointment of the Chairman and Members of
 the Authority came into force on 1 June.

 The main responsibilities of the FLA will be to operate a
 licensing scheme for grounds at which 'designated matches' (see
 note below) are played; advise the Government on the introduction
 of all-seated accommodation at football league grounds and the
 national stadia; and keep under review the local authorities'
 exercise of their safety functions under the Safety of Sports
 Grounds 1975 at sports grounds at which designated matches are
 played.

 The other Members of the Authority (a maximum of 8) and permanent
 staff will be appointed as soon as possible.

 The location of the permanent offices for the FLA has yet to be
 determined.   In the meantime, correspondence to Mr Jacobs and
 other enquiries about the FLA should be addressed to:

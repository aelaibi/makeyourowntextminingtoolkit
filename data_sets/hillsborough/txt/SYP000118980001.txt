                   INCIDENT AT HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND,                            SHEFFIELD ON

                  S A T UR DA Y, 15TH APRIL               1989.



                  With reference to recent correspondence I am submitting the self

                  written account of my actions                       1S.04.89.

                  ’1.                 I came on duty that day at 0830 am.

                  S.                  I was responsible           to PS Hodgett of E l .

                  3.                  I was deployed to tunstiles on the South                        Stand, along     with

                                      other officers.             The intention was to take over             supervision

                                      of the w h o 1eSouth Stand a r e a after               15O 0 h r s .   This,    ho w e v e r ,

                                      did not take          place.     Once it became clear what             had happened

                                      1 made my way to the pitch itself                    in order to assist free

                                      movement of emergency vehicles and personnel.                          Further to

                                      this    I joined the line of officers forming a cordon along

                                      the centre of the pitch because at one stage a clash between

                                      fans appeared likely.               Once the match had been cancelled I

                                      was directed to Penistone Road to assist traffic direction.

                  4.                  At the time of the           incident      I saw many confused          and angry

                                      people,     mostly Liverpool           supporters.         Their anger was

                                      directed at the Police and some were being verbally abusive.

                                                                                                                ftn *

                                                                                 RE59

                   Some were      clearly drunk -

    5.             In response to this 1 tried to help these people as best

                   I could and to calm them down.

    6.             The mood of the Liverpool        fans was very angry and upset.

                   Many were very aggressive.

    7.             I did not see any stewards inside the ground that I can

                   re me mbe r.

    8.             I was not equipped with a personal        radio and therefore   I

                   cannot   comment on any breakdown in transmissions.

    9.             At no time did I handle any dead bodies.

    10.            Once   I realised what had happened,      I was very upset.     I wa

                   also worried that the Liverpool        fans would start fighting

                   as their behaviour was very aggressive.

     It was      clear to me that some Liverpool       supporters   were also very

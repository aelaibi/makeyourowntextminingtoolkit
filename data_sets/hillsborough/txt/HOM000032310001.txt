Dear Mr Pyne

Re: Hillsborough Family S upport G roup

I have        a      copy of your letter of the 7th May last to the above, andInoteit’
contents. I would, however, seek clarification on the following points:

       1) Has all the material placed in the House of Commons library been copied
          also to the Hillsborough Family Support Group?

       2) Is this all of the material considered by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith,
          including transcripts of meetings of him with witnesses, and/or members
          of his staff, with witnesses?

       3) Can you itemise which pieces of material have not been lodged in the
          HOC library, and the reasons for their omission?

       4) Can you itemise that material awaiting the confirmation of agreement
          to disclosure by interested parties?

Your assistance in these matters would be greatly appreciated.

Yours sincerely

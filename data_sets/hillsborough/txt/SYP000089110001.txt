           Hillsborough for briefing             in connection with semi final Liverpool and

                                                                NiyO$
                                information from POL DS CHA RL ES WO RT H,           I collected a

           pe rsonal       radio,    transit van keys and pack lunches from the gymnasium,
                                                                                 PAGE     2

I then returned to the North Stand where I was further i»riefed by my
                             f\f(ptyfata
Serial       Inspector, POL INS WALLACE.         Our duties were s-

Fhase    1    -   Patrol Hi 11sborough/Langsett Rd paying s pecial at te nti on

                  to licensed premises.

Phase £       -   After meal at 3.15 pm (1515),         to patrol as before.

Phase 3       -   Continue   patrol.

I briefed my officers, we consumed our pack lunches and then commenced

patrol at approximately 10.15 am (1015).                The driver of our transit

was POL PC ROWBOTHAM,         I was the front seat passenger and the remainder

of the serial were seated in the rear.



We patrolled Langsett Rd to the Kelvin Flats travelling from

Hillsborough Corner,         returned the same route,       turned left onto Holme

Ln to the one way system and then back along Holme Ln to Langsett Rd,

It was apparent that there were a large number of both Liverpool and

Notts Forest supporters         in the area.       They were   in high spirits but

presented no problems at this stage.



I visited the following public houses              in the course of    our patrols;

1.   Freemasons, Walk ley Ln.          Spoke to    the 1ajid lord,_________ .   He was

only allowing Liverpool         supporters      into his pub, he together with four

 r five barmen were remaining on the door at all times.                  There was no

trouble and he was advised re drinkers standing outside.

2.   ,Queens Ground,     Langsett Rd.         At approximately 1.00 pm (1300)      X

entered these premises.          The pub was absolutely full of both Liverpool

and J>iotts Forest supporters.             Most were   in high spirits but there was

no trouble.        I estimate the pub contained approximately 250 people.                 I

also gave passing attention to George IV, Lanqsett Rd, Buraovne— Arm.g

and Masons.        There were no supporters outside these premises.
                                                                          PAGE     3
                                                                          S 3337

A general    patrol of the area was made but no public order situations

were encountered.



 t approximately 1.15 pm (1315), my transit was directed to an

incident at the Royal Hotel, Fenistone Rd, opposite the dog stadium.

The   landlord had asked the Police to help him clear the pub because

some damage had been caused inside.        Other officers were present and

there were approximately 100 fans outside and the same number inside.

There was no violence although most of the fans seemed in very high

spirits and some were drunk.       I am unable to say which fans were there

but I got the impressioft that they were Notts Forest supporters.



The fans were moved along and the pub emptied.         On the pavement

outside were a large number of bottles avid glasses, many of which were

broken.     Three members of st?ff 4?ere directed to clear up this debris,

which they began                   I was there.    We then resumed patrol.




officers at the Horse and Jockey Public Hse, on Wadsley Ln              I there
           pt 11+20                   :             ....
spoke to PgL PS MILLER and it was decided to close the pub



.Outsijae the pub were approximately gSO^^iverpool fans.         Most




Police.     With POL PS MILLER,   I went   into the pub,   explained by

intentions to the manager, who was in             agreement.



The juke box was turned off and            formed the fans in the pub that
                                                                              PAGE     4
                                                                              S'3337

they had ten minutes      in which to finish their drinks.          The pub

contained approximately      150 Liverpool      fans who had obviously been

drinking most of the day.



Myself and POL PS MILLER       received no animosity and the fans were in

good humour.     These same facts were given to the fans outside the pub

and four members of staff began collecting the bottles and glasses.



By 2.30 pm (1430> the pub was empty and the /ans were escorted by me

and POL PS M I L L E R ’S transit,    down Wadsley Ln towards the ground.         We

had also been joined by two dog handlers,            one of whom was POL PC
NlOfe
TWIGG, a l though they were not deployed.



We then transported a Police Constable with a prisoner from the bottom

of Wadsley Ln to the Police Room.            I do not know details of either

person.    At approximately g.,50 pm (1450) we resumed patrol but due to

very heavy traffic,     remained in M i ddlewood Rd near to Wads ley L n ,

monitoring the traffic and fans.           At this time radio traffic was very

busy.     I heard a request that the match be delayed to allow fans into

the ground.    This   request was refused.        I do not know who requested or

who refused.



I can recall hearing POL SUPT MARSHALL request on,             I think,    four

occasions for the gates into Leppings Ln to be opened to relieve a

crush of fans.     Finally his Request was granted.           At the same time I

heard a Sergeant,
                                       rJ mb
                      I think POL PS HIGGINS,        of 'F' C and V,   request a

further gate to be opened.           This request was also g r a n te d.



We then made our way to Leppings Ln and my officers were d e -b us s ed .

There were hardly any Police in this location and some fans had

started to leave the ground.



I saw several        casualties being given first aid on the left side of

the driveway and approximately 20 dead people on the right hand side

of the driveway.           It was at this point that I realised the enormity of

the problem but d i d n ’t know what had caused it.            A ljne of officers

were jispioyed to stand as a barrier or shield in front of the dead.                     I

deployed my officers to allow access for the ambulances and fire

tenders w hich were now arriving.

The departing fans were growing in numbers and many showed and spoke

hatred to the Police.              They called us murdering bastards and blamed us

for the deaths.          Many had to be restrained by Police and their friends

from attacking Policemen.              However,   some of the fans were

blaming their own supporters.              Because of the hatred I felt and the

build up of fans which were congregating on Leppings Ln,                  I requested

further assistance to control and disperse the crowd.                 At this time I

was unaware of the events             inside the ground.



The ambulances        could not cope with the number of injured so I put four

injured fans in our transit and with POL PC RQMBQTHAM took them to the

hial lams hi re H o s p i ta l .



I returned to Leppings Ln to try and locate the rest of my serial.                      On

my return I saw that barriers and a green sheet had been erected in

front of the dead.



The publi c order s ituat ion had become            calmer and I requested f ur ther

duties.      My transit and serial were deployed a nd we attended a few

minor public order situations but the sheer volume of traffic and

pedestrians impeded our m o b i 1 ity.

          We remained on patrol until 9,00 pm (2100) when we were allowed a meal

          and eventually were stood down at 10.00 pm (2200).



           It w a s n ’t until about 7.30 pm (1930) that I discovered the large

           number of dead and up until that time thought the only casualties

           involved were those at Leppings Ln entrance.

Dear Member

HILLSBOROUGH

I am writing to let you know where the trial has got to. The prosecution case completed
today, and the defence immediately asked the Judge to determine that there was no case
to answer. The Judge declined to do this, which means that the case for defence will now
start next week. Unofficial estimates are that the Jury will consider its verdict sometime
during the week commencing the 17th July. If so, this means that the original estimate of a
six week trial will be exceeded slightly.

We have had a number of press calls and both the Chair and Vice-Chair have been
approached. This was in the belief that the trial might end today. However, we can expect
increasing press interest as we reach the end of the proceedings. I will provide members
with a full briefing over the next couple of weeks in anticipation of that. At this stage I
would advise to be very careful about saying anything which could be mis-interpreted as a
comment on the proceedings.

Yours sincerely




Bill Wilkinson
Clerk and Treasurer

 put    your        arms       down        by y o u r          side?       it w a s       very       crowded          and you          just       had

 to    go w i t h       the        c r o w d as       you       were       pushed         one      way and another.                     By

 three        o'clock          ( 1 5 0 0 hrs)             it w a s        even       more       crowded and            the       terrace          had

 been        filled       by a v e r y           large          number          of     youths       aged        between          seventeen

        twenty-five                 years        who       had       been       drinking           heavily.            These       youths

 were        not    concerned with                    any       other          p eo p l e ?     they     pushed        and       charged

 their        way      down        the     terrace,             knocking             people        out     the    way.           People       could

 not    be m o v e d          very       far     as       it wa s         so    crowded,           but     I saw       these       youths

 launch         themselves               off     the       terrace             steps      into       the    crowd,          forcing          people

 to    give        way.        All       this     wa s         taking          place      at    about       f i ve     to       three

 (1455        hrs)      and        older       people           were       complaining               about       t h is     behaviour             as

 they        had    been       in the          Ground           early and              t o ok     up a v i e w i n g        position.

 I have         been      to       several        stadiums                before        where        there       were       large       c r owds,

 Ground          late     were        very       hostile             to    other        supporters              and    I have          never

drinking?             I was       very      uncomfortable.                      People             were      urinating

everywhere              and      urine      was        running           dow/\ the t e r r a c e a n d d o w n the rear of

the       stand?        I saw      this       l a t er       as       I wA I ked         to    the       g/ym.

As    the       game     started         at      3     pm    ( 15Qtf hrs?,               the       cj^owd s e t t l e d        down and

not       fall     ov e r     because         we      were        crowded           together.

On    looking across                  the     pitch          towards           the       Liverpool              su/porters / n              the,W

a    line       of Pol i c e m e n       took         up a        position across                      the      centre      of    the       pitch.

This       blocked          my    view and             I could           not    see       what         was      happening         at       the    far

end       of    the     pitch.

It m u s t       have       been      ten mi n ut e s             before        I     saw a           person being             carried

across          the     pitch with            his       f ac e        covered         and          a p p e a r e d to   b e/ d e a d , a n d      I

    hat    a serious             situation            existaef at              the       far       end     of    the G r o u n d .          There

On    realising             there       were         people           injured,           we    made        our    way      to a g r o u p         of

at    least        five       minutes         because             of    the     aisles             bearing full          and     the       density

Dear

Thank you for your letter of 23 January to the Minister for Sport
which has been passed to this department in view of our
responsibilities for safety at sports grounds.    I apologise for
the delay in replying to you.

I enclose a brief summary of the Government1s responses to the
recommendations of the Inquiry held by Lord Justice Taylor into
the Hillsborough Stadium disaster.   In addition the Government
are making available £100 million to the Football Trust over a
five year period to assist clubs in carrying out safety
improvements.

The Government has recently introduced new powers under the
Football Spectators Act 1989 to complement the existing provision
of exclusion orders which prevent convicted football hooligans
from attending matches in England and Wales.     These enable the
courts to impose restriction orders on convicted football
hooligans, preventing them from travelling to key matches abroad
involving teams from England and Wales.
Lord Justice Taylor recommended the creation of new offences
specific to behaviour at     football grounds.     The Government
generally supported these recommendations and on 12 November
1990 the Home Secretary announced that legislation was to be
introduced which would ban the throwing of missiles, the chanting
of obscene and racial abuse,       going on the pitch without
reasonable excuse and creating a ticket touting offence, at
football grounds.   This legislation will be introduced as soon
as Parliamentary time permits.

I hope this information is of use to you.

                                            Yours sincerely

INFO      »    TWO COMMENTS I WISH TO PASS ...WE ARRIVED IN SHEFFIELD AT 2 PM
               AND GOT TO THE GROUND AT 2.20 AND WERE ABLE TO WALK WITHIN
               20YARDS OF THE GROUND WITHOUT BEING CHALLENGED AND THEN THE CROWD
               APPEARED TO BE THERE. THE CROWD WAS INCREDIABLE. THE POLICE
               WERE UNABLE TO CONTROL THE CROWD THERE APPEARED TO BE ONLY A FEW
               THERE. THERE WERE NO PROPER QUEUES.

WE EVENTAULLY GOT THROUGH TURNSTILES AT ABOUT 3.02. THE CROWD OUTSIDE WAS
INCREDIABLE. PEOPLE WERE STRUGGLING AND THE POOR OFFICERS DID NOT APPEAR TO
KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON. I EVEN PASSED A COMMENT TO AN OFFICER THAT SOMETHING
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. IT APPEARS THAT THEN THE GATE WERE THEN OPENED.MY
FRIENDS ALL HAD DIFFERENT TICKETS AND THEY IN FACT MADE THERE WAY TO THE
LEPPING LANE STAND BUT WERE SEATED ABOVE THE PENS. I MADE MY WAY TO THE
NORTH STAND AND STOOD UP CLOSE TO THE KOP END. IT ALL HAPPENED THEN AND
NOBODY SEEMED TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON. IT WAS NOT UNTIL I SAW EVERYBODY
MILLING ONTO THE PITCH DID I REALISE THAT SOMETHING DRASTIC WAS HAPPENING. AN
AMMILANCE THEN APPEARED ON THE GROUND MAKING ITS WAY THROUGH THE ENTRANCE
SE®RATING THE KOP AND THE NORTH STAND. (AS YOU LOOK AT THE KOP FROM THE
PITCH IT WOULD BE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE) I IMMEDIATLEY GOT ONTO THE PITCH
AND TOLD AN OFFICER THAT I WAS A DOCTOR AND WAS THERE ANYTHING I COULD DO. HE
POINTED TO SEVERAL DEAD PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN BOUGHT UP FROM THE WEST STAND AND
LITERALLY DUMPED ONTO THE GROUND AT THE KOP END. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY USELESS.
I STAYED AT THE TOP END AS THERE WERE TOO MANY PEOPLE AT THE WEST STAND AND
WAITED FOR THE DEAD AND INJURED TO BE BOUGHT UP. IF I HAD KNOWN WHAT WAS
GOING ON I WOULD HAVE BEEN OF MORE USE BUT AT NO STAGE WAS THE PUBLIC ADDRESS
SYSTEM USED TO ASK IF THERE WERE ANY DOCTORS AVAILABLE ABOUT. IT WAS A WASTE
OF TIME STOPPING ON THE PITCH SO I ASKED AN OFFICER IF I COULD BE OF ANY
ASSISTANCE ELSEWHERE. HE POINTED TO THE ENTRANCE WERE THE AMBULANCE HAD COME
THROUGH SO I MADE MY WAY THERE. I HAVE NEVER WITNESSED ANYTHING SO
DEMORALISING. THERE WAS A POOR YOUNG ST JOHNS AMBULANCE BOY ABOUT 14 YEARS
OF AGE SURROUNDED BY PILES OF DEAD PEOPLE, SEVERELY INJURED PEOPLE AND DAZED
PEOPLE. HE WAS ALL ON HIS OWN. THERE WAS NOBODY ESLE WITH HIM AND NO OTHER
MEDICAL SUPERVISION. THE FACILITIES WERE AWFUL, THERE APEARED TO BE NO
MEDICAL EQUIPMENT TO USE AND IF THERE WAS NOBODY KNEW WERE IT WAS OR EVEN
BOTHERED TO GET IT. I WAS OUT ON A LIMB. I BELIEVE THERE IS SUPPOSED TO BE
A FIRST AID ROOM BUT AT NO STAGE WAS I INFORMED ABOUT IT OR DIRECTED TO IT. I
OPINION IS THAT IF THERE HAD BEEN PROPER MEDICAL SUPERVISION AS THERE IS
SUPPOSED TO BE MAYBE A LOT OF PEOPLE COULD HAVE BEEN HELPED.
THE FRIENDS I WENT WITH CAN ALL BE CONTACTED AT THE HOSPITAL THAT I WORK AT
WOMANS HOSPITAL
CATHERINE ROAD,
LIVERPOOL.

THAT WE ALL HAD TICKETS AND THEY OPENED THE GATES. THE CROWD SURGED IN AND I
FOUND MY FEET IN THE STAND. I TOOK MY SEAT AND THE MAN NEXT TO ME SAID THEY
HAD KICKED OFF 2 MINUTES EARLIER. I WATCHED THE MATCH FOR 3 OR 4 M,INS AND
THEN SAW FANS CLIMBING OVER THE FENCE. THE POLICE DIDNT REALISE WHAT WAS
HAPPENING AT FIRST AND WERE AGRESSIVE TO THESE FANS UNTIL THEY SAW SOME WERE
INJURED.THE POLICE WERE SLOW TO RESPOND TO THE INCIDENT AND THE FANS SEEMED
T («HOW MORE INITIATIVE. I WENT ONTO THE PITCH AND SAW POLICE AND FANS GIVING
F ® T AID. THERE WAS NO ANNOUNCEMENT TO INFORM THE CROWD AND THIS FRUSTRATED
THE FORREST FANS.THE DELAY IN COMMUNICATIONS WAS A GREAT FACTOR IN THE
INCIDENT

CATERED FOR. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT AT FIRST EVERYONE IN THE KOP END
THOUGHT THE LIVERPOOL FANS WERE PLAYING UP AND THERE WAS A LOT OF JEERING AT
THEM ETC. THERE WAS AN ANNOUNCEMENT AN HOUR LATER ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND
THIS STOPPED THE JEERING , IF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT HAD BEEN MADE EARLIER IT
WOULD HAVE MADE CROWD CONTROL AT THE KOP END EASIER. ALSO I WAS STANDING BY
A     ENTRANCE WHERE THE AMBULANCES WERE COMING THROUGH, THEY HAD TO DRIVE DOWN
A ^ E R Y NARROW ALLEY WHICH MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM IN TURNING ETC,
THEREFORE SLOWING DOWN THEIR RESPONSE. I ALSO WITNESSES THE CRUSH AND PEOPLE
CLIMBING OVER AND THE GENERAL TRAGEDY.
I WAS WITH MY BROTHER                    36 YRS,                            AND

             A LONGER ROUTE TO THE GROUND IF    THEY HAD LET THEM STRAIGHT
             THROUGH THEY MAY HAVE ARRIVED EARLIER & AVOIDED THE CRUSH. THERE
             WAS NO ORGANIZATION OUTSIDE THE GROUND AS THERE WAS LAST YEAR

               POLICE OFFICERS OUTSIDE THE GROUND. PEOPLE WERE BEING CRUSHED
               OUTSIDE AND IT TOOK ME ABOUT 20 MINS TO GET TO THE NORTH STAND.

             TRAFFIC BUT OTHERS BECAUSE THEY HAD BEEN DRINKING. I NOTICED THAT
             THE GATES FOR THE STAND AND THE GROUND WERE TO CLOSE TO GETHER

I GOT THROUGH AND THEN I HEARD SOMEONE SHOUT DON'T OPEN THE GATE BUT THE GATE
EAS OPENED AND THERE WAS ONE MAD DASH AND EVERYONE SEEMED TO RUSH INTO THE
STAND, I WHEN TO MY SEAT IN THE NORTH STAND AND FROMN THERE I COULD SEE THAT
THE CENTRE PENS WERE FULL TO OVER LOADING AND THE SIDE PENS WERE ALMOST EMPTY
AT ABOUT 1500 I SAW TWO PEOPLE CLIMB OVER THE FENCE AT THE FRONT OF THE WEST
STAND I THEN SAW THEM THROWN BACK OVER THE FENCE BY THE POLICE.
IT WAS A FEW MINUTES LATER THAT LOTS OF PEOPLE WERE SEEN TO COME OVER THE
F^CE, I THOUGHT AT FIRST THAT IT WAS A PITCH INVASION, BUT ONLY AFTER A
SHORT TIME I COULD SEE ALOT OF PEOPLE IN REAL NEED AND SERIOUSLY INJURIED.
I COULD HEAR SOME ONE SAY OVER THE P.A. TO KEEP CALM BUT THEY DID NOT LET YOU
KNOWN WHAT WAS HAPPENING.
I SAW A POLICEMAN I THINK HE HAD TWO PIPS ON HIS SHOULDERS GO TO THE REFEREE
AND STOP THE MATCH THEN THE PLAYERS LEFT THE FIELD.
THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION PASSED OVER THE P.A.
THE CROWD CONTROL OUTSIDE THE MATCH WAS NONE.

I         >> I ARRIVED AT ABOUT 1445HOURS I WENT TO WHAT I THOUGHT WAS THE
             ENTRANCE TO THE NORTH STAND, THAT WAS IN LEPPINGS LANE, THERE WAS
             JUST A MASS OF PEOPLE, I SAW OFFICERS ON A WALL NEAR TO ENTRANCE
             B THEY WERE PULLING PEOPLE OUT OF THE CROWD AND OVER THE WALL
             BECAUSE THEY COULD SEE THAT THEY WERE GETTING CRUSHED, ALSO I SAW
             YOUNG CHILDREN BEING PASSED OVER THE HEADS OF OTHER AND PASSED
             OVER THE P.T.O.

TURNSTILES, BECAUSE THERE WAS SUCH A LARGE CRUSH.
I THEN SAW THE GATES AT ENTRANCE A OPEN AND EVERYONE JUST SPILLED INTO THE
GROUND, I SAW ABOUT 10 TO 15 POLICE OFFICERS IN THE GROUND I ASKED IF THIS
WAS THE WAY TO THE NORTH STAND I WAS TOLD YES AND FOLLOWED ROUTE D. IT WAS
JUST A D AND AN ARROW.
I WENT UNDER A TUNNEL UNDER THE STAND, I ARRIVED AT MY SEAT AT ABOUT 1459
JUST IN TIME TO SEE THE KICK OFF.
I W E R P O O L STARTED OFF WELL I THINK IT WAS A CORNER KICK AND SOMEONE HIT THE
CROSS BAR OR POST BECAUSE WE ALL THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A GOAL, THE NEXT THING I
NOTICED WAS PEOPLE BEING PULLED OVER THE FENCE ON TO THE PITCH FROM THE WEST
STAND. I COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS FAR TO MANY PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE SECTION.
I THEN SAW THE POLICE COME ON TO THE PITCH AND ONE POLICE MAN TALK TO THE
REFEREE AND THE MATCH WAS STOPPED AND PLAYERS SENT OFF THE PITCH.
I TRAVELLED WITH FOUR FRIENDS BUT I ONLY KNOW THE DETAILS OF 2 I CAN GET THE
OTHERS WHO I ONLY KNOW BY NICKNAMES FOR THE OFFICERS AT A LATER DATE WHEN THE
 VISIT.

             After      the     disaster                 had    o c c u r r e d , I d o n ’t t h i n k a n y b o d y k n e w w h a t to do
                                                                     \           OA- r ,
             -   there       wa s     an    obvious             lack             c o m m u n i c a t i o n a m o n g s t the P o l i c e a n d

             rnatch o f f i c i a l s .              A    line       of P o l i c e m e n      j u st     stood       in f r o n t       of       the    N

             Stand      like        garden           gnomes.              They     wouldn't          allow any              fans       out    of    the N

             Stand      to    help         the       injured and                dying      fans.

             Finally,         I am         of    the          opinion        that       the    fact       t ha t    the L i v e r p o o l          f a ns

             only     ha d a c c e s s          to       the    Ground          through        the      tiny amount               of    turnstiles

             that     were      o p e n at           the       Leppings           Ln    e n d wa s      a major         factor          in the

             disaster.              In     comparison,                 the      Nottingham           Forest         fa ns     h a d all           the

             turnstiles             of     the       Spion Hop              end and       the    S Stand            end av ai l ab le              to    them.

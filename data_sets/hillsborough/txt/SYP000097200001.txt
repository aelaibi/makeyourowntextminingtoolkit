1    Read Broad S u mm ary of Incident (attached)

2    Clarify the nature of the South Yorkshire Police           enquiry, viz

      i)     The Chief Co nstable will give evidence to the f ort hcoming Committees
             of Inquiry.    The Inquiry chaired by Lord Justic Taylor will open on
             1 May 1989.

      ii)    It is nece ssary to submit a formal          proof of evidence 7 - 1 4         days
              before the enquiry opens.

      iii)   That formal proof of evidence will be under the following headings:

             1   History, geographical       area,   m a nnin g and   organisation     of South
                  Yorkshire Police.

             2    Policing of sporting events: legal background.

             3   Approach of South Yorkshire Police to policing major sporting
                  events.    History of such operations and current standing of
                  operational orders.

             4      Specific background to policing of match on 15 April 1989.

             5      Details of manpo wer and organisation of match.

      These 5 areas were all pulled together by a team over the last 2 4 hours.
      I am meet ing with counsel this afternoon when I will be able to present this
      evidence. However, last but certainly not least is heading number 6:- Events
      which occurred on the day and that's where you fellows come in.

      iv)    It is necessar y to obtain accounts from as m a n y as possible of the
              officers who were deployed in the vicinity of the Leppings Lane end
              of the ground that day. That includes not just those in the ground
              but also those in the terraces, at the turnstiles and outside the
              ground at Leppings Lane.

      v)     These accounts will be self-written on plain paper and will not be
              taken under CJA rules.
      vi)    Our task is not to examine the policing arrangements on that day or
              to   investigate actions or to establish blame in any way.      Our job
              is m e r e l y to collate what evidence South Yorkshire Police officer
              can provide to their Chief Constable in order that we can present
              a suitable case, on behalf of the force, to the subsequent inquiries.
vii)    Please note that we shall only obtain these accounts f r o m South
        Yorkshire Police officers at this stage.    Not    from members of the
        public or from officer from other forces attending on mutual aid.

        Also, at    this stage, I repeat that the scope of our enquiry is limited
        to those     officers who were on duty at the Leppings Lane end of the
        ground,    and to senior officers involved in the overall control of
        policing   at the game.

viii)   You should be under no misapprehensi on that the major enquiry is that
        being conducted, presently, by Mr Dear and his     West Midlands team.
        Ours should be looked upon as internal, narrow in scope, as evidence
        gathering not investigation and, finally, as secondary to the West
        Midlands enquiry.

Your task

Various documents have been scrutinised to extract details of officers on
duty at Leppings Lane end of the ground. Other officers who have relevant
information have also been included.

The present list runs to some 120 - 140 names.       These are all entered on
a Holmes computer which is supporting this enquiry.      You will be issued -
after this enquir y - with a list of officers who you are to see.

Chief Inspector Bettison will hand each of you a p roforma sheet.

I want you to give a copy of this proforma to each officer you see.      It
sets out the information that is required from each of these officers.  You
should go through the proforma with each officer and ensure that he/she has
no queries or difficulties.

I would like you    to stress to each of these officers that our enquiry is
concerned only with the incident itself and not with the actions taken in
respect of the aftermath.     Note:  This e n q uiry is to consider the events
leading up to the decision to stop the game and nothing thereafter.

You should then make a contract with the officer to supply you with their
handwritten account (make sure they are legible).    I want these document
as soon as possible and you should therefore arrange to receive them, in
person preferably, the same day that you instruct them or the day after at
the latest.

You should advise them to make a copy of the document for their own retention.
If they are subsequent ly seen by West Midlands officers then their account
will need to be consiste nt with that already given.

The written accounts should be passed to the Holmes Incident Room team -
they are situated   in a room called "The War Office" on 1st floor - or leave
the documents in the Holmes in-tray situated:- the Conference Room at
Headquarters.
If    any officer has any queries that you are unable to answer then ring me
or Chief Inspector Bettison on HQ 3457. If any officer declines to provide
an     account then please mak e a note of that for the Holmes team - however
you should ende avour to settle the minds of every officer that this is not
a witch-hunt, far from it, we seek only objective facts for the benefit of
the force as a whole.
There m a y be some officers who have already made statements to the West
Midlands team or for some other reason. We are negotiating with West Midlands
for copies of any statements - In the meantime the officers should be required
to provide the self-written account that is sought. They should aim to be
accurate, and consistent with any previous statements with the proviso that
our cut-off point is the game being brought to a halt.

(On this point either Inspector Ensor or Cleverly will be allocated Inspector
Woodward F2 - Chief Inspector Bettison has a copy of a previous self-prepared
statement of Woodwards submitted in a de-br iefing exercise - wh ichever of
you is allocated Woodward please see Chief Inspector Bettison).

A further    document which you should    hand to each officer is a copy of the
map being    circulated now.   In order    to assist the officers to be accurate
in their    accounts - and to achieve     some consi stency in description - they
should be   encouraged to refer to this   map.

It clearly shows some important features, na mely the three gates at the
Leppings Lane turnstiles - A, B and C. We believe that Gate C is the gate
that was opened to relieve the crush outside.

The m a p also denotes the various enclosures, so that we know which enclosure
the officers are referring to.

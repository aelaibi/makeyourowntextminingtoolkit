Briefly         serials        36       a nd 37 were           responsible              during        Phase       1 'to w o r k         in

conjunction            with mounted                  officers         and       supervise          Liverpool           supporters

the      ground.



My    original         orders           indicated           t ha t    during          this     phase,       serial       37,       was

to    remain       static          at    the R a i l w a y        Station         and was NOT              to    escort

supporters            to     the    ground.




I established                that       in f a ct       only      one      train       wa s    expected          (commonly

referred         to as        the       service         train)        and       this    wa s       anticipated          to a r r i v e

at    1 4 02    ho u r s .




Serial         number        38 was          responsible             for    the       supervising           and    parking          of

m in i    buses       (containing               Liverpool            supporters)              in W a r d s e n d R o a d North,,

which      is     situated          n e ar      to    the    Railway Station.



Phase      2    referred           to    the     period        during           the    match which              included a

refreshment            period           ait C l a y w h e e l s      Lane.        Phase        3    involved       similar

duties          to P h a s e       1,     ie„    supervising               supporters              returning       to    the

Railway         Station,           with       the     exception            of    serial        3S,    who       were    to    t ak e     up

a    position         in the        ground           in f r o n t     of    the       North        stand    on    the    perimeter

t rack.




Having         received        the       briefing           I then         b r i e feci m y        three    serials          as    to

their      respective              duties,           familiarised               myself        with    the       ground and          then

with      Chief       Inspector              Purdy     at    '11.00am a p p r o x i m a t e l y            I made       my w a y        to

the W a d s l e y      Railway           Station         situated           on P e n i s t o n e      Road       North       near       to

its      continuation with Halifax                           Ro a d .       Almost        immediately             supporters

began      to a r r i v e      in t r a n s i t          type        vans,       mini     buses       and       private       cars.
These    were       all    Liverpool             supporters               and    after          about       1 h ou r      there        had

been a       considerable             build        up of       supporters                 and    the a r e a        became        quite

busy    with       both     vehicular            and     pedestrian              traffic.




It    soon    became        apparent         that        many        supporters              we re w a l k i n g       ’'Away*         from

the    ground       uphill         along     Penistone              Road Worth               towards            Halifax       Road         and

FoKhill       areas       apparently             in s e a r c h       of a l c o h o l .




Many    visited          tw o    public      houses           within           30 y ards         of m y         location

although          these     public         houses        were        closed          to    the    general           p u bl ic .        I

was    aware       that     the      nearest        public           house        ( ap a r t     from       these      two)       was

the    White       Horse        public      house        about        600 yards              up H a l i f a x       Road.         As       a

result       I walked           up H a l i f a x    Road       to     the a r e a          of    the       White     Horse        public

house    and       satisfied          myself        that       there           were       officers          patrolling            this

area    a l so .      I then         returned          to     the     Railway             Station,          at W a d s l e v .

Supporters          were        still      walking          away      from       the       Football             ground and           we

were    then       continually             engaged          advising            supporters             t h at     there       w as     no

provision          for    them       to    obtain        alcohol           and       that       the    pubs       were     closed

and    that       they    should          make     their       way        to    the       ground.           This,      almost

without       e k cept ion         had     little        ef f ect         and    the       supporters             n o n e t h e 1 ess

continued          to w a l k      away     from       the     ground           s om e     returning             during       the      n ex t

hour    carrying          cans      and     packs        of    lager           and    beer       and       were     similar],y

advised       that       they     wouldn't          be      permitted            to       take    it       into     the   g ro u n d .

At    approximately              1.45pm      I observed               a    crowd          of a b o u t      100 y o u t h s       sat          on

a grass       verge       in H a l i f a x       Road       approximately                  100 y a r d s         f r o m my

location,          all    drinking          what       appeared            to    be a l c o h o l          in    cans.        Many

others       were    milling          around.            I felt           it    necessary             to    request       a mobile

serial       to    attend        this      location           to    supervise              these       youths        in the          event

of    trouble       but    at      this     time       they        a p p e a r e d well          behaved.            1 then          saw
tw o    mounted         officers          on    their       horses             positioned            immediately          behind

these      supporters              and    stood       on th e         forecourt            of H a l f o r d s    Store.           After

approximately                two    minutes          I heard a             request         for a s s i s t a n c e       an d    looked

immediately             towards          Halfords         and        saw       that     the     two     officers         on h o r s e s

had     disappeared.                Supt.       Marshall             a n d Ch.         In sp . Purdy were            walking

across       the       road    towards          the       supporters.                  I s en t      6 men    immediately

towards       Halfords             with    the       instruction                 to a s s i s t      the m o u n t e d    officers

and     established            that       there       was       an    off-licence               facility        in the G a t e w a y

supermarket             situated          -at the         rear       of    these        premises.




At     2 n0 0 pm th e        service       train          arrived          as     scheduled.              I ascertained            that

there      were        430    supporters             on    b oa r d .          With     the     approval        of S u pt .

the     assistance            of    mounted          officers             we     began     to m a r s h a l l     the

to m e      three        counterfeit               tickets        that       they    stated           they      had     purchased

from a small                boy approx.             3'6"       to 4 f e e t        t all.        These       were

amateurishly                forged       on a n         ordi n a r y    copying          machine          and     had    been

hastily          coloured          in y e l l o w        crayon.           I showed         to      the     men    Appendix            ’E ’

of m y      order        confirming               the    colour        coding       of    legitimate              tickets         as

br ow n ,     red,       purple,         orange,           blue and          green       only.         They       indicated            that

the    b oy      had     several         of       these       tickets        and    that       he     hadn't       been able            to

sell     these         tickets          f as t     enough       to     supporters           coming          from      the

direction           of C a t c h        Bar       Lane     (ie.      the     opposite          direction           to w h e r e        my

attention           had      been       concentrated).                  I advised           the       men and         they       walked

away     in a n a t t e m p t           to    find       the    boy.




I was       then aware             that       I had        become       overwhelmed              by the         sheer       volume           of

supporters             though       I. w a s       stood       in the m i d d l e         of     the      road.         I then

simultaneously                began          to    receive        several          reports          from members             of     the

public        that       people         were       getting        c r u s h e d at       the     turnstiles.                The

latter        of    these       reports            were       from     people       who     were       obviously            frantic

with worry             and    concern             and    they were           having       to     sho ut ,       though       only a

few    feet        away      f r o m me.           Immediately             I began        to     seek       the    attention            of

the m o u n t e d        Police         Inspector             on hi s      horse     nearby.              I could        see      there

were     horses          in the         crowd       of     people       immediately              outside          the m a i n       g a t es

in L e p p i n g s       Lane.          The       mounted       officers           were     having          great       difficulty

c o n t r a i l in g t h e i r h o rs e s a n d t h ey w e r e                 1 i k e w i s e i n d i v i ciu a 1 1 y

surrounded             by a h u g e          crowd       of    supporters.               It w a s      difficult            to

communicate              verbally            and    by     radio       due    to    the     general          noise      and       the

lack     of      radio       air    sp a c e ,      however          1 was     able       to m a k e        my way       to an d

shout       to     the      Mounted          Inspector          ( wh o s e    name       1' d id      not    know).          He was

attempting             to    re-group             his m e n     and     1 requested              he    form a barrier

across        the      front       of    the       gates.         People       were       continually arriving                         from
both     directions              in t h e i r       hundreds         and       although          I was        still       in the

centre         of L e p p i n g s    Lane        and     1 wa s      st i l l       surrounded           by    supporters

there     was        no    discernible              movement         of    the       crowd.          The      turnstiles              were

directly          in      front     of me        though       about        40 yards             away and           the m a s s e s           of

people         were       continually            attempting           to       filter       slowly          towards           the

turnstiles,                I heard         repeated          requests           over       the     tannoy          system        from

the    area       of      the    turnstiles            for    people           to    stop       pushing.



At 2 . 5 0p m a L a n d r o v e r           arrived          driven        by PC       1863 M i c h a e l           Buxton          and       he

positioned             his      vehicle       at      an angle        directly             in f r o n t       of    the

turnstiles             in L e p p i n g s     Lane       with      t he    roof m o u n t e d         public          address

system         speaker          facing      the       supporters           trying          to    enter        the     turnstiles.




I heard         him       appeal      for     patience          and       to    stop       pushing          but     this       seemed

to    h a ve    no     effect.




In v i e w      of     the      number      of      queries        I had        received           for      directions              I

thought         it w o u l d      assist         if    1 was       able        to    direct        the      crowd        visually

also     from        the     problem        a re a s ,    and      .1 w o u l d      obtain a better                  vantage

point.          I climbed           onto      the      roof     of    the       landrover           took       control           of      the

mobile         public        address        system        and      personally              began      to a d v i s e          p eo p l e

where     to      go      with     their      respective             tickets          and       to a p p e a l      to    them          to

stop     pushing.




I saw     that         the      mounted       Police         had     in f a c t       formed a           barrier          across             the

front     of      the      main     gates        between        the       natural          barrier          walls        on    either

side     of     the       main     gat.es , I est i m a t e d             6 horses          at     t hi s     st ag e .

My    initial          view      from      t h is     vantage        point          gave    me     real       cause       for

concern.             I could        s ee    that       all    around           me    people        were       stationary and

close     together              a n d as    they       neared        the       turnstiles           they were             jammed
                                                                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                                                                 R 1H

together         for    the     whole       width        of    th e    turnstiles             and       far    a depth           of

several      yards.           All     I could           see    were        heads       of    hair.        Not       even    t h ei r

shoulders         were       visible.            They were            so    tightly          packed       that       1 began           to

shout     over        the    public        address         system          to    stop       pushing.           I could           hear

people      screarnings

                  "Get       the     match       d e l a y e d ."

and

                  "why       d o n ’t y o u      get     the m a t c h          delayed."

I responded            with     more       appeals        over        the       public       address          system and

several      times          asked     for       patience        and        I informed             the    crowd       that        we

were     making        efforts        to    delay        the     "kick          o ff*.       I could          see    p eo p l e

frantically            struggling           to    get      further          forward          past       the    barrier

created      by       the    horses.            Some     youths        1 saw          run u n d e r n e a t h       the    ho r s e s ,

others      succeeded           in    pushing           between        them.




There     wa s    no    idscernible              ga p    between           the       supporters          on    either       s id e         of

t he   horses         and    I could        see       t h at   a space           had     been      provided          in the

centre      of    the       horses       for     the     supporters              to    gain access.                 This     I

conveyed         to    the    supporters              o ve r   the     public          address          system and

visually         directed          them     al so.        This        should          have    restricted             access           by

approximately SOX                  but     the     crowd       seemed           to    have    been       gripped          by a

mania     and     the i r on 1 y         i n t e n t i on a p p e a r ed         to    he    to    gain       access       to     t he

g r o u n d at    any       cost     before       the     kick        off.




I wa s    continually              looking        at m y w a t c h          in the          period       b e t w e e n 2 . '30pm

and 3.00pm.             I was        gripped          with     real        concern          that    there       wa s      serious

danger      of    injury        or    loss       of     life.         I looked           to my      left       a n d as     far as

I could      se e      down Leppings              Lane         (approximately                400    yards)          it wa s

crowded with            hundreds           of    supporters            which          stretched          f rom wall         to wall

a n d all    were       making        their       way     to    the        turnstiles.              The       situation           was
                                                                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                                                                   R IE

I continued             my a p p e a l s         to     the    crowd and          was       shouting         above       the       P .A .

system         so    loud       that       this       c a u s e d me      to    cough       between messages.




I heard a            c h e er    from within              the       ground which             I la ter        assumed          to     be

th e    players         entering            t he      fi e ld .      I became          increasingly anxious                        as

people         ignored          the       barrier        of    horses.           I heard abuse               from       supporters

d i r e c t e d at      the      mounted           officers          who were          being accu s e d            of    preventing

them     gaining          entry.            I saw        th a t     the    situation            ha d w o r s e n e d     in    that

there were            people          precariously                 balanced       and       tightly         packed       on    t o p of

th e    row     of    narrow          railings           which       ran       down    the      centre       of    the      approach

to     the     turnstiles.                 The     crowd was             tightly       packed         below       them and           it

was     though        these          people        on the          railings       had       climbed         onto     them      so as

to a v o i d        being       crushed          by     the    cro w d.         They    were         simply       sat    there          for

the     full        length       of       the    railings           facing       both       sides      as    if t h e y       had.

climbed         from      both        sides.            There       was    no m o r e       r oo m    for    anyone         else        on

the     railings          and        they       were     so    tightly          packed       they were            in d a n g e r        of

falling         off     into         the    crowd        below.           The    scene       was      by    now    so    desperate

that     1 l o o k e d at            my    watch        again       hoping       that       either         there     would         be     an

announcement              t h at      the       kick     off       was    delayed       or      that       the    attitude           of

t he    crowd w o u l d          change          when      they      realised          t h at    their       objective             to     get

in the         ground       before          kick-off           had       not    been achieved.                   It w a s     fifteen

Still        I could        see       no    signs        of    the       crowd    diminishing               directly          in front

of     the     turnstiles.                 1 could        see       a Police          Officer         in the       corner          a n d to

the     far     left      hand        side       of     the    turnstiles,             he    seemed         unable       to m o v e

due     to     the    sheer          weight        of    supporters.              1 could            occasionally             see

other        officers           on    the       inside        of    the    ground       at      the    turnstiles.                 The

problems         continued             in th i s          v a i n as       supporters            continued           to     e n t er       the

turnstiles.                The       next     thing          I reca ll       is     looking           towards        the

turnstiles            again          and     to my        surprise          and     relief        I saw       that         t h e r e wa s

only      a small          crowd       about         5 yards          deep       but      for    its    whole        width.             I ha d

not      seen where             the    main         b u lk    of     supporters            had gone          to a n d       my       only

belief         was    that       they        h ad    somehow          entered          the      ground       quickly            through

the      turnstiles.                 What     I witnessed                 then    I watched            in d i s b e l i e f          and

amazement.                I saw       the     supporters              clambering             o ve r    the    turnstiles                any

way      they    co ul d .           They     were        apparently             not      showing       tickets            or    paying

to    enter.          Some       supporters               I saw       literally            diving       over       the      turnstiles

as    though         a huge          wave     of     panic         had     descended            over    them       to E N T E R         the

ground although                  there        was      no     reason        for     this        behaviour..             I was

instantly            relieved          at     t h is      stage       to    see     the      problem         of    entry         had       been

resolved         before          there        ha d     been        death     or     injuries           at    the     turnstiles.



There      remained             approximately                 £00     people        outside           the    ground         on the

Leppings         Lane          side    of     the      horses         apparently             still      intent          on g a i n i n g

entry and            1 heard          on e    mounted           officer          shout;

                     "If       you    haven't          got      tickets          then      get a w a y . "

This      seemed          to    discourage             t h e m inomentarily a n d                 t h e y all        moved           b ac k

and      some    began          to m o v e      position             though       they made            no a t t e m p t         to    le ave

the a r e a .         Some       still        attempted              to    get    past       hiis h o r s e       i nt o    the

I then a l i g h t e d           from        the     roof       of    the    landrover            and       having         spoken          to

PC B u x t o n       he    then       drove         his      vehicle        into       the      lane    down       the      rig ht         hand

side      of    the       turnstiles           and which              gives       access         to    the    ground and                in

particular            to       the    South         Stand.           After       a fe w      seconds         I heard a message

o ve r    the    radio          requesting             all      available           personnel           onto       the      fie ld .            I

observed         25       to    40    officers            run      in the        s a me    d i r e c t i o n as     a      re sult.             It

then      became           apparent,          that      there           was    a serious             emergency             and myself

and      those        remaining             at    the    entrance              received             urgent         instructions                to

close         the     gates.



Immediately                the    turnstile             gates           were       slammed          s hu t    and        I then assisted

other         officers           to    close       the     forecourt                and     to      close         t he    main    steel

gates         at     the L e p p i n g s         Lane    entrance.                  We    were       immediately                confronted

by a n g e r         and     aggression            from        the m a n y          supporters               remaining           and

demanding             entry       to       the    ground.               I was        personally approached                        by a few

individuals                on s e p a r a t e      occasions              who       were       arguing            with     disbelief

that      anyonecould              shut           the    ga t e s .           They were             waving         their      tickets

with      fury        in m y          fa ce.      1 explained               t ha t      th e   ground was                full    to       capacity

and      ha d      been      closed         because           of    safety           regulations.                  The     supporters

seemed          unable           to a c c e p t         any    explanation.                    I could         understand             a

persons            anger         at     being       refused             entry        having purchased a                     t i c k e t but

this      wa s       more        than        simple       protest             and       anger and            I c o u l d not

comprehend               the     fanatical           behaviour                of    these           supporters.              I h a d to

forcibly             push away             those     1 wa s         speaking             to a n d      I recall            shouting            at

and      c lo s ed .           It s e e m e d that        my       final           remarks          registered             with    those

across          I found myself                   repeating              it to       other        similarly               angry

A t a p p r ox itnate 1 y 3. 1 0 pm                I went           i nto      the       I...ane 1 eadi ng           % o t he S a uth

Stand         where        1 had       seen       other        officers             running.            X saw            several       other

officers             tending          to    injured        persons             just       inside        the        lane,      near        to    the

corner          of    t he     south        and    west       stands.               Some       of    the      injured        were         laid

on    the       ground.           Some        had white             blankets             of a t y pe          normally           carried            by
ambulances          ov er       their       bodies        and    covering          their       fa ce s.            It was

apparent         t ha t    there       was     an    ernergency a n d            there        had    been a          disaster

though       I was        not       aware    at     that    time       the     extent         nor    the

circumstances,                  I reasoned           that       there    would         be m a n y        officers           inside

the    ground and              I looked        around       and    saw       supporters             leaving          the

ground.          Many were            injured        or    distressed            and were           staggering              about        in

shock    and      disbelief.                I realised           that    this area w o u l d                  be a m a j o r

route    for      the      emergency           services          and    my     efforts         and       those       of     the     fe w

remaining         officers            was    assisting           and    comforting             the       in j u r e d and

attempting          to     keep       people        moving       who    were       leaving          the       ground.          I

observed         approximately                '10 c o v e r e d b o d i e s     and 20          or m o r e i n j u r e d

persons       sat     or       laid    on     the       tarmac amongst            them.            Whilst working                  I and

every    officer           was       met    w i t h a w a l l of a b u s e          from        s om e       of t h e s e

supportes         apportioning                blame        to   the P o l i c e .        Anger           like I h a d       never

seen    before        was       being       d i r e c t e d at    us.




Many    people        were          being    aggressive           to th e        extent        t ha t        I anticipated               a

serious       disorder              problem       if we     did    not        re c e i v e    ass i s t a n c e      o ut s ide         the

ground and          I hastily              requested        further          Police          assistance             over     my

radio.        I observed              several        individual          officers             and    trying          to     restore

order.       Some         of    these       supporters           were    uncontrollable.-                     I understood

that    t h is    anger         was    partly/wholly attributable                             to    something             they      had

seen    in the        ground          and    in s o m e     cases       was      a shocked           reaction.               1 found

myself       putting           my    arms    round many           of    these        people         and walking             with

them    to    keep        them       moving,        consoling          them whilst             I di d         so.     All      the

Police        Officers.               Some       officers           were        assisting            the       injured.




Supt.      Marshall             arrived          a n d at      his       request          I s e nt        several          officers           to

l a te r   sent       more       officers           to    assist           as    more       people         began        leaving         the

ground.          A    photographer                arrived wearing                    a    flourescent                waistcoat.               My

at t e ntion was            drawn       to       him when           several          violent             and    angry       supporters

tried      to    attack          him.        Whilst           he    did       not    sa y      a word          they     accused         hi m

of     taking        photographs.                 So     violent           was      their       aggression,                in my

opinion,         he wa s         in    serious           risk       of     losing         his       life       had    the       supporters

not     been     prevented             by    other        officers              from      getting          hold       of    him.        I

literally            frog       marched          the     photographer                out       of    the       way    for       his    ow n

protection.                He    did    not       appear           to a p p r e c i a t e       the       seriusness             of    the

directing            their       aggression              at    him.           I found          it    necessary             to m a r c h       him

hurriedly            20    or    40 yards           where          1 gave        him      to    the       custody          of    two    oth er

Brian ANDERSON                (approx.           30    years).          He        was    sat       on    the     tarmac        at    the

side       of    his    father          who     was    apparently             dead.           Brian       Anderson           did     not

instructed a Police                      Officer        to    remain with                him.




As     the      time    elapsed           it    became       clear       as       to    the       severity        of    the

Inspector             Purdy       and    we     returned         to    the R a i l w a y           Station        and       assisted

with       enquiries          and. g e n e r a l       duties         in the           ar ea.



At     approximately               1800        hours     1 returned with                     5 officers           to C l a y w h e e l s

Lane.           More    officers           arrived a          short         while        afterwards.                 It w as        clear

many       were       visibly       shocked and              upset/distressed                     and     unfit        to    continue

1 returned with                   these        officers       to      Rothe rh am where                  we    all     retired           from

To     summarise,            it    is m y       genuine       belief          that       supporters              entering           the

turnstiles             between          1450 and        1300       hours          were       in    imminent          danger         of
being      killed          or    seriously            injured         as     a    result           of    the       huge       volume          of

fanatical          supporters               arriving         enmasse,             all       intent        and       anxious            to     the

point      of     desperation               to     get     into      the     g r o u n d at         any       cost       before         the

kick      off.      This         was       confirmed         by      the     anxiety             of m a n y        other       supporters

who      were     frantically               pleading         for      the        k i ck     off     to    be       delayed          and       for

t he     Police      to     do    something              although          the        situation           developed              so

quickly         and with          th e      behaviour          of     t he       crowd          t h i s w as       impossible,



I   am    satisfied             that       the     officers          1 could           see       behaved           in a

professional               and    exemplary              manner       and        did all           they       could       in the

c ir c u m s t a n c e s    prevai1ing.




The Moun t e d        Police           also        acted     in a      professional                     manner          and    I was

impressed          by th e        way       they      organised            themselves               to    form          a barrier

under      great       and       difficult            circumstances                   the       like     of     which         I h a ve        not

seen      since      the m i n e r s            strike.        Whilst            their          actions         may      have       relieved

t he     pressure          for a       short         while     on     the        turnstiles,              the       behaviour               and

volume       of    the      c rowd was             such     t ha t    they were                 unable        to    sustain            it,,

I was      not     surprised               to    find      during      the         period          consoling             the     violent

supporters           leaving           the       ground after              the        incident           t h at     many       of      them

had      been     drinking            and       smelled      strongly             of       alcohol,             I consider              that

t-his     p 1a y e d a      1 ar ge        par't     i n the      b e h a v iour           of    those        ac t i ng

irresponsibly               and       violently.             Whilst          I was          in     c l os e     proximity              to m a n y

other      NONE      violent           persons           (including              those          injured)            none       of      these

a p pe a re d to       have       b ee n d r inki n g .




I did      not     witness            any       violent      disorder             as       such      p r io r      to    the     match

though       this      seems          to    h a ve    been     diverted               or    released            from      the       crowd

through         efforts          to    enter         the    ground.              My    conclusions                 were       t ha t    many

supporters           had        in f a c t       arrived       in s u f f i c i e n t            time     but       had       left      the
 area     to    consume         alcohol.          Through        having       to    w al k     some      considerable

 distance        when       returning,           they     had    arrived       late.           This      resulted          in a

  situation whereby               they       were       unable    to    enter       all      at    on ce.       The whole

  of L e p p i n g s   Lane      at    the       crucial    10 m i n u t e     p e r i o d wa s       one     mass     of

 moving        people.          In m y      opinion       this    would       have       been      the     queue      had     t he y

 all     stood     s ti l l .     It w o u l d      have    necessitated                hundreds         of P o l i c e     in

  the    circumstances            to     control         them and       the    majority            would       have    been

  unable       to g a i n    access         without       missing       part       of    the      match.




  Those     supporters           at    the       rear    would    have    been          unaware       of      the   problem

  of    entry    as    the      turnstiles          were    so    far    away       and      out    of     view.       Th e

  situation        developed           so    quickly       that    we w e r e       powerless            to    control        the

  huge    numbers       and      even with          reinforcements             it w o u l d        have       entailed

  crowd     control         similar         to    that    witnessed       in       the M i n e r s       Strike       to

  restore       orderly         queues.

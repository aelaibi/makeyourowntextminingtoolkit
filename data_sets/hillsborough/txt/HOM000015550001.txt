            Dear Mr Bloomfield

            HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL DISASTER

            My senior investigating officer has advised me that your company carried
            out the cleaning of the personal clothing from those who tragically lost
            their lives three weeks ago. I understand that you decided to waive the
            charges.

            On behalf of Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry can I say thank you for
            carrying out the uncomfortable, but absolutely necessary task. Secondly
            can I ask that you pass on our appreciation to your staff. Thirdly, your
            kind gesture to waive the charge is noted and appreciated.

            Yours sincerely




            Assistant Chief Constable
            (Hillsborough Inquiry)




             Copy To: Chief Superintendent Pemberton (for Det Chief Inspector Tope)

I went      up to E a s o n            and he a sked           for a cot to be taken out                                        of

his ambulance.                He    said that          there           had been a bit                           of a crush

and    that a young., g a g            had     been        crushed and stopped                                 breathing.

At this          time we were all              unaware              of the extent                        of the

situation.           We     removed the             cot and made                      our way             by foot           onto

the    pitch.         It was           now about          1515 h o u r s .                 The          game     had

stopped and there were                       ?>oplayers              in sight.                      There       were a

We went       down the mai n He r ries Road                    to t he      r oundabou,t and

then    round onto L e p p i n g s          Lane,        The    police were            on every

junction directing                 us and we were             not held up at all.                    I

have    no    idea what          time     it was whe n we got               to L e p pings       Lane.

There was          some    delay a r o u n d      the    gates       because       of the amount

of    people around.               It was    bedlam w h e n we             parked with fans

and    police       everywhere.            T h e r e were about            three a m b u l a n c e s         in

from Hal tby and a s k e d him where                     the    casualty         ci. earing point

was    as    I thought          that     control    had       told us       it was       in L e p pings

Lane.        He    said that        he did not          know but       that      the     vehicles            in

front were          being       loaded and w o u l d          be moving        shortly.          1

tried       to find an officer              in charge          but    could not          see    one,.

Then a police             inspector        came    up to me and a sked me to take a

young       boy and his          dead     father    because          the    boy w ould         not

leave       his    father.         The    boy was       not    injured.          I said that             I

could no I         move    dead bodies         and as         the    boy was       not     injured he

The    vehicles       started          to move     up.        This was about             five

There was a lot of equipment                       with the          patient and          so we did

not    look       for any more           patients       to take with           us.       We m a n a g e d

      told     us to go           to H a l i a m s h 1 r e bec a use he had wor k e d                  there

      before and             u nd e r s t o o d    that N o r t h e r n General          was    quite        full.

13.   I was     not aware            of the        jour n e y    because        1 was    helping         in the

      back.         I think         it took about 7 minu t e s                   to get to the

      Hal lamshi r e .

14.   We    u n l o a d e d the        patient and ha n d e d him over                  to     casualty.             I

      then      radioed         clear and was              told by       control        to go back           to

      Le p p i n g s    Lane.          I still       assumed       that L e p pings Lane was                  the

      casualty          clearing          point.        We had a quick               journey       back      down

      which      took a bout 7 minutes.                       We went ar o u n d         to just         outside

      the     gate and          the     doctor       got     out   to    see who        he    could help.

      The D e r b y s h i r e       ambulance          man      stayed with us.               I radioed           to

      control          again      to ask where             the     casualty         clearing       point was.

      I was      then d i r e c t e d to the H e r r i e s Road bus                      depot      to stand

      by.      We were          able      to turn       round and            go back     up L e p p i n g s Lane

      and along H e r r i e s Road where                        we met S t a t i o n Officer             Eason.

      He    told us to            park      in the      driveway         to the       depot.        All

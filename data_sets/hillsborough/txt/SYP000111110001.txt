            t ime   for           our               serial      was     set at       1 500     hours          a n d we    were      provided with a

            snack     meal                    immediatly            following         briefing.




            We   made        out w a y                    to   the W e s t    Stand       to    tak e         up out      designated            positions

West    S t a n d at        the     Leppings             Lane       end.        Our    position was              to     the       left          of

the    goal        when     looking           at    the       pitch,       almost       directly above                  gate          3    in

the    perimeter            fence.




Our    duties         were       to:




1)                 Stop     f ans       climbing          o ver       the     fence      separating             the     north             end

of    the     stand        from     the       raised          section        of    terracing          (overlooking                    gates

6 and 7        in the           perimeter           fen c e ) .




2)                 Prevent         fans       from       throwing           it ems     from     the    stand          onto        the

pitch,        or    onto        fa ns    below.




3)                  Supervise            the       use    of    the    emergency             g ate    situated           at       the

front       corner         of    the N o r t h          end    of    the W e s t      Stand      (above          gate        6    in the

perimeter           fence).             Two    stewards             were     also      n ear    to    the       gate     (one             in

t rai ni n g ).




At    t his    time        (and     up    to       phase       two)    there          were     only    eleven           officers

about       three      thousand           five          hundred.           At     phase      two,     we       were     to       be

relieved           by S e r i a l       16 to       go    for       meal     (three       o ’cl ock).

of    climbing          over.        Several          aborted attempts                made.

Complaints            made     by f e m a l e       members       of    the     crowd        in that

section         of y o u t h s      urinating          in the         enclosure.             Several

this      time,       in a n     effort       to      stop    those wishin g                to    climb

Looking         down     onto       the    terracing,            it w a s     obvious            that       the

El HACKENTHORPE

SERIAL 13 WEST STAND GANGWAY U,

I commenced duty at 0830 on Saturday '!& April 1989 at El, Hackent-horpe
where I joined colleagues to form serial 13, under the direct command of
Sgt 2001 Burman, We arrived as a serial at Hillsborough football ground
at 0930, and attended the general briefing at 10,00 given by Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield, Meal time for our serial was set at 1500 hrs
and we were provided with a snack meal immediately following briefing,

We made our way to the West Stand to take up our designated positions at
11,15 in plenty of time before the opening of the ground to the public
at 12,00 noon,

Together with PC 10 fiercer I went to gangway U in the West Stand at the
Leppings Lane end, Our position was to the left of the goal when looking
at the pitch, almost directly above gate 5 in the perimeter fence,


Our duties were to;
                      1 , Stop fans climbing over the fence seperating the
north end of the stand from the raised section of terracing (overlooking
gates 6 and 7 in the perimeter fence),
                      2, Prevent fans from throwing items from the stand
onto the pitch, or onto fans below,
                      3, Supervise the use of the emergency gate situated
at thefront corner of the North end of the West Stand, C above gate 6
m the perimeter fence), Two stewards were also near to the gate Cone in
training),


At this time,( and up to phase two ), there were only eleven officers
< Serial 13 consisted of 12 officers plus Sergeant, but was depleted by
one due to illness), in the West Stand, which has a capacity of about
three thousand five hundred. At phase two, we were to be relieved by
serial 16 to go for meal (three o clock).

The times listed hereafter are as accurate as I can make them, but 1 am
aware that there are deviations from accounts made by others, non the
less it gives a time scale to my perception,

1200   Ground opened to the public,

1345    Large numbers of Nottingham Forrest supporters ib their allocated
       enclosures, but only low numbers of Liverpool supporters, notably
       women and familie s ,

1430   Still relatively low numbers of Liverpool supporters in ground,

1440   Visited by Sgt Burman, who 1had not seen since taking up position
cont,,.,
      at m s . Comment, passed by me to him about the low numbers in the
      stand up until that time, and the large numbers now entering the
      stand, Central terracing (rear of goal) and stand now
      substantially filled with supporters, North and South ends of the
      terracing relatively empty. Raised area of terracing to the North
      of the West Stand nearly full, Large numbers of youths
      congregating near to the dividing fence, apparently with the
      intention of climbing over, Several aborted attempts mads,
      Complaints made by female members of the crowd in that section of
      youths urinating in the enclosure. Several youths seen at the rear
      of the raised terracing climbing onto the fencing above the rear
      entrance tunnel, and removing the barbed wire, Moving through the
      crowds at this time, in an effort to stop those wishing to climb
      over the fence, it was obvious that large numbers had been
      drinking, some heavily.

        Looking down onto the terracing, it was obvious that the centre
        sections were overcrowded, Persons were climbing over the fencing
        separating the pen at the rear of the right, hand side of the gual
        looking from the stand, to the pen on the left hand side of the
        goal, This appears to be shown incorrectly on the plan provided,
        The double row of fencing which seperates these two pens form a
        gangway from the entrance tunnel to a gate in the perimeter fence

        Officers were standing on the perimeter track supervising those
        fans climbing, and preventing them from climbing over onto the
        track,

1501    Fans began climbing over onto the perimeter track and then the
        gate in the pen behind the goal was opened, and fans were allowed
        to walk along the perimeter track and re-enter the terracing via
        gate 6 as shown on plan, which is directlu below gangway U.

1502    Crowd in West. Stand stood up,



1503    I went to barrier with PC 2.117   and looked down on the terracing,
        I could see fans syrging forward in the two pens behind the goal,
        Fans were now climbing over the perimeter fence onto the track,
        and over the fence seperatirtg the two pens (single fence), Large
        numbers of fans seemed to be crushed into the corners of those
        pens as below at x,


                                         1
                                    X    1   X

                                         1

 1504   Obvious that person were being crushed at this time, and fans were
        being assisted obver the fence by Police officers,
1505    Heavy surge of spectators towards the front of the terrace, but
        instead ot the gap left in the crowd when fans sway forward, the
        space? was immediateIt filled by other fans, It was now obvious
        that there were serious problems in the pens, and more and more
        fans were spilling over the fences and onto the pitch, Looking at
        them it was obvious that some were injured, More Police began to
        help at the fences, and supporters in the stand were now helping
        those below up into the   stand over the front of the balcony,

1506    Bolt croppers were requested, and request aknow1edged, Ambulance
        requested and acknowledged, Large numbers of spectators walking
        and being carried onto the pitch, some lying still. Numberous
        officers now giving first aid.

1510    Further request for bolt croppers. Non forthcomming and fence torn
        down by hand by Police and spectators.

        Onto food bar area at rear of stand (upper level), Assist with
        injured passed upo from terracing. Three placed in recovery
        position, breathing but unconeious, Ambulance requested by me,

        Assistance obtained from medically trained persons in crowd to
        stay with injured until arrival of ambulance, Approached by Doctor
        and together with PC27H guided him down behind the Police box and
        made a path through the crowd and onto the pitch, Returned to food
        bar area,

Ref Z

1519    Approached by Inspector Grace and told to join him in the stand to
        prevent fans causing damage. On arrival saw that fans were tearing
        hordings down to use as stretchers, no action taken,

1522    .Return to food bar area, Injured now removed to ambulance, Joined
        by PC 928 Parkin, Took up position at Isle Z, Approached by one by
        one by literally hundreds of fans very distressed and needing to
        know what to do, All they wanted was to be told what to dpo, as
        they were incapable of making decisions themselves, Advised them
        to leave ground quielty and make their way home.

        On looking arround the bar area I noticed a heap of discarded
        tabards which the stewards had been wearing, On purposefully
        looking arroung the stand I realised that therfe were no stewards
        in sight, (SUBJECT OF FULL REPORT SUBMITTED THROUGH SUFT, GOUGH ON
        SUNDAY 16th APRIL).

        Official announcment of match abandoned, Maintained station
        supervising fans leaving groung, Large numbers in a truculent and
        abusive mood, seemingly caused by frustration. Mental note that it
        wouldn't take much to provoke a major public order incident,

'????   West stand cleared and serial reformed, Stand searched for items
        left behind. Negative result. During this time I noticed two
        stewards taking tabards from under coats and putting them on
       again, 1 spoke to                                  and told him
       what 1 had seers, He replied,  What do you expect ihem to do if
       they're going to get thumped,' Heard radio message regarding^
       number of places available in mortuaries and realised full scale
       of catastophe, Obtained details of remaining fans for purpose*
       of taking statements,

       Return to gymnasium for re-deployment, and placed on standby in
       Ho r t-h &t-a n ci,

       During the time span of the disaster unfolding, shown here as Ref
       Y to Ref Z I closely monitored radio traffic, I at no time heard
       any directions being qiven in terms of leadership, Ihe only
       messages I heard were"those requesting assistance of one sort or
       another , and where appropriate, their acknowledgements,

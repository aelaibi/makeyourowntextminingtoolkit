1 could      see        that    there were           people      drinking         from     cans,   and tnere              was

one group of about                   15 who were           drinking and acting               drunk    but       I don't

trouble      outside           the ground,,          I should say that there would have been

appeared        to be very d r u n k .             I saw this           bloke at           the    end of       it and       he

was     standing       up and he         seemed O.K.                There      was      also a man whose              body had

opened.           I sa w 4 3         policemen          pulling         at    the    wire         mash     to     force       it

off.       People        couidn       ‘t n a v e     been       crushed           right        up a g a i n s t    it at          that

p oin t    because        the       police    wouldn           ’t have        been       able       to    push and           pull

the    m e s h as       they    were       doing,,        1 presumed              that     there         must     have       been

barriers          which       had    fallen       down     the       gap     ay    the     concrete         under           where     the

wire      mesh     is.        Eventually          it wa s       pulled        loose        and      bent    back        and

people       were       let    out,    once       that     nad       happened more                police        were        trying        to

pull      the     other       wire    m e s h away.            The    area        started         to     clear     then       and     I

was    able       to    get    from    behind        my    barrier,,              It wa s       about      3.30        pm    now,,        Me

a n d ________ (went           back    to w h e r e       we    were        originally            standing and               met     up

with                   and |
                           ________          The     tanoy was asking                    the      fans     to go back              onto

the    terraces          and they were asking                    for medical               staff and            social

workers         to help.            I went    to     look       for               and went         onto     the        pitch,,        I

saw about 2 0 - 3 0            people       lying about              with     people           helping      them,           one

thing      1 didn't m e n t i o n           before was when                  the    intial          surge       happened

there was a policeman                      standing        at the           front    of the            fence,      I think           he

                                                                                                                    S480

was    trying     to give        people advice            to help          those     who were       fainting.                    He

seemed to be aware               of what        was    gong     on.        Whe n    I was     on the      pitch          I saw

people     being       carried off         on s t retchers made                of b o a r d s , about          10 15

people,,        1 had    looked about            for            but    I c o u l d n ’t find him so                 I was

getting w o r r i e d about           him so      I wa l k e d       in b e t w e e n where        the    bodies

were,,     1 saw some          covered         over    with     coats,,        1 saw some          people          giving

the    police a b u s e , these           people were           very upset           and were       crying          so       I

presumed        that    they were         friends       and     relatives           of those who          had died

or were        injured,,       1 never         saw a policeman hit.                    I saw a lad            push a

po l i c e w o m a n arm she        grabbed      hold of nim and               he star t e d to sob and

then she        comforted him.             The    police were muck i n g                in like anyone               else

then     but    1 never       saw any      police who was              in    charge      to tell         them what

to do.         1 still     couldn* t find                  so    1 went       to find                                     and

           again.

I went     back    into Pen 5 and               climbed       over     to the        back    of    pen 4 but             I

couldn     *t find anyone            so    1 went       back     to the       front      of the      terraces             and

I found                  then on the            pitch.        We went        over      to the main            stand

side     of the    pitch to the            right and we           saw               in the m a m         stand

waving at        us.     We    indicated         to           to meet        us outside and we went

b a c k t o the    t e r race and t h r o u g h t h e t u n n e 1 „                T I"!ere were    p o 1 i.c s t h ere

blocking        people     coming        in.    We went       out and met                    and went         back       to

the    car.                and                  weren't       there,,        A bloke a s k e d us             if we

were     in crush and when we                  said we were           he    invited us         into his            house

and he gave        us a cup of tea.                   He gave     us a piece            of   paper       to    leave             a

note     on|            \s car       to tell      him we were O . K , but as we ware                           setting

off we     saw                and                and    1 went        horne wi th                  and

and              land            A’ent    home    t o g e t he r .

One    thing     that    I noticed         that was        different          from      last years m a t c h was

that     on the way to the               ground       there w e r e n ’t any           police      stopping          mini

buses and vans           on the way            to the m atch to             check      for alcohol            as    there
               was        last year,,

                1 would          be willing   to   give   evidence at any   -future hearing,,

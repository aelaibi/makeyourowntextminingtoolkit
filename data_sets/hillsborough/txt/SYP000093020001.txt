                  I live at the a bove a ddress with my                            parents.        X am a single man.                   In

                  May      1989    <000589)       3'. was   v isi te d by P olice           O ff i ce r s   from the west

                  M id la n d s Police.           I c ompleted a q u es t i o n n a i r e          in c on ne c ti o n w it h the

                  H i l l s b o r o u g h tragedy.



                  F urther        to the     i n fo rm at io n   I gave      in the Q u e s 1 1 onnair f           a bo ut     the

                  barrier         in P en 3.       I can say that            I e nt e re d P en 3 aT a b ou t              1450 hrs

                  (1450).          F rom the time           I entered P en 3 I was               being      crushed./l            was

                  near the back of the                pen and        I saw     people       being      h elped yjr into the

                  west      stand.        I knew                ,0 q*
                                                     I n eeded to  gs«t out of the                   pen and so          I got to JChe

                  back and was           helped up into th^y we st                     stand.    At this        time     the majfch

                  had not started.
                                                                                                         P AG E        2
                                                                                                         S3728

I stayed at          the front        of the stand                  was    helping     other      people up

out of the          stand.       As    I looked    i n t a the     pen     I could see all         the    people

were       crushed.        It looked worse         than a n y t h in g      X have   ever    seen before.



1 saw the m a t c h start,              but   1 was still help in g           people      up so    I was     not

really w at ch i n g        the match. ' I was            just glan ci ng at         it from time to

t im e .



I was wa tc hi ng          the   m a tc h as B E A R D S L E Y   hit the     cross         bar at the other

end.       At that        time   I heard      people s c r e a m i n g /    I looked down         into     pen     3

and    I saw near          the   front a lot of peo pi s r go for t^afrd and               fall    down.         I n

my own mind          I knew      that a barrier had e i t h e r ^ J o r o k e n or bent a nd that

had    caused the          people      to fall.      I knew that           people/^Jould have been

killed.           I then saw a fan climb over                  the f enc^y/and go to the Live rp oo l

goalkeeper.           The m a tc h was        then stopped.



I was wa tc hi ng          people      climb on to the           pitch and then        people      being

g iven m outh to m o ut h and heart massage.                        I saw     p e o p l e on the    pitch who

vWere o bvi ou sI y dead.             People with their            heads     covered over.



I continued to help               pull    people     up    into the stand as the             pen slowly

cleared.



When       the    pen had    cleared s u f f i c i e n t l y     I could s e e y that      there was a

barrier          in pen three         that was    bent     right    over ta the        floor.       !his

barrier was          in the      same    position     that       1 saw all     the    people      fall    over

earlier          on and    I knew that        I had been         right when       I thou gh t that a

barrier          had given way w hen          1 saw all        those     people    fall    over

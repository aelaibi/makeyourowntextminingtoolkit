            On Saturday 15th April           1989 (150489),       I was on duty from 08.00am

            (0800)   for the FA Cup semi-final               to be held at Sheffield Wednesday

           Football Club.        At 08.30am         (0830)   that same day, after        initial       parade

           at Doncaster Headquarters,               I went by convoy to Sheffield Wednesday

           Football Club,       arriving at 09.30am            (0930)

           At 09.45am       (0945)   I was                                             wiucn

           After the parade, whl^Th concluded at 10.30am                     (1030)   I had rny first

           meal    in the North Stand which concluded a*t                    .10arn (1110).       I was then

            informed by POL PS                       to patrol          u s t o n e Rd from Tanfield Rd to

 Nottingham Forrest supporters to side street parking,                 checking all

  premises and to maintain order and to prevent any clash of rival

 sup por ter s.

 Whilst standing at the junction of Tanfield Rd and Penistone Rd I

  could see that a large number of cars with red and white scarves

  flowing out of the side windows were heading                in my direction.    I would

  estimate the time to be 11.30am (1130).                Some of the vehicles    pulled

  up adjacent to myself and POL PC BATEMAN and requested directions for

  parking facilities.             The supporters at this time were     in good spirits

  and were eagerly awaiting the match.

  By 12.00 noon (1200)            the second wave of Nottingham Forrest supporters

  arrived via mini       buses and vans.           The majority of them were noisy,

  boisterous and were singing and chanting,                which could be heard a

  distance away.

  Once the vehicles were            parked on Dutton Rd and Tanfield Rd the

  supporters asked myself and POL PC BATEMAN where the location of the

  nearest public house was.             I informed them that it was some

  considerable distance away,             but this didn't deter them in seeking a

      ’watering hole'.   One supporter told me that he w o u l d n ’t enjoy the

 match unless h e vd had a few pints.

  By 1.30pm     (1330)   the pavements were beginning to swell with supporters

 with the majority who were walking                 in the opposite direction of the

  club.      I was called,        in company with POL PC BATEMAN and POL PS

              , to attend Lills Pork Stores,           which was a large sandwich shop
- -                       -             ________
                              ;

  with a bakery attached to the rear,                regarding a report of a           ^

  disturbance from^tfithin.            On arrival     I saw approximately 30 Nottj^fgham

 Forrest faiyy'mi 11 i ng outside eating sandwiches and c o n s u m i c o h o l ,

  ranging^rrom beer to wine and cider.                 I didn't see anyblray at this

  time drinking spirits.

 The majority of the fans on the whole were well behaved,                 but a small
                                                                       PAGE    3
                                                                       S2495

group of approximately 10 male youths,     aged between 18 and 25 years,

'were being boisterous,   shouting and singing football songs.    I could

see that at least half    of them were carrying 4   and 6 packs of baer and

litre bottles of cider.     I even saw one youth carrying a three      litre

box of Country Manor wine, where he placed the tap which was provided

into his mouth,   switched it on and then consumed the wine.     When I

questioned him he informed me that he had bought it from a local

supermarket on the way to the match and that he had been drinking it

since 11.00am (1100)   that day.

At approximately 2.00pm    (1400)   the proprietor of the shop came out and

requested a Police   presence,   to remove 4 male youths, who had been in

for approximately 20 minutes and were causing a disturbance.

After an initial discussion the youths were escorted out of the shop

and then told to make their way to the ground.

I noticed at this time that there was an aura of tension and

anticipation in the air.     The crowds appeared to have a mixture of

emotions   ranging from excitement to lethargy.

From that time onwards    there was a steady flow      of supporters

comprising of families    to groups of youths who    were walking from

Sheffield City Centre.     There were still a large number of fans

carrying some form of alcohol.       I informed a number of them that once

they had reached the immediate vicinity surrounding the Stadium any

form of alcohol   present would be confiscated.     Their replies were to

the effect that there would be no alcohol      left by the time they had

reached the ground, which was approximately half a mile away.

By now the crowds were spilling onto the road and some were becoming

aggitated when told to keep on the pavement.        I could see that a

number of youths had discarded a large quantity of beer cans in the

bins provided.

At approximately 2.50pm    (1450)   the crowds were running towards the

ground.     I could see that the majority of them comprised of young men

and women,    who were jeering and shouting towards fellow supporters.

There was no animosity towards the Police.

At 3.00pm    (1500)   I was informed by POL PS               to   make my way with

POL PC BATEMAN to the ground with the remaining supporters and then,

wait on Penistone Rd outside the Spion Kop between gates 77 and 8®.                ^

Whilst walking to the ground POL PS                  informed us to ajrte^

ground as quickly as possible as there was a report \»^fj

within the ground.      The time would be approximately 3.1j

I approached gates 77 and 88 I could see a large numffer of Nottingham

Forrest   supporters standing outside showing me their bonafide tickets

and demanding to be let into the ground.          It became apparent to me

that there was something amiss when the turnstile operators             refused

them entry.     By now the atmosphere was electric.          I then entered the

ground by the Spion Kop and walked straightaway onto the footba l 1

pitch.     I was greeted with a large number of youths         running around the

field ripping boarding from the perimeter of the field.              I walked up

to the halfway line to see a large number of both sexes and all ages

lying on the ground.       Some were screaming for help,      some were covered

with their coats and were obviot^sly dead.         The scene was one of total

carnage and to a certain extent confusion.          It was at this point that

I helped a n unconscious/supporter who was        laid down on the centre     line

in the Nottingham Fo/rest end,

Approximately six/youths brought him on a piece of boa^rffing and laid

him on the ground.       I could see that the lad was aJjrfSut '18 years of
               /
age.     I qui/Ckly turned him on his back and he>^m mouth to mouth

resuscitation followed by external       heart iti^tssage.   After approximately

■15 mirrlites the youth didn't   respond to treatm en t and a d o c t o r , I don't

know his name,     pronounced life exticrct.     This youth was then carried

by the same team of lads to the j^ymnasium at the rear of the North

                      dying.    I did notice,       how/ver,       that not one of the photographers

                      helped any of the       injured,      they were too keen to take        ’action'

                      by a youth who was approximately 20 years of age, who was carrying his

                      friend over his s h/ ul de r.         He told me that he had just stopped
                      A-
                      breathing.     I placed him on the grass and after                an examination found

                      that there     was /o pulse. I began to              administer mouth to mouth

     ^                I now found /a pulse and found that he was breathing.                  I placed him in

                      the recovery position and awaited for the ambulance to arrive to

                      convey hijk/\Q the hospital.            Once placed in the ambulance        I then

                      joined others who at this time were standing forming a cordon

                      immediately in front of the Spion Kop.                    I was informed by my Sergeant

                      that   I was   to maintain order at this end and to prevent any of the

                      supporters     from invading the pitch.

                      After the crowds were         informed that the match would be cancelled,                I

                      followed the Nottingham Forrest supporters from the ground towards

              I am former Police Constable 2593 of the South Yorkshire Police.

             Further to my previous statements made for th e /West Midlands Police

              regarding my experiences at the Hillsborough Football                ground on

             Saturday 15th April           1989 (150489).

              I have previously identified from photographic evidenc^y^ne youth I

       V      dealt with on that afternoon as the deceased Keith i

              In regards to my dealings with Keith McGRATH I cWt confirm the

             following,       I first saw McGRATH^ lyi ng on the pitch in the area of the

              centre line of the pitch I saw a supporter trying to resuscitate

             McGRATH,    I could see that the supporter was not resuscitating                 in the

              correct way and I approached them.              McGRATH was lying on the pitch

             surrounded by a number of supporters,               because the area they were in

             was so overcrowded.            I assisted the supporters to carry Keith McGRATH
                                                                      PAGE    2
                                                                      S 2493B

on a hoarding to the Spion Kop end of the ground.        We placed the

hoarding down on the pitch in the area I have previously indicated on

the plan (Ref No BMR/1)    (Exh No).   It was in this position that

I attempted to resuscitate McGRATH as previously stated, whilst          I was

attempting to resuscitate McGRATH I was assisted by an auburn haired

St Johns Ambulance Woman.

I am shown on a photograph    (Ref No T0D1/15) attempting to resuscitate

McGRATH at that time administering external       cardiac massage.   I am

pictured kneeling besides .McGRATH with my back towards the camera.             I

am also shown on photog/aph    (Ref No T0D1/12)   standing to the right of

the hoarding again
                li n Wtt-i
                     with my back towards the camera.      On photograph

(Ref No T0D1/12)   I do not recognise the man kneeling down by

McGRATH,   on both of these photographs the supporter who     I saw trying

to resuscitate McGRATH when I first saw him by the centre line

(Spion Kop side)   is shown facing the camera and wearing blue jeans and

a red short sleeved   *T' shirt with his hands held behind his head.

After trying to resuscitate McGRATH and having been unsuccessful as

previously stated a jjoctor came and s a id McGRATH was dead.

I then carried McGRATH from the area indicated on plan (Ref No BMR/1)

to the gymnasium behind the North Stand.      Having viewed the visual

evidence   I can confirm that 1 am shown on photograph A H / 14 together

with /nother Police Officer who    I now know to be Police Constable

MA9QN and a further Police Officer and a supporter who I do not

recognise.   This photograph shows us lifting Kevlw McGRATH from ti

hoarding on the pitch in the location indicated on plan (Ref Nq/BMR/1)

just prior to us carrying Kevin McGRATH to the g^mrj^sium.       After

placing Kevin McGRATH in the temporary mortuary in the gymnasium.           I

returned to the pitch and had no further dealings with ifevin) McGRATH.

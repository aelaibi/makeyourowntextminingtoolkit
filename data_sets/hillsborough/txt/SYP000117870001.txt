At this point I tried to use my personal radio also in order to contact police control that
further police assistance was required urgently at the Lepping Lane end of the ground, but
each time I tried to use the radio I was blocking others already useing the radio, so I did
not try further to use it. I then tried to use the internal telephone system to contact the
police control, but again each time I tried the line was engaged and could not get through.
   this point Mr Lock then left the Video room in order to s s s x s ± x k x s x organise some safety
measures with his security personal.
Also present during this time in the Video room was a Mr Roger Holdsworth, he is the person
who installed all the videos and computor system. As he could also see what was tasix taking
*place he also left the room in order to assist in anyway he could.

After the incident I made a note of all the perple that had entered the ground as shown on
the computor and they are as follows.

Spion Cop            19*906.
North Stand           8,109.
South Stand Covered   ^7^0 .
South Stand Uncovered 3»255«
Lepping Lane,         7,038.
West Stand.           5»6l8.

            Total.   **8,666.

These numbers would not give a true reading of the eaact amount of persons entering the groun
due to the gates being opened and several hundreds entering thr groung without going through
the turnstiles.



I knew prior to the start of the match that it was an all ticket match, but on big football
^ t c h e s such as this you can always expect people turning up at the ground without tickets
and trying to gain access, by any means.

Under the ground regulations in respect of the amount allowed in each section of the ground
It is my duty to check with the computor of the amouut of persons who have enteredy-aSw*1;he
number of persons outside t|ie^ropnd ^about to enter, to make sure that no more persons are
allowed into that areaf'aSef^f l&ere are, to inform control to arrange for turnstiles to be
closed and for the persons outside the ground to be moved to an area where there is sufficient
room to accomodate them.  This is very important on a no ticket match where the numbers
attending are not known in advance.
On a ticket match that this rill becomes a kKxdtgHiHgx    watching brief, with the persons
turning up at the match without tickets,

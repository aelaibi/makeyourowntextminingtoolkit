    My dear Sir,

                                          Hillsborough Tragedy

         Through your association with Liverpool Football Club you are no doubt
    aware of the tragedy which took place in Sheffield on the 15th April.   Since
    that day there has been close co-operation between the flayers and staff at
    Anfield and the local Social Services Departments.   Indeed, today Prince Charles
    is visiting the Club to meet players, officials and social workers.

        We are now considering how to provide assistance to individuals and families
   as a result of the Hillsborough Tragedy.    The Municipal Authorities recognise the
   national scale- of the disaster given the vast area of this country from which the
   Club derives its support.    They also recognise the need for a novel approach to
   financing these services, drawing on the goodwill of everyone associated with
   football.

        I am attaching a report which deals with the need for co-ordination through a
   Regional Unit here in Liverpool at a cost of £350,000 per year for the next three
   years.   In addition to this it has been assessed that those areas most affected will
   have in total to find over £1 million per year to provide direct services to families
   and individuals in addition to the financial assistance available through the National
   Disaster Appeal Fund established following this tragic event.

        Currently we are exploring the possibility of financial support from our own
   Government, the European Commission, private companies, football authorities and
   individual benefactors.   Perhaps you will find it presumptuous that we are making
   this request to you.


                                                                         /continued

    Dear

                                       Hillsborough Tragedy

         As an Organisation concerned with football support and supporters I am writing
    to you to seek financial assistance in the provision of services for the victims of
    Hillsborough.   Yb'u .will be aware that immediately following these tragic events
    Social Services Departments have been at the forefront of Local Authority Services.
    The seven Authorities in Merseyside most affected, plus Sheffield and Nottinghamshire
    are working together to try to ensure a concerted response is maintained.

        Last Saturday the Leaders of the nine Local Authorities (Merseyside, Lancashire,
   Cheshire, Sheffield and Nottinghamshire) most directly affected considered the
   attached report and endorsed its principles.   They are asking that all avenues be
   explored in seeking financial support for both the Regional Unit to co-ordinate
   activities and local direct services in each area.

        The cost of the Regional Unit alone is £350,000 per annum and the local services
   will require annual expenditure of at least £1 million.   Other football organsiations
   such as the Football Association and the Football league are being approached as well
   as the Government, the E.E.C., private companies and benefactors.

        There has been a close working relationship established between the Club and
   the Social Services which we are keen to maintain, and extend to include all those
   groups associated with the game which will have the welfare of victims high amongst
   their priorities.


                                                               /continued

     We are 'seeking to finance the Unit and the direct services fpr three
years so any assistance you may be able to offer for this year and the next
two years would be greatly appreciated.

      I would, of course, on behalf of. the authorities participating, be prepared,
•at your convenience, to answer any questions.


                                     Yours sincerely,




                                     Director of Social Services.

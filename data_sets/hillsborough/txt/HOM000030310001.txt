       Dear Sir

        Thank you for your letter o f 12th June and the enclosed statements. Statement number R566D
        (Brooke) was not included, is this one o f the outstanding issues with SYP? In addition to
        those statements I have requested, R109 (Wallace) and R336 (Huckstepp) also appear to be
        missing.

        You refer to Sergeant John Morgan’s statement being allocated two document numbers, yet in
        other examples o f the same error occurring, both numbers have a copy o f the same statement.
        (Eg QOR2 and QOR46). You also include the statements o f QOR59 Sanderson as already
        being registered under R306. We have not yet been informed o f the relationship between the
        QOR and ORMNF files, but I query whether the same statement could be included in both
        systems.

        With reference to R293 (Illingworth), the copy we received from you was the amended
        version, and I should be grateful if you would forward a copy o f the original unamended
        statement.

        Thank you for your assistance.

        Yours faithfully

I thought I should let you know that Bob Whalley is temporarily
standing down from his post as Head of F6 Division in order to be
Secretary to Lord Justice Taylor's enquiry into the Hillsborough
football disaster. He will continue to work from his office in
Queen Anne's Gate but will not have day-to-day oversight of F6
Division's responsibilities.

For the time being, these will be discharged by Bob's deputy,
Brian Luetchford, who will act as Head of the Division. His
responsibilities, and those of the Principals and the Civil
Defence Adviser, remain unchanged.

I know I can look to you and your colleagues to bear with us all
while these temporary arrangements hold.

I am copying this letter to all members of the Police War Duties
Committee.

Dear David

Thank you for your letter of 10 June to Chris Smith, enclosing a copy of the letter that you have
sent to the Home Secretary following the Task Force's visit to Liverpool in May.

I would like to address the Football Supporters Association's concerns about perimeter fences, as
responsibility for the safety of sports grounds rests with this Department.

I have seen Graham Kelly's letter of 29 June to you on this same issue, and the Government is fully
in accord with the points he makes. The Government encourages the removal of perimeter fences
wherever possible, but recognises that this can only be achieved where the certifying authority,
club and members of the relevant emergency authorities are satisfied that adequate safety
management systems are in place to protect spectators. By the start of next season we hope that
there will be just eight grounds in England and Wales with perimeter fences. This represents a
considerable improvement on the position five years ago when some 57 grounds had perimeter
fencing. W e hope that similar progress can be made in Europe, where the UEFA guidelines on
perimeter fencing have been heavily influenced by the British approach.

I understand that the Home Secretary will be replying to the other points made in your letter, and
I am copying this letter to him for information.

POLICE CONSTABLE 951




1.          I reported      for duty at Rawmarsh Police Station at 8.00 a.m.

(0800) on Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489).                    At this time I was in full

uniform.     I was to be conveyed directly to Hillsborough Football Ground

by force coach, to be briefed for the day's duties.

2.          I was part     of serial 56 under the leadership of PS 2140 Taylor

from C2.     We were under the direct responsibility of Inspector Newey.

3.          Following      the   briefing in     the    North    Stand      at   the   football

ground, I was deployed with- the rest of my serial to Rawson Spring Road,

an industrial estate near to the bottom of Herries Road.                         At 11.15 a.m.

(1115) that date, I took up my position to direct the Nottingham Forest

contingent, to suitable parking places allocated within this industrial

estate.

The   football     fans   that   I saw   were         conducting      themselves       in a good

natured     and   lighthearted manner.          The    majority       had   parked     up    and

entered     the ground    at an early     stage.         On the approach of 3.00 p.m.

(1500)     the    roads    around Penistone       Road,        Herries       Road and Rawson

Spring     Road   were    almost   deserted.          There    were     the odd latecomer to
                                                                                                                     P AGE
                                                                                                                     R '107

the ground but the                 numbers were             not     so great as to              cause a n y        problems.

The    next       stage     of our      duties was           to a t t e n d C l a y w h e e l s L ane T r a f f i c

Office       for a cooked meal                 and f o l l o w i n g     this we were             to be on s t a n d b y

outside       the ground           on the P e n i s t o n e R o a d end.

At about 3 . 0 5 p m          (15050)      that       date,       I was       stood w i t h the          rest      of my

serial       at    the    corner      of P e n is to ne        R o a d and Herr i e s R o a d outs i d e                 the

C har l i e B r o wn shop.            We were a p p r o a c h e d            by a S u p e r i n t e n d e n t ,    who    had

just     emerg ed from the             football          ground,         he     immediately ordered                 us    into

the ground.

At this       time       I had no       idea what was               happening,           I e n t e r e d the ground

w ith the         rest    of my serial            t o g ether w i t h PS Tay l o r and                  I n spector

N e w ey who were           both    in p o ssession            of      police      radios.         As    I approached

the    playing a r e a from the en trance                         b et w e e n the N o r t h S t a n d and           the

S p i o n Hop,      I saw the         players        leaving           the    pitch and a large               crowd of

s p ectators        on the        pitch a r o u n d the L e p p i n g s Lane                end of the            ground.

My    immediate          r e a c t i o n was    that     there         had been a pitch              invasion        by the

L i verpool        fans.       I then      ran across             the    pitch to offer my as s i s t a n c e ,

there were          some Police           officers          present          but not many.

As    I moved       closer        to the goalmouth,                 I realised the full                  horror      of

what     had just         happened.            Fro m only a couple                 of feet a w a y         from the

perimeter          fences,        I could see          people were a l r e a d y dead,                   others were

t urning      blue a n d some were                having       difficulty            in breathing.

I i m m e d iately s u r v ey ed the situation,                         I shou t e d to the             people at the

fences       to wake        up,    I prodded them to sti m u l a t e                     them     into     bre a t h i n g

but all was          in      vain.        I then s ta r t e d           to shout        to the       supporters

b ehind to move             back,     but there was               no movement.              The    rest     of my

colleagues were              doing     the same.             E ve ry t h i n g was        in chaos,         there was

no guidance          on what        to do,        s pe c t a t o r s    were      climbing        over     the

perimeter         fences,         using    the bodies             crus h e d at the front as a ramp.

P o l ic e   off icers were           start i n g      to    pull       spectators          over     the    fence,        I
                                                                                                             P AG E
                                                                                                             R 107

tried but        found      I was     too* s m a l 1.      I then went          to gate        number 3      in the

perimeter        fence,       the    gate was       open but the exit from the                       terrace was

blocked by bodies.                  I then a ss i s t e d     in the dragging            out     of some         of

these        bodies    onto    the    pitch.        This    task was        h i n d e r e d by some      of the

fans a lr e a d y on the            pitch,    they were        pulling at us,            some were w a n t i n g

their        own relatives          and friends         dealing w i t h straight               away,    w h i c h was

impossible at this time.

I could then see that                 there a p p e a r e d    to be plenty of space                   to the

left     in the number S enclosure.                      I then shouted to the s p e c t a t o r s                    to

move     to the       left to ease the             crush on the         people at        the     front.          They

did not move so             I m o v e d over to this           part     of the ground myself,                    there

I d i s c o ve re d that       there was a fence              running       from front          to    back

holding       the     people    in sect i o n number 3.               As    I could do no more               at

this     stage,       I returned to gate            number 3,         there      I assisted           in the

removal       of a very h eavy man who was a p p a r e n t l y dead.                           Once    this man

was    removed,       we    could     clear a wa y through.

I then       climbed       into the number 3 enclosure,                     by this      time,        a space was

beginning        to    clear an d spect a t o r s w ere mo v i n g             backwards,            allowing a

rescue       effort     on the       bodies     crushed t o g ether at the               front.         As   I

assisted        in the      removal      of the     bodies,       I then r e a lised that               one of

the barriers          had g iv e n way half w a y up the                terrace.         Chief

S u pe ri n t e n d e n t Ne s b i t was     on the      other    side      of the     perimeter         fence,

he was       shou ting     for a chain to be formed                   to carry the bodies                aw a y

from the terrace and                 onto    the   pitch.        This      I con t i n u e d    to do until

all    of the       bodies had been           removed.        This      effort was        h a m p e r e d most         of

the time       by some of the            spec t a t o r s who were 'unscathed,                  they were

shouting an d jeering and some                     came a c r o s s     and    punched out at            the

P o l i ce   officers a tt em p t i n g       to rescue       the     victims at the             front.

W hen the terrace was                clear and the bodies               had been m o v e d to the

g y m n a s i um or to hospital,             I made my s e l f a v a i l a b l e      for other         tasks.

In the confusion I tried to help people who had lost friends etc.                     I then-

made my way to the centre of the pitch to other officers to try and find

the rest of my serial, this was not successful.               I then waitedwith other

officers from C2 to await further instructions.

At   4.30 p.m.     (1630)    that    date,   I returned    to Rawson Spring Road,           to

assist in the removal of the Nottingham Forest supporters.                    From there I

returned to Claywheels Lane,              then back to Rawmarsh Police Station.              I

booked off duty at 8.00 p.m. (2000) that date.

4.            The only thing I can think of that could be relevant in any way

to this enquiry is that the majority of the supporters at the Leppings

Lane side of the ground had been drinking.

On my arrival at the scene, whilst trying to shout to the crowd to move

back, some of the supporters were obviously unaware of what had happened,

they   were    shouting     abuse    at   the Police   and   the    tubular   part    of the

barrier was      thrown over the perimeter         fence     at    the Police.       At   this

stage, I had no idea what the barrier was that had been thrown, I only

became aware of the damaged barrier once I was inside the terrace.

5.            My reaction was to try and reason with the crowd, but this was

impossible, the crowd appeared to be beyond reason.

6.            I did handle bodies at the base of number 3 gate and inside                  the

number 3 terrace.           The bodies I moved from the base of the gate were

moved onto the pitch, there they were tended to by other services.                        The

bodies I helped to move             from the   terrace were passed along         a line of

Police.   I have no idea who the bodies were passed to.                I cannot give any

description of any of these that I passed on.                At this point, everything

was happening very quickly.

7.            I have   policed      several big matches      at Hillsborough Football

Ground in the past, for matches involving Sheffield Wednesday, I have
                                                                          PAGERS' 5

usually been miles away from the ground and had no part in the policing

of the crowd.       I was on duty on the Leppings Lane side of the ground in

1987 for the semi final between Leeds United and Coventry City, my duties

there entailed the orderly removal of Leeds supporters from their coaches

and into the ground.             I had occasion to arrest a supporter for being

drunk   and   he   was   disorderly    on a PSV.    In   1988,   I was   on duty    at

Hillsborough Football Ground for the semi final involving Liverpool and

Nottingham Forest.         On    this occasion my duties    included policing      the

outside of the Leppings Lane entrances to the terraces. There I searched

the Liverpool supporters on their arrival.         On this occasion there was no

late build up of supporters of the same scale as those I have witnessed

on the TV coverage of this year's event.

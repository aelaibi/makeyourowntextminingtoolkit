Dear Sir,
             THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER /

Why is it that every enquiry into this
disaster always avoids the real cause,
simply that "IF THE FANATICAL LIVERPOOL
SUPPORTERS WHO DID NOT HAVE TICKETS FOR
THE MATCH HAD STAYED AT HOME, THIS TRAGEDY
WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED !
100<* seating will not be a solution the
trouble is not in the grounds but outside
by fans who are hell bent in getting in
in spite of the grounds being full, having
no tickets, does not deter them they will
get in somehow even if it is all seating
they ar FANATICS” why waste money ?

                    Yours sincerely

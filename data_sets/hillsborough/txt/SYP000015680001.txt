 20 April 1989


Dear Dr Popper
I enclose herewith the results of the blood ethanol and other
analyses carried out at your request on the 94 bloods and on
tablet sample brought to me by Det/Sgt Turner on 18 April
1989.
There are some very unusual features in the blood samples.
Many contain significant amounts of acetone, which might
indicate either that some time had elapsed since consuming
food,  or possibly that at the time of death,        for other
reasons,  they were ketotic.   Also virtually all the samples
that contain alcohol also contain significant amounts of
acetaldehyde. Although acetaldehyde is the first metabolic
product of ethanol    it is normally present     in very    low
concentrations  in blood.   Certainly it is rarely,   if ever,
present in concentrations sufficient to be detectable in the
course of blood alcohol analysis by head space G C . I am doing
more work to elucidate this and I will report back to you as'
soon as possible. My first thought is that these phenomena
are a reflection of NADH- depletion due to hypoxia.

                                yours sincerely.

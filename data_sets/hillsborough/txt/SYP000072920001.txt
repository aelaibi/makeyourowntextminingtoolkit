                     On Saturday 15th April                    1989 (150489), I went to the FA Cup Semi-Final

                     match between Liverpool FC and Nottingham/forrest FC at Hi 11sborough

                     Football Ground.                I am a Li ver poolysuyporter.

                     I went to the match with a group of friends.                               We actually le»'ft from

                    Shrewsbury having been there for a stag party.                                                      ar owned
                                                                                           M K +ss
                     by one of the group.                     In the car were

                                                             Liverpool      (car o w n e r );                    (30 y e a r s ),

                                                                Liverpool;       and                 (27 y e a r s ),

                   April        (100489-120489).    I paid £6 for it and it was for the Leppings

                   Ln standing area, Liverpool area                       (Marked 23 51 LL3).

                   En route to the game we stopped for breakfast on the A5 near Cannock,

                   having        left Shrewsbury at about 8 ajtr^(0800) .              We travelled to

                   Sheffield w ith no problems,             a n / v i n g at about      1 1.30 am   (1130).    We

                   parked the car on the Sportsmans Pub car park w hich is not far from

                   the ground.

                   On our arrival, we went for a drink at that pub.                         The pub was f u l l of

                   Liverpool        supporters, most of them drinking, although nobody as far as

                   I could see was drunk.           We     left the pub at about 2 pm (1400) and

                   walked to the ground.           There was no drinking on the streets.                      I had

                   drunk about 5 pints of lag er.

                   Between the pub and the ground I only saw one                        incident of unruliness,

                   which was outside the Coach and Horses pub w here some lads were just

                   singing and sh out ing .        The     police turned up in a van but there were no

                   problems,        it was simply high spirits.

                   Between leaving the pub and arriving at the ground I received no

                   police direction or escort.

                   I attended the semi-final             last year at Hillsfr&rough and noticed that

                   there were not as many police officers around the ground as there w ere

                   last y e a r .

     £    it y '   I arrived at the entrance to the ground j t IT about 2.15 pm (1415) .

                   On my arrival at the ground there we^t? no queues that I could see,

                   there was just a mass of pe</ple ^i^und the turnstiles, all                          pushing and

                   shoving.         The only police      1/ c o j i l d   see were two officers on horseback_

                   near to the gates of the ground.                       All   I could see them doing was

                    ushing the horses up against                 people and they were signalling              people

                   to move over.         There were no other                police officers visible at that

                   po i n t .
G u ^ v
                   We had seen some        police officers on foot about                 150— 200 yards from the

                                                                                      S1718

         ground.      They told us to move down to the o/ffund and not hang around.

         I ;could not see any stewards outside ttye ground and I saw non inside.

         The     crush outside the tu r n s t K Les Jxframe oppressive and far more

         crowded than normal.         I joined the crowd and made my way towards the

         turnstiles.       I knew which turnstiles to use having been there before

         and using the map on the back of the ticket.

         It was very difficult to get to the turnstiles but eventually I got to

         the turnstiles and went through and handed my ticket            in retaining the

         stub part.

^ ^ j ^ O n getting       into the ground I saw one Police Ofiicer who was talking to

I       i a group offans.       They were pointing outside,     obviously     talking about

         the     crush.   All   I saw the officer do was shrug his shoulders.          In fact

          I spoke to the man taking the tickets at the turnstile and told him to

          hurry up taking tickets,       but he just took his time.

         By this time I had been split from my f ri end s, p-ffs        was just before 3

          pm ( -1500) .   Whilst trying to get into the q/tSund,      I saw about 4 or 5

          lads    climbing onto the wall on the l e f t ^ ^   the terrace turnstiles and

          showing their tickets to sorneboTdy inside the ground,            but I didn't see

         them or any others        climbing in.

         When     Ientered the ground I walked across         to stand next to the tunnel

         to see       if I could see any of my friends.       I knew I had to use the

         tunnel       because my ticket said I had to use Section B and the tunnel

         had a B above      it.    I could not see any police officers or stewards

         near the tunnel or controlling           it.

    *    Whilst standing there       I realised that the           concertina gates

         opposite the tunnel and lie:<t to the turjpti^fti 1es had been op e n e d .     I

         think there were two police offic&rs^py the gate, they were standing

          in the doorway itself.        There were people coming into the ground

         through the gates but it was just a mad rush.            I then decided to go

         down the tunnel and walked down it.            As I walked down there was no
                                                                                PAGE       4
                                                                                S 17 1 8

pushing or shoving or a rush.              I had fairly free passage down to the

t e rr ac es .

At the bottom of the passage,             I went left into pen 4 )of the terraces.

I have been shown a grid showing the two penj^.behind the goals and I

have marked with a * 1* where            I stood initially with a view to watching

the game.        I have marked it with a ’2 ’ where         I ended up after the

events that led to the disaster and point                ’3 ’ shows where   I had a man

I was helping to rescue taken from me by the police.

On first getting        into the terrace I realised that it was more            crowded

than normal and already it was fairly uncomfortable.                  I ca n ’t tell

what stage the match was at as I saw no part of it.                 Whilst standing

there the pressure from behind begji»"-to gradually increase,                so much so

that    I couldn ’t move a n y t h i ^ ^ a n d   I was pushed forward towards the

pitch.      I saw that _£ec)gfe_we r e , by now,       climbing out onto the    pitch

and over the fenca^T           This was at about the time the match was stopped

because     I remWber      the officer     running over to the referee.        I could

also see that people were being pulled up intp^the stands behind.

All around me I could hear people screan^iffig in fear and pain and you

could actually hear bones breaking,

Eventually I was pushed up against a barrier,                this being point    ’2 ’ on

the grid.        By this time things were easier although           still

un com for ta ble .    At one point before getting there I          had actually

fallen over       in the crush and I was trampled on but someone managed to

pull me up.

On getting to the barrier someone shouted/^ush back                 and when we did so

I saw there was a man lying on the^rj^fnd under the                 barrier.    A few of

us then stood round him to protect him whilst two men gave him first

aid.     The man on the floor was blue in the face and d i d n ’t appear to

be breathing.         He was a white male, about 5Q~6Q years old, he was not

a tall man,      stocky build,      greying hair,     going bald.   He was wearing a

                   red jumper and brown corduroy trjjrffsers,                    I have been told since then

                   that he was called John ANDERSOt/, a                                from                       I d o n ’t

                   know this for a fact but*-/x t ’s just what                  I have been told from others

               who were at the match.

               Two       lads tried to give him first               aid. I saw some            police officers

                   standing on the fence by the pitch.                    I managed to attract the

               attention of one of the officers                     and signalled            to him that I was with

                   someone who was dead.             He indicated to me to put my fingers down his

                   throat.      I bent down and told this to the lads giving him first aid.



                   A short time after that, 3 or 4 of us or even more,                              picked him up and

                   we managed to carry him towards a gate                   in the fence that was open.

                   Before getting to the gate we were grabbed from behind by three

                   officers.      One said,         "Out," and tried to pull us back into the
    *              terraces.      I said to the officers that we had a dead or injured man

                   and wanted to get him out.                The officer said,              "H e’s going out the back

                   way," and they took him off u s .

                   sure that this is the same fgarn we helped.                        ^

                   Near to us then I saw a girl on the floor.                          She was still being

                   stepped over, a lad was             pulling her up so I went and helped her up

                   She was unconscious but alive.                  We passed her out through the gate

                   onto the pit ch.

                   I tried to get out onto the pitch but t)p4 police stopped all able

                   bodied people getting onto the pitpTu                    So I just helped injured people

                   to get out grito the pitchy

                   One of the     people     I helpeV^off         the   floor    was    a    lad   in his     e a r l y 2 0 ’s,

                   a   bit   taller   t h a n me,   hi s   nose   obviously      broken and        he w a s    covered      in

                   blood.

                   After helping all the            people I could,        I looked round to see if I could
                                                                                           PAGE          6
                                                                                           S-17'18

                  see any of my friends.        Eventually,                saw me and came over

    ^\>v°         to me.     We looked for the others but couldn’t see them.

                  Just before seeing             I was approached by a high ranking police

                  officer.     He was wearing a flat cap, with silver on the peak.          He said

                  to me,   "Calm down, y o u ’re alright," because by that time I was quite

                  upset and crying.     He then said to me,     "Do you know what caused it?"

                  I simply pointed my finger at him and said,        "You should know w h a t ’s

                  caused it."

                  After    looking round with          we walked out through the tu n ne l and

                  carried on looking for our f rierids .      Eventually we met up with most of

                  them and we left the ground.        This was about 3.45 pm <1545),      this

                  being of our own accord.

                  At the time I could not see why there was such a crush and surge,                At

                  no time did I witness anything that I consider to be a criminal

                  offence.

                  1 would like to say that the crowd seemed J f S take over the running of

                  the incident.     The police d i d n ’t seenydfo know what to d o .   In fact,     I

                  saw one officer    in the West Standyjfooking down when the disaster was

                  starting with fans shaking him/and pointing down.          He just stood there

                  looking, he never even ysetj/nis radio. The police just stood and
            \                            V
                * watched.  I did see the firemen come in and they were great and worked
                                          ---------
'                 hard to help pe ople.

                  I would also like to point out that the fcA             to make Liverpool

                  travel the farthest for all the big m a t c W s    and the t icket allocation

                  was all wrong a s usual, and it ’s obvious that the North of the country

                  needs a big stadium to accommodate the large number of fans that are

                  in the area.

                  As a result of the incident I                                         although

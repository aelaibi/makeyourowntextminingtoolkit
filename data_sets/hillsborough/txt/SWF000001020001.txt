                                    Halcrow found a difference between the areas of the West
                                    Terrace and North West Terrace calculated from the Ralph
                                    Brade drawings when compared with the Eastwood drawings.                      For
                                    the West Terrace Eastwood & Partners used an area of 1480

           metres of an exit or gangway and the height, gaps and

    2      Given   the    configuration      of   the   Vest   Terrace    the
           decision by        Eastwood    and Partners that it was not
           practical     to     provide    gangways     was    a   reasonable
           decision.     A reduction in standing area of 10% was made
           by Eastwood and Partners to allow for the non provision
           of gangways.

                          3   It la agreed that gaps in the barriers were sometimes
                              too wide, too narrow or In an appropriate place.


                          4   It     is   agreed    that    some     barriers          appropriate     to
                              physically control crowd flow were absent.


                          5   It is Agreed that cross hatch painting on the ground
                              was the only form of sign (on the terracing).


                          6   Some    barriers      were     lower       than     the        Green   Guide
                              recommended limits and tall people would not find such
                              barriers as effective in resisting crowd pressure from
                              behind as one of the recommended height.                       Low barriers
                              are not completely ineffectual to prevent crowd loading
                              flowing      over    although       some     transmission         of   crowd
                              pressors would occur over the top of the barrier.


                          7   Some barriers Including 124a were of a design which, if
                              designed     for     the    recommended load             of 5 kN/m were
                              stressed beyond the elastic limit.


                              The older barriers were about 59 years old, corroded
                              and In several cases had been repaired.                         (Blrond say
                              frequently which is believed to be misleading.)


                              The deflection under design load was in some cases in
                              excess       of     the    recommendations          in    BS     6180: 1982
                              "Protective       Barriers     in    and about           Buildings".     The
                              limitation of deflection in BS 6180 is included so
                              that, although the barrier may be structurally safe the
                              public are not alarmed by movement when the barrier is
                              subject      to    normal    service       loads.        The     Green Guide
                              permitted deflections are written in terms of recovery
                              and not      overall deflection.            Halcrow       donot consider
                              the deflection limitations in BS6180 to be appropriate
                              for sports ground crush barriers and handrails.

                       8a   Barrier teat on 123 was witnessed by Halcrow and failed
                            as noted.


                       8b   Barrier     test    on   128A was witnessed by Halcrow and
                            failed as noted.


                       8c   The other tests were not witnessed by Halcrow and                 as
                            yet have sot received the results.           However there is no
                            reason    to   doubt      the       statements      made by Blrond
                            Engineering, although 'passed doubtfully' appears to be
                            somewhat biased.


                       9    Barrier   124a would have been failed by Halcrow or at
                            least retested in 1983 and 1988.


                            She   interpretation        of      the   Green    Guide as to   the
                            Keference point for recovery of deflection as used by
                            Eastwood and Partners is a possible interpretation                of
                            the Green Guide but it is not considered to be a sound
                            engineering one.


                            Halcrow     agree    with    the     last   statement     concerning
                            working or field notes.


                       10   (1st paragraph)


                            Loading of two adjacent            spans does attract load       tothe
                            central support.         It isconsidered that failure of         the
                            rail is likely to occur          by fracture at the support but
                            collapse of the rail under 6 kN/m test load is unlikely
                            to have occurred.


                            (2nd paragraph)


                            This statement is agreed.

         11   The stated capacity of the West Terrace vat too high
               and some barriers were inadequate.


D        Conclusion


         Lack of barrier height would allow some transmission of crowd
         pressure across the barrier.         The absence of barriers in line
         frost the tunnel would have contributed to the pressure on
         124a but the degree of the Increase is arguable.


         1    This    statement is agreed.


         2    This    statement is agreed.


         3    This    statement is agreed.


         4    (1st    sentence) Halcrow consider           that intheir          opinion
              barrier      124a   collapsed     at   or    about    the     test    load
               (6 kN/m).


         4    (2nd    sentence) No comment.


         5    This    statement is agreed.


         6    (1st    sentence) Halcrow consider           that that      the barrier
              124a collapsed at or about 6 kN/m and the suggested
              collapse load of 5.25 kN/m is too low


         6    (2nd sentence)       It is not understood exactly whether
              "this loading" refers to failure load or load on the
              barrier.     The load on the barrier is not likely to be
              greatly      affected   by      barrier     height.      It    will    be
              influenced     by   the positioning         or   absence      of     other
              barriers such as 144, 136A and 136.

                        6     (3rd sentence)    The collapse load of a barrier DESIGNED
                              to 5 kN/m will be greater than the failure load of
                              5*25 fcff/n predicted by Elrond


                        7     Capacities were ascribed by the Engineer (Sastwood and
                              Partners) for each pen although Halcrow consider they
                              were    incorrect;     provision of such figures does not
                              cause overcrowding or control crowd entry.             The pens do
                              not need to be self contained and provided with a
                              counting management system if           a     satisfactory   crowd
                              management system is operated.         The sentence "If such a
                              system ....      each pen"     is considered       irrelevant   and
                              impractical.


                        8     Signs would have been desirable but lack of signs was
                        8a & not causative of the disaster.          Effective monitoring of
                        8b    the filling of the pens would           have indicated to the
                              Police which were measures needed to close off areas or
                              direct incoming spectators to less occupied parts of
                              the terrace.


                        8 c   The gates at the rear of the radial fences cannot be
                              regarded    as   an    effective    method    of   lateral   crowd
                              distribution;     they are two unit widths wide while the
                              entries to pens 3 and 4 from the tunnel are each about
                              3 unit widths.        The use of these gates would not have
                              relieved   the    pressure     on   barrier    124a,   which was
                              generated from the crowded tunnel,            because of their
                              position off the line between the tunnel and barrier
                              124a.


                        8d    This statement is agreed.

â¢HiÂ® pitch perimeter gates were not causative of the
disaster.   They did not comply with the 1.1 n width
requirement in the 1986 Green Guide (not required in
the 1976 edition).   All the gates were installed before
**Â»â¢ appearance of the 1986 edition.   Upgrading of all
gates was likely to have been dealt vith in due course
hut such action was not urgent.   The Green Guide does
not require the gates to be capable of being opened
from the inside and given the function that a pitch
perimeter fence fulfils it would probably have been

              COMMENTS OK THE DUTIES OF THE BHGISEKK


              2.3      [a]   Halcrow     consider     that        the    "normal      standards       of
                             engineering etcâ were adopted by Eastwood and partners
                             although, some of the interpretation of the Green Guide
                             was questionable.


              2.3      [b]   Eastwood and Partners appear to have conformed with the
                             guidance of "Appraisal of Engineering Structuresâ' In
                             relation    to   the    ground       structures.         However,      this
                             guidance does not appear to have been followed for
                             crush     barriers     particularly         in    regard    to    visible
                             defects     (deformed      rails      and    support       stands)      and
                             recommendations for carrying out barrier tests, where
                             the requirements of the Green Guide have been generally
                             followed.


              2.3      [c] Specific but       incorrect capacities for each pen were
                             identified by Eastwood and Partners in 1979 and also
                             after the 1981 alterations and these were communicated
                             to the Club.     Specific capacities were also identified
                             on Eastwood      and Partners drawing No 8945/1A,                      first
                             drawn in April 1987.         She importance of these figures
                             was perhaps not underscored in communications with the
                             Club.


              2.3      [d] Generally      safe    means      of    access       and   egress        were
                             identified but signing could have been Improved.


              2.3      [e] The need to calculate the capacities for individual
                             pens was identified although the capacities determined
                             were    incorrect    due     to    drawing       distortion      and    the
                             alignment of gaps in barriers.                   The spacing between
                             rows of barriers was in accordance with the Green Guide.

             2.3       ff] The capacity of individual pens was addressed.               It was,
                             however, incorrect.


             2.3       Cg] There was a system of control            to allow closing off of
                             the pens.   Closing off the tunnel had been carried out
                             by the Police at the 1988 FA Cup Semi Final.


             2*3       [h] The gates in the radial fences were not appropriate for
                             transferring large volumes of spectators from pens 3
                             and 4 to adjacent pens.             When   pens    3 and    4 were
                             approaching capacity the access to them through the
                             tunnel should have been closed and pens 1/2 and 6/7
                             filled via their main entrances at the ends of the West
                             Stand.


             2.3       [ij This statement is agreed.          The recommendations were not
                             fully Implemented,         /'tv/ejMAe/ gcaj t,                          1


             2.3       [J]   Emergency   escape        was   investigated by      Eastwood     and
                             Partners.


             2.3       [k]   Eastwood and Partners were aware that the publication
                             of the 1986 Guide contained a specific reference to
                             pitch perimeter gates to be 1.1              metres wide.         The
                             previous edition did not have such a reference.              It was
                             not   necessary      to     immediately     Implement      such     a
                             modification.


             2.3       Â£1]   It is considered that a satisfactory testing procedure
                             for the barriers          should have been adequate        without
                             recourse to design calculations.           The Green Guide lays
                             down a testing procedure in Annex G to be applied when
                             guidelines are first applied to a ground,


             2.3       [m]   This statement is agreed.

              2.3        [n]   It    is   not   clear      Which    British         Standard     is     being
                               referred to.          The barriers did not all conform with
                               BS6180 oa deflection but it is argued that such a
                               criterion is not appropriate for crush barriers.                           The
                               Creen Guide does not lay down a total deflection limit
                               but sets out a test procedure for existing barriers
                               based on recovery of deformation.                A properly performed
                               test Should therefore be sufficient.


              2.3        Co]   A recognised procedural method was used for testing the
                               barriers - the test procedure in the Creen Guide was
                               adopted although this is not clear on several points.
                               The resulting test procedure was deficient in quantity
                               and detail recording of some results and lacking in
                               their analysis.


              2.3        [p]   It is not considered that a programme of measuring
                               material content and age beyond identifying the types
                               of material (which was done) was appropriate in the
                               presence of a procedure laid down in the Green Guide
                               for testing EXISTING crush barriers.                   Severe corrosion,
                               ie holes and other severe wastage and badly deformed
                               barriers should have been rectified.


              2.3        [q] It     is considered that it was recognised that failure of
                               a    barrier     in     a   crowded       situation            could     have
                               catastrophic effects.


              2.3        [r] It     is thought that "too high" should read "too low".
                               The fact that some of the barriers were too low was not
                               causative of the disaster.


              2.3        [s] The spacing between rows of barriers was appropriate.


              2.3        ttj It     Is agreed that the gaps between barriers (both in
                               width and alignment) were inappropriate.

             2.3         tÂ«J   It is not known how Eastwood and Partners originally
                               produced their ground plana.               Somewhere in the process
                               errors crept in as the dimensions do not agree vith the
                               ____________ drawings.          Some checking of dimensions by
                               Eastwood    and     Partners    would        hare      been    useful   and
                               prudent.


             2.3         [v]   It   ia    agreed     that     some     barriers       were    needed    to
                               deliberately interrupt human flow.


              2*3        [w]   It is not considered that proper signing was incumbent
                               on the Engineer.       The lack of signing was not causative
                               of the disaster.

                           It is considered that the going of the Vest Terrace can be

                           The pens do not ftave to be self contained.


                           The effectiveness of providing additional gates at the front
                           of the radial fences is questionable.

                           The distances between rows of barriers was generally regular

                           It is likely that gaps in crush barriers would be difficult
                           to locate wherever they were in a crowd.

                   What error is meant here is not clear; it is assumed that it

                       The Creen Guide provides recommendations of good practice
                        aimed   at   ensuring      the     safety of spectators.         Elrond    in
                        itemising Instances where the recommendations have not been
                        observed have        described      these as â¢ BREACH OF DUTY             and
                        ascribed     a    significance      which in many     instances     is    not
                       justified.        Many of the supposed 'breaches' would be rendered
                        inconsequential       if   crowd     control and     Management     of     an
                        appropriate level for the circumstances had been provided.


                        Therefore the following comments are made not in relation to
                        BREACHES OF DOTY but non-compliance with the Green Guide.


                        It is considered that the following were not instances of
                        non-compliance with the Green Guide recommendations:


                        k       Terrace      not    self     contained   -    not    a     specific

                APPENDIX K - REPORT OF DE BUCKS


                1.3        Barrier 128 had been tested by Eastwood and Partners on 16
                           April 1989 in accordance with the Green Guide Test load of 6
                           kN/m end then to a higher load.      A load of 9 kH/netre was
                           apparently sustained.    It is not surprising that there are
                           permanent deformations in the rail and leg.


                1.5        Barrier 137 had been tested by Eastwood and Partners on 6
                           April 1989 in accordance with the Green Guide Test load of 6
                           k9/m and then to a higher load.     A load of 7.5 kN/metre was
                           apparently sustained.    The deformations noted are therefore
                           not surprising.


                1.6        Inadequate strength may be a misleading term.       Loading up to
                           6 kH/o generally stresses the rails and internal legs beyond
                           the elastic limit.


                2.1        The comments are agreed but also:


                2.1        [iii]   The reinforcement at the base of the legs appears to
                                   be long standing and before 1979.


                2.2        The existence of repairs does not mean that all the old style
                3.1 - barriers should be replaced.         Halcrow have stated that taken
                3.5        overall the older type barriers inspected in 1990 were not
                           considered to be in a condition such that a clean bill of
                           health could be given solely on       the   basis       of   a   visual
                           inspection.   There were a number of matters requiring further
                           investigation,    particularly the permanent deformations and
                           corrosion under the strap.    It is considered that even making
                           allowance for the testing on 16 April 1989 and any damage at
                           the time of the disaster, some of the permanent deformation
                           would have been visible prior to 15 April 1989.

                              It is considered that the evidence available shows that the
                              Club relied on Eastwood and Partners for all natters relating
                              to crush barriers and their testing.


                APPENDIX L - STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF BARRIER SUPPORTS


                Consents on Elrondâs analysis are given elsewhere.          Their sectional
                 elevations of the barrier illustrating the failure mode are badly
                drawn, stags 4 being misleading as to behaviour.         It is assumed that
                where yield is noted this is commencement of yield at a part of the
                 cross section.        If this is so the section will have some reserve of
                 strength until the whole cross section has yielded,           ie complete
                 failure will be at a slightly higher load.


                 APPENDIX 0 - RIBA EVIDENCE


                 The comment made by RIBA about perimeter fencing and highlighted by
                 Slrond is at variance with the guidance given in the Green Guide.

                       Turnstiles


                       Thorburn is of the opinion that no              reasonably     competent
                       engineer vould have           resisted the   introduction of        radial
                       fences in 1981 and 1985 because of the lack of separate
                       turnstiles.


                       Comment:

                       The original Eastwood proposals in 1981 and 1985 both showed
                       a     reasonable    number    of   spectators   to    be   admitted    per
                       turnstile and each area with its own entrance/exit.             There is
                       no evidence of Eastwood and Partners advising the Club of
                       proceeding without turnstile groupings/segregation.


            5.2        The Semoval of Barrier 144


                       Thorbum is of the opinion that Eastwood and Partners acted
                       reasonably in not opposing the Police's request                to   remove
                       barrier 144.       The Police request may have been reasonable but
                       for Eastwood and Partners to agree to remove two spans of it
                       without any further action was ill advised.                 Barrier 144
                       would have interrupted the flow of people from the tunnel by
                       enforcing a 90Â° turn and therefore prevented the build up
                       of high crowd pressures due to uninterrupted downhill crowd
                       flow and surge.

                      5.3      Width of Perimeter Gates


                               Thorbum is of the opinion that the Licensing Authority had
                               already approved the numbers and            widths of gates in the
                               perimeter fence and that Eastwood and Partners had no reason
                               to challenge this decision and acted reasonably in accepting
                               the situation.      Re was also of the opinion that wide gates in
                               perimeter fences can present a hazard by people 'falling out*
                               when the gates were opened.


                               The above is fair comment.             However, the 1986 Green Guide
                               (but not the 1976 Guide)             specifically states         that     pitch
                               perimeter gates should be a minimum width of 1.1 metres.
                               Widening should eventually have taken place as part of an
                               ongoing    programme     of    ground     improvement      but      was       not
                               considered of immediate priority or to have been causative.


                      5.4      The Testing of Crush Barriers and           the Collapse of Barrier
                               124a


                               It   is considered that the Eastwood Test Rig is suitable
                               equipment for the testing of crush barriers                    testing        two
                               adjacent    spans   at   a    time   provided     that    it   is    properly
                               assembled and operated.       It is not accepted that the Eastwood
                               method of calculating recovery is on a sound engineering
                               basis.     The measurement of deflection at only one midspan
                               point was insufficient and masked what was really happening
                               at   the central support in the           test.     The    rig      was   also
                               distorted by previous mistreatment and it is likely that
                               tightening of the pivot nuts and             this distortion had on
                               occasions caused partial         fixity at the joints and thus a
                               different load distribution to that intended.


                               It is not considered that the barrier 124a was subjected to a
                               load significantly greater than the test load in the disaster
                               and that the barrier collapsed at or about the test load.

                           Fair comment.


                  5.7      Exit Routes and Means of Escape


                           Thorbum states that he had no evidence made available to
                           indicate that the access or egress through the tunnel was
                           unacceptable or hazardous.              It is considered that given the
                           physical constraints of the tunnel spectator amenity could
                           have been improved by the installation of handrails.


                           It    is   accepted    that   a    gangway       system     would    have     been
                           difficult to implement without extensive remodelling of the
                           terrace*


                           The     gates   in   the   perimeter         fence were      not    required      to
                           evacuate pens 3 and 4 in 8 minutes if It is accepted that the
                           exit from pen 3 to the tunnel is equivalent to 3 unit widths.


                           Certified Capacity of Terrace


                           Eastwood and Partners carried out capacity calculations and
                           provided capacity figures to the Club for the West Terrace in
                           1979 and it is assumed that these were approved by the Local
                           Authority       as    they    were          Incorporated     in     the     safety
                           certificate.     Eastwood provided a split of these figures into
                           three pens in November 1981 after erection of the first two
                           radial fences.        Eastwood and Partners advised the Club on a
                           capacity figure and it would appear that they regarded this
                           as one of their duties albeit that that figure was subject to
                           approval by others.

                          It is considered that the loading applied to barrier 124a at
                          collapse was not          significantly greater        than the      loading
                          stipulated by the Green Guide.              It is believed that the
                          barrier 124a collapsed at or about 6 kN/m.


              5.9         Gradient of the Tunnel


                          It is considered          that spectator amenity would have               been
                          improved by the provision of handrails dividing the steepest
                          section of the tunnel into 3 lanes of 1.1 metre width.
                          Without handrails         the gradient is a potential hazard to
                          spectators.


                          The local gradient in the tunnel with spectators entering the
                          ground     could    present    a   hazard    under    heavy     crowd    flow*
                          Forward momentum of a crowd would lead to the likelihood of
                          pushing    end     pressure    transmission.       Absence      of handrails
                          deprived those of a means of arresting momentum and providing
                          stability     in    the   event of tripping,         slipping or pushing
                          incidents.


                          Pressures built up in the tunnel could have been transmitted
                          onto the terracing in the absence of barrier 144.                  There was
                          a considerable distance for crowd pressure build up from the
                          tunnel to barrier 125.             Barrier 136A would not          serve to
                          perform the same function as barrier 144*


              6.1         Height of Crush Barriers


                          Thorbum produces a figure of 0.975 m as the minimum height
                          of crush barrier which may be permitted above the surface on
                          which a spectator is standing. The source of this information
                          is   not   known    as    he   also says the University of Surrey
                          apparently concluded a preferred height of 1.05 metres (cf
                          Green Guide preferred height of 1.1 metres).
        Dr   Eastwood has    stated    that   the   location    of   the    crush
        barriers leads spectators to stand on the step immediately
        below the rail rather than the one above.              Thorbum states
        that the mean, height of the lower barriers (older!> is 0.90
        metres from a range of 0.83 to 0*95 metres.            If the barrier
        is one where spectators stand on the step Immediately below
        the rail the mean height complies with the 0*975 m minimum
        (0*90 mean + 0.85 mean rise m 0.985).


        If the Eastwood argument is accepted some barriers would
        still be up to 70 mm lower measured to the top of the rail.
        Ho comment can be offered on the validity of the 0.975 m
        figure but   the    use   of   the Green Guide     limits     and    the
        recommendation to measure the height from the nosing behind
        the barrier is preferred.


        The statement 'Common Usage has demonstrated that spectators
        in the West Terrace accepted the heights of the barriers* has
        little meaning unless some study of the views of spectators
        was carried out.     Merely because spectators have used the
        barriers and appear to 'accept* them does not mean that they
        are satisfactory.


        However, it is not considered that the height of the barriers
        were causative of the disaster.

               R E P O R T BY PC       1934 S M I T H     (SERIAL 31)



                I report        that     I am     currently s t a t i o n e d at A.S Thorne Su b D i v i s i o n on

                beat duties at Thorne and Hatfield.

                At 8.4 5 am on Saturday,                  15th April       1989,         I came on duty at Doncaster

                D i visional H e a d q u a r t e r s and was            transported,         w i t h other            officers,            to

                H i l l s b o r o u g h Football       S t a d i u m for briefing          in the m ain s tand at 9.3 0 am

                that date.

A    W>\        I was a member             of PS P e a rsons       details,        Serial 31,        our duty being                       to

0   (n Ift)     supervise         crowd      control at the         roundabout at the j u n c t i o n of Leppings

                Lane and P e n i s t o n e R oad w i t h specific                regard to the Liverpool

                s u pporters        coming       to the ground from the                  coach park an d W a d s l e y

                Br i d g e    railway station.

                At   11.00 am that            date,      w i t h my serial,        I took up thip                point.

                Th r o u g h the morning,             s u pporters a r r i v e d and all a p p e a l e d                 in jovial

                mood,        looking     forward to the match.                  There was m          animosity                       far as

                I could detect             from the s upporters and e verything a p p e a r e d                               to be a

In fact,        every t h i n g a p p e a r e d to be the same as                 last y ears       similar

fixture,        a m a t c h that      I was also              on duty for at a similar              point.

The day        continued         in m u c h the same way,               and    it a p p e a r e d as though the

game was        going        to be well a t t e n d e d         by good natured football              supporters.

I saw nothing             to suggest any               problems at       this    time,    except     the odd

fan being s t o p p e d by a Police Officer and told to                                leave any      cans of

beer     behind.          I could see some               fans    sitting on walls and drinking

their        cans,     but nothing          to suggest          problems and        it was     only the

occasional            fan.     I had not          cause       to speak     to anyone      except     to give

directions            or a s s i s t a n c e as to where           the various       e n trances were at

the ground.

B y 3 .0 0     prrKthe crowds         coming dawn P e n i s t o n e Roa d to the gr o u n d had

s u b sided to & mere             trickle        of\fans,        all    still    in good h u m 0 4 4 r and

causing rtp problems,                certainly no more                 th&jj 100^5eople and they were

s pread out as            though they hadT~arrived late                       in private     cars.

At this        time,      because     there were              no more    crowds,     our serial       with

PS Pearson,            began to mak e our way                  back to the ground.

By a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 .10     pm we a r r i v e d at          the metal     gates at       the

Leppings Lane             entrance,         where       I could see a cordon of Police Officers

but very few supporters.                         We were       d i r ected to assist        here,    but at

this time        I could see no              reason for the             cordon.

A few minutes             later,     it became           clear     that a serious         incident was

taking        place      inside     the ground.               I saw several        fans   being e s c orted by

Police Officers               from the ground by the                   turnstiles.

I could see by their                 faces        that they were           in great distress and                it

became obvious               that they were             not    being a r r e s t e d but a s s i s t e d   by

        Police.         At this          time   I heard the a n n o u n c e m e n t      that a serious         problem

        had occurred            inside      the ground and that                several    people were         injured,

        ambul a n c e s                been requested and              I was   directed by an Inspector,
                                ‘V,.

        w hom    I do not know,             to go down the service                road at the       rear of the

        south stand to as s i s t a m b u l a n c e s                to an d from the ground.

    ^   I went down the service                   road and w ith the help of some                   fans and other

|f      officers,           we m o v e d one or two          parked vehicles so that               the service

        road was        clear.

        I did not have a personal                        radio       issued to me and so         I went   to the

        control       box at           the side of the south stand and                   informed them that the

        service       road was           clear for amb u l a n c e and eme r g e n c y service            vehicles.

        I s u ggested that a m b u l a n c e s             should       come   in from L e p p i n g s Lane and

        that     they should             leave via P e n i s t o n e R o a d and thus keeping a smooth

        flow.       Some a m b u l a n c e s     stopped at the Police Control                   entranc e      to the

        ground and           loaded victims from this                    point,   but for the most          part the

        a mbu l a n c e s    came from Leppi n g s L^ne.
                                                                 i
        I remained at C h i s              location to ensure              the free      passage of e m e rgency

        vehicles and a s s i s t e d one or two                      injured fans with first aid where                   I

        could and helped thejn into wai t i ri^, a m b u l a n c e s .                                    v

        It would be about 5 . 3 0                pm w hen        I was    e v e n t u a l l y stood down frata this

        duty and        I then          returned to the mai n stand for d ebriefing at 6.00 pm.

        I did not see any gates                   opened,         nor did      I see any surge       in crowd

        numbers       prior      to the kick off,                except    for a few      late    comers.       I saw

        nothing       that w o u l d suggest a sudden                    influx of s upporters at 3 .00 pm.

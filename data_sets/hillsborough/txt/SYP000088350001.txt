                    I am a qualified mortuary technician! I qualified in June 1989

                    (U00689) at Rotherhairs I have worked at the Northern General Hospital

                    for the past three and a half years (3 1/2)                    years.    At the time of

                    the Hillsborough incident I was not qualified in fact i was studying

                    for“ my e k amintions.

                    On Saturday 15th April            1989 (1504895,        it was my day off and I was at

                    home,       At arcydnd 4.45 pm (1645)          I received a telephone call from

                                           and he asked me to go the hospital because there had

                    been a major disaster.             AT/ that stage I d i d n k n o w     any mare details.

                    I made my wav to t.he hos/iital mortuary arr/vinq there at about 5»c.0

                    pm   ( '\ f'c.u > .                 and                       f rom the histopathology

                    labs were already there I was told to contact                                     who was

                    over in casaulty.            I spoke with him and he informed me that there nad
been a disaster at the H il ls bo ro ug h football                         ground and that a number

of    people    had died.                         told me to stay at the m o r t u a r y and make

sure    that the       bodies were          booked       in properly and that e verything was

being    done       correctly.         1 assis t e d                          ancl

book    the bodies          in as they arri v e d from the                plaster     room w h i c h was

being used as a t em po r a r y mortuary.                      The    clothing was also         being

brought       across wit h the bodies.

A number       of    people       including       relatives,         and friends      of sus p e c t e d dead

people along with social                  workers        kept a r r i v i n g at the m o r t u a r y    trying

to    identify their             respective       relative/friend.            I did not do any

i de nt i f i cat io ns »

•Sometime      later       the    same day     I was      informed by                   that    the     bodies

had got       to be transf e r r e d        to the H i l l s b o r o u g h football       ground.        An

a m b ul a n c e arri v e d and two         (2)    or three       (3)   of the bodies         together

wit h t h e i r p r o p e r t y were       placed     i ns i d e a nd t ra ns ferred t o

Hillsbor ough.                         t r a velled      in the first ambulance            with the

bodies.

Over    a period of time all                of ti>/ remaining           bodies were also

transterred.

I remember          that                           ana                        collected a body yfrom

the    GITU    (General          Intensive Treatinen                    ) I cannot     be surV'of        the

time    but    it was       fairly     late   on probably some             time between 8.3 0           pm - 9

pm    (2030 ~ 2100).              It a rr i v e d at the m o r t u a r y just        before    the     last

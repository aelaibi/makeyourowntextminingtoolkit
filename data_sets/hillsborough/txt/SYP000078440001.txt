           I am a Detective Constable          in the South Yorkshire Police             presently

           stationed at Main St Police Station, R o t he rh am .

           At 8.30am (0830) on Saturday 15th April                    1989 (150489),   I reported for

           duty in full       police uniform at Main St Police Staion.                 Dut i es were

           given for policing the FA Cup semi-final football match between

           Liverpool A n d Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Football Ground

           Sheff is4d .

           HILL vand DAY.              the officers     I was working with were in uniform

           and were all from Main Street Police Station.

           We were transported to Hillsborough Football Ground where we were
                                                                       PAGE      2

briefed by senior officers,     we then wem,   in ourr serials to our first

phase which was before the footbal1 A a t c h .   /

We walked to our points which wersy on Wardend Rd off Halifax Rd were

our duties were to park up mini Mouses of fans which had come down the

motorway.    I say that the time would be around 11.00am (1100).

We were there for some time before any mini buses started to arrive

and when they did so they were in dribs and drabs and I would say that

the majority of people      in the mini buses were young men from late

teenagers to early twenties.      They were Liverpool    supporters and they

were   in good spirits.

The mini    buses were   parked up to the left hand side of the road half

on the pavement as we expected to have to line Wardsend Rd on both

sides.     The supporters   in good humour and I spoke with large numbers

of them about the match and the prospects of their team.

Our duties also included checking the mini        buses and vans for drink

and also checking the tickets of the fans.

The mini    buses arrived steadily throughout the morning and into the

afternoon and in the early part of the afternoon we began to use a

car park about half way up Wardsend Rd to fill        that up.   At this stage

I would estimate that we had only parked up around twenty vehicles or

so.    Some of the mini buses were small type coached vehicles and these

had drivers who stayed with the vehicles.         Again I talked to the

driver of one vehicle who stated he would stay with the vehicle

throughout the whole time.

When we started to park the vehicles in the car park because of the

small numbers of few private cars came into he car park and we allowed

them to park there although strictly we were told mini buses only.

There were around four cars at this stage mainly consisting of men

with their sons,    some of these stayed and had sandwiches before they

made their way to the ground.
                                                                    PAGE      3
                                                                    S2270

It was now around two o clock and more mini buses began to arrive

again many of them containing youths and young men.       The majority of
                                                                              I
these had been drinking and there were empty cans in the backs of the

vehicles,   the youths   left the vehicles and just sauntered down towards

the ground not appearing    to be in any rush.    Again because of the

small   number of minx buses private cars were being let through to

park and even though this happened the car park only got full      just

before we left.

Our brief was to remain at Wardsend Rd until the kick off or shortly

before and them we    were to make   our way towards Claywheels Ln to meal.

We all assembled around three o      clcock at the end of Wardsend Rd and

together with Detective Sergeant TISSINGTON we made our way down

Halifax Rd.     This was the first time that morning that I had been to

that end because I was up at the top of Wardsend Rd parking the

vehicles up.     There were still people running down the road towards

the ground,    only a few people on both sides of the road.

Halifax Rd all the    way down was littered both sides with cans and

bottles of alcohol    they were lines of cans and bottles on the wall

outside the few house and shops on the road and also outside the two

public houses at the bottom The Travellers and The Gate.

We made our way onto Claywheels Ln intending to go for our meal as we

were on there we met up with other officers and I remember seeing our

Detective Inspector CHARLES who was in charge of other serials on that

day.

There was a radio message asking for officers to attend at Leppings Ln

end of the ground.

We stopped where we were and Inspector CHARLES asked over the radio if

we were required to attend.     There was a lot of traffic on the radio

but we were asked to attend, we made our way down to the area and we

lined up in our serials at the junction of Vere Rd.
                                                                    PAGE                4

I remember I ns pec tor’CHARLES a nd Sergeant TISSINGTON a nd another

Inspector who went off towards the ground.          All our serial was there

and there were around four to five other serials with us.               Police

Constable LAWRENCE was in another serial and I was talking to him as I

work with him.

We were then ordered into the Leppings Ln end or West Stand, we all

made our way there as a serial.

We went    into the area in front of the gates and there were hundreds of

fans still trying to make their way into the ground.             At this stage      I

was still unaware of what was happening         I thought a t ^ h a t   time that

there was fighting with the fans.         i .         i
                                      iC -l
As we got into the area near to the centre tunnel           I remember seeing

around four or five bodies laying on the floor and Police Officers

bent over them giving them mouth to mouth resusication at this stage I

realised that these people were seriously ill.            The bodies were grey

in colour and they looked limp and lifeless.

As the officers were attending to the people on the floor some of the

fans were hysterical and were shouting "Do something dont just stand

there".     At this stage I had lost contact with members of my serial

and   I was with other officers who I do not know.          We were trying to

keep the fans away from the police bent over the people on the floor.

The mood of the fans was ugly at this stage and they were pushing and

shoving,    they were abusive and they were shouting "You murdering

bastards" At this time I was still unaware of what was actually

happening    inside the West Stand.   More Police officers came in and the

crowds were pushed away and held back to give the officers working on

the bodies more space.

The tunnel mouth was still    crowded with fans and Police Officers

trying to get into the West Stand.        I then saw Officers and fans

coming out of the tunnel    carrying bodies again these bodies were grey
                                                                           PAGE        5
                                                                           S227G

in colour and my thoughts    immediately were that the bodies were dead.

There were shouts from inside the tunnel for more officers to help,                I

ran through the tunnel again having to push passed fans who by now

were travelling both in and out of the stadium.        It was total        chaos

in the tunnel and I remember seeing more bodies being brought out and

was thinking that I couldn't believe what was happening.            Once    inside

the West Stand area it was absolutely packed full of fans and police,

there were some police officers trying to clear a path through the

fans and I could see both police officers and fans trying to pull down

the barriers at the front of the stand.     they were kicking at it and

pulling it with their bare hands.     There were shouts and screams

from people in the parapet above the stand and they were shouting              "You

murdering    bastards".

Again the crowd was    in an ugly mood they were abusive and threatening,

some of the fans in the stand were sat on the floor        crying and other

wert obviousW     injured and trying to get out.    I mad© my way to the

front ami I saw a pile of bodies crushed up against the wall and the

barrier    I thought they were four or five deep just piled on top of one

another.    There were arms and legs sticking out all over the people

were just pulling on them trying to get them out.         I did not have a

radio so did not have any communication, the sounds w r e          deafening and

I could not really remember what was happening arcyand me.           I began to

assist both fans and police officers pulling bo$/es out of the pile,

this was to the right hand side of the tunnel      in p e n 1g .   I could not

recognise any of the police officers and I remember pulling one male

aged around 23 years out of the pile and onto ythe floor,          he had no

shirt on and he was face down,    I saw redden/ng on his back and his

skin colour was grey and he felt dry,    th^e   was no room to work on the

man there as other bodies were being pu/led out.        I carried this man

with other officers back up through tne tunnel and out into the back

area and handed him to other police officers out ^fhere and then ran

back into the stand.

When   I got back into the stand the fence had/been pulled down and both

police and fans had formed a chain and bo,d/^s were being pulled out of

the crush and passed through and on\g thy„ pitch.          I assisted in this

and would estimate that     I handled around five or six bodies.      I could

not recognise them because the prime concern was to get them out as

quickly as possible to an area where they could be treated which was

on the pitch.    Fans from the parapet above the stand were ripping

hoardings off the wall     to enable people to carry the bodies away on.

There were some violent scenes with fans fighting amongst themselves

some trying to calm      the others down.

Eventually the bodies were cleared out of the West Stand and I made my

way onto the football     pitch and rejoined Sergeant TISSINGTON and

Constables YARROW and DAY.

We were stood facing the crowd at this time there were large numbers

of police officers on the pitch and the Nottingham Forest fans had

been chanting at the Liverpool        fans,   they in turn were incensed and

there were verbal exchanges.

The atmosphere was electric and all the bodies had been removed,             I had

the feeling that the Liverpool        fans were about to start attacking the

police and they outnumbered the police greatly.

The mood was somewhat     calmed when the Liverpool manager made an

announcement over the t a n n o y +]7. //                                       '

Again though there were two scenes of crime men who entered into the

crowd and began to take photographs-'one went into the West Stand where

there was items of clothing a n ^ e r s o n a l   effects strewn all over.

Some of the fans attacked these two men and they to be calmed down the

photographers were led away by the police.

Chief Superintendent NESBIT was then on the pitch and he was asking

               the Police Officers to move the few supporters that were still on the

               pitch and the fans seemed to disappear away without any trouble at all

               It was some time later that we were all told to reassemble at the

               stand where the briefing had earlier taken place when we were de

               briefed and I left the football ground and went off duty.

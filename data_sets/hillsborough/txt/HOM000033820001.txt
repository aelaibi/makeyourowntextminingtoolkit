HILLSBOROUGH: FURTHER CORRESPONDENCE FROM THE FAMILY
SUPPORT GROUP


Issue


Letter (attached) from Mr Trevor Hicks, Chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support
Group, about the terms of reference for the Scrutiny.


Timing


2.         An early reply would be helpful.


Summary


3.         Mr Hicks sets out at length concerns about the way in which the terms of
reference for the scrutiny seem to be being interpreted. Underlying the concerns is
the Support Group’s sense that the scrutiny is not coming to the conclusions which
they would like, and a veiled threat that they will decry the whole exercise if the
outcome is unwelcome. They feel that too much of the burden is being put on them
to produce new evidence which would have affected the outcome of any of the
previous proceedings. Answers can be given to some of their concerns about the
nature and purpose of the scrutiny, but it is not likely to overturn the outcomes of
previous proceedings in the ways which they seek.

Recommendation


4.        A draft reply to Mr Hicks is attached.


Consideration


5.        The concerns of the Support Group are difficult to capture concisely, but they
come down to five broad issues:



           (i)        They question whether Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has the power to
                      overturn the findings of the Divisional Court or order a fresh hearing.


           (ii)       Their understanding of what constitutes new evidence is different from
                      that of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.



           (iii)      They believe that the CPS have closed minds about the possibility of
                      further proceedings.



           (iv)       They ask whether a limited form of public inquiry might be possible,
                      acknowledging that a full inquiry starting from scratch like the Taylor
                      Inquiry would not be right.



           (v)        They feel that they are being asked to prove too much too quickly and
                     without access to all the information.


O')       Powers of the Scrutiny


6.        In 1993 the Divisional Court considered and refused judicial review of the
verdict of the inquests.           Although Lord Justice Stuart-Smith is a Lord Justice of
Appeal, he is not acting in his formal judicial capacity in carrying out this scrutiny and




f:\oppu\houUongjub\pp0469pAdoc
has no power to overturn the decision of the court. Nothing other than a decision of
a higher court could do that.



7.         Mr Hicks suggests that that gives the families no hope of overturning the

inquest verdicts, which they regard as so unsatisfactory. Their particular concern is

the decision by the coroner to impose a 3.15pm cut off time in considering evidence.
One of the major issues which the judge is considering is whether there is fresh

evidence which bears on that decision - it is one of the central issues in the scrutiny.
Although he does not have the power directly to overturn the decision of the court he
is considering whether there are any grounds for the Attorney General to consent to

an application to the High Court for a new inquest. That would be the route by which
the Support Group’s objectives might be achieved.


(ii)     New evidence


8.       On the issue of what constitutes new evidence, it is inevitable with any major
disaster that over the years new information emerges which was not known at the
time. You made clear in announcing the Judge’s appointment that the purpose was
to establish whether there was any material evidence which was of such significance
that further inquiries would be justified or which would be relevant to the statutory
functions of the Attorney, the DPP or the Chief Constable.        In order to justify re­
opening the previous decisions, evidence would have to be material not simply new.
It will be for the judge to report whether in his view there is material evidence, but the
decision about the outcomes will rest with you and the others who have statutory
functions to perform.


(iii)      CPS views


9.       On the role of the CPS the support group are concerned that they have not
seen all the papers held by the DPP and are particularly unhappy about a letter
written from a chief crown prosecutor on the day you announced the scrutiny. ( A
copy of that letter is attached to Mr Hick’s letter.) That letter reiterates the point



fi\oppuVhouUongsub\pp0469pd.doc
which you made in your oral statement that the view of the DPP at that time was that

the material so far presented to her would not justify fresh criminal proceedings. The^
letter goes on to stress that the CPS will consider very carefully anything which

emerges from the scrutiny. The letter was intended to be reassuring, but Mr Hicks
seems to have interpreted it in the opposite sense. The CPS have not “closed" the

book on Hillsborough and would consider anything which might emerge.



(iv)      A limited inquiry


10.       On the issue of a limited inquiry, that is in effect what the scrutiny is intended
to be. Its purpose is to establish whether there are sufficient grounds for a wider-
reaching investigation. But Mr Hicks can be reassured that no possible outcome has

been ruled in or out.


(v)       “Burden o f pro of’


11.        Their concern about what they call the burden of proof is perhaps the biggest
misunderstanding.                  They seem to believe that it should be the purpose of the
scrutiny to act in effect as the families’ advocate, seeking out all possible areas
where some shred of new material might exist.                   However, this would turn the

exercise on its head. The origins of the exercise lay in claims originally made a year
or so ago that there was new evidence which called into question the previous
findings. The scrutiny therefore started by asking anyone who believed that there
was new evidence to bring it forward for consideration. The judge has approached
 the task by looking at what was alleged and following that up to establish the
 substance of the claims. Given the extent to which Hillsborough has been examined
 in previous proceedings, there would have to be some clear cause for overturning all
 that. There is in that sense a burden of proof on those who remain unhappy about
 the previous proceedings to show good cause why they should be set aside - there
 does need to be some reasonable doubt that the previous outcomes were wrong.




 f:\oppu\hou\longjub\pp0469pddoc
12.       On timing, you announced the judge’s appointment at the end of June and he

requested written submissions by the beginning of September. Those submissions

were then used for the basis of discussions with the parties during October and
November. As you have made clear, it is open to the judge to take as long as he

likes, but to be fair to all those concerned it should not be allowed to drag out any
longer than necessary. At some point a line has to be drawn.



Handling


13.        It is difficult to be critical of the Family Support Group without appearing
insensitive - indeed it would be impossible to be publicly critical. Given what they
have suffered, it is entirely understandable that they should use every possible
means to further their case.            But I cannot help feeling that their current
correspondence is deliberately disingenuous on some issues and seeking to delay
the completion of the scrutiny. You may want to discuss this with Lord Justice Start-
Smith when you meet him on Thursday 11 December. W e will put forward briefing

for the meeting under separate cover.


14.        Mr Hicks said that he has not released his letter to the media “at this time” but
it must be likely that he will do so and that your reply will similarly become public.

             DRAFT LETTER FOR SIGNATURE BY THE HOME SECRETARY



Trevor Hicks Esq
Chairman of the Hillsborough
Family Support Group




Thank you for your letter of 30 November about the terms of reference for the
Hillsborough Scrutiny. I am grateful to you for setting out your concerns, and I hope

I can provide some reassurance.


It is right that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has no formal powers to overturn the
decision of the Divisional Court. He is not sitting in a formal judicial capacity, and
only a higher court could in practice reverse the decision of another court. It is his
role, however, to draw to the attention of the Attorney General matters which would
be relevant to the Attorney’s statutory responsibilities.        That would include the
question of whether the Attorney should give his consent to an application for a new

inquest.        That would be the proper legal route by which an outcome different to that

in the Divisional Court might be achieved.


 I cannot of course, at this stage say what Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s views on that
 issue will be nor what decision the Attorney General might subsequently take. I can
 assu^/jfe you, however, that no outcome has been ruled out. After Lord Justice
 Stuart-Smith has reported, the decisions about any further action will be taken by me
 and, in relation to their statutory responsibilities, by the Attorney General, the

 Director of Public Prosecutions, or the Chief Constable.


 Lord Justice Stuart-Smith is considering whether there is any evidence which, had it
 been available, would have been material to the outcome of any of the previous



 f:\oppu\hou\longsub\pp0469p4 doc
proceedings. With any major disaster, it is inevitable that over the course of time

some new information may become available which was not known at the relevant

time, but that does not always mean that the previous outcomes would have been
any different. We have to be careful that any re-opening of previous proceedings is

merited, and therefore that any new information is not simply new, but also material.
I do not think that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith is looking for any particular party to

prove a case. His purpose is to consider any claims or evidence which interested
parties wish to put before him and to form an impartial view about whether any of
that calls into question what has gone before.     He has made clear that he will look
equally rigorously at all the information presented to him, whether that information
comes from individuals or official bodies. I know that the 3.15pm cut off time, which
is of such concern to you, is one of the main issues which he has been considering.


I am sorry that you were unhappy with the letter of 30 June from a chief crown
prosecutor. What she says in that letter about the material so far presented simply

reflects what I said in my oral statement at the House.     I think that the letter was
intended to assure you that the CPS would consider very carefully anything which

might emerge from the scrutiny. It is unfortunate that it gave the wrong impression,
but what Lord Justice Stuart-Smith might say will certainly not be limited by the view

of the CPS at that time.


As you know, I believe that the present police disciplinary procedures are
 unsatisfactory for a number of reasons.      The disciplinary system is currently the
 subject of an inquiry by the House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee.

 We expect them to report in the New Year.


 As I stressed in my letter of 4 December, the management of the scrutiny is entirely
 a matter for Lord Justice Stuart-Smith and the timescale is a matter for him to
 decide. What happens after he reports will be a matter for me, and for those who

 have specific statutory responsibilities to discharge.

                              Hillsborough Family Support Group


   Rt Hon Jack Straw MP -Home Secretary
   Home Office
   Queen Anne’s Gate
   London SW1 9AT


    30* November 1997


    Dear Mr Straw,

    re; Hillsborough Scm liM

     You will recall that in our letter of 9th November, we said we would write to you to highlight the
     Group* concerns relating to the Terms of Reference of the Hillsborough Scrutiny.

     At the outset I would point out that this letter is not intended to undermine the appointment and/or
     foie of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. Indeed, we are pleased that he took the lime and trouble to meet
     the fam ily in Liverpool and you are aware that we have accepted, admittedly with some reservation,
     his apology for the offensive gafife about latecomers.

      I trust you will concede that this is in keeping with the responsible attitude our group has always
      adopted and that our forbearance should not to be seen as weakness or diminution of our resolve.

      We remain committed to assisting the Scrutiny, however we have considerable disquiet at some areas
      of the Terms o f Reference and lot the interpretation that appears to have been adopted.

      This letter seeks clarification o f these areas and places on the record our deep concerns.

       The          initial reaction to your statement to the House of Commons o n 3 0 th J u n e was positive ai
                                 determined that t o Scrutiny would be a thorough and just o n e O ^ ™
       based on the wording of your statement, your demeanor and responses to questions both on the
       of the House and during our meetings.

        We felt that your statement was balanced, gave a clear commitment and culminated by “saying it all”
        in the last few words:-
        In our view it represented a huge step in the right direction and understandably raised within the grot
        a legitimate expectation of the eventual attainment of justice.

 Sadly that view is changing and we are now concerned that the “legal small print” rather than the spirit
 of your statement is being applied. It may be that our expectations were too high or that our treatment
 over the last eight years has jaundiced our judgement but we would respectfully suggest that Lord
 Justice Stuart-Smith’s practical interpretation o f the Terms of Reference of the Scrutiny appear to us to
 be at variance with your stated intentions.

 There are five major areas of concem:-

         1)     Relationship with the Divisional Court/ Judicial Review

         2)     Definition of “new” evidence

         3)     Attorney General / Director of Public Prosecutions

         4)     no “limited” Inquiry

         5)     prima facia case /burden of proof

     Relationship with the Divisional Court

  Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has repeatedly stated that he is not a Court of Appeal of the Divisional Corn
  and that he cannot reverse their findings even if he thought they were wrong.

  If this is the case, it presents us the families with insurmountable difficulties and with no prospect of
  remedy. It effectively renders the whole scrutiny a waste of time and money .

   As you are probably aware, the Judicial Review proceedings involved only six of the families and to a
   very great extent concentrated on the legal process at the court of first instant. It also took place
   before much of the current evidence was in the public domain and/or the families possession.

   However, the Divisional Court made certain findings which arguably could be deemed to apply to all
   families. For example, the Court upheld the coroners imposition of the 3.15 cut-off time and as you a
   well aware that is one of the major issues which continue to concern families. The Coroners decisior
   may have been lawful but it is manifestly unjust and has denied us the opportunity to investigate critic
   life or death actions (or non action!).

   It seems manifestly unjust that the whole of the Hillsborough Family Support Group now appear to b
   saddled with that decision without the Court having heard any details relevant to these other cases.

    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has on occasions conceded that if there is fresh evidence that puts a differe
    complexion on the decision of the High Court then the matter may have to be reconsidered.

    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has also said that he does not have the power to order either a fresh judicfc
    inquiry or a re-opening of the Taylor Inquiry. Neither is he a Court of Appeal. What then is his role
    What does he have the power to do?
    Obviously, there is a great deal of confusion and we are at a loss to say with any certainty just what
    families can hope to achieve out of this Scrutiny.

    We are of course unable to take legal advice on this confusion as the Scrutiny is unprecedented.
/12    '97 08:51       FAX 01729 840602                  TREVOR HICKS




 We trust you will agree that this is a major problem and is a clearly a matter upon which femilies (and
 in our view, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith!) require and indeed are entitled to urgent clarification.

 21 Definition of “New Evidence*1

 In your statement to the House you said:

              (Para 18 ) We have asked Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to examine all the "written and other
              evidence which has been submitted. He will also consider any farther material which
              interested parties wish to submit.

 It is our belief that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith seems to be restricting the Scrutiny to a definition of
 “fresh evidence” much narrower than the above statement. From the many comments contamed in the
 transcripts of meetings we believe he is only really considering anything which could have affected:

  i)           the outcome of Lord Taylor's Inquiry;
  ifi          the verdict of the jury at the inquest;                            . . .                 • _*
  iii)         the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions not to take criminal proceedings against any
                person in connection with the disaster; or                         _     „
  iv)          the decision not to pursue disciplinary proceedings against any police officer.

  It is the Group's submission that such a narrow interpretation is fiindamentally flawed for the following
  reasons:-

      a)       This does not satisfy the Terms of Reference (page 9 line 13) : - T o ascertain whether any
               evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough Stadium on IS Apnl 1989 which
                was not available;
                It is not consistent with Terms of Reference (page 9 line 26):- ‘To draw to their attention any ^

      c)         It seems to disallow the final sentence (page 9 line 28) :- “ and to advise whether there is any
                 other action which should be taken in the public interest.

       It can be argued however that this definition is entirely consistent with (page 9 line 37)

                 “First to advise me whether any evidence not previously available is o f such significance as to

  In the context of new evidence and/or its interpretation we would like to add the following comments:-

   i)         The outcome of the IflYlfll iBQMy

               As you are aware, Lord Taylor was only concerned with events which happened at the
               Ground. Therefore, his Inquiry did not deal with, for example, whether or not facilities at
               the Northern General Hospital were adequate.

               This is of major concern to families as subsequent to the inquest it emerged that failure to
               activate the major disaster plan earlier meant that only a few staff had to cope with a large
               clinical workload in addition to implementing the major incident plan. This information was
               contained in an article in the British Medical Journal and is completely at odds with evidence
               given to Lord Justice Taylor.

               Although it may not have affected Lord Taylor’s principal finding (that the primary cause of
               the disaster was loss of police control) in itself it merits further investigation in the context
               of not only safety at sporting events, but emergency planning as a whole.

    ii)        The verdict of the jury M thg Immsst

                This is the area which is causing the greatest concern to families. Such a narrow
                interpretation of your Terms of Reference could potentially undermine the credibility of the
                Scrutiny If the verdict is the only aspect o f the Inquest which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith is
                examining, then in effect he is empanelling himself as a twelfth juror which cannot be right.
                Further, this approach ignores the function o f an inquest winch is to seek out and record as
                many o f the facts concerning the death as the public interest requires.

                Families are deeply embittered by the 3.15 pm cut-off time imposed at the inquest. This
                single act, almost by itself was sufficient to vitiate the legitimacy of the inquest as it
                prevented any meaningful examination o f the response of the emergency services.

                 Surely the public interest requires that such an important aspect requires vigorous scrutiny.
                 Whilst Lord Justice Taylor considered some aspects o f the response of the emergency
                 services, in the main he attributed any fellings to the feet that the police were stow to
                 recognise the extent of the disaster. He may be forgiven for perhaps presuming that this was
                 a matter which would be more thoroughly investigated at the inquest but the feet o f the
                 matter is that it was not.

                 Therefore, a major aspect of the disaster has never been fully examined. TTiis will remain the
                 case unless Lord Justice Stuart-Smith can be persuaded or instructed to widen his
                 interpretation of the Terms of Reference.

                  The Judge's insistence that he will only be persuaded by new evidence which would have
                  resulted in a verdict of unlawful killing feils to acknowledge families’ expectations at the
                  inquest that all the circumstances related to their loved ones deaths would be investigated
                  and relevant questions answered, irrespective of the verdict.

              The decision of the Director of P»Mic Prosecutions not tQ lake criminal DTOWSdingS against
              anv person in connection with thg disaster.

               In relation to the above the HFSG is particularly concerned that it is not in a position to say
               how any new evidence could affect the decision of the DPP not to prosecute as we have
               never had access to the documentation upon which the DPP originally reached his decision,
               neither do we know what possible charges were considered by the DPP. For example, did
               he consider the common law offence of misconduct in public office?

               We are also concerned with the content and implications o f Dru Sharpling’s (Chief Crown
               Prosecutor - Crown Prosecution Service) letter written to us on the 30th June 1997- the
               very day you announced the scrutiny!!

               A copy is attached for we draw your attention to the phrase

                “ At this stage the CPS takes the view that the material so fa r presented does notjustify
                asking the police to re-open the investigation

                The timing and content hardly inspires us to believe in an open and fair appraisal by the
                scrutiny. The CPS already seems to have an entrenched position and we seek assurance that
                Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will not be limited by them.


                The decision not to pursue disciplinary proceedings against any colics officei

                The Group’s concerns here mirror those outlined at iii) above insofar as we do not know the
                nature and extent o f the evidence before the PCA. Nor are we aware of any "defence"
                advanced by Messrs Duckenfield and Murray.

                    We are only too aware that Duckenfield was allowed to retire on ill-health grounds and
                    Murray was not proceeded against- despite neglect of duty charges being initiated against
                    them both. The “evidence” was irrelevant to these decisions and the reasons they were
                    taken.
                    Paragraph 10 of your statement dealt with the Police Complaints Authority preferring
                    charges for neglect o f duty against Duckenfield and Murray and the lack of proceedings
                    ultimately.

                    The robust cross-party interventions and questions at the end of your statement clearly
                    illustrated the universal dissatisfection that exists with Police Discipline matters in practise.
                    Our view is that the whole thing has became a travesty of fercical proportions !

                     Clearly in the absence of relevant information, it is difficult for us to see how we can
                     evaluate any new evidence-with a view to telling Lord Justice Stuart-Smith how this would
                     have affected either section iii) or iv) above. The CPS letter and their track record todate
                     does not inspire confidence and the total lack o f information moves this into the distrust
                     zone We are therefore totally dependant on the freedom to investigate and the robust
                     intentions of Lord Justice Stuart Smith. Please make sure he feels able to look at, commen
                     and rnake recom m endations, if required, in these areas.

        3^ Attorney Generali PEE

        We feel the comments within (2) above clearly show our concern and we need say no more, other
        than to reinforce our concern and incredulity at their letter o f the 30* June.

        41 No limited inquiry

         Again, we merely repeat what we said earlier under (2 c)

         SIPrima Facie Case/ Burden of proof.

         We cautiously welcomed this scrutiny in the belief that its task was to examine whether there was a
         prima facie case to be answered. We accepted the methodology and timetable in this belief.

         It is o f great concern that we feel that the “burden of proof” placed upon us is now “beyond all
         reasonable doubt”. We feel that the families are being expected to prove everything, with minimal
         access to information, information that is being/ has been subject to delays by South Yorkshire Police,
         who unlike the HFSG seem to have infinite resources throughout this scrutiny, which, from the
           families point of view is proceeding with undue, almost indecent, haste. The task started late through

        1no fault of ours, the burden has been shifted to being upon us and yet it is expected to remain within
         the timetable drawn up in June .

         Again, we seek clarification for ourselves (and perhaps Lord Justice Stuart Smith!) Is this a scrutiny
         prior to the proceedings or are these the proceedings 7?

          I apologise for the length and complexity of this letter but trust you can understand our concerns
          having considered the above comments. It is important that these matters are dealt with now lest we
          have to cry “foul” later and the whole process is a waste o f time and resource, achieving nothing but ^
          heightening the acrimony that already exists. We looked to new Labour for justice at last, please don’t
          let administrative convenience, inter-departmental wrangling, political dogma or fear of loss of face
           affect the aims of this process .

          I close with a repeat of your words-

                      “iVe owe it to everyone touched by the tragedy, but above all to the fam ilies o f those who

                And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is of
                such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home
                Department of a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
                attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
                their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should
                be taken in the public interest.

      It may be helpful if I explain the role of the CPS in relation to the Hillsborough Disaster to
      help you put this announcement in context so far as the CPS is concerned. The CPS is
      responsible for the prosecution of all criminal cases resulting from police investigations in
      England and Wales (with the exception of certain minor offences). The police are
      responsible for investigating offences and for deciding whether or not to charge or summons
      an offender.

      In recent months, senior lawyers within the CPS have examined large quantities of material
      arising from the Hillsborough disaster. The purpose of considering this material was to
      ascertain whether there was sufficient evidence to start a criminal prosecution. If the
      evidence was sufficient, the CPS would invite the police to conduct a further formal
      investigation and prepare a file for consideration of criminal charges against named
      individuals.

          At this stage the Crown Prosecution Service takes the view that the material so far presented
          does not justify asking the police to re-open the investigation.

          In the light of the decision of the Home Secretary to institute an independent scrutiny, the
          CPS will consider the matter again when the outcome of that scrutiny is known. I can assure
          you that the CPS will assist the independent scrutiny in whatever way it can and we will
          carefully exam ine its findings before making any further decisions.

          There are two outstanding issues upon which you await a reply, they are:

                  •      the request for a meeting (as mentioned in the opinion of Alun Jones QC dated
                         3 March 1997); and

                  •      a considered reply to your fax of 8 April 1997, enclosing your comments on
                         the statement of South Yorkshire police dated 1 April 1997.

           In relation to both of these, the Home Secretary’s announcement means that you can be
           assured that there is to be an independent scrutiny to establish whether material not
           previously considered might have an impact on decisions to be made, as well as whether
           there should be a further public enquiry. I imagine you will be inviting those responsible for
           the scrutiny to examine the material referred to by Alun Jones QC as well as your comments
            in relation to the South Yorkshire police press statement of 1 April 1997. I think the proper
            course would be for these issues to be considered by the independent scrutiny before any
            meeting is held with the CPS. I am particularly anxious to avoid any suggestion or
            impression that the CPS has in any way pre-judged the outcome of the independent scrutiny.
            I am sure you will appreciate the importance of ensuring that everything is done properly and
             in the right order. I will write to you again when the outcome of the scrutiny is known.

                                           Hillsborough: Oral Statement by the Home Secretary
                                                         Monday 30th June 1997

    1                3)             With permission Madam Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the Hillsborough
    2                               Stadium disaster
    3
     4               4)             Ninety-six people lost their lives as a result o f the Hillsborough disaster, which happened
    5                               on 15th April 1989. That was more than eight years ago but no one whosaw the news
        6                           reports on that dreadful Saturday will have forgotten those terrible events. For those who
        1                           lost loved members o f their fa m ily, the pain is ever present. Following Hillsborough,
        8                           members o f this House were united in their determination to do all in their power to prevent
        9                           anything like that ever happening again.
    10
    11               Public Inquiry
    12
    13               5)             Madam Speaker, after the Hillsborough disaster, a number o f inquiries and investigations
A       4                           took place, looking at aspects o f the tragedy. Perhaps the most thorough and wide ranging
    15                              was the Public Inquiry led by Lord Taylor. The terms o f reference o f that Inquiry
    1   g                           encompassed not only inquiring into the disaster itself but also making recommendations
    17                              about crowd control and safety at sports events.
    18
    19                              lo rd Taylor's Inquiry took oral evidence from over 170 witnesses at public hearings
    2       o                        during May and June 1989 and considered many hours o f video evidence from different
    21                               sources. In his interim report in August 1989, Lord Taylor found that the disaster had a
    22                                number o f causes. He did not attribute all the blame to a single cause or person, but in
    2 3                              paragraph 278 he made clear that: " the main reason fo r the disaster was the failure o f
    2 4                             police control"
    25
    26                    7;          In that interim report Lord Taylor made 43 immediate recommendations. His final report in
    27                                January 1990 made a further 76 recommendations. The developments which have taken
    2 8                              place since then in safety at football grounds and in the policing o f football matches have
    29                               been based largely on those recommendations. Football in this country has been
    3o                               transformed since the Taylor Report. To a large extent that is due to his wide ranging and
        31                            soundly based conclusions.
        32
        33                Coroner's Inauesl
        3 4
        35                s)           The deaths which occurred on 15thApril 1989 were also the subject o f inquests conducted
        36                             by the Coroner o f the western district o f South Yorkshire.
        37                9)           The jury at the Coroner's inquest, after examining the evidence, found in March 1991 that
        30                             the cause o f death o f those who died at Hillsborough was accidental death.
         39
         40
         41
            42            10)          A further investigation was conducted by the West Midlands Police, supervised by the
            43                         police Complaints Authority, to establish whether there were any grounds fo r criminal
            44                         proceedings, and to consider whether any police officer should be subject to disciplinary
            4    5                      proceedings.

                                                                                                                  Page 7 of         S
 ' 01/12 ‘97 08:51                 FAX 01729 840602                 TREVOR HICKS

  1               9)         That investigation involved the taking o f over 5000 statements and the scrutiny o f all the
  2                          material which had previously been examined by theTaylor Inquiry After that investigation
  3                          the evidence was sent to the Director O f PublicProsecutions,who concluded that no person
  4                          should be subject to criminal proceedings. ”
  5
  6               10)        The Police Complaints Authority decided that the chief superintendent and superintendent
  7                           in charge on the day shouldface disciplinary charges fo r neglect o f duty. In the event, the
  8                           chief superintendent retired due to ill health in advance o f a ruling by a disciplinary
  9                           tribunal under the police discipline rules. A disciplinary hearing cannot proceed when a
 1o                          police officer retires before the hearing takes place. The Police Complaints Authority later
 1 1                         decided that disciplinary proceedings against the superintendent should be withdrawn
 12                            because the retirement o f the chief superintendent meant that what, in effect, was a joint
 13                           allegation o f neglect o f duty could not be fairly heard in the absence o f the more senior
 14                          officer.
 15
 16                Continued calls for further investisatiom
 17
                   II)       Madam Speaker, Hon members will be fam iliar with the unhappiness o f the families o f
^19                          those who died, about the inquest. They later appliedfo r judicial review o f the coroner’s
 2o                          proceedings. In November 1993 the Divisional Court ruled that none o f the matters raised
 21                          in the judicial review proceedings justified intervention by that court in the verdict o f the
 22                           inquest jury.
 23
 24                12)        The events surrounding the disaster have therefore been subject to investigation on several
 2        5                   occasions. But concerns have remained about whether the fu ll facts have yet emerged. I
 2        6                   have met relatives o f the Hillsborough victims whose suffering is exacerbated by their belief
 27                          that there are unresolved issues which should be investigatedfurther.
 28
 2 9               13)        Representations were made to my predecessor and have been made to me, to the Attorney
  3   o                       General and to the Director o f Public Prosecutions. A Granada television programme in
  31                          December last year dramatised the disaster and raised a number o f issues which in the view
  32                          o f the programme makers, represented new evidence. This promoted an adjournment
  3       3                    debate led by my Hon Friend, the Member fo r Liverpool Walton, to which my predecessor,
  3       4                    the Rt Hon and Learned Member fo r Folkestone and Hythe, responded. Since then further
  3       5                   material has been submitted on behalf o f the Hillsborough Family Support Group. Those
  3           g               representations have related in particular to video evidence o f the disaster and medical
  37                           evidence about the time o f death o f the victims.
  38
  3 9                  14)    Madam Speaker, my Department, the Office o f the Attorney General and the Crown
     4    o                    Prosecution Service have considered very carefully all the evidence which has been put
     41                      forward in recent months.
     42
     43                15)    The Director o f Public Prosecutions has taken the view that the material so fa r presented to
      4       4               her would notjustify fresh criminal investigations. The then Attorney General also took the
      4       5               view, again on the material presented to him, that any application to the High Courtfo r a
      4       6                new inquest would not have any realistic prospect o f succeeding.
      47
      4       8        16)    Nonetheless, I am acutely conscious that the families o f those who died at Hillsborough anc
      4       9                many others, including Hon members o f this House are very concerned that unresolved

                                                                                                            Page' 8 of         <

 issues remain. I am determined to go as fa r as I can to ensure that no matter o f
 significance is overlooked and that we do not reach a final conclusion without a fu ll and
 independent examination o f the evidence.

 I can therefore tell the House today that the Attorney General, The Director O f Public
 Prosecutions and I have agreed that it is in the public interest that there should be an
 independent scrutiny to ascertain whether there now exists any new evidence relating to the
 disaster which was not previously available. We are appointing Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a
 senior Lord Justice o f the Court o f Appeal, fo r that purpose.

  His full terms o f reference are:-

      To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough
      Stadium on 15* April 1989 which was not available:

       a)      To the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or

       b)      To the Director o f Public Prosecutions or the Attorney Generalfo r the purpose
               o f discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or

       c)      To the C hief Officer o f the South Yorkshire Police in relation to police
               disciplinary matters;

       And in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available is o f
       such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary o f State fo r the Home
       Department o f a further Public Inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their
       attention any evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
       their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action which should be
       taken in the public interest.

   I am today placing a copy o f these terms o f reference in the Library.

   We have asked Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to examine all the written and other evidence
   which has been submitted. He will also consider any further material which interested
   parties wish to submit.

   Lord Justice Stuart-Smiths task will be twofold. First to advise me whether any evidence not
   previously available is o f such significance as to justify a further fu ll public inquiry. His
   advice to me will be available to the House and the public. Secondly, he will identifyfo r the
   Attorney General and the Director o f Public Prosecutions and the Chief Constable o f South
   Yorkshire any evidence which might be relevant to their decisions which has not previously
   been considered.

    I hope that this examination will enable us to establish conclusively whether or not material
    evidence about the causes o f the Hillsborough disaster has been overlooked. I f it has I can
    assure the House that I will take whatever action is needed. We owe it to everyone touched
    by the tragedy, but above all to the families o f those who died, to get to the bottom o f this
    matter once and fo r all.

              I report       that    I am c u r rently s t a t i o n e d at A . 2 Thorne, Sub D i v i s i o n on

              beat duties at T h o r n e and Hatfield.

              At 8.43 am on S a turday,               15th April      1989,   I came on duty a t Do n c a s t e r

              Divi s i o n a l H e a d q u a r t e r ® and was t r a n sported,     wit h other officers,* to

             Hillsborough Football               S t a d i u m for   briefing    in the m a i n s tand at 9. 3 0 am

              that date.

              I was a me m b e r      of P S Pearsons          details,    Serial      31,    our duty being to

              supervise       crowd     control       at the    roundabout at the            j u n c t i o n of Lappings

             At   11.00 am that          date,       w i t h my serial,    I took up this           point.

             T h r o u g h the morning,         supp o r t e r s a r r i v e d and all    appeared      in jovial

             mood,        looking    forward     to the match.         T h e r e was     no a n i m o s i t y as far as

^ f a c t ,       eve rything a p p e a r e d to be the same as                        last years       similar

fixture,          a m a t c h that         I was also           on d u t y for at a similar             point.

The day           continued         in m u c h the same way,               and    it a p p e a r e d as though the

 game was going                to be well          attended       by good natured football                  supporters

 I saw nothing               to suggest any              problems at this time,                except      the odd

 fan being             s t o p p e d by a P o l i c e O f f i c e r and         told to leave a n y         earns of

 beer     behind.            I could see some fans sitt i n g                     on walls and drinking

 their      c a n s , but noth i n g             to suggest       problems and           it was o n l y the

 occasional             fan.      I had not         cause       to speak       to anyone       except      to give

 directions             or a s s i s t a n c e    as to w here       the       various    e n trances were at

 the ground.

 By 3.00          pm the       crowds      coming down P e n i s t o n e R o a d to the gr o u n d had

 su b s i d e d    to a mer e t r i c k l e of fans,                all    still     in good humour and

 causing          no    problems,        c e rtainly no more              than     100 people and they were

 s p r e a d out as          though they had a r r i v e d             late      in private      cars.

 At   this        time,      because       there were           no more        crowds,    our serial        with

 PS Pearson,              b e g a n to m ake our w a y back               to the ground.

 It was at this                time,     approximately 3.05                pm that we were d i r e c t e d

 by   radio to a s s i s t w i t h               crowd problems           at    the L a p p i n g s Lane    entrance

 to the ground.

 By a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 . 1 0      pm we a r r i v e d at the metal               gates at the

 L e p p i n g s Lane        entrance,           where    I could see a cordon of Police O f f icers

 but very few supporters.                          We were       d i r e c t e d to assist      here,      but at

 this     time         I could see no             reason for the           cordon.

 A few m i n u t e s         later,      it became         clear     that a serious            incident was

 taking       place        inside      the ground.              I saw several          fans    being e s c o r t e d by

 Police Officers                from the          ground    by the        turnstiles.

 I could see              by their       faces that         they were           in great      distress a n d       it

 became       obvi o u s       that    they were          not    being a r r e s t e d    but a s s i s t e d by

 Police.          At this         time     I heard the a n n o u n c e m e n t         that a serious         problem

                                                                                                            <PV

              ' occurred        inside     the ground and that              several     people we re injured,

        .ambulances           had been      requested and          I was    d i r e c t e d by an   Inspector,

           whom    I do not know,          to go down the service               road at the         rear of the

           south s tand to a s s i s t a m b u l a n c e s      to a n d from the ground.

           1 went     dow n the serv i c e         road a n d w i t h the help Of sop©              fans and other

           officers,         we m o v e d one or two        parked vehicles so that the                  service

           road was      clear.                                                                             ,

           I did not have a personal                  radio    issued to me and so             I went     to the

           control     box at      the side of the s outh stand an d i n f ormed the m that                            the

           service      road was       clear      for a m b u l a n c e an d e m e r g e n c y service    vehicles.

           I s u g g e s t e d that a m b u l a n c e s   should     come   in from L e p p i n g s U n e       and

           that t h e y sh o u l d     leave via P e n i s t o n e R o a d and thus keeping a smooth

           flow.      Some a m b u l a n c e s    stop p e d at the P o l i c e Control         entrance        to the

           g r o u n d and    loaded victims          from this       point,    but for the most           part the

           ambulances         came from L e p p i n g s Lane.

           I remained at          this    location to ensure            the    free    passage of eme r g e n c y

           vehicles a n d a s s i s t e d one or two             inju r e d fans wit h first aid where                  I

           could and he l p e d the m            into w a i t i n g ambulances.

           It w o u l d be a bout 5 . 3 0         pm when     I was    eventually       stood down from this

           duty and       I then     retur n e d to the m ain stand for debr i e f i n g at 6 . 0 0 pm.

           I did not see any gates opened,                     nor    did   I see a n y surge        in crowd

           numbers      prior     to the     kick off,        except    for a few       late    comers.         I saw

           nothing      that w o u l d    suggest a sudden            influx    of suppo r t e r s at 3.00            pm.

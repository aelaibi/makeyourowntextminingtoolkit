   We are dismayed to M a r & see Pictures of the Bissartrious happening at
Hillsborough# 94 Killed and all those injured, then to be told it was an
Accident, Look at the Facts, Liverpool were given lees fickets than Forest,
they were given the smaller SHB* So those who had tickets, turned up & went
in, as we saw the OBQUDS in the Photo's* all legal, ( I remember in the 30*s
coming out of a ground after a Match, you*d lift your legs off the ground but
still move with the Crowd, Lungs squashed a little* but as you went on it graj
dually eased Off* Maybe a women or two Faint*), But in the Gase of Hillsborou*
gh* The ticket Holders were II, the Crowd out-side Probably with-out fickets
Decided to force the Policeman, to open the Gate ahead, so that they could
get in with-out fiekete, So the P.O. probably being in front of the CBD\w TBAi

learned       that        there        were      at      least      two       people        dead       because           of       crushing

I became        aware          that     t he     situation was                 not        simply       o n l of a m e r e               p i tc h

invasion        but       was       something            of a     greater           p r o p o r t i o n ajnd c o m p l e x i t y .

Again around              this       time      I became           aware        from a t a n n o y              broadcast               that

the    m a t c h was       to       be a b a n d o n e d .

In    consequence              of    t he m a t c h a b a n d o n m e n t           I spoke          to     either           Chief

Superintendent                 Nesbi t/ li ole           or S u p e r i n t e n d e n t         C h a p m a n a n d wa s              deputed

to    take    half        of     the     cordon which               extended              f r o m the       centre           sp ot      td    the

The    leaving         spectators              were        safely       d i s p e r s e d ,as had              been      planned             for

phase      IIT and about                5.13pm           I returned            to     the       g ro und .         It' w a s       at     this

point      t h at     I became          aware         of    the     magnitude              of    the      incident               and    of    the

After      a de-brief               in the       n o r t h sta n d,           I assisted             in     reorganising

E N D OF   REPORT
WILLIAM   HENRY   MANUS   BOOTH   INSPECTOR    WOODSEATS POLICE STATION



On Friday, 14th April 1989 with Superintendent Greenwood, I attended at the
Sheffield Wednesday Football ground where an initial briefing was held for
officers of the rank of Inspector and above who were to be engaged on
supervisory duties connected with the policing of the F.A. Cup Semi Final
match to be played at the ground between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest
Football Clubs the following day.

The format of the ground and the briefing itinary were familiar,as I had
previous interspersed experience at all ranks, of being involved in the
policing of the ground on such major occasions.

On conclusion of the address by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and other
senior staff, I accompanied Superintendent Greenwood and other officers to
the Spion Kop area of the ground. I was aware by reason of previously
circulated documentation of my duties and area of responsibility.

I had charge of serials 9 and 10 which were to be utilised on sub sector 4
of section 1A. Superintendent Greenwood was the ground commander with
Superintendent Chapman and Chief Inspector Beal being the sector commanders.

The three phases of duty i.e. before, during and after the match were not
new to me as I had policed this particular duty on previous occasions.

The duty stages were turnstile supervision before the game, crowd control
during the game and supervision and loading of departing fans on buses at
the end of the game.

Essentially this area of the ground had been designated for the use of the
Nottingham supporters however, past experience and the ticket allocation
dictated there would undoubtedly be a distinct and identifiable proportion
of Liverpool followers who would gain admission to this part of the ground.

Superintendent Greenwood addressed those present concerning what was
potentially problematical which was to ensure the safety of any such
opposing supporters.

The contingency plans based on previous occasions were discussed and mutually
agreed. The essence being that any supporters from Liverpool would be
directed/located to the north and raised side of the Kop where they would
be separated from the adjacent Nottingham followers by one or two serials
of police officers.

On Saturday, 15th April 1989 at 10.00 a.m. I attended the main briefing
with all officers on duty and directly engaged on the policing of the
ground and the attending supporters on that day.

That briefing was opened by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield who introduced
the various other senior officers and they in turn identified themselves.
                                 -   i   -




The intention of the Police together with the method to be employed in the
supervision and safe conduct of the supporters at and in the ground were
explicitly outlined.

The various stages and aspects of the policing in keeping with the operational
order was oralated to those in attendance.

At 11.00 a.m. that day, I went with the two serials under my command and
joined others on the Spion Kop where all of the staff on duty at that
particular location were briefed by Superintendent Greenwood.

His address basically covered the matters discussed at supervisory level the
previous.day in relation to security and safe conduct of the anticipated
Liverpool support.

As in the main briefing and at this second briefing, the order of the day
was reiterated in that "the policing was to be firm but fair with the
safety of the public being of prime importance".

In this secondary briefing Superintendent Greenwood outlined from his
experience his recollections of previous policing of Liverpool supporters.
He spoke of the need to be vigilant and he had seen that these particular
supporters would not hesitate to take advantage and attempt to cause
problems if things were not going their way or in favour of their team.

The nature of the anticipated problems and the relevant contingency plans
being exhausted I then took my two serials to the area where they were to
be initially engaged for phase I of their duties.  I briefed them speaking
of what I expected and advised them of their specific responsibility
touching on the three phases of duty. In addition to what had been said
at the other briefings I also proferred my thoughts on what I deemed an
important issue which was the welfare and safety of each other.   Such
matters as the exercise of discretion in arresting people or acting
impulsively without considering safety.  I mentioned specifically how it
was important not to unnecessarily denude our presence by rigid and
inflexible application of the rules without thought of the objective of
the day. I stated that such a policy on such an occasion would benefit
to show not only good relations but should ensure the safety and welfare
of all not only at the turnstiles but in later crowd control.   I gave
example for the benefit of those with lesser experience of how acting in
isolation would or could leave officers at the mercy of the crowd.   I
dictated that any public order matters inside the ground during the game
would be dealt with by teamwork at my discretion and instigation. I
also touched on the need to exercise caution in the searching of
supporters and of ticket inspection.

At the completion of my address, the officers were paired off and allocated
or selected specific turnstiles whereby they would supervise admission of
fans during phase I.

I satisfied myself that the area we were required to initially police was
adequately covered and spoke to each officer under my command as I patrolled
the location. During this patrol I identified that there were some turn­
stiles numbered 65 to 88 which did not appear to have had staff allocated
to supervise them. On ascertaining that some of these turnstiles were to
open and a communication with ground control, further officers but not
under my command were deputed.
                                                                            #5 O



                                  -   3   -



In addition to staff directly under my command, the police resources were
reinforced by, the presence of several officers on horseback. There were
eight mounted officers available to control any build up of supporters
outside the ground whilst queuing for entry.

The turnstiles opened at 12 noon and from that time there was a steady
and easily manageable flow of, in the main, well behaved supporters. The
progress and admissions at this section of the ground seemed steady,
there never appeared to be any major build up at any of the turnstiles
and the only congestion was when the occasional ticket tout(s) made a
presence but any one stage there was never to my recollection any more
than about fifty at any one of the turnstiles awaiting admission.

I only recall the utilisation of one mounted patrol officer to assist in
crowd movement and this was caused primarily be the presence of a ticket
tout.

The majority of the spectators arrived at this end of the ground either on
foot or by the provided double deck buses which were bringing supporters
from the railway station.

In general the mood of the spectators was good and although there was
evidence of people drinking from cans in the immediate vicinity or on the
approach to the ground, all complied with requests to desist and either
disgarded the contents down the gutter or left the vicinity.

Some time after half past two, I received a radio transmission to the
effect that there was people trying to break down a turnstile at my
location. However, I was directly outside the particular turnstile
quoted with two mounted officers and there was no evidence of such a
situation being in existence.  I related this to ground control.  In fact
the only specific instruction and action I had to take was to cause a
programme seller to close a concertina type gate from which she was
selling programmes from inside the ground to persons passing on the
footpath outside.

About 2.40 p.m. some of the mounted officers I believe initially two, but
laterally four, were directed to the Leppings Lane end of the ground to
assist with crowd control.

I realised from radio transmissions that there was a congestion and build
up of supporters at the other end of the ground and I recall thinking how
clear it was at our location.

From the turnstiles opening at 12 noon to the period when the mounted
officers were released I had had several visits from and brief conversations
with Superintendent Chapman and Chief Inspector Beal.

I then heard the game start at around I presume 3.00 p.m. However, my
staff were still outside the ground due to a small number of supporters
still being in the locality and additionally the fact that some of the
turnstiles were to remain open until half time.
                                                                             0



                                  -   4   -



The next thing I recall was that there was an address over the tanoy system
requesting spectators to either stay off or get off the pitch. Very shortly
after this there was a police radio message for all available officers to
go into the ground. I Saw both my serial sergeants i.e. P.S. 767 Jessop
and P.S. 1080 Hoyland instruct their staff to close the turnstiles and
they proceeded into the ground. I went into the ground via gate 'O' in
company with Superintendent Chapman. As I entered the section between
the north stand and the Spion Kop, I saw that there were numerous supporters
on the pitch at the Leppings Lane end of the ground and there was a hostile
atmosphere in the crowd. To all intents and purposes, it seemed that there
had been a pitch invasion from the Leppings Lane end terraces.  I could see
that there was a good police presence at that end of the ground and I
therefore instructed the staff on the perimeter track at the Spion Kop end
to ensure that there was no pitch invasion from that end.

There were numerous officers arriving at the ground several were going to
the Leppings Lane end and some remained at the Kop end.

It seemed that numerous spectators were coming from the Leppings Lane end
of the ground up to the Kop. Several were restrained and held back from
antagonising the crowd in the K o p . After some time I could see that
spectators around the ground were beginning to break down several of the
advertising hoardings which they began to carry back in towards the
Leppings Lane end of the ground. I then saw what were obviously injured
people being carried from that end of the ground to the Kop end. The
atmosphere in general appeared very volatile with spectators in these
initial stages jeering and shouting and venting their frustration at the
pitch invasion.

I caused several officers at this end of the ground to rip down remaining
advertising hoardings and clear the debris of the support structures so
that they could not be used as weapons in the event of any further outbreak
of violence.

It seemed that whatever was happening at the Leppings Lane end of the
ground that little control was being gained and there were still people
after what seemed a considerable period of time, clambering over on to the
pitch, some of whom were running to the Spion Kop end or towards Nottingham
supporters in the south stand antagonising the crowd with gestures.

As time progressed the mood of the Nottingham supporters began to quieten
and applause was heard as what were obviously or appeared to be injured
people being carried to this end of the ground. About 3.25 p.m. a cordon
of officers began to form and move from the Spion Kop end of the ground
up to the half way line. I then went up to this cordon and assisted in
trying to calm and reason with spectators who were in various emotional
states.  Some appeared to be wandering about aimlessly and in tears whilst
others were aggressive and hostile, shouting threats and displaying
geatures at the crowd and the police.

I was approached by a youth of about 20 years dressed in a blue sweat shirt
who was in an extremely hostile and aggressive mood. He began to harrange
me with various obscenities and threats of violence. However, was
restrained by some nearby supporters. He was obviously suffering the
effects of alcohol but appeared to calm when confronted with his fellow
supporters.
However, as I began to move away from him, I felt a violent blow to the
base of my neck below the right ear obviously having been hit. I looked
to the floor and saw a plastic bag which I picked up and found to contain
a heavy object but which I did not examine.  It had obviously been thrown
by the youth who I had just,spoken to as I was approached by two of his
colleagues who began pleading that I did not arrest him. I handed one
of the youths the plastic bag and told them to take him away.

Whilst I was in the area around the centre of the pitch, I remember hearing
a tanoy broadcast from the Liverpool Manager although I do not recall its
content. I was also at one stage instructed by Chief Superintedent Nesbitt
to secure the Spion Kop perimeter by the use of some dog men to release
further officers from that side of the ground to reinforce the cordon in
the centre of the pitch. Having done this, I again returned to the central
area and had by this time learned that there were at least two people dead
because of crushing on the Leppings Lane terraces.  It was not until this
time which must have been at least 30-35 minutes after I had entered the
ground that I became aware that the situation was not simply one of a
mere pitch invasion but was something of a greater proportion and
complexity. Again around this time I became aware from a tanoy broadcast
that the match was to be abandoned.

In consequence of the match abandonment I spoke to either Chief Superintendent
Nesbitt/Mole or Superintendent Chapman and was deputed to take half of the
cordon which extended from the centre spot to the north stand outside the
ground at the Spion Kop end to assist in the loading of the buses and to
ensure a safe dispersal of the crowd.

The leaving spectators were safely dispersed as had been planned for
phase III and about 5.15 p.m. I returned to the ground.  It was at this
point that I became aware of the magnitude of the incident and of the
disaster that had taken place.

After a de-brief in the north stand, I assisted in reorganising personnel
who had attended the ground as a result of operation support into serials
for despatch to the town centre in anticipation of public order incidents.

I later returned to the gymnasium in company with Chief Inspector Beal,
Chief Inspector Creaser and Inspectors Burns and Sewell where we assisted
Inspector Charles in the setting up of the casualty bureau. I was later
engaged in the reception of relatives who viewed photographs of deceased
persons fatally injured at the ground and in the general running and
administration of the identification procedures.

I retired from duty at 5.00 a.m.

I did not specifically handle any bodies which were removed from the
Lepping Lane end of the ground my only involvment with bodies was in the
make shift mortuary.
                                                                              { J i&   °




                                  -   6   -



In relation to command structure at the time of the catastrophe I would say
that Chief Superintendent Nesbitt and Superintendent Chapman were the only
two officers in the initial stages with whom I had any contact. Radio
communications were very restrictive and the radio was either down or when
it was utilised could not be heard due to the volume of the crowd.

At the time and during the time I was inside the ground I only became aware
in the very later stages that there had been fatalities. To all intents
and purposes, from where I had been it looked like there had been a pitch
invasion.

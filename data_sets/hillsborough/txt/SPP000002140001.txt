Dear Mr. Webster,

             Hillsborough Disaster Inquests - Judicial Review

 Thank you for your letter and have spoken to Sarah Pimkott-jf
(apologies if I have spelt the name wrong) in the department
 today.

I only went down to listen to the Zeebrugge inquest for one day
   f ^ aS 1 remember the DPP's investigation followed the inquest
m that case.                                                ^

I think there was a DPP investigation in the Marchioness
disaster. The coroner in that case was Dr Knapman. I recollect
that he had some problems with sorting out the inquests but
cannot remember precisely how he did it. I expect if he were
approached he would discuss it. I cannot remember what happened
in the Kegworth air disaster. That was handled by the coroner
m Loughborough who might be able to fill in the details. There
were other disasters too for example the Bradford fire disaster
which also involved a football stadium but as far as I can
recollect although there was an inquiry I do not think that the
DPP was involved. Jim Turnbull the coroner in Bradford could
help.

As far as I recollect Mr. Sturt did adopt a cut of and was in
fact judicially reviewed and upheld on the selection made by him.
I have given the title of the case to your colleague over the
phone.

I do not think I can help you further.

I understand that a conference has been arranged for 26th August
I look forward to receiving details in due course.

Yours sincerely,

S . L . Popper.

                         have arranged a conference with Counsel in connection with the
                         above mentioned matter on Thursday 26 August 1993. The
                         conference will commence at 11.00am.

                         The conference will take place at Counsel's Chambers at 1 Crown
                         Office Row, Temple, London EC4Y 7HH

                         I enclose with this letter the following

                         1.               A       copy of Counsel's preliminary advice dated 10.8.93.

                         2.               A copy of the draft Affidavit which I propose filing on
                                          your behalf.

                         3.               A copy of a draft Affidavit which I propose to file on my
                                          behalf.

                         The three documents referred to above have all been prepared by
                         the Council with whom we will be having the conference on 26
                         August 1993.

                         The enclosed documents were prepared by Counsel at a time when
                         he had limited information available to him. Counsel has now
                         received extensive documentation which should allow him to
                         prepare to further draft Affidavits incorporating the
                         information he since received.

                         I shall look forward to meeting you on 26 August 1993.

                         Yours sincerely

50   CHARGES FOR POLICING OF FOOTBALL MATCHES
     (FOR THIS ITEM THE CHAIRMAN VACATED THE CHAIR AND LEFT THE MEETING.    THE
     CHAIR WAS TAKEN BY COUNCILLOR G GALLIMORE).
     The Clerk and Financial Officer referred to minute 23 of the meeting of
     the Finance and General Purposes Committee held on 9 August 1991 when the
     detail of the charges for the policing of football matches had been
     established for the 1991/92 season. In relation to 1990/91 satisfactory
     arrangements had been concluded in respect of League games but the clubs
     disputed the Authority's charges for the Cup games in 1990/91.
     RESOLVED
                                                                   âœ“
     1      That the previous decision be reaffirmed at the formula at which the
           South Yorkshire Football Clubs made their payments for policing of
           football matches for 1990/91 applied to Cup games also.
     2      That payment be demanded and if it is not forthcoming legal action be
           taken for recovery.
51   COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE POLICE

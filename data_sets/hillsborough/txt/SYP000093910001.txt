           I    left          the     pen    via    the      front     gate/in          the    front       perimeter          fence.       Jusjt

soon    after          I had       got       out       from    the    pen,          the        game       was       stopped,




Between       about          ten       minutes          past     three         (13^80           and       fifteen          minutes       past

Kop    end.        There          were       other       supporters             in        attendance                with    the    hoarding

and    were       in    the       process          of    picking          it    u      I            went       across       to    help       with

the    hoarding.                 Together          with       the    oth^r          s u p p o r t e r s,        I    picked       the

hoarding          up    and       carried          it    t o w a rds/the            corner           of    the       ground       in    between

the    North       Stand          and       the    Kop    End./       I was          towards              the       front    of    the

hoarding          on    the       left       hand       si&g/,      nearest          the        North          Stand.        There       was

one    lad    in       front       of       me    carrying          the     front          left       hand          corner.




When    I first             picked          the    hoarding          up,       I presumed                 it    was       another       injured

fan,    however             as    we    carried          the     hoarding             I    realised             that       the    person          was

dead.        The       persons          arms       were       flopped          over        the       side       of    the    hoarding

and    there       was       no    movement.              The       person          was        lying       on       his    back    with       his

head    towards             the    front          of    the    hoarding.                  The       head       was    tilted       towards

me    and    there          were       no    signs       of    life       in    the        mans       face.




We    carried          the       hoarding          into       the    area       between              the       North       Stand       and    t he

Kop    where       there          was       at    least       one    ambulance                 parked          alongside          the    North

                   Stand,         I left           the    hoarding          at    that    point          and    a    couple         of    ambulancemen

                   took     hold        of    the    hoarding             and    carried       it       towards       the    area         at    the      rear

                   of    the     North        Stand.           I then       returned          to    the    Lappings          Lane         end       of   t he

                   ground.

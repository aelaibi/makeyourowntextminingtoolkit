Thank you for your letter dated 23 May conveying the Rt Hon Lord
Justice Taylor's invitation to the Building Control Committee to
submit written evidence to the second stage of the inquiry. The
Committee is meeting on the 8 June to consider the matter and I will
write to you again shortly thereafter.       It may not, however, be
possible to meet the date of 12 June, although I will do everything
practicable to that end.

Evidence to the


HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY


June 1989


INTRODUCTION


1.    The       Secretary              to      the        Inquiry           wrote         on      behalf         of the Rt Hon Lord
      Justice           Taylor to               the         Secretary of the Institute's Building Control
      Committee              on      the       23        May      1989       inviting            the       submission of written
     material.


2.    Lord Justice Taylor's terms of reference were stated to b e :


      "To       inquire            into the events at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground on
      15      April          1989 and            to        make recommendations about the needs of crowd
     control and safety at sports grounds."


3-   The       Committee,              Chairman                Sydney         E Bell, Dip Arch (Birm) RIBA, Acting
     County           Architect             Nottinghamshire County Council, met at the RIBA on 8
     June        1989.            It had before it the Secretary's letter dated 23 May 1989
     and         general plans                  and       sections           of the Sheffield Wednesday ground at
     Hillsborough                 which         had       been provided through the Secretary's office.
     The         Chairman subsequently went to look at the ground and whilst unable
     to      gain         access          was       able         to      look at the external spaces around the
     ground.                The       capacity figures for each stand have been obtained from
     the Club.


4.   We      are       aware of the general background to the disaster as reported by
     the       news        media          but       not of detailed evidence provided to the inquiry
     and       our        evidence is therefore limited to observations on the planning
     layout          and       detail design considerations which may have influenced the
     course          of      events           and        suggestions              on how these considerations might
     affect decisions in the future so as to prevent a recurrence.
SPACE OUTSIDE THE GROUND AND ENCLOSED AREA


5.   We    consider            the     fundamental              cause     of     the    disaster      to    be due to
     overcrowding.                By        overcrowding we mean the number of people within a
     confined       space        are         in       excess      of     themaximum number that space is
     designed        to       hold      safely.               Overcrowding        in    any     space      can   be     a
     distressing              experience           for     some        people but rarely leads to multiple
     fatalities,           nevertheless               movement can create local pressures and lead
     to    people         being        crushed.                Where     however the floor of the space is
     sloping        or        stepped        the        force     of gravity will increase the pressure
     exerted        by        a crowd        on those people at                 the bottom of the slope.              The
     greater        the        depth        of     the        slope, i.e. from pitch to the back of the
     crowd,     the           greater        the        potential        pressure.           Crush    barriers        are
     therefore           frequently           introduced           to     try    and     reduce the build up of

     pressure.


6.   We    look      at        four     aspects           of     crowd        control    in this paper.          First,
     admittance           to     the        ground;             secondly,        admittance to any enclosure;
     third, communication and fourth, general safety considerations.


7.   The     Sheffield           Wednesday              ground at Hillsborough, like many other club
     grounds        situated           in     an        urban     environment,          is    in     a built-up area
     surrounded           by     residential              housing,        main and residential roads.                 The
     ground     is        hemmed        in       by      the     surrounding development and whilst the
     pitch     and        stands        are        of     a     high     standard       befitting a club of the
     stature        of        Sheffield Wednesday the surrounding space outside the club
     ground     is        inadequate             to      provide        for     the effective supervision and
     marshalling of large crowds of spectators.


8.   In    particular, while turnstiles serving the North Stand, Spion Cop and
     the     whole of the South Stand are dispersed along a length of 400m; the
     turnstiles           serving        the          remainder of the North Stand and the whole of
     the     West        Stand are all contained within a length of 40m.                                   Furthermore
     the     width        of     the access from Leppings Lane is only 22m and the depth
     of    space         in     front        of the turnstiles to the road edge is only in the
     order of 25 m.
                                                                  - 3 -


9.   The        dispersal           of     turnstiles              on the east and south boundaries of the
     ground           does        provide           some        space     to     marshal the crowd but even here
     space        is        limited, particularly adjacent to Penistone Road North where
     the        pavement           is     only        5m wide and the road must become obstructed by
     spectators.


10. At      the        Leppings           Lane entrance the confined area does not provide any
     space        where           orderly           queues at the turnstiles can be formed and would
     appear           to     provide           no     opportunity              for    thee     police to exercise any
     effective              control.                For        example, 23 turnstiles admitting 10 persons
     per        minute        would        admit           230 people in 1 minute.                Ten minutes queuing
     time        would result in a crowd outside thee turnstiles of 2 , 3 0 0 which in
     the        space        available              means        they    would        be     packed    as   tightly as a
     capacity              crowd        on the terrace.                 These turnstiles serve half the North
     Stand        and        the        West        Stand and terrace with a capacity of 19,416.                      It
     therefore would take 1 to 1.5 hours to admit all spectators.


11. The         latest        edition           of        the     Home     Office          'Guide to Safety at Sports
     Grounds'              is an excellent publication but only makes brief reference in
     para        46        to the need to have contingency plans to deal with situations
     where        available entrances at a ground have proved insufficient to stop
     unduly           large        crowds from                 gathering outside.             No guidance is given to
     what        external space outside turnstiles is desirable and where space is
     inadequate.                   It     would be difficult to imagine what those contingency
     plans could be.


12. The         handbook           of     'Sports and Recreation Building Design' published by
     The        Sports        Council           states           "As    pedestrian           traffic   approaches   the
     stadium           there        is    much            to    be said for segregating it from vehicular
     traffic           and        immediately              surrounding          the    building there should be a
     clear        circulation              so       as to allow spectators to walk unimpeded around
     the        entire stadium.                 Clearly visible from this ambulatory there should
     be     regularly spaced turnstile positions, sufficient in number to admit
     at     a    rate         fast        enough           to avoid large admission queues and yet slow
     enough           for     the        comfortable             distribution          of     spectators     within the
     ground."              ....     "If        site dimensions inhibit an external ambulatory, it
     should be incorporated within the perimeter of the stadium."                                             The
                                                                  - 4 -


      Hillsborough              ground       does           not     fulfil those conditions and we believe
      the     selection of this neutral ground to be unfortunate.                                     In defence of
      those     who       made the decision we must say that they may have had little
      alternative          and        that      conditions            surrounding other venues might have

      been equally bad.


13. We       would        recommend that games with this emotional content should only
      be    staged        at venues where there are adequate access and facilities to
      enable     effective             crowd       management             to be obtained.          For example, The
      Sports     Council's             handbook             refers to the close proximity of a railway
      station       and coach parking.                      Provision for car parking (on street or in
      parks)     within          a     reasonable distance, the ability to obtain access to
      the     entire       perimeter              of        the    enclosed        ground    and the dispersal of
      turnstiles          around         the       perimeter          adjacent to the particular stand or

      enclosure they serve.


14.   Few      existing grounds are likely to meet these criteria and if they are
      not     available we suggest that a number of regional football stadia may
      need     to     be provided in suitable locations where major football events
      could     be        staged.            We        do     not recommend multipurpose stadia because
      provision           for     other        sports,             and particularly athletics, reduces the
      quality        of     experience that a good football stadium can provide.                               That
      does     not        inhibit the use of the stadia for other activities including
      pop     concerts ,          megastores and specialised supermarkets which could use

      many of the same facilities.


15.   Although        we        are advocating the use of stadia which meet the necessary
      criteria        for        crowd         management for             special         events    we do not see a
      wholesale           need for clubs to move from their current sites.                               The police
      should        advise        clubs of the size of crowd they can effectively control
      outside        the        ground       and        this        should    be     an     additional criteria in
      determining           a ground's capacity - this may necessitate some clubs with
      a     large     following           moving             to more appropriate accommodation and some
      events        which will attract a larger than normal crowd being staged away
      from the home ground.


16.    These     first          set     of observations are principally concerned with space
      outside        the enclosed area of the ground and stands.                                   We would now like
     to    comment on the control of crowds in terms of access to terraces and
    grandstands.


ADMITTANCE TO ENCLOSURES


17- In     our     view          the prime cause of death on the west central terrace was
    due     to     overcrowding,              i.e.        an    excessive     number    of    people     having
    obtained          access to the ground were able to gain uncontrolled access to
    the prime viewing spot behind the goal.


18. The      'Handbook            of    Sports and Recreational Building Design' recommends
    one     turnstile             for each 1,000 spectators and that turnstiles should in
    addition           control          the     dispersal         within     the   ground.       It     further
    recommends             that standing spectators should be divided into pens with a
    capacity          of     about 2,000 and that each pen should have its own pair of
    turnstiles             and     exits      to        the perimeter.       The capacity of the central
    pens     on the west terrace is of this order (i.e. 370m2 x 54 persons/lOm
          2,000).            However,         there is no separate control to this section at
    Hillsborough             and       the    turnstiles          would     appear to allow considerably
    more     people          into       an    area which serves several enclosures.                    In that,
    the ground does not conform with good practice.


19- We     would           agree       with the recommendation in the handbook bythe Sports
    Council        -and       with       that contained in paragraph 101 of                   the 'Guide to
    Safety       at         Sports       Grounds'          that access to any compound or         section of
    stand     should          be       independently controlled.               This should be     done so as
    to     count the number gaining entry to any compound and stop access once
    capacity          is     reached.           It is possible to control access to the ground
    separately             from    access          to    individual       enclosures and tickets can be
    collected          at     either         point.            Individual enclosures should, however,
    ideally         be       equipped         with       toilet     facilities     at   the    minimum     and
    refreshment facilities are also desirable.


20. The     provision of individual seats is another way of exercising control
    on     numbers and we would recommend seated provision be expanded as more
    in     keeping         with        modern      life-styles        but not to the exclusion of all
    standing       provision.                 As     control      in the form we are suggesting will
    cost    money           it may be acceptable in existing grounds to impose it only
    in the most popular areas where pressure on space is always high.
COMMUNICATIONS


21. The     third           issue        on        which we would comment is that of communication.
    Emergencies              happen           quickly.             It    is       difficult for people outside a
    crowd        to        realise           that a serious emergency is developing.                           The police
    outside           the        ground,           in the crowd, realised they had an emergency and
    took     some           action.                To     our knowledge no one in authority was in the
    crowd        in        the     enclosures              and we suggest that consideration should be
    given        to        stewards           with        radio communication being placed in the most
    popular           enclosures              to        monitor     the situation and keep ground control
    informed.


22. Most     grounds              have public announcement facilities and in our view this
    is     a tool which if used effectively could help in most emergencies.                                             A
    large        crowd           will        react        with sympathy if they know what is happening
    and     instructions                 can           be given to a large number of people, including
    officials,              very        quickly           by    effective use of the public announcement
    facility.                Time        is        of     the     essence         -    it only takes 3 minutes for
    someone           to     suffocate.                  The      requirements           of     a good communications
    system        is        set     out           in     the    'Guide       to       Safety     at     Sports Grounds'.
    Effective              communication                is,     however, not an end in itself - it is an
    aid     to     effective                 management.               The    guide       sets        out the duties and
    responsibilities                    of        management        in Chapter 2.              The guide however does
    not    lay         enough stress - in fact it hardly mentions - the need to have
    someone        in       total        management control once spectators have entered the
    ground        until           they have all left.                   The manager is responsible not only
    for     the       game        but         also the ground, staff and all spectators, he must
   have      the        ability              to     appraise       a     situation,           make (often unpopular)
   decisions               quickly            and       above     all    give         instructions        as   they   are
   necessary.


23. On    detailed design matters, not having been inside the ground, we have
    little        comment.                    If the crush barriers were of adequate strength we
   would      have          expected              them     to     have prevented the crowd pressure that
   resulted           in     so     many           deaths.          Medical           evidence might be useful in
   ascertaining              if the crush barriers were of safe design or if they were
   the cause of some injuries.
GENERAL SAFETY


24. We     must     express some concern about safety at football grounds.                            There
    is     always        a conflict between security and safety but safety should be
    paramount.                Whenever an emergency occurs in a football ground with so
    many        people        there is frequently only one safe space to go to and that
    is     on     the pitch.              The current practice on so many grounds of erecting
    fencing        between           the crowd and the pitch creates a hazardous situation
    whenever        an emergency occurs and we deplore the practice.                          Emergencies
    can     take     many           forms       -     fire, bomb scare, structural failure, maniac
    behaviour,           or        overcrowding - all require the quick movement of people
    away from the danger.


25- If     no     other        way can be found to prevent pitch invasions than fencing
    (and        there must be better ways in the interest of football) it must be
    possible        for        50        to    100%     of     that   fence to be opened quickly in an
    emergency.                The        operation       can    be    by    a   number of means but local
    pressure        sensors and both local and remote automatic release should be
    possible.            Other forms of barrier which prevent escape onto the pitch
    should also be avoided.


26. It     is     easy        to     be       wise after the event but we believe the available
    space        outside           the    ground        was such that the police had an impossible
    job     in     trying           to     control       the    crowd      there.    Lack   of control of
   spectators        inside              the    ground led to overcrowding of the central pens
   and     the     fence erected to prevent access to the pitch by the crowd was
   the reason this emergency turned into a disaster.


27- We     would     recommend                that     research should be carried out to establish
    what     space        is desirable for marshalling crowds outside turnstiles and
    standards        determined.                     These would be a further limitation on ground
    capacity       and this should be included in the 'Guide to Safety at Sports
   Grounds'.

 FOREWORD
                                                                            References
In 1986 HMSO published the Guide to safety a t sports grounds               Guide to safety
to provide measures for improving spectator safety primarily                a t sports grounds,
a t existing sports grounds for management, local authorities,              HMSO, London 1986
and specialist technical consultants such as engineers. It was
itself the result of considerable discussion by a technical panel
chaired by Mr Martin Killoran to advise Mr Justice Popplewell               Com m ittee of Inquiry
for his report Com m ittee of Inquiry into Crowd Safety and                 into Crowd Safety and
Control a t Sports Grounds.                                                 Control a t Sports
                                                                            Grounds, July 1985
Many sports grounds in the UK were built up piecemeal as
the fortunes of individual clubs improved and attendances
increased. Attendances reached peak levels in the early 1960s,              Guide to fire precautions
and facilities were expanded, often without sufficient thought              in existing places of
for long-term planning and m aintenance.                                    entertainm ent and like
                                                                            premises, Home Office
With falling attendances once again prevalent, lack of money
and of imagination has led to many sports grounds lagging
behind foreign contemporaries in quality and appeal. Decay
of the fabric, lack of maintenance, change of social habits
have aggravated this effect.

New concepts in the standards and techniques of management,
diversity of use to which these sports grounds can be put, and
the relationship of the facility itself to its community are
required. These necessitate considerably b e tte r maintenance,
more methodical appraisal and higher standards of refurbishment
or design if the requirem ents of com fort, appeal and safety
are to be met within the finite budgets of most clubs. Appropriate
certification can then be gained from the Licencing Authorities.

It is of paramount importance to ensure the safe evacuation
of spectators in an emergency.

This publication is intended to stim ulate the imagination of
all parties to improve the imagery th a t the public holds of
sports grounds by the application of sound method and engineering
principles to make such places safer, more com fortable and
satisfying to visit.

Its task is to help increase the chance of success of such facilities
in the community as well as reduce the risk of failure.

 SCOPE
                                                                        References
This publication provides a companion book to Appraisal                 Appraisal of existing
of existing stru ctures first published by the Institution              structures, Institution
of Structural Engineers in July 1980. It is to a c t as a               of Structural Engineers,
reference source to the m ulti-faceted problem of refurbishing,         July 1980
appraising, or designing sports grounds. It also aims at
developing an overall engineering methodology and body
of scientific knowledge to enable com petent personnel
to carry out reliable and complete appraisal of existing
sports grounds (or the design of new ones).

It is also intended th at this booklet be complementary
to the Guide to safety a t sports grounds to improve the
knowledge of and communication between different categories
of person concerned in the operation of sports grounds.
It is addressed to the following persons:

(i)     Directors and managers of sports clubs who must
        run clubs to a budget and provide a service to the
        customer th a t can be afforded and which is satisfying,
        safe and controllable

(ii)    Engineers, arch itects and other consultants engaged
        by the clubs' managers to appraise, design the refurbishm ent
        and organise any necessary maintenance

(iii)   Public officers responsible for approving measures
        for refurbishm ent and maintenance, and for licencing
        sports grounds for their various uses.

The attendance a t most sports grounds are generally sufficiently
low not to put strain on the existing, perhaps under-m aintained
fabric. Occasionally a particular fixture brings to th a t
sports ground the possibility of near capacity attendances,
putting pressure on under-practised management, overcrowding
the way of ingress and egress, and straining the underÂ­
maintained sports ground with the resulting considerable
erosion to public safety . Bradford was just such a case
in point.

It is the responsibility of club management to appraise
themselves of the necessary measures to prevent risk
to their clubs and the public by employing professionally
competent personnel to advise them on any repairing,
refurbishment, and certification th at will be required
before their sports ground can be used to its full potential.

2.   PLANNING MATTERS : WHAT MANAGEMENT SHOULD KNOW

     2.1       REGULATIONS AND SAFETY                                     References
               The Safety a t sports grounds Act 1987 imposes a
               licensing system on sports clubs* with stands having
               a capacity of 500 or more. The implications of
               the Act for club managements are far reaching.
               In future managements will need to be aware not
               only of the regulations and associated documents
               but also of what measures will need to be implemented.
               The main regulations are:

               The Building Regulations 1985 (for England   &.   Wales)
           The Building Standards (Scotland) Regulations 1977
           (for Scotland)
           The Building Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1977
             (for Northern Ireland)

           Approved document B2/3/4 Fire spread gives guidance
           on the fire safety provisions of the regulations for
           England and Wales.

           Management will be responsible for overall safety
           of the public. This means, in ter alia:

           -     having available drawings of the overall facility
                 (1 : 1000 city plan; 1 : 500 ground plan and section
                 showing principal means of ingress and egress,
                 com partm entation and other facilities such as
                 location of stew ards and public address system

           -     being able to identify
                   potentially combustible m aterials and building
                   fabric

                   potentially dangerously degraded or substandard
                   fabric

           -     establishing the principal needs for good access
                 and egress

           -     providing good inform ation transmission systems

           -     keeping the conditions of terraces, viewing slopes,
                 stairway, etc. in good condition




           * Sports grounds are widely defined in the Act to
           include not only soccer, rugby, cricket, tennis, etc.
           but also horse and greyhound racing, athletics, etc.
           grounds.

      -   establishing the need for appraisal, testing and
          refurbishm ent (usually without disruption to
          the sports programme and club facilities) to
          bring the ground to the required standard

      -   establishing a planned preventative maintenance
          routine

      -   establishing a strategy for em ergencies

      Management will need to estim ate the necessary
      work and prepare a cost plan (probably on a quarterly
      basis) so th a t the aims can be achieved. A list of
      day-to-day routine responsibilities is given in Appendix
      A.

      This docum ent is aimed primarily a t advising on
      safety for sp ectators in existing sports grounds,
      and as such it attem p ts to take account of the contraints
      and difficulties th a t are present within these grounds.
      Although it is not a design brief for new construction
      work or reconstruction a t sports grounds, the principles
      may well still be applicable. Such work should not
      be to a standard lower than th a t set out here, and
      the scope offered by new design work should lead
      to b e tte r standards than can be achieved a t grounds
      already built.


2.2   MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS

      2.2.1   Preparation of drawings of sports ground
              The im pact of a new sports ground on the
              local infrastructure requires careful consideration
              from the aspects of road safety; traffic
              congestion; environmental changes and the
              e ffe c t on the lives of the local residents
              during m atch days.

              The convergence of over 30 000 persons on
              a locus within an urban neighbourhood can
              c re a te both tra ffic congestion and the potential
              for road accidents. The construction of a
              m ajor sports ground within a community
              also can create social and physical stress.

              In regard to the social behaviour of the spectators
              converging on the sports ground it is im portant
              th a t confrontation of the supporters is avoided
              through ease of access to the respective
              p arts of the sports ground. An open-plan
              sports ground free from boundary fences
              and having freedom of access from most
              compass affords the best solution to crowd
              control.

              Such e ffe c ts are best judged from a plan
              of the sports ground and surroundings a t a
              scale of about 1:1000. Further larger scale
              drawings of the ground and its constituent
              p arts will be required.


                             2/2

2 2.2    Access for emergency vehicles                            COPY No. - 2
         Adequate roads for emergency vehicles such
         as fire appliances and ambulances should
         be provided so th at speedy and direct access
         can be obtained to all buildings within the
         ground. Emergency routes should be defined
         (in consultattion with the police).

        Wherever practicable and where necessary
        roads within 0.5km (5 mile) of the ground
        should be kept entirely free of parked vehicles
        so as not to delay or obstruct the access
        of em ergency vehicles.

2.2.3   Considerations affecting capacity
        There are two elem ents in the design of facilities
        for crowds - crowd management and crowd
        control. In good design the crowd would
        be managed such th at its self-m otivation
        would lead it to behave correctly. Crowd
        control is necessary where self-m otivation
        would lead to incorrect behaviour.

        In many instances, the required safety standard       Guide to safety a t sports
        to be attained will relate to the maximum             grounds, HMSO, London
        number of spectators who are liable to be             1986 (Section 16)
        adm itted to the ground (or p art of it). For
        example, a large football ground with a maximum       BS to comment
        sp ectato r capacity of tens of thousands is
        liable to pose significant crowd pressure
        risks. To accommodate safely a maximum
        crowd a t such a ground might entail substantial
        rem edial work; alternatively, consideration
        might be given to accepting a much sm aller
        number of spectators who, properly dispersed,
        could be accommodated safely without having
        to incur costly repairs or alterations. The
        first step, therefore, is to assess how many
        people can be safely accommodated in the
        different sections of ground given the existing
        condition of the ground, i.e. to determ ine
        a safe spectator capacity.

        (Note: practical example to be included that
        differen tiates between normal and emergency
        conditions.)

        Although controlling crowd numbers may
        serve to reduce some risks to an acceptable
        level, rem edial work is likely to be necessary
        to overcome others. Obvious defects such
        as trip hazards (especially a t the head of
        stairs or steps), loose or weak handrails on
        stairs, and obstructed exists of exit routes,
        should be rectified as part of the general
        care and maintenance of a ground. Structures
        should be sound and inspected by suitably
        qualified persons. Design, layout and signposting
        of exits and exit routes require particular
        atten tio n to ensure th at they can safety cope
        with the number of spectators who will use
        them a t the end of an event or in an emergency.
         Similarly, the condition of terraces of viewing
        slopes and presence or otherwise of crush
        barriers, correctly sited and m eeting the
        described strength tests are im portant factors.

      Broken, uneven terracing causes stumbling.
      Barriers not only serve to break up crowd
      pressures but also assist in controlling movement
      off the terrace s by restrictin g the rate of
      arrival a t exits to suit th eir capacity, and
      encouraging the form ation of queues so th at
      spectators arrive a t exits in an orderly fashion.

      It follows th a t in general in a ground where
      it is proposed to retain a high spectator capacity,
      the measures needed to be taken to accom m odate
      safety such large crowds are potentially more
      extensive.

2.4 Division of ground
      A ground should be divided into sections to
      prevent potentially hazardous migrations
      by spectators. Each section of a ground has
      its own lim it of safe capacity and a major
      migration can cause dangerous overcrowding.
      Each section of the ground, for example,
      each end or side, should be self-contained
      with its own entrances, exits and toilet/refreshm ent
      facilities. For football grounds in particular
      there should be no access from one such major
      section to another except in an emergency.
      At other sporting events such as greyhound
      racing spectators may need to move freely
      between different parts of the ground, and
      this should be borne in mind when considering
      access to and from the sections of the ground.

2.5 Signposting
      A comprehensive system of signposting th at
      clearly indicates routes to the various parts
      of the ground, and the the exits from the
      ground, should be provided. Signs relating
      to fire safety and other safety signs (e.g.
      first aid facilities) should also be provided.
      Exit gates them selves should be clearly signposted,
      preferably using illum inated signs. Directional
      signs should be provided to encourage crowds
      in any particular section to flow in one direction
      when leaving the ground.

2.6   Exits
      Locked exit g ates should be manned by a
      ste.ward a t all tim es when the public are
      in the ground, to ensure they can be opened
      im m ediately from inside by anyone in an
      emergency. The use of a common pass key
      for all exits should be considered, as should
      one-way exits to cope with normal conditions.

      All gangways and exit routes must be unobstructed
      and capable of being used to their full capacity
      at all tim es when the public are in the ground.
      Every part of an exit route should be able
      to accom m odate the flow from the terrace
      or stand exit.

2.3   REFURBISHMENT AND RECONSTRUCTION WITHOUT                       COPY No.   1
      DISRUPTION TO CLUB ACTIVITIES

      2.3.1   General
              Changes in legislation and the need to make
              significant improvements in the provisions
              for spectators have presented football clubs
              with a serious challenge to their existence.
              Clubs of different standing within the present
              league structures are confronted by major
              expenditure on th eir existing grounds in order
              to m eet future standards in com fort, safety
              and com petition.

              Functional and financial considerations often
              necessitate the redevelopment work being
              carried out in phases, and management of
              projects of this kind equates with the special
              technical and practical skills required to
              design and construct large-span structures.
              Whether the aim is to construct a single stand
              within an existing ground or to create a com pletely
              new complex, the project requires technical,
              managerial and financial skills of a high calibre.

              Safety provisions must comply with the requirem ents
              of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1986.
              Comformity with fire regulations is of paramount
              importance.

              Ingenuity of design, construction and the
              creation of new provisions will determine
              the health and welfare of sport in general,
              and football in particular. Current technology
              is advanced sufficiently to perm it the reliable
              design and construction of new concepts
              in sports grounds, provided that they are
              commercially viable.

      2.3.2   Preplanning
              There are many im portant m atters to be
              considered in the creation of sports grounds,
              and preplanning the project management
              are essential elem ents of reconstruction.

              Preplanning commences with a definition
              of the overall concept of the proposal for
              development, by identifying and researching
              the potential m arket for the facilities and
              by making arrangem ents for financing the
              reconstruction work.

      2.3.3 Spectator safety
              Safety of spectators requires consideration
              to be given to the behaviour of large masses
              of people stim ulated by certain events. Hooliganism
              can be inflam m atory and can result in extrem e
              behaviour by small groups or encourage the
              general misbehaviour of large masses of spectators.
               Unruly behaviour is identified best by seating
              all spectators since serious mischief in terracings
              is clandestine and difficult to control.

                                                                       COPY No     .1
               Easy access to groups of spectators is im portant,
               and an adquate system of passageways facilitates
               crowd control. Television cam eras can also
               a c t as a d eterren t. Alcohol is a stim ulant
               to be avoided since it can cause unacceptable
               behaviour in some individuals. Alcholic drinks        / / BS to revise
               cannot be taken into grounds in Scotland.

               The provision of a high security fence between
               the spectators and the playing field prevents
               both the exercising of control over crowd
               misbehaviour and the egress of spectators
               a t a tim e of panic or disaster. The use of
               fences to re stric t crowd movement in a cage
^3-g jls A     environment is not the best solution. Safety
               is best served by an open-plan concept for
               grounds where spectators are placed within
  s i* - ) ,   specific areas to and from which access and           DC to comment
               egress are rapid and simple.                          BS to comment

               The latter-d ay concept of high walls and
               fences around grounds within which pay-
               kiosks are located is no longer tenable, and
               new grounds should elim inate the restrictive
               strips of land between the boundary fences
               and the spectator stands. Pay-kiosks should
               be positioned within the stands and the boundary
               fences should be removed.

               The removal of the barriers to free movement
               outside the stands elim inates the feeling
               of being within a stockade and promotes
               b e tte r crowd behaviour. The occasional misdemeanours
               by some spectators is readily handled within
               an open-plan system . Incidents within strips        / / DC to consider
               of land between boundary fences and stands
               are difficult to handle and control, and the
               ease of access provided by the removal of
               boundary fences facilitates crowd handling
               by police, and operations by fire and ambulance
               services.

               Stairs providing access and egress to stands
               should be well designed to obviate dangerous
               jostling by spectators and dangerous forward
               movements to groups of spectators. Collapse
               of a mass of individuals can cause severe
               crushing of persons caught in the zones of
               maximum thrust.

               Rapid exit of spectators in emergency situations
               is im portant, and generous provisions should
               be made.

               The m aterials used in the construction of
               new grounds should inhibit combustion and
               the spread of fire and provide spectators
               with an opportunity for escape and survival.

      Comfort is a relative description in the context
      of open-air grounds since clim atic conditions
      control largely the amount of comfort being
      experienced by spectators.

      Seating should be clean and com fortable,
      and the manoeuvrable spaces between the
      seats should be adequate for all sizes of persons.
      Seating decks should be free of columns to
      perm it a clear view of the playing surface
      by all spectators. Spectators should be close
      as possible to the playing surface.

 3.3.2    Additional facilities beneath stands
         The use of grounds on an in term itten t basis,
         is a commercial lim itation th at necessitates
         additional income from other sources such
         as pools and sponsors. The use of space for
         div jrse commercial businesses within sports
         grounds can provide financial resources for
         the club and can benefit the local community
         by employment and service to industry. Advantage
         can also be taken of space available below
         inclined seating to provide additional facilities.

3.3.3     Comfort
         Comfort of the spectator also forms a major
         consideration in the design of stands. Inevitably
         in these days of television, less and less people
         will be a ttra c te d to the sports grounds unless
         the com fort conditions are improved and
         are comparable to those a t home. The level
         of com fort can be raised by providing a warm er
         environment, roomy seats or accommodation,
         protection against elem ents (i.e. against
         rain or chilly wind), refreshm ent facilities
         of reasonable standards as well as toilet facilities.
         The ranking or grading of the existing stands
         can possibly be made on the basis of the above
         considerations.

3.3.4    Viewing and sightlines
         One of the im portant param eters in the design
         of sports grounds is 'good viewing'. It is essential
         th at the spectator should be able to see the
         principal object of the sports (namely the
         football or tennis ball or the ath lete as the
         case may be). This is also a primary consideration
         in appraising an existing sports ground. When
         large crowds are present and densities are
         high the frustration from lack of proper visibility
         of the principal object can cause aggravation,
         irrational behaviour, and build-up of pressure
         within the crowd. Some consideration of
         viewing and sightlines is given in Appendix
         B.

3.3.5    Circulatory space
         It is necessary to provide a g reater area for
         circulation in the case of perambulatory
         viewing such as athletics and horseracing
         than for stationary viewing such as football
         (see Appendix B).

3.4    SAFETY OF SPECTATORS

       3-4-1     Home Office Guide                                   References
                 Since the Ibrox Park disaster, the safety
                 of the spectators in sports grounds has been
                 extensively studied in the UK. The sources
                 of problems have been identified and recommendation
                 given in the Guide to safety a t sports grounds
                 to minimize hazards to the crowd with particular
                 application to football grounds. Recommendations
                include ingress and egress arrangem ents to
                and from the sports ground and means of
                 escape, standards for stairways, ramps and
                handrails, fire precautions as well as the
                standard for viewing slopes and terraces,
                including layout and design criteria of crush
                barriers. Pressures can be set up within a
                departing crowd by im patient people; such
                incipient pressures can and must be contained
                and controlled by careful attention to the
                detailed design of barriers, stairways, gangways
                and exits. Reference should be made to Section
                5 for further information on flow rates etc.

      3.4.2     Deviations
               Although the recommendations of the Guide
               are not mandatory, they are accepted as
               guidelines by the local authorities in enforcing
               the Safety of sports grounds Act 1975. The
               Guide however, was prepared primarily in
               the experience of football stands; therefore
               some of the recommendations may need modification
               before being applied to stands for more relaxed
               activities such as tennis, horseracing, etc.

               Deviations from individual guidelines are
               possible without necessarily detracting from
               the overall safety of the ground. The variety
               of type, function and layout of sports grounds
               and the inter-relationship of the different
               parts of them means th at a flexible approach
               should be maintained to take account of the
               particular circum stances at individual grounds.

                It is necessary to evaluate flow characteristics
                which, are generally based on notional ideas.
                The rate of ingress a t which people moved
                was variable and could easily change, e.g.
                parents looking for children etc. Egress rates
               are hard to calculate as people do not divide
               themselves evenly but go where they want
               in order to get on to 'targ et' to where they
               are going, rather than sorting out into an
               even distribution. At certain events, e.g.
               Olympics e tc , people drift in and out depending
               on the attractio n of the event. To have even       Jake Pauls: American/
               flow it is essential th a t exits are free from     Canadian Olympic Games
               obstruction, smoke logging in a fire or loose
               or ill-repaired surfaces. Crowds progress           Life safety code
               at different rates, which are slower for old        handbook, FK 802, 1988
               than young people and are reduced with increasing
               density.

        There are essentially four types of safety
        problem to be considered within a ground
        and in its immediate surroundings, all of
        which are linked in some way:

        1.   Hazards th at cause individuals to trip,
             slip and fall causing individual injury
             but also serious fu rther injuries due to
             build up of pressures

        2.   Build up of crowd pressures.

        3.   Danger of crushing of people during
             the evacuation under emergency conditions.
              Orderly evacuation of large crowds
             under emergency conditions is a very
             serious problem.

        4.   Risk from fire (see Section 4).

3.4.3   Information transmission
        The importance of communicating clearly
        to people, particularly those waiting, cannot
        be stressed too strongly. Good public address
        systems are required.

                         Structural safety is the primary consideration
                         of structural appraisal and design. For a
                        new structure, the design generally follows
                        the recommendation of the Codes of P ractice
                        appropriate to the m aterial to be used, and
                        lf B^JancÂ® in some respect is not clear cut
                        or sufficient in the Code it is based on the
                       engineering judgment and appreciation backed
                       up by experience and/or tests. When appraising
                       existing structures particular attention has
                       to be paid to the effects of joints or elem ents
                       from corrosion, from cracking and from potential
                       degredation by fatigue.                    ^

                      In the current Codes an accepted level of
                      safety is deemed to be achieved by the use
                      of partial safety factors on loads to allow
                      for the possibility of a given load being exceeded
                      accidentally and by partial safety factors
                     on the strength of m aterials to cater for
                     its probable variation in the actual construction.
                     In the appraisal of the existing stands however,
                     the situation is somewhat different. At the
                     design stage, for example, many factors remain
                     unknown and need to be covered by a safety
                     margin in loads and m aterials.

                      In the appraisal of existing stands, however,
                      the situation is somewhat different since
                      most of the variables are determ inate. In
                     consequence, it is possible and often preferable
                     w ? Pi y . t nginee^ing judgment as to the appropriate
                     level of these safety margins such th at the
                    assessment does not become inordinately
                    conservative. What is most im portant is
                    the application of rigorous methodology to
                    the m atter of appraisal to ensure nothing
                    is missed or misinterpreted.

                In the appraisal of any existing structure
                or design of new works all relevant loads
                should be considered invidually or in the approriate
                combination to give the most critical effects
                on the elem ents and the structure as a whole.

                         perm anent loads, the structure should be
                         designed to withstand loadings, from crowds
                         and their movement, wind, snow and any
                         other forces to which it may be subjected.

                         to appraise a stand in the light of the possible
                         loads it is likely to receive in relation to
                         maximum crowd density achievable.

                         in valleys in relation to the shape of the roof.       BRE Digest 290

                         The person responsible for determining the
                         adequacy of the roof should pay particular
                         attention to its accessibility. This will apply

                             Traditional design approaches incorporate
                             dynamic loading as statically equivalent live
                             loads. This provides adequate strength but
                             only partially accommodates vibrations.
                             Attention should be paid to periodic forces
                             th at may arise due to gusting wind. Concerted
                             spectator activity should be considered where
                             any of the natural frequencies of the structure
                             are below 4 Hz.

                     3.6.7   Handrail loads
                             Handrails and balustrades should be capable
                             of withstanding the loads defined in Table
                             4 of BS 6339: Part I (referenced above).
                             The strength of handrails (including supports)
                             used to divide a stairway into channels should
                             be as given in Table 2 of the Guide to safety
                             a t sports grounds. Cognisance of this is especially
                             im portant where masonry or other discontinuous
                             m aterials are employed.

                     3.6.8   Crush barrier loadings
                             The loadings for which crush barriers, perim eter      Tuan, C. Y. & Saul,
                             or dividing fences need to be designed are             W. E.: Journal of
                             given in Section 9 of the Guide to safety              Structural Engineering,

                             are fixed must withstand such localised load
                             e ffec ts (see also Section 6 of this report).

3.7    STRUCTURAL SAFETY IN FIRE

       3.7.1     Fire resistance (see Section 4)
                 The statutory requirem ent for the minimum
                 period of fire resistance of a structure is
                 normally specified in the Building Regulations
                 or equivalent.

                 The structure should be able to withstand
                 a fire without collapse and prevent its growth
                 and spread for a sufficiently long period to
                 enable safe evacuation of the occupants.
                 The degree of fire resistance required, therefore,
                 varies with the fire risk of the building as
                 well as the facility for rescue operations
                 and is in general governed by three considerations:

                 (i)   type of occupancy (i.e. the purpose
                       for which the building is used)

                 (ii) floor area and cubic capacity of com partm ents
                      and

                 (iii) general height above the average ground
                       level.

                 Considerations (i) and (ii) are indicative of
                 the expected fire load, the area of ventilation
                 and the geom etry of compartments th at influence
                 the fire severity and thus determine the degree
                 of fire risk, while consideration (iii) relates
                 to rescue operations. The higher the building,
                 the more time is likely to be needed to evacuate
                 the occupants to safety.

                Steel roof structures of stands do not therefore
                require a specific period of fire resistance
                but clearly in the case of particular elem ents
                in steel adjacent to high fire loadings whose
                failure could lead to disporportionate areas
                of collapse, additional protection may be
                necessary to achieve a minimum of half an
                hour fire resistance.

      3.7.2      Smoke venting
                 The form, organisation and constructional
                 m aterial of a stand or sports ground must
               â¢ be such th at accumulation of the products
                 of combustion (smoke, toxic gases) does not
                 occur so as to inhibit escape to the outside,
                 either in still wind conditions or under the
                 various directions of prevailing wind. When
                 there are significant fire loadings, wind tunnel
                 studies may be required to assess the likely
                 consequences of particular wind directions,
                 and additional smoke venting provided.

5.   CROWD SAFETY AND COMFORT

     5.1 GENERAL
        The Guide to safety a t sports grounds contains procedures      Guide to safety at
        for evaluating the capacity of different parts of sports,       sports grounds. Home
        i.e. sports grounds. Chapter 16 of th at Guide gives            Office/Scottish
        examples for the estimation of safe ground capacity.            Office, 1986
        Assessment must be made of:

               the holding capacity of a te rrace or viewing
               slope or seated area

               the capacity of a given exit route from a terrace
               or stand

               the location of crush barriers to minimize
               pressures associated with crowd movements.

        The number of people th at can be safely accommodated
        on a terrace or in a stand (or other covered accommodation)
        is either its holding capacity, or the capacity of the
        exit system to be used in normal circum stances at
        the end of an event or the emergency exit system
        whichever is the least.

     5.2 PASSAGEWAY BLOCKAGES
        With a crowd moving along a passageway, physical
        blockage can occur once a critical density is reached.
        In these conditions crowd pressures can escalate
        to a dangerous level, and if a person stumbles or
        falls the crowd cannot adapt to avoid him or to stop
        to help.

       The blockage may be 'spontaneous' and does not require
       an obstruction such as people falling to generate
       it, the mass of people forming a 'comprehensive arch'
       against the onward stream between the 'abutments'
       of the passage boundaries. Any obstruction such
       as people falling will of course aggravate the effect.

       Once a blockage occurs the build-up of pressure and
       resultant injury and asphyxiation may be rapid if
       the following crowd is not halted and is unaware
       of the obstruction ahead.

       Since this type of danger arises from crowd pressures
       its rem edy'lies in their removal or restrain t within
       safe lim its. â

       The essential measures are:

              the means of controlling the crowd density,
              which is by controlling the initial entry into
              an exit route such th at the rate of entry is
              commensurate with the capacity of the route

              the design of the passageway to elim inate
              obstructions to flow and other hazards



                             5/1
                                                                  COPY No.
          provision of sufficient barriers on terraces
          to ensure restraint to surges in 'peak' or 'other'
          viewing areas without incurring pressures
          on the human body th at cannot be 'tolerated'.

5.3 FLOW RATES
   The recommended flow rates given in Chapter 17
   of the Guide to safety a t sports grounds are:

          From stands and stairways a flow rate of 40
          persons per minute per unit of exit width (i.e.
          550 mm) should be used (73 persons per minute
          per m etre). From terrace s (including covered
          terraces) and the ground generally a flow rate
          of 60 persons per minute per unit of exit width
          should be used (109 persons per minute per
          metre).

   The design of each passageway section against these
   flow rates should be for those flows expected in an
   emergency, where other passageways have been closed,
   rather than the normal situation.

   It should be noted th at all rates may be reduced where
   spectators may be less physically able, a fte r consultation
   with both the Licensing and Building Authorities.

   Appendix C shows flow rates assumed in Israel and
   US for a range of recommended uses including sports
   centres. Also included are the flow rates used by
   the Departm ent of Transport for pedestrian facilities.

5.4 SEQUENCE OF CALCULATION
   The capacity of an elem ent is the product of the
   flow rate, the available width and the emergency
   evacuation tim e, as defined in Section 4.

   The sequence of calculations for each elem ent in
   the ground is illustrated in Fig. 5.1. It recognizes
   that should a particular elem ent fail to reach the
   required capacity the options are generally to improve
   the elem ent or to reduce the overall capacity.

5.5 CONTROL OF CROWD FLOW IN EMERGENCY
   The need to control the flow of crowds in emergency
   situations is recognized. In an em ergency, reactions
   may not be logical and clear concise directions must
   be given. It.is im portant th at exit passageways are
   identified, signed and sized, and allowance should
   be made for the emergency situation when other
   exits may be unusable. Care should be taken in the
   planning of exit systems to ensure th at, in the event
   of an em ergency th at blocks any of the usual exit
   routes, alternative routes will be available. Management
   and stewards must be fam iliar both with the layout
   and organization of the ground and the plans for em ergency
   evacuation. Arrangements for en try and exit and
   those for seated or standing accommodation can
   conveniently be considered separately. Disasters
   at Ibrox (1973) and Birmingham (1984) occurred during


                              5/2
                                                                 COPY No.
egress, while those a t Bolton (1946), Oxford and Carlisle
(1973) happened on the terraces due to collapse of
barriers or insufficient barriers.

5.5.1     Entry control
          Entry should normally present no problems
          within the ground as spectators generally arrive
          over an extended period and are 'filtered' by
          the turnstiles. Crowd pressure can however
         occur outside the ground, such as under 'house
          full' conditions a fte r the turnstiles have been
          closed. An im portant provision is means of
         autom atically recording the numbers adm itted
         a t each point. This information should be
         continuously available at a central control
         point. This allows the spectators to an area
         or section but will not necessarily prevent
         surge pressures th at can even occur in partially
         filled pens if the crowd concentrates in a favoured
         area as is common.

5-5.2    Exit control
          Where problems occur as in the event of an
         exit passageway blockage for whatever reason
         it is essential th at the entry to that passageway
         is closed quickly. The public address system
         should be used to reinforce, and even inform,
         the stewards. However, such communication
         cannot be achieved unless the public address
         system is aimed a t the specific passageway
        or the passageway itself is clearly identified
        in some manner for example, alphabetic or
        numeric. The labelling of each of the passageways/exit
        routes a t regular intervals such that, for instance,
        it could be announced that passageway R was
        closed and passageway T should be used as
        an alternative would be of benefit. The ability
        to redirect crowd movements by such clear
        identification of exit routes is of major im portance.

        Protection provided to stairs, landings and
        passageway should be enclosed to a standard
        such as NOT to pass a 100 mm diam eter ball
        through the protection.

        All padlocks on exit doors should be unlocked
        and made ready for removal throughout the
        period th at spectators are within the ground.
        Wherever feasible, for example, a t manned
        pitch perim eter gates, non-locking security
        devices should be used.

        Splitter barriers are those th at are arranged
        parallel with the flow and split it into separate
        lanes. They have a regulatory effect, help
        to reduce surge pressures and provide a desirable
        hand support on one side. Some reduction
        of flow occurs with lanes less than 1.1 m wide.



                        5/3
.6 CRUSH BARRIERS
  While it is of paramount importance that collapse
  of barriers under crowd pressure does not occur,
  it is also im portant th at crowd pressures cannot be
  generated so as to cause injury to those spectators
  pressed against the barrier.

  It should be recognized, however, th at maximum
  pressures occur with all spectators between two barriers
  contributing simultaneously, which although it seldom
  occurs is likely to cause gross discomfort rather than
  actual injury.

  The Guide to safety at sports grounds contains guidance
  on the reduced spacing of barriers in areas where
  spectators may crowd together, for example behind
  football goals.

     6.1 GENERAL APPROACH
        In carrying out an appraisal of an existing ground or
        individual stand it is especially im portant th at the survey
        of conditions of both the overall structure and all its
        individual details is methodically and meticulously carried
        out so th at as complete a 'picture' of its existing condition
        and likely structu ral performance can be identified.

        Any rem edial measures th at may be required to ensure
        structural adequacy can then be more precisely targ e tte d .
        Although the process of appraisal inevitably leaves less
        scope for choice of strengthening necessary than does
        the process of designing a new structure, it is nevertheless
        important th at measures should be as attractiv e as possible.
        The imagery of such basic structures has been shown
        to play a significant part in how the facility is viewed
        by the public.

     6.2 EXISTING SURVEY DRAWINGS
        Original drawings should be sought. If not available,
        a survey should be undertaken to identify the construction
        and provide base drawings for use and annotation during
        appraisal (see subsection F.4).

        For new work (and old if possible), the ground should
        retain original as-built records on the premises, preferably
        in negative form so th a t they can be readily reproduced.

     6.3 SURVEY OF CONDITION & RECORD OF FINDINGS

        Determination of the physical condition of the structure
        is im portant. The task of determ ining the condition
        of a structure should be approached with an open mind
        without prejudging the cause of any apparent defects.
        There is always the danger th at new defects that are
        outside of previous experience will be missed, and much
        effort may go into trying to find a well known type of
        defect th at is not present. It is necessary to describe
        the conditions adequately so th a t the situation can be
        reviewed objectively. However, previous experience                 Appraisal of existing
        of defects should be borne in mind and checks made                 structures, IStructE,
        for them.                                                          London 1980

        (The engineer should tru st only the evidence of his own
        eyes. He must therefore be dressed when undertaking
        this work, so as to be able to inspect all spaces and be
        equipped with a torch, tape, ham m er, ladder, notebook,
        etc. He must be prepared to expose members or connections
        where he judges that defects may occur. Clear notes,               (Fig.A is Appendix A
        together with sketches and photographs should be kept;             of Appraisal of Existing
        a possible form is shown in Fig A.                                 Structures)

        The report Appraisal of existing structures should be
        consulted for guidance on surveying the condition of
        a structure.

           -   Water traps in m etal construction are particularly
               notorious, for example:
               A channel on its side
               Roof hook bolt fixings
               Eaves and gable framing members
               Column head connections, and other sim ilar
               details where rust can develop freely.

           -   'loose' terrace units resting on supports
               which could move sideways and fall off
               under sway loading should be noted. Thick
               packers under units can be potentially hazardous.
               Poor quality in situ concrete terracing can
               create a tripping hazard.

           -   A ttention should be paid to block/brick
               walls enclosing public corridors, perim eter
               walls and those forming entry/egress gatew ays
               especially if not adequately restrained,
               since they may be subject to significant
               la teral loads from crowd pressures.

           -   All parapets, barriers, etc.

           -   In the case of slender structures with long
               cantilevers and long span structures, atten tio n
               should be paid to the effects of fatigue
               resulting from possible fluctuations. Principal
               welds should be inspected on a regular basis
               for evidence of cracks.

           The above would be some of the key areas for
           inspection which are needed in any event to
           determ ine whether the construction has been
           built as intended from the drawings.

   6.4.2   Inspection

           What needs to be inspected must be safely and             Appraisal of existing
           easily accessible.                                        structures, IStructE

         Checks should include identification of deleterious
         or hazardous m aterials. These will include:

            high-alumina cement in structural elem ents

            woodwool slabs as perm anent formwork

            calcium chloride in adm ixtures for use in
            reinforced concrete

            sea-dredged aggregates (inadequately washed,
            so containing residual chloride)

            asbestos products

            concrete subject to alkalisilica reaction

        Toilet areas, or structures below toilets designated
        and otherwise), are particularly at risk from
        acids etc. Dark corners should be checked.

        Pre-World War II concrete may contain clinker
        or otherwise sulphate/nitrate rich aggregates.
        Leaks through these can highly corrode existing
        embedded filler joists or supporting steelwork.
        Embedded details may require sample or widespread
        opening up.

        The services of an expert are recommended
        to inspect tim ber elem ents for rot, insect atta c k ,
        and to identify or warn of conditions th at could
        encourage these. (Damp unventilated areas
        are notorious for dry rot.)

        Details that contain junctions of steel and concrete
        should be checked for corrosion, eg precast
        terrace or seating units on steel fram es. Anything
        fixed by chemical or expanding anchors should
        be regarded as potentially suspect.

        GRC is a m aterial th at will bum and become
        b rittle, and its presence should be identified.

6.4.3   Recording of results of condition
        Specific comments should be meticulously marked
        on a 'pro forma' check list as per Fig. 6.1. Ideally
        the locations of any particular defects should
        also be cross referenced to the survey plans,
        and photographs taken.

    FABRIC

   Guidance on m atters concerned with fire appraisal has
   been given in Section 4.

6.6 TESTING OF MATERIALS & ELEMENTS

   Where the survey provides sufficient information to
   enable the engineer to complete the appraisal and reach
   conclusions and make recommendations with confidence
   there will be no need to te s t. Requirements for testin g
   will arise where, for example,

          there is lack of information on what m aterials
          are present in the structure

          the presence of deteriorated or deleterious m aterial
          or substandard m aterial is suspected

   Such requirem ents, whether they be for m aterials testing
   or for load testing are described in Appraisal of existing
   structures

6.7 TESTING OF CRUSH BARRIERS/HANDRAILS

   Crush barriers should be tested in accordance with the               Fig. 6.2 Testing of
   Guide to safety at sports grounds by an approved testing             barriers a t Bradford
   machine. See Fig. 6.2.

   Where testing is carried out on isolated members, as
   opposed to complete barriers, then the loading on the
   member should take account of any loading transfer
   due to fixity of components.

   The results of each individual te st must be recorded                Ref Guide to safety
   and kept in a log. Copies should be available to both                a t sports grounds
   the Licence Holder and the Local Authority. Tests should             Â§ Annex C
   be carried out eith er on a five year cycle or totally a t
   least every fifth year. This information should be noted
   on a 1:200 plan of the ground, and should be incorporated
   into an annual report for inspection by the Licensing
   Authority.

   Failure of barriers should be to the criteria laid down
   in the Guide.

   All failures should be prepared or renewed prior to the
   next activity taking place, or the areas in question taken
   out of use until made safe.

   Any works of strengthening and refurbishment carried
   out as a result of a failure must be re-tested and logged
   before being opened to the public.

   All new or renewed work should be designed to comply
   with the Guide for loading capabilities and to the relevant
   structural codes of practice and, if supervised, by a C hartered
   Civil/Structural Engineer, need not be tested on completion.

6.8 APPRAISAL OF THE EFFECTS OF WIND

   6.8.1 Wind tunnel tests
           If on appraisal doubts are raised as to the effects
           on the structures or on smoke venting of the wind
           regime, investigations by representative wind
           tunnel te s t may be necessary.

           Sports ground structures tend to dominate their
           environment and can make major changes to the
           original airflow pattern. Sports grounds are seldom
           built on level sites free from obstructions, so
          th at the topography and all structures in close
          proximity will need to be included in any wind
          tunnel te st. Care must be taken to ensure that
          this does not reduce the scale of the model so
          much, in order to fit the wind tunnel, th at model
          is too small to reproduce the dynamic effects
          accurately. Suitable wind tunnels are specially
          built to reproduce the gusty nature of the wind
          to the same scale as the structural model and
          are available in specialist laboratories. Tests
          in the smooth and uniform flow of aeronautical
          wind tunnels give inaccurate and misleading results.
          Guidelines for wind tunnel tests is given in Appendix         CP 3: Chapter V
          K of CP 3: Chapter V, P art 2, and Part 2 of The              Part 2. Appendix K
          designer's guide.

  6.8.2    Analysis of effects on wind loading
          Approach to the assessment of wind loadings is
          covered in subsection 3.5. Most structures which
          are not slender, ill-conditioned or long cantilevers,
          can be analysed for response under quasi-static
          loadings. However gust loadings generally excite
          the structure over a wide range of frequency
          producing a combined sta tic and dynamic response.
          The dynamic part is normally a random buffetting
          which may cause problems of fatigue. Data on
          the loading cycle for fatigue assessments are
          given in Table 1 of IP19/84 and in Fig. 24 in the
          ECCS Report No. 52. Regular periodic oscillations
          caused by vortex shedding only occur with slender
          solid structures, such as lighting masts. L attice
          structures and typical stand enclosures are not
          usually subject to this problem.

          Flexible stadia structures and especially any with
          long cantilevers may display excessive dynamic
          effects. If investigation (for example the classification
          procedure in BS 6399 Part 2, Digest ??? Part
          2 or Chapter 10 of The designer's guide) shows
          th at dynamic effects are likely to be experienced,
          there are three problems to consider. Firstly,
          the interaction between the structure and the
          air flowing over it; secondly, the determ ination
          of the magnitude of the forces which this causes:
          and thirdly, the response of the structure itself
          when random or periodic forces from wind or
          spectators are applied to it.

         by altering the shape of the structure to reduce
         the aerodynamic forces and elim inate instabilities;
         by changing the member stiffnesses to move the
         natural frequencies away from those generated
         by the wind or the crowd; or by increasing the
         damping to reduce vibrations to negligable amplitudes.
         Even relatively simple arithm etic calculations
         will be sufficient as long as they can dem onstrate
         th at there is no danger to the structure from
         wind loading or any feasible behaviour of the
         spectators.

         The simple calculations of BS 6399 P art 2, Digest
         ??? and ECCS Report No. 52 are sufficient to
         determ ine the peak dynamic forces with sufficient
         accuracy for most stadia stru ctures of regular
         shape in relatively open environments for preliminary
         assessments.

6.9 APPRAISAL OF STRUCTURES AGAINST DISPORPORTIONATE
    COLLAPSE

   With so many people collected in one area, it is necessary
   to ensure th at sports ground structures do not collapse
   disproportionately to the cause.

6.10 REPLACEMENT OR STRENGTHENING OF DOUBTFUL
     ELEMENTS

   Where either the survey or subsequent testing, or appraisal
   shows an elem ent to be unsatisfactory it should either
   be replaced or suitably strengthened.

   Such considerations may well require the installation
   of tem porary support until such tim e as the permanent
   remedial work can be undertaken. All such tem porary
   works should be designed and constructed with the location
   and nature of usage in mind.

As the diam eter of a football is 220 mm, it follows th at the
maximum distance between a sp ectator and the furthest point
on the football playing area should not exceed 190 m. It should
be borne in mind th at a t this distance the object is barely
recognizable and does not in fa c t provide a good and unstrained
visibility. The maximum distance therefore should, where
possible, be reduced by 20-40% of th at calculated by the above,
i.e. for a football ground the fu rth est point of the field to
a spectator should be lim ited to, say, 150m. In a football (and
also in a rugby) ground this will correspond roughly to a circle
of 90m radius from the centre spot as shown in Fig. A l.

Figs. A2 and A3 show the optimum viewing circle and the
maximum distance in two existing grounds - in St Jam es' Park,
Newcastle, and Wembley Stadium. It is clear in the case of
Wembley Stadium th a t a section of the spectators will remain
outside the optimum sight distance or even the maximum sight
distance of the full arena.

This consideration som etim es is most crucial in deciding w hether
the stand should have a single rake or m ulti-tiered ones.




                                 APP 1
                                                                           COPY No.
Another aspect in ter-related to good viewing is the sightline.
The slope of the rakers should be such th at the lines of sight
from the eyes of sp ectato rs in each row to the focal point
should be clear of or a t least tangential to, the top of the
head (together with the head cover) of the sp ectator in the
row in front. The focal point is taken as the near edge of                Handbook of sports and
the playing field or the centre-line of the nearest line of the         recreation buildings design
nearest lane of the ath letic track. The profile of the raker
can be determ ined graphically and by calculation. Simplified
formulae can be obtained from references listed in the Handbook.

There are three main categories of raker:

1.   straight rakers of constant slope

2.   series of straight rakers of different slopes, and

3.   curved rakers.

The curved arrangem ent is theoretically ideal but cumbersome
in practice, and ap art from the high cost, th ere can be a safety
hazard where crowd movement is involved. Orientation of
the stand as well as positioning of the first row with respect
to the arena (touchline, for example) is im portant to allow
a good view of the whole of the touchline by all viewers.

Depending on the nature of the perform ance th ere appear
to be three borad p attern s of crowd circulation in stands:

(a) Static crowd: which exists where the show is continuous
    or even in term itten t such as football, rugby and some
    athletics, but without any interrelated diverse activities
    during the interval.

(b) Circulating crowd: which exists where the show consists
    of several consecutive events with in terrelated ex tra
    activities during the interval between them , and generally
    associated with betting, such as horse racing, dog racing
    etc.

(c) A combination of (a) and (b), where one p art of the stand
    could have a sta tic crowd while the other parts have circulating
    spectators.

Compared with (a) crowds are sm aller and more leisurely in
the other two categories, especially in (b). The design criteria,
of necessity, will be differen t and the facilities provided by
the designer will, of course, have to be com patible with the
requirements of the patrons in each relevant category. A
relevant num erical comparison of the three categories is given
in Table A l.

** The area of 2.60 m 2 per spectator was calculated with
regard only to the seating and standing capacity of the rakes.
Durking major races a crowd of 30 000 could actually use all
the facilities and then space per spectator would come down
to 0.69 m 2 only, thus comparable to category (a).

4.0    FIRE AND FIRE SAFETY                                                     REFERENCE

      Safety from fire is achieved by measures that restrict initiation,
      rate of early growth and later spread of fire; provide and protect
      escape routes; segregate higher fire risk areas; provide warning
      (and where necessary detection) of fire; and assist with fireÂ­
      fighting operations.  The fire officer should always be consulted
      on matters of fire safety.

      The type of accommodation that can present the greatest hazard
      in the event of fire is the existing covered stand where spectaÂ­
      tors sit or stand, where the level of combustibility may be high
      and the resistance to propagation and spread of fire is low. Such
      a combination of properties can endanger life.

      When there are poor housekeeping, combustible structures, poor
      stewarding, no evacuation procedures, a lack of fire-fighting apÂ­
      pliances or these are not in the appropriate places, there is great
      potential danger from fire when large numbers of people are
      gathered together in a relatively confined space.

      It is an undeniably fundamental principle that in the event of
      fire people in a stand must have ample time to be able to make
      their way to safety without having to endure smoke and toxic
      gases, heat radiation, etc by use of protected exit routes.

      The means provided for escape depend on the rate at which the
      fire may develop, the number of people involved, as well as the
      size and geometry of the structure.



      FIRE SAFETY APPRAISAL STRATEGY

      The age of existing structures, their construction and the resisÂ­
      tance to spread of fire will vary considerably along with the
      chances of safe escape. It is therefore not considered practical or
      viable to produce a definitive set of rules from which a judgeÂ­
      ment can be made. Therefore an approach based on the experiÂ­
      ence of appropriately qualified professional persons, licencing
      authorities and club management working within a set of deÂ­
      fined parameter is adopted.

      The assessment of the Are performance of an existing stand is
      dependent primarily on (1) the layout, (2) the materials of conÂ­
      struction and (3) the management of the facility which must inÂ­
      dependently comply with a minimum standard.

      However it is important that the assessors, the club management
      and the local authority recognise . that a performance of one asÂ­
      pect that is below minimum acceptable levels must result in cloÂ­
      sure of that element or improvement to the minimum level.

      In concept the appraisal strategy is very simple and is defined in
      the following flow chart (Fig 4.1).

In order to enable a relatively reliable means of assessing the
large number of parameters which influence Are safety, the
sports facilities are grouped into various risk categories. SubseÂ­
quently in each category the fire safety provisions are reviewed
interactively and equated to a-graduated scale for assessing the
escape capacity in accordance with limitations of Fig 4.2 followÂ­
ing the techniques described in Section 5.0.

.1   Allocation   o f S tan ds   to T hree    Risk    Categories:

     Accepting compliance with the minimum standard, the most sigÂ­
     nificant feature o f any enclosure is the com bustibility and
     spread o f fire and smoke characteristics of the cladding and linÂ­
     ing systems. This is therefore used as the criteria for allocation
     of a sports facility to one o f the three risk categories. The assessÂ­
     ment is a function o f the spread o f flame performance (ie Class 0
     or Class 1 - Building Regulations Section B) and the risk of lateral
     spread of fire. For 'non-traditional' materials such as coated texÂ­
     tiles the assessment is more appropriately based on large scale ad
     hoc testing.

        EITHER

         A stand consisting of combustible material with a Class 1 spread
          of flame rating (BS 476 Part 7) eg timber with an intumescent
         coating, or Class 1 cladding supported by test certificates for the
        composite construction.

        OR

         A stand consisting of combustible materials where it is possible
        to justify that the lateral spread of fire will not inhibit escape or
        fire fighting operations.

        The desirability of preventing undue flame travel under roofs,
        even those made of inert material, is important. Where this canÂ­
        not be prevented by the intrinsic form of the roof, then it may
        be possible to restrict the travel of flame along the underside of
        a roof by installing deep roof screens combined with substantial
        areas of venting in the roof to allow the flame to pass to the outÂ­
        side. The reservoirs so formed should generally be much smaller
        than are needed for smoke ventilation in order to reduce the
        area of stand exposed to unacceptably high levels of heat radiaÂ­
        tion.   Much larger areas of venting would be required than are
        needed for smoke venting.        However, with the greater buoyancy
        o f the flames, the effect of wind is likely to be less important.
        The ro o f. screens; together with their fixings must be able to reÂ­
        sist attack by": flame and very hot gases for a period commensuÂ­
        rate with escape and fire fighting operations.

        Where the roofs o f stands are so connected that smoke and
        flames could travel along essentially two or more sides of a pitch,
        a ..wide break in the roof should be made to separate each side unÂ­
        less flame travel could be eliminated by the measures above.

        In very difficult cases, removal of the roof altogether could be
        considered.


4.1.3   Low Risk Stand ^ C a te g o ry 2

        A stand consisting o f a non-combustible material (BS 476 Part 4)
        with a Class I spread o f flame rating (BS 476 Part 7) defined as
        Class 0 in the Building Regulations.

        A construction comprising a low density primary timber frame
        which meets the fire resistance requirements with a Class 0 cladÂ­

4.2     GUIDANCE FOR ASSESSING MINIMUM STANDARD                               REFERENCE
        OF CONSTRUCTION AND PLANNING

        Generally the appraisal should be guided by the Building RegulaÂ­
        tions and appropriate legislation (see Section 2.1).  However the
        specific items which relate particularly to sports grounds    must
        be considered in addition to the basic planning and structural asÂ­
        pects defined in this document and in the "Guide to Safety at
        Sports Grounds HMSO 1986". The charts in Figs 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5
        should be referenced to guide the appraisal.



4.2.2   C o m p a rtm e n ta tio n /P ro te c tio n   of   T iers

        Fire-resistant construction is required to separate high fire risk
        areas and voids from the spectator tiers. Floors separating stand
        tiers should also have appropriate fire-resistant construction.
        (See minimum requirements defined in Figs 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 for
        various categories of stand.)

        Automatic sprinklers could be considered as an alternative to
        compartmentation although in the majority of cases compart-           BS 5300 Part 2
        mentation is the better option. Sprinklers are not acceptable in
        outside stands.



4.2.3   P lanning     of    E scape      Routes

        Escape routes should be planned to keep people well clear of the
        smoke from a fire. The hot buoyant smoky gases produced by a
        fire will flow: upwards and will collect under and flow along roof
        spaces, balconies, etc. As the gases rise, they entrain air strongÂ­
        ly, which increases their volume and lowers their temperature.
        Further cooling takes place by radiation and convection heat
        transfer as the gases flow under roofs, etc and eventually they
        may have lost enough buoyancy for them to follow air moveÂ­
        ments created by any wind. This could mean that within a stand
        smoke is brought down to ground level. The escape routes should
        be planned with these factors in mind so that people can generÂ­
        ally move downwards and away from the smoke and protected
        from radiation.

        Escape routes should not be significantly threatened by continuÂ­
        ing fire and its products of combustion or by a developing fire.

        Alternative widely separated escape routes are preferred, proÂ­
        viding similar protection.



4.2.4   Smoke      C ontrol      M easures

        It may be possible in some cases to keep smoke away from escape
        routes by restricting its travel and even making it flow out of the
        building altogether.

        Some geometries of roof, eg transverse open-ended barrel vaults,
        can promote the rapid ejection of smoky gases from a stand and
        inhibit their spread along it.   Conversely, longitudinally vaulted
        roofs would favour the rapid spread of smoky gases along a stand.
                                                                                   CO PY No.

        Where the roof geometry is not of itself capable of ejecting                      REFERENCE
        smoky gases, then reservoirs to contain them together with roof
        venting to cause them to flow to the outside may be advisable.
        The design of such systems is normally made for still-air condiÂ­                  Thomas, P.H. &
        tions.  With an open building of this kind, the effectiveness of                  Hinkley, P.L. :
        the venting can be strongly influenced by the wind because                        Design of Roof-

        neath it can oppose the flow of smoky gases out of a vent, and                    for Single-
        even cause a complete reversal of flow so that air from above the                 Storey BuildÂ­
        roof flows down through the vent. Thus roof venting cannot be                     ings, London,
        a universal solution. Expert assessment and possibly wind tunnel                  HMSO, 1964
        tests may be required.



4.2.5   R estriction    of    Flam e     Travel        U nder   Roofs

        Flames from a large fire that impinge on the underside of a roof
        or balcony, even one made of inert material, will elongate very
        considerably as they flow along under the roof and, radiating
        downwards, can put people below in great danger and greatly
        enhance the spread of fire horizontally at floor level.   As with
        smoke spread (see Section 4.1.2) the geometry of the roof can inÂ­
        hibit or favour spread of flame along a stand and should be careÂ­
        fully considered.    Similar design approaches to those of Section
        4.1.2 are possible, and expert assessment may be required.



4.2.6   Em ergency      V ehicle       Access     to     G round

        In addition, consideration will need to be given during the early
        planning for adequate and maintained access for emergency veÂ­
        hicles to all parts of the ground from outside the facility.



4.2.7   M easures to         Prevent or     R etard       E arly   Fire   Growth

        It is absolutely crucial to restrict fire growth rate to manageable
        proportions because of the impact of fire growth rate on escape.

        There is a need to break interaction between fire spreading in a
        litter-filled cavity and wooden seating or flooring. This can be
        done by:

        (a)     cleaning cavity and       compartmenting from tiers;

        (b)     cleaning cavity and filling with concrete;

        (c)     replace flooring and       seating with concrete;

        (d)     clean and seal cavity, provide cavity barrier and detection
              supporting evidence to show that lateral spread of fire
               along floor or seating is not a significant hazard.

4.2.8   C o m p artm en tatio n    of     Spaces        Under   and   Between   Stands  REFERENCE

        For stands with space underneath the seating where a fire might
        develop in stored materials, it may be necessary to provide autoÂ­
        matic sprinkler protection under the stand and a fire-resisting
        barrier between the stand and the space beneath.       Significant
        storage areas should be isolated from stands.



4.2.9   P revention    of   Growth         of    Fire

        Where there is extensive wooden seating on a concrete or simiÂ­
        lar floor, giving a high fire load, protection may be gained by
        providing manually operated sprinkler system in order to preÂ­
        vent build-up of smoke, etc. (Such a system is not sufficient to

        The    Are resistance period of the structure should be compatible
        with    the compartmentation (Section 4.2.2) that it supports and
        also   sufficient to prevent premature collapse or progressive failÂ­
        ure    of a facility (indeterminate structures are an advantage in
        this    respect).

        General requirements for Are resistance period are defined in
        the charts (Figs 4.3, 4.4 and 4.S). However these values are not
        definite and careful consideration is required in appraising the
        consequences of failure of a particular element and its implicaÂ­
        tions on means of escape and subsequent fire fighting.

        Where specific test data is not available or tests to BS 476              indiÂ­
        cates a lower standard than required, an alternative fire                engiÂ­
        neering approach could be adopted to make an assessment.                  This
        approach recognises the influence of fire load, ventilaton,              locaÂ­
        tion o f structural members and their working stresses.

        The stability of structural members during a fire is controlled by
        the temperatures that they experience and the nature and magÂ­
        nitude o f the stresses in the members.      The fire engieering
        method of design can quantify the conditions to which structuÂ­
        ral members will be subjected in the event of a fire.

        Different approaches can be made when implementing fire enÂ­
        gineering, many being simple, while others are complicated,
        costly and time-consuming. In view of the cost implications inÂ­
        volved in the length of a study, the level of potential cost savings
        should be evaluated to establish whether the application of fire
        engineering is worthwhile.

        FIRE PRECAUTIONS

        In both existing sports grounds and in those of new design, the
        way the Management organise the ground, their stewards and
        supporting equipment is fundamental to the safety of the spectaÂ­
        tors in the event of a fire. Staff training, particularly for steÂ­
        wards, in carrying out their normal duties and ensuring that
        they are aware of their role in an emergency situation should be
        given the highest priority. It is the responsibility of the ManÂ­
        agement who have the best knowledge of their particular situaÂ­
        tion to produce the documented evidence (operating plan) that
        they have considered the total problem and that the stand/
        ground is safe for the certified occupancy.



4.3.1   Q uality   A ssurance     for   L arg er   Facilities

        For larger facilities, quality assurance techniques can       be used
        beneficially to provide the documentary evidence and           give an
        affective means of monitoring the application of the          manageÂ­
        ment intent. The following steps are a simple resume          of the proÂ­
        cess:

        1.    Produce an operating manual to cover all aspects relating to
                 crowd management, emergency situations and equipment.

        2.     Verify and monitor the manual for, say, 1 year to ensure its
              adequacy and consistency and that it forms a basis for certi
             fication.

        3.    Adjust manual if necessary.

        4.     Monitoring process continues, based on operating manual.



4.3.2   Em ergency     P ro ced u res   and   S ta ff   T rain in g

        It is essential that plans should be made for dealing with emerÂ­
        gencies including fire. The onus to do this lies with the manageÂ­
        ment of the facility. Joint consultation between Management,
        police, fire, ambulance and other emergency services should
        take place in order to produce agreed plans of action for all foreÂ­
        seeable types of emergency.      While the public are in the
        ground, the number of staff on duty should be sufficient to covÂ­
        er entrances, exits and other strategic points and to fulfill other
        essential duties.

        All such staff should be trained in the use of the fire fighting
        equipment provided, and in the action they should take in the
        event of fire.

        Organisation of stewards and their training to respond appropriÂ­
        ately in an emergency is the Management's responsibility but
        the advice of the local fire and police authorities should be
        sought on the content of their training programme.

         In dealing with any emergency situation, it is important to                   Fire and Human
         recognise the way people behave. The seriousness and extent                   Behaviour, D.
         of effect has been found to depend considerably on the reacÂ­                  Canter, UniverÂ­
         tions and patterns of activity of people associated with the                  sity of Surrey
         emergency or fire situation.

         It is especially important that appraisers and designers recogÂ­
         nise the need to minimise any delay to the start of evacuation.

         In this context clear authoritative and planned instructions
         given on a reliable and audible address system are extremely
         im p o rta n t.

         Advice will need to be sought from the local Fire Authority.           At
         least the following should be considered:

         (a)      provision of adequate water supply and hydrants;

         (b)      hose reels to BS 5306:Part 1, of sufficient length to reach
                   whole area;
         (c)      provision of portable fire extinguishers, properly main
                  tained and protected from vandalism to BS 5423 and sited
                   and m a in tain e d according to BS 5303:Part 3.

 4.3.9   M easures to R estrict the Extent of Fire Spread              in
         L a te r Stages
         Restricting the extent and speed of fire spread in the later
         stages of fire will reduce the possibility of people's escape beÂ­
         ing further threatened, assist the operations of the fire briÂ­
         gade, and reduce the ultimate size of fire and extent of damage.

                      Most measures which reduce the rate of fire growth in the early                REFERENCE
                      stages will help to restrict fire spread in later stages.

                      MEANS OF ESCAPE TIME

                      If the exit     capacity   of the stand is .less than actual capacity of the
                      stand, it is    feasible   (subject to the limitations of Fig 4.2 and guidÂ­
                      ed by Figs      4.3, 4.4   and 4.5) to increase the escape capacity by the
                      addition of      further   safety provisions. The methodology of the
                      approach is      defined   in the flow chart of Fig 4.6.

                     Additional management activities or active fire protection measÂ­
                     ures must be justified by the management and supported by a
                     sound technical submission and agreed by the licencing authoriÂ­
                     ty. It should be clear that the additional provisions will, in realiÂ­
                     ty, improve the safety of the facility.

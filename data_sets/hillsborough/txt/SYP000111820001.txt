situated at the              rear of each turnstile,                       in, order to attr a c t our

attention.

At ar o u n d     IE noon the            first Liverpool                 fans    began arriving         at the

ground.         They were          few       in number and were                 in good homour.           I could

see    that     they wer e         being          searched          outside     the ground and        let    them

s tr aight      through,,          We were          then told by            inspector White          to search

everyone        even     if we      could see           that         they had be'en s e a rched         before.

By, about       1.30 p.m.          the flow of fans was                     increasing,       however,       it was

still    only a st e a d y flow and most were                             searched.       A few did object                to

being    searched         but ag r e e d after              the       si t u a t i o n had been exp l a i n e d     to

them.     The      view      through          the turns t i l e s was            still   clear and it was            not

crowded outside              the     ground..

At about .2 p.m.             the    turnstile           operator          knocked on the w i n d o w s t a t i n g

that a fan was            trying         to get        in with o u t a ticket.             He    came through

the    turnstile        and was          then ejected               thro u g h gate •*C"- whilst         doing      this

we were       s u r r o un de d    fay his        friends who ab u s e d us,             claiming       he had

got a ticket.             This      H a p pened about a dozen times                      in the     next 20

minutes.        I also       s a w twa or three                 people     offer money to the            operators

w hi ch was      refused and the fans who did this                                then went away.

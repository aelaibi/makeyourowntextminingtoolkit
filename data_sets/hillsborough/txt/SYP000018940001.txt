Dear Graham,
                                V.A.Cu p S.Fi-'al Liverpool v Nottm.F.
                                          15.4.89
                     I acknowledge your letter Bef PFS/jW/14 of                                21   April about
which I apologised for the delay in replying thereto after the Staff S.C.
Meeting on 27 April 1989•
               Ey journey to Sheffield took some 1-j hrs leaving the K1 at
Junction 34 as advised by The Nottm.Evening Post some tro or three days
previously. ’Whilst the journey from the Motorway took some 25 minutes it
was extremely well signposted and either a Traffic Warden o r Policeman or
¥ P.O. was stationed at each junction when it was necessary to make a left
or ripht turn. That I felt vas well organised by The Police Authorities,and
indeef was almost identical to the last Semi-Final some 12 months previously.

               After leaving the reception area some 12 minutes prior to kick-o.
 I expressed surprise at the great numbers of supporters at the rear of the sta.
 makin- there way to The Leppings Lane area,and felt at tnat time tnat the tu--
 stiles would   beunder pressure to house them all within the area/s o   e gr
 prior "to the advertised kicM—off*

                    I understand that The Nottm.Forest Supporters were mainly in
    their positions within the ground up to 30 minutes prior to the kic -cu . nc
    again advice was given in the Press to comence their journeys in good time to
    iillevie.te problems later on.
                  One Member of my Council irho had tickets supplied by us did noti
    that mon^y ’ms being exchanged at a turnstile when carnally glancing to his ri
         proceeding towards his seat in The Kain S t a n d . Unfortunately he cannot ex,
    rate on details since whilst he felt that it should not occur he appeared to
    somewhat puzzled that it was apparently happening.

                     You may remember that together with The V-Chairman and      —
 ------ 1    was close to you on the day,and having agreed ^ith your verbal and
  written    report presented to the Exec tive Committee on 18 Apr 1989 i h -v®
  nothin;;   to add except to state how very pleased i was with your performanc
  the day    u n i thereafter which were conducted in an expert fashion.
                                                                               i
                     Ki-d regards,                                            p.
                               _____ Yours sincerely_______

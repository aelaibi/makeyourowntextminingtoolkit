           of    the     ambulance                service                and    a     friend.                I    returned             to    the, st«ii I I C’i     3 . Cl LA



           concourse             where           I saw          for       the       first       time         the       injuries             that       had

    CJJ^   occurred            on       t he     pitch.              I    returned             to     the        concourse             where          the     fans

           were      very        hostile              towards             the       Police          and      at       this       time       I feared           for

           the     safety           of     officers              working             in    that        area.

           1 stayed            in       this      area          with       supporters                 trying           to    talk/advise/assist

           As    the     disaster                became          more          clear,          and      it       was       obvious          that       the     game

           was     not        going        to     continue,                I,       together           with           other       officers,                tried        as

           I a c t f u 11y       as      possible               to       advise       the       supporters                  to    leave        s 1 o w 1y »         A

           small        number           of      families                did    so.        Large           numbers           of    supporters

           appeared            very        angry           and       upset          and    di r e c t e d k ^ t h e i r a n g e r            at       the

           officers            present.

           In    the     course            of     time,          a       large       number           of     supporters                left       the       ground

           quietly            and       s 1 owfy^ as            requested             and       were         consoled             and       advised           as    t he

           left.

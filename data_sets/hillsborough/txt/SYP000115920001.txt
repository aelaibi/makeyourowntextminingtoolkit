             Mr K i n g , Counsel   for• 43 of the deceased relatives,              began his ope:

             address.        He commented on the fact that only the events up to 3 =15pm

             (1515) had been covered during the previous Inquest.                      The point he was
                                                                         PAGE

making was that between the times fans were first-    seen (somewhere
around 3.15pm - 1515)    on the terraces and the time they were

certified dead in the gymnasium (somewhere around 4.00pm -1600), what

was the emergency services doing?    Were their relatives still alive

immediately prior to being certified dead?     Could the emergency

services have provided more assistance,    i.e. providing specialist

vehicles?   Dr Popper   likened the tragedy to a serious road traffic

accident, where we produce only evidence up to the victim being

transported to hospital.    Evidence is only supplied to that      point
Just, because a victim is certified dead at a later time does not mean

that they are actually alive up to that time.

The Coroner stated that it would still stand at 3.15pm (1515) and

that- it- was not his intention to stray down the way Mr King was

trying to direct him.

Mr Issacs then addressed the court and indicated his wish that Chief

superintendent Duckenfield should not have to give evidence at this

inquest.    At. this point there was an outbreak of   'booing'   and

'hissing' by members of the relatives sat at. the rear of the court:

The coroner advised the public of his powers and stated that he

would not put up with this sort of behaviour.      He statd that       any
decision he made would not be influenced by comments etc made by the

relatives   in the court.

Mr issaes then put forward his case as to why chief superintendent

Duckenf ield should not. have to take the stand,   quoting Rule 22 of the

Coroners Rules re self incrimination.     After much discussion,        it- was

suggested that transcripts of chief superintendent-    Duckenfield?e
evidence at the Taylor Enquiry be read out to the Jury.

Mr King indicated that his families would prefer the real thing, but

would accept the transcript, being read out to the Jury,

counsel for the other officers,   except Mr Hale who had left      the
                                                                              PAGE     3

         court,   Indicated that they would also like evidence in respect of

         their clients to be presented in the same vein.

         Mr Catchpole stated that he would have to speak to his clients before

         making any further comment.

         Dr Popper stated that he would advise him at a later date of any

         decision he would make in relation to the matter.

         In the afternoon,       Inspector Leighton and Police Constable Brown, West

                   Owl, where the fans were leaving as late as 2.30pm - 2.45pm.        (4) All
                   public houses showed a substantial increase in sales and takings.

                   witnesses in relation to submission of transcripts as an alternative to

        SUBJECT:     SUMMARY OF INQUEST 21.11.90


        Mr King mentioned an article in the Yorkshire Post re: the Coroner being
        paid by Sheffield Council and there might be a conflict of interest,
        however he was satisfied with the current position.

        The Inquest continued with Mr Knight, licensee of Commercial public house,
        giving evidence.  He stated consumption was 3 - 4 pints per person and the
        fans left between 2 .30 pm - 2 .50pm.

        The remaining witnesses, who consisted of local residents, people employed
        in the area and people travelling through the area, gave their evidence
        relating to unsociable behaviour, i.e. urinating, lateness of fans
        approaching the ground, fans consuming and carrying 4 packs of alcohol in
        the street, drunken behaviour and crowd comparison with the 1988 semi­
        final.   Mention was made by a couple of the witnesses to an air of
        impending trouble, nothing untoward happened but there was an atmosphere.

        During the afternoon, Police Sergeants Wilson and Lomas entered the court,
        to gain a feeling of the court in preparation to their giving evidence. A
        short time later Mr King addressed the Coroner, stating that it may be
        wise that certain witnesses be excluded from, the court prior to their
        giving evidence.    (I took this to mean Police Officers).     The Coroner
        replied that it was his decision that witnesses be allowed in the court
        during the hearing and should this decision be reversed, some of his
        clients, including Mr Hicks, who is also to give evidence, would be
        excluded.

        On Friday 23 November 1990, the court will commence at 9 .30am for the
        Coroner to give his decision in relation to transcripts being accepted as
        an alternative to certain witnesses being called.

        On Wednesday 28 November 1990, the room being used for the Coroner's court
        is required for a Council meeting.    The Coroner stated his intention to
        use that time for the Jury to do a site visit at Sheffield Wednesday
        Football Club and there is a likelihood that only a few witnesses will be
        heard that day, if any.

        I have been informed to the effect that Mr Hicks and company have
        approached Mrs McBrien, who is present in the court representing her
        family's interests (her son died in the tragedy).      They consider that
        questions she is putting to the witnesses are apparently detrimental to
        the case which Mr King is presenting and they are putting pressure on her
        (in her words 'bullying' her) in order to prevent her from asking such
        questions.    She has spoken to Mr Russell, who is the Counsel for
        Superintendent Greenwood, who in turn has approached Douglas Frazer and Mr
        King with a view to his advising his clients.  Mr King is also quite keen
        to change his or Mrs McBrien's position so that he is in a position to
        question witnesses after her, obviously to repair any damage she may have
        caused.

            The following witnesses were called to give evidence:

            Angela Hockenhall                Resident
            John Taylor                      Nottingham Forrest Supporter

            Michael Tissington               Ex Police Officer

            The evidence given by the above people related to fans making their way
            towards the ground in groups, a lot carrying 4 packs of beer/lager, a
            large percentage showing signs of having consumed alcohol, fans openly
            urinating in street (J. Taylor), urinating in gardens and waving their
            genitals towards female occupant (A. Hockenhall).   Mention was made of
            the conspiracy factor (D. Watts, J. Shelley and G. Taylor) who either
            overheard or held conversations with fans who apparently had no tickets
            and whose intention was to enter the ground by causing a disturbance
            outside the turnstiles, forcing the Police to allow them in the ground.
            A practice some of them had carried out with success on previous
            occasions.

             The majority of witnesses made reference to late arrivals, crowd density
             and a noticable difference between the 1988 and 1989 semi-final,
             describing it as, "An unusual atmosphere, worst I've seen".

          The following wintesses gave evidence at the Inquest.

          Michael Tissington                                          Ex Police Sergeant

          John Bartholomew                                            Resident
          Paul Wilson                                                 Police Sergeant
          Philip Lomas                                                Police Sergeant

           Ex Police Sergeant Tissington concluded his evidence                                   under cross
           examination.  He was questioned regarding his assessment of                            drunkenness,
           his knowledge of match operation order, the action he took                              when inside
           Pen 3 and Police Officers he could identify in command inside                           the ground.

           The two civilian witnesses who live locally mentioned crowds arriving
           late, urinating, ticketless fans, consumption of alcohol and unsociable
           behaviour.   Mention was made of the Police Landrover and messages being
           transmitted from the loud-hailer requesting fans to move back on numerous
           occasions, all of which were ignored.

           Police Sergeant Wilson, who was on duty in Leppings Lane manning barriers
           to side roads, stated that initially fans were friendly and good
           humoured.   Later, at 2.40pm, a large number of supporters in their
           hundreds came running along Leppings Lane past him, towards the ground,
           carrying cans and bottles, intent on getting to the ground.    An attempt
           was made to slow them down, without any effect.

           Police Sergeant Lomas, who was on duty in Middlewood Road, mentioned vast
           amount of alcohol consumed (everything except spirits).   He noticed many
           fans without tickets asking for spares, and other fans' unsociable
           behaviour.   When asked why he did not arrest them, he replied that it
           would have depleted his serial and left his patch devoid of Officers.

                     SUBJECT:         SUMMARY OF INQUEST 26.11.90

                     The following witnesses were called to give evidence.

                     Philip Lomas                   Police Sergeant
                     Ross Wright                    Football Supporter - Liverpool
                     Anthony John Murray            Relative (son 14 years died in tragedy)
       (             Louise Jan Hinton              Supporter

                     Police Sergeant Lomas concluded his evidence under cross examination. He
                     was questioned on his experiences of policing football matches, his
                     expectation of crowd arrivals and numbers (a 1989 semi-final ticket was
                     produced to highlight recommended times that fans should be in their
                     seats), and his impression ofwhat was taking place at Leppings Lane.

                     Mr Ross Wright travelled to the match by coach.     Due to the organiser
                     leaving their tickets in the coach, this caused them to arrive late at
                     Leppings Lane turnstiles.  He mentioned a minority of fans carrying cans
                     (none drunk).    Outside the turnstiles he joined the crowd and saw a
                     Landrover and heard messages over the loud-hailer. When in the crowd he
                     was pushed from behind by other people who arrived later and who took no
                     notice of the instructions from the Police in the Landrover.     Emphasis
                     was put on the poor signs displayed to assist fans in getting into the
                     ground and the lack of assistance given by Police and Stewards within the
                     concourse behind the West Stand.   Mention was made of fans attempting to
                     climb over perimeter fences from the pens and Police forcing these back
                     by hitting their hands.     This incident was timed around 3.15pm.     He
                     thought the fans climbing over the fence were protesting against being
                     allocated Leppings Lane end again. Wright entered the ground through the
                     turnstile.

                     Anthony John Murray, father of Paul Brian Murray, 14 years, who died in
                     the tragedy, described the scene in Leppings Lane outside the turnstiles.
                     He saw mounted Officers trying to control the crowd. He was concerned by
                     jostling and crowd movement all around him.     He entered the ground by
                     Gate C.    The pressure eased on the concourse and he then entered the
                     tunnel and Pen 3 without problem.   Once in Pen 3 he began to move to the
                     right hand side of the pen, when his son was knocked over and he never
                     saw him alive again.   In hindsight he would not have joined the crowd in
                     Leppings Lane outside the turnstile.

                     Louise Hinton and her boyfriend attended the match travelling by train.
                     They did not have tickets and purchased two from touts at £20 each.   She
                     saw other fans without tickets also trying to obtain them. She mentioned
                     lots of fans, some with cans of beer in their hands, and described crush
                     in Leppings Lane outside turnstiles.   On the concourse, she was directed
                     by a Steward towards the tunnel and entered Pen 4.       In the crush she
                     became separated from her boyfriend and ended up at the front of the pen.
                     She could not move and was standing on a. body in the pen. She saw Police
                     Officers atempting to remove grille from perimeter fence. Hinton and her
                     boyfriend entered the ground through Gate C .

                 cause for concern.     He arrived outside the Leppings Lane entrance at
                 approximately 2.45pm.    He became concerned when he joined the crowd at
                 that location due to the pressure build-up from behind him. He mentioned
                 a horse nearly falling over because of the crush.     Gate C opened and in
                 his words, "If gate not opened more death on hands" - as the gates were
                 swaying under pressure.     He was in the first 100 to enter the ground
                 through Gate C.    He crossed the concourse and went through the tunnel
                 into Pen 4 without difficulty.     Initially he was not concerned but then
                 the pressure increased and a surge from behind carried him forward,
                 hitting a barrier.   This resulted in him receiving fractures to his ribs.
                 He was unable to remember anything about the 1988 semi-final.

                 David Lowe travelled with four others to the ground, leaving Mansfield at
                 about 11.00am.   None of the party were in possession of match tickets.
                 They purchased tickets for the Kop at £20.00 each, then went to the White
                 Horse public house.  He consumed 3i pints of lager. They left the public
                 house at 1.00pm and made their way to Leppings Lane and after a
                 conversation with a Steward, entered the ground and went to Pen 4. At
                 2.00pm the pen began to fill up and the crowd began to sway, an
                 involuntary movement, and they ended up at the front of the pen and began
                 to feel uncomfortable as pressure grew gradually.     He climbed over the
                 radial fence into Pen 5 and saw a Police Constable standing on the fence,
                 pushing  people back. He didn't see any Police Officers attempting to
                 assist.  The Jury asked questions regarding the purchase of tickets.

                 Alison Bennett, Lowe's girlfriend, travelled to Sheffield with him and
                 three others.   Her evidence was almost identical, however she saw more
                 Police Officers by the perimeter fence giving assistance.

                 Alan Jones travelled with his brother and friend by coach, arriving at
                 Sheffield at 1.20pm.   They were in possession 'of match tickets.    They
                 went to The Fox public house, which was overflowing.   He consumed 2 cans
                 of lager, purchased from a nearby off-licence, between 1.20pm and 2.35pm.
                 He then made his way to the Leppings Lane end of the ground, arriving at
                 2.55pm.  He joined a large crowd already there and more joined after his
                 arrival.  He cannot remember being pushed around by the crowd or pushing
                 himself.   He was not crushed.   He did not hear messages on any tannoy
                 system and only saw one mounted Police Officer. He cannot remember which
                 gate he entered to go into the ground.     He entered the tunnel and saw

players on the pitch. Halfway along the tunnel he came to a halt due to
obstruction, then was carried into Pen 4 by pressure in the crowd.    Due
to crowd movement he was carried to the front of the pen and climbed over
the perimeter fence.    He saw Police Officers helping others over the
fence, but couldn't remember what was happening on the pitch.

                SUBJECT:   SUMMARY OF INQUEST 28.11.90

                During the morning the court toured the area outside the ground, locating
                public houses, supermarkets, Wadsley Bridge Station and finally visiting
                Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground.

                At 2.00pm, the court reconvened, hearing evidence from:

                Stephanie Jones           Liverpool Supporter

                Stephanie Jones travelled to Sheffield on Friday 14 April 1989, to visit
                her brother Richard and his girlfriend, Tracey. They were all going to the
                semi-final the next day. They were in possession of four tickets. Richard
                and Tracey both died in the tragedy.     Richard resided in the Crookesmoor
                area of Sheffield and left his home address with Tracey and Stephanie at
                2.00pm, intending to visit a public house on the north side of the ground
                to sell the fourth ticket to a friend.      Stephanie did not see many fans
                during the drive and those she saw were not carrying any cans. She joined
                the crowd, which she describes as a mass of people, at Leppings Lane
                turnstiles and felt pressure from behind.        She saw only three Police
                Officers, one of whom was on horseback. The mounted Officer was attempting
                to split the crowd but failed due to its volume.        She mentioned being
                crushed against Gate C before it opened again at 2.59pm, when she gained
                access to the ground.    She entered the tunnel, which was clear, and saw
                fans urinating against the wall.     She then entered Pen 3 unhindered and
                described the crowd as normal.   She remembers being shoved from behind and
                after a big surge, lost sight of Richard and Tracey.     She cannot remember
                anything further until shortly afterwards, when she stepped out of Gate 3
                onto the track. She was not aware of any activity on the field or that the
                match was in progress until she stepped onto the track.

                There is photographic evidence showing Jones outside the ground near to
                Gate C at 2.45pm, with several Police Officers in close proximity to her.
                She has identified her brother in Pen 3 on video, BBC, MAP 1, timed
                1456:31:01.   This evidence appears to be in conflic't to her previous
                evidence.

                When questioned regarding the urinating in the tunnel, she appeared to
                accept this sort of behaviour as the norm and not out of place amongst
                Liverpool fans.

                Counsel for Sheffield City Council addressed the Coroner regarding time
                being lost by questions being duplicated by other legal representatives.
                The matter was discussed and the Coroner stated that he was quite happy
                with the way the questioning was going because he wanted the Inquest to be
                as thorough as it could be.

       turnstiles                and    heard       a Police          Officer           with        a    loud-hailer                asking          fans

            SUBJECT:    SUMMARY OF INQUEST 29-11.90


            The following witnesses were called to give evidence.

            Colin Gillam            Security Guard
            Kevin Carroll           Liverpool Supporter
            Roger Knowles           Liverpool Supporter
            Matthew Gould           Liverpool Supporter

            Gillam was engaged on security duties at perimeter railings in Leppings
            Lane. He mentioned seeing 20 - 30 fans hanging around near to the bridge,
            who appeared to be without tickets.    He noticed large influx of fans at
            about 2.00pm and mentioned actions of Police Officers in the area.

            Carroll arrived in Sheffield at 2.00pm with two friends, all of whom were
            in possession of match tickets. They approached the perimeter railings at
            2.30pm.  En route to the ground he saw fans drinking, some carrying cans,
            but not physically drunk.   He mentioned large crowd outside the perimeter
            gates, which were closed. He entered the ground through Gate C and walked
            through the tunnel into Pen 3> He described the tunnel and pen as packed,
            however he was not concerned with these conditions and forced his way down
            the terrace to a position somewhere behind barrier 124A. He heard people
            screaming and when Beardsley hit the cross-bar, conditions became worse
            and he saw people start to climb over the perimeter and radial fences. He
            saw Police preventing fans from climbing over the perimeter fence. He did
            not see or hear barrier 124A break, but saw the bar being thrown over the
            fence, nearly hitting a Policeman.

             Knowles arrived in Sheffield at 1.30pm with his son and his friend. All
             were in possession of match tickets.      He consumed one pint in a city
             centre public house, after which they all left for the ground, arriving in
             Leppings Lane at 2.30pm.    He described a large crowd outside, with no
             orderly queues.   He was concerned as a free-for-all was developing with
             fans pushing and trying to get to the turnstiles.    Gate C opened and he
             heard a cheer from the fans behind him and his party entered the ground
             through that gate. They walked along the tunnel and entered Pen 4. They
             forced their way to the perimeter fence at the front of Pen 4, but did not
             appear concerned with the conditions in there.     He mentioned that as a
             result of a strong surge, his son and friend became uncomfortable with
             being so tightly packed and he allowed the boys to climb the perimeter
             fence onto the pitch. A Policewoman then directed them to Pen 6, which he
             described as empty.

             Gould originates from the Midlands, is a student residing in Sheffield and
             follows Liverpool Football Club. Accompanied by two friends, he left his
             accommodation, arriving in Leppings Lane at 1.30pm.     None of his party
             were in possession of match tickets and intended purchasing them from
             ticket touts.   He saw fans drinking from cans and bottles.      At 1.30pm
             there were no queues, but then there were insufficient people to warrant
             forming queues at that time. He stated tickets for Leppings Lane end were
             too expensive so they walked round to the Nottingham Forrest side, but
             couldn't find another ticket tout. In Leppings Lane, fifty percent of the
             crowd were drinking from cans and 2 litre bottles, some carrying 4 packs.

SUMMARY OF INQUEST 29.11.90



He himself was approached for tickets.         He saw fans climbing over
turnstiles and heard a Police Officer with a loud-hailer asking fans to
keep calm.   He saw a fan strike out at a Policeman on horseback.     Some
fans appeared distressed in the crowd.     He saw Gate C open and decided
that they would get in a position that if it opened again they would take
advantage of the situation and enter the ground, which they did.      They
went along the tunnel and met a wall of people near to the terraces, then
they entered Pen 3-    He described being part of the flow when in Pen 3,
but was not concerned as he wanted to go where the flow was taking him
anyway.   He mentioned, however, that he could not move backwards against
the flow of people. He positioned himself in front of barrier 124a , where
he saw two males (who it is believed to be A.J. Murray and his son, P.B.
Murray, 14 years, deceased) both having difficulties.   When Beardsley hit
the cross-bar, he felt a massive surge and ended up near to Gate 3, which
opened and he entered the playing area.       He did not see or hear the
barrier break.

            both had tickets for the Spion Kop.    They arrived in Sheffield at 12.30pm and
            parked near to The Fox public house, where they stayed until 2.30pm. They were
            amongst a thousand plus fans who approached the turnstiles at Leppings Lane.
            At 2.40pm they joined a mass of people outside the perimeter railings and
            worked their way to within 3 or 4 people from the gate, which was secured by a
            Police Officer.   At 2.50pm someone at the front said, "Rush the gates."    The
            crowd pushed forward from behind.   They entered the turnstile area, where they
            were directed through Gate C by Police Officers.       They walked through the
            tunnel into Pen 4, which was crowded but not uncomfortable.          They moved
            directly to the front of the pen.       Conditions changed with surges and he
            climbed over the fence onto the pitch.

            McGauley states that between 1.30pm and 2.30pm he was looking out of the front
            window of his home address.      He mentioned the flow of fans walking along
            Wadsley Lane towards the ground increased, but never encroached onto the
            highway.   He did not notice any unruly behaviour and there was no litter in
            evidence on this occasion, which was unusual.    Between 2.30pm and 3.00pm his
            only knowledge of outside his home address was a series of glances.

            This particular witness was put forward by one of the families and the Coroner
            adjourned this evidence due to Mr King attempting to introduce evidence
            requiring this witness to make a comparison with the match between Sheffield
            Wednesday Football Club and Manchester United Football Club and the semi-final.
            The Coroner intimated that he may well deny Mr King's application to follow
            this line of questioning.

            Boardman travelled by coach with his brother and friend, all of whom were in
            possession of match tickets.    There were twenty coaches at Liverpool and they
            boarded the next to last coach (19), the reason for this being that other fans
            were pushing to get on the coaches. Their coach was late, having been delayed
            at Liverpool through the Police searching all the coaches and confiscating
            alcohol found thereon. At 2.45pm they arrived at the Leppings Lane end and saw
            fans drinking, but well behaved.    He saw some Police Officers on horseback and
            some on foot near to the turnstiles.     He didn't see the Police Landrover, but
            heard a message, "Stop pushing .... "        He saw injured fans outside the
            turnstiles so they stood away from the crowd, next to a group of ten people in
            the 20 - 30 age group.   He heard them say, "Next time they open the gate they
            would get themselves in."    When Gate C opened, Boardman, his brother and his
            friend entered the ground, as did the other group.         They walked down the

tunnel, which was blocked near to the terrace, and they entered Pen 4, where
they were pushed forward by the crowd.    He was separated from his friends and
became squashed.  He climbed over the perimeter fence onto the track and later
found his friend. He later learned that some people who were on the same coach
as him had died, but he did not know them.

                 SUBJECT:    SUMMARY OF INQUEST 3•12.90




                 The following witnesses were called to give evidence.

                 Graham Hirst                      Football   Supporter   -   Liverpool
                 Thomas Hilton                     Football   Supporter   -   Liverpool
                 Graham Richardson                 Football   Supporter   -   Liverpool
                 Roger Houston                     Football   Supporter   -   Liverpool

                 Hirst, with a friend, arrived in Sheffield at 2.15pm and both were in
                 possession of match tickets.   They joined a large crowd outside Leppings
                 Lane perimeter gates and experienced pressure from behind.     They entered
                 the ground through Gate C. His match ticket displayed 'B' on it and seeing
                 letter B on the left hand side of the tunnel, he entered the tunnel, which
                 was packed.   The flow of fans was slow but he had to go with the force of
                 people behind. He went into Pen 4 and moved towards the radial fence. The
                 pen was packed and he mentioned the worst crushing he had ever experienced.
                 He climbed over the radial fence and into Pen 5-

                  Hilton, with a friend, arrived in Sheffield at 2.30pm and saw many fans,
                  none carrying alcohol. He arrived at Leppings Lane at 2.40pm and many fans
                  arrived at the same time. There were no queues and mass disorder. He saw
                  several Police Officers on horseback, with fans running under the horses.
                  Fans were anxious to get into the ground and the pressure was severe. He
                  entered the ground through the turnstiles and walked round to Enclosure 2.
                  He then entered Pens 3 and 4 to look for his friend. He was not deterred
                  by the volume of fans in those pens and did not leave the confines of these
                  pens.   He was in Pen 4 when Beardsley hit the cross-bar at about 3-04pm.
                  He climbed the perimeter fence onto the players area.

                  Richardson and his brother arrived in Sheffield at 2.45pm due to being
                  delayed by major roadworks.    In Leppings Lane he joined a large group of
                  fans outside the perimeter gates, these opened under the pressure of fans.
                  He saw Police Officers on horseback, with fans ducking under the horses.
                  He entered the ground through Gate C and headed for the tunnel, as the
                  crowd was going towards it.   The tunnel was full but he was able to make
                  progress with a bit of a push.       He entered Pen 3, which was packed,
                  propelled by pressure from behind, ending up behind barrier 124A.       The
                  conditions were terrible and he was unable to move.        He saw a Police
                  Officer on the fence, trying to bend over the spikes at the top. Beardsley
                  hit the cross-bar, resulting in a biggish surge forward. He then noticed a
                  further movement forward from the crowd in front of him.     He exited from
                  the pen using the tunnel at the rear of the pen.

                  Houson and his son arrived in Sheffield at about 2.30pm, both in possession
                  of match tickets.   Theyjogged to the.ground and saw a     steady stream of
                  fans leading towards the ground.    He was approached by at least half a
                  dozen teenagers, asking for tickets.     They arrived at Leppings Lane at
                  about 2.35pm.  He described the crowd as a large stationary wedge. He saw
                  two Police Officers on horseback at the side of the crowd, not being

    Gen/2

effective in any way. He experienced the crowd crushing outside Wembley in
1986, therefore he was reluctant to enter the crowd.         He climbed the
banking across the road from the turnstiles and observed the crowd's
behaviour between 2.45pm and 2.55pm.   The Police Landrover arrived and he
heard a Police Officer on a loud-hailer telling the crowd to "Ease back",
with no apparent effect. Attempt was made to delay the kick-off, reference
was also made to 3.15pm.   Order were also given to Police on horseback to
get into line, which they did but to no effect.          The gates opened,
including Gate C, and the crowd entered the ground.     He mentioned Gate A
also opened.  He entered the ground as 3 - 4 Police Officers were ejecting
some youths.     He entered the tunnel, which was empty, but natural
apprehension prevented him from entering the pens.    He saw some fans run,
charge and they bulldozed their way through the crowd.      He also saw two
adults come into the tunnel from the terraces, sweating and having
difficulty breathing.   He could not detect any concern from the line of
people who were standing in front of him at the entrance to the terraces.
Whilst in the tunnel he saw the ball hit the cross-bar. He then left the
tunnel, turned left and walked behind the stand into Pen 1 (by Police
Control), where he remembers the game being abandoned.

                this match and saw a large crowd outside Leppings Lane and at 2.45pm decided
                to go to the Kop area of the ground.    Whilst on the Kop he saw fans climb
                from Leppings Lane terraces into the West Stand during the game.        It was
                established that he did not see if the crowd actually entered Leppings Lane
                turnstiles before the kick-off at that match, he did not see the crowd
                outside Leppings Lane turnstiles on 15 April 1989 and therefore could not
                give a comparison between the two matches.

                Inspector Sykes was in charge of Sub-Sector 8, under Chief Inspector
                Creaser.   He described the duties of his serials in relation to searching
                fans for drink, banners and offensive weapons near the turnstiles.      The
                crowd build-up was greater than anticipated and he caused Inspector Hand-
                Davis to form a cordon with horses at about 2.15pm.  He also caused traffic
                in Leppings Lane to stop at 2.30pm, due to the build-up of fans, some
                obviously having been drinking.    He saw Inspector Bennett assisting fans
                over the turnstiles wall.     He also saw the Landrover arrive and heard
                messages transmitted from the loud-hailer.  He saw fans at the rear of the
                crowd pushing and also saw Gate A open.

                SUBJECT:   SUMMARY OF INQUEST 6.12.90




                  The following were called to give evidence

                  Inspector Gordon   Sykes                     Police   Officer
                  Inspector Robert   Purdy                     Police   Officer
                  Police Constable   Brian Huckstepp           Police   Officer
                  Police Constable   Kenneth Horsefield        Police   Officer

                  Inspector Sykes was re-called and concluded his evidence under cross-
                  examination.   After the announcement over the loud-hailer, Gate C opened
                  and the crowd surged through. Superintendent Marshall instructed Officers
                  to enter the ground.   No further information was given and they went into
                  Pen 1 and then into Pen 3 through the tunnel, having to push fans out of
                  the way. He assisted in the recovery of bodies from the terrace onto the
                  concourse.   He mentioned that the fans in the tunnel had no idea what was
                  happening in the pens.     Interest into the evidence relating to ticket
                  touts was made by the Jury in relation to the law. They were advised that
                  there was no specific law against ticket touts but if they were
                  obstructing the highway they would be arrested for that offence.

                  Inspector Purdy was in charge of Sub-Sector 8, with Inspector Sykes.   The
                  serials in his Sub-Sector were briefed regarding their duties behind the
                  West Stand by Inspector Sykes.   Inspector Purdy described Police Officers
                  on horseback dispersing ticketless fans away from the turnstile area.
                  After 2.00pm the crowd built up rapidly, were volatile and there was great
                  pressure.  He mentioned Police action to control the crowd, which finally
                  resulted in Gate C being opened and the crowd entering the ground.      He
                  later saw the perimeter gate open and Gate C also open.        He heard a
                  message for all Officers to attend on the pitch and’ entered the ground
                  through Gate C, then with a Sergeant and a Police Constable went to Pen 2
                  via the players' area and began assisting in the removal of bodies from
                  Pen 3-

                 Police Constable Huckstepp was a member of Serial 16, under Inspector
                 Purdy, and was positioned outside turnstiles A and B, in the section of
                 turnstiles marked A to G.   He described his duties relating to searching
                 fans for alcohol and offensive weapons as normal until 2.30pm, when the
                 situation changed drastically - no longer queues, great mass of people,
                 could not move freely, was being crushed together with other fans who had
                 been behaving perfectly properly.     At 2.30pm he saw Police on horseback
                 trying to regulate crowds.   He forced his way through the turnstiles into
                 the concourse   area and immediately returned to the area outside the
                 turnstiles, through Gate C.      There was severe crushing and fans were
                 distressed near to the turnstiles, caused by sheer volume of fans pushing
                 from behind.    Gate C opened andfans began      to stream away from the
                 turnstiles and into Gate C.    He heard a request for Officers to go onto
                 the pitch and entered the ground through Gate C and onto the pitch area.

SUMMARY OF INQUEST 6.12.90




Police Constable Horsefield was a member of Serial 16, under Inspector
Sykes, and was positioned outside turnstiles 9 ~ 16 in the section of
turnstiles marked C. Between 2.00pm and 2.30pm there was a steady stream
of fans entering the ground.  He spoke to 3 or 4 separate groups of fans,
who were without tickets.    Between 2.30pm and 2.45pm the enclosure had
filled up with fans and he was pushed into a corner. He described it as a
dramatic change, with a sudden rush of fans all appearing at once. With
another Police Constable, he made his way to the perimeter gate.         A
Policeman on horseback halted the crowd whilst he shut a gate and put the
bolt into the ground.   Fans climbed over the gate.    He was jostled and
verbally abused by fans who were intent on entering the ground.     He was
also thumped by one fan, which resulted in him having to release the bolt,
allowing the gate to open. Gate A opened and fans disappeared through it.
As a result of hearing a verbal message, he entered the ground through the
turnsiltes and went onto the pitch. Together with Police Sergeant Morgan
and others, he returned to the concourse and entered Pen 3 through the
tunnel and assisted carrying several bodies out through the tunnel.

                Killock,  West Midlands    Police,   gave evidence  in relation to the
                identification of Richard Jones by his father Leslie Jones.   Mr Jones had
                identified his son on BBC video, Map 1, timed at 1456:31-'01, in Pen 3 of
                the Leppings Lane terraces.   On Wednesday 28 November 1990, Mr Jones was
                shown a still photograph of that same identification and is now unsure of
                his original identification. Stephanie Jones, his daughter, gave evidence
                on Tuesday 28 November 1990 and was adamant that she was crushed against
                Gate C before it opened again at 2.59pm, when she gained access to the
                ground with her brother, Richard Jones.

                Ralph Salt is the Licensee of The Owl public house.        He described the
                amount of stock he had on his premises on 15 April 1989-       He mentioned
                that there were one hundred to one hundred and fifty fans inside the
                premises and fifty plus fans on the car park outside the premises. Sales
                for that day totalled £1 ,1 9 2 and he estimated he sold about one thousand
                pints of beer at the lunchtime session.      He referred to a delivery note
                dated 20.4.89 itemising stock he ordered to replace that which was sold on
                15.4.89.

                The Coroner caused Salt to be called as he wanted to get a fair picture of
                events and to clarify evidence given by Ollerenshaw on 20 November"1990.
                It should be noted that the stock Salt ordered on 20.4.89 exceeded that
                which he stated was sold on 15-4.89.

                Police Constable Stephen Fry is a Police horseman with the Liverpool
                Police.   On 15 April 1989 he was working with the South Yorkshire Police
                horsemen.   He mentioned his duties at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.
                He described the fans as good humoured and well behaved until about
                2.30pm, when he was requested to return to Leppings Lane turnstiles.    The
                area near to turnstiles A - G was full and he positioned himself sideways
                on, blocking one of the perimeter gates effectively, causing a gap to be
                created behind him. He noticed that fans at the rear of the crowd near to
                the turnstiles were still pushing forward.     There was still pressure as
                the crowd increased in front of him outside the perimeter gates.         He
                appealed to the crowd to stop pushing - some did, others continued, some
                squeezing under the horse's belly.      One fan struck his horse on the
                muzzle.    He had never experienced the determination, pressure, and the
                size and lateness of crowds arriving at the ground.     He was not aware of
                any gate opening, only that pressure began to ease.

                The West Midlands Police compilation tape which was used at the Lord
                Justice Taylor enquiry was shown to the Jury again.

        SUBJECT:    SUMMARY OF INQUEST 10.12.90



         The following were called to give evidence.

         Francis Grunfiill               Police Officer (Merseyside Police)
         Philip Smith                    Police Sergeant (Merseyside Police)
         Elizabeth Wilson                Police Officer (South Yorkshire Police)

         Police Constable Francis Grunhill is a Police horseman with the Liverpool
         Police.   On 15 April 1989 he was working with the South Yorkshire Police
         horsemen.   He mentioned his duties at the Leppings Lane end of the ground
         and described the build-up of fans after 2.45pm.    He described the fans'
         behaviour and his appeals to them to stop pushing, which were ignored. He
         mentioned there was an urgency in the fans, brought on by frustration and
         the fact that his horse became agitated with the build-up of pressure from
         these fans, which began to lift it off the ground. He removed his horse
         from the crowd as he was apprehensive that it would injure someone nearby.
         He noticed that those fans at the rear of the crowd could have eased and
         moved back, reducing the pressure.

        Police Sergeant Philip Smith is a Police horseman with the Liverpool
        Police.   On 15 April 1989 he was working with the South Yorkshire Police
        horsemen.   He mentioned his duties at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.
        He described the behaviour of the fans and the build-up of fans at about
        2.20pm.   He mentioned crowd movement through the turnstile was slow. He
        described how he placed his horse across an open perimeter gate to stem
        the flow of fans and his attempt to slow the fans by verbal commands. He
        mentioned noticing the Police Landrover arrive and also appealing to fans
        to push back.    He sensed the mood of the fans changing and becoming more
        aggressive, turning into agitation.       He compared this match with a
        Liverpool v. Everton local derby at Goodison Park, which was an all ticket
        match and was a sell out, all 40,000 tickets.     There were 300 - 350 fans
        without tickets and on four separate occasions they attempted to gain
        entrance by forcing exit gates.

        Police Constable Elizabeth Wilson is a Police horsewoman with the South
        Yorkshire Police and worked with Police horsemen from the Merseyside
        Police on 15 April 1 9 8 9 . She mentioned her duties at the Leppings Lane
        end of the ground, describing crowd behaviour, fans she believed did not
        have match tickets, fans' carrying 4 and 6 packs of lager and 2 litre
        bottles of lager, and smelling strongly of intoxicants. She described the
        build-up of fans outside the turnstiles end and being part of a cordon
        formed across the entrance to the turnstiles area. She also described her
        horse being hit by fans, a fan trying to snatch the horse's reins and
        other fans going under the neck, belly and rear of her horse in order to
        get past her.    She formed the impression that kick-off was delayed or
        being considered and conveyed this to the crowd, who eased off. She heard
        a roar from inside the stadium and the crowd began to push again, forcing
        their way past her.

to    hold     the       crowds        back,           this          being        physically             by a       cordon        oy a r m

movements           and verbally,                     all       without           effect,            'Ihere     was      r oom      at    the

to.     He     observed             the         Landrover             in     the    area        and      heard       requests            far

fans    to     stop       pushing,               also       to       no    effect.           He      described           the      cordon         put

                The following were called to give evidence.

                Elizabeth Wilson                Police Officer (South Yorkshire Police)
                Kenneth Rawlinson               Football Supporter (Liverpool)
                Paul Hand-Davis                 Police Officer (South Yorkshire Police)
                Stephen Thomas                  Police Officer (South Yorkshire Police)

                Police Constable Wilson was re-called and concluded her evidence under
                cross-examination.    She was questioned regarding briefing details,
                monitoring fans' arrival, advising the crowd of delay or possible delay
                with kick-off, which tended to calm them down, also her ability to hear
                messages being transmitted over the radio and the       Landrover tannoy
                messages.

                Kenneth Rawlinson, with his friends, arrived in Sheffield at 12.30pm.
                They arrived in Leppings Lane at 2.40pm and at.2.45pm were approximately 3
                to 4 bodies away from the turnstiles A - G. He described the situation as
                very tight.    One of his friends, plus an elderly fan, began having
                difficulty breathing.   They were assisted out of the queue by a Police
                Officer and allowed to enter the ground through Gate C. He waited for his
                friends on the concourse by the entrance to the tunnel.          In cross-
                examination he stated the natural flow caused him to go to the tunnel. He
                went into the tunnel, saw it was blocked, came out and went to Pen 1,
                which was also full. Whilst making his way to Pen 6 he saw a gate in the
                fence to North Stand open and he went into the North Stand.     He saw the
                game was still in progress as he entered the stand and saw fans were
                climbing over the perimeter fence and West Stand.He presumed this   was an
                overspill as the terrace at the front was packed.

                Inspector Hand-Davis is a Police horseman with the South Yorkshire Police.
                He mentioned the briefing       he gave to the Officers he had under his
                command, these being from      Merseyside and Nottingham as well as South
                Yorkshire Police.    He mentioned that there appeared to be no problem at
                Leppings Lane until about 2.30pm, when there was an influx of fans,
                thousands of people.    He described the attempts made to hold the crowds
                back, this being physically by a cordon by arm movements and verbally, all
                without effect.   There was room at the back and fans could have responded
                and stopped if they had wanted to. He observed the Landrover in the area
                and heard requests for fans to stop pushing, also to no effect.         He
                described the cordon put across the reception area and the effect this had
                on the crowd.   He saw Gate    A open and a large influx of fans enter the
                ground.  He later went towards the Police Control, sawfans climbing over
                the perimeter fence and thought it was a pitch invasion.         There was
                nothing to distinguish it from an overspill situation except that fans
                did not encroach on the playing area.

            PoliceSergeant Thomas    is a Police horsemean with the South Yorkshire
            Police   and worked with Police horsemen from the Merseyside Police on 15
            April 1989.     He mentioned hisduties at the Leppings Lane end of     the
            ground, crowd behaviour and up to fifty fans who he believed to have
            attended without tickets.   He described the arrival of fans, the pressure
            in the turnstiles area and his action to relieve it by holding a perimeter
            gate in the closed position.   He mentioned shouting to the crowds to stop
            pushing.    A surge of the fans forced the gate open.        He mentioned
            requesting more horsemen to assist at his location, which they did.     He
            saw Gate B open for about five minutes.

                SUBJECT:   SUMMARY OF INQUEST 12.12.90


                The following witnesses were called to give evidence.

                Peter Kerry            Police Officer (Nottinghamshire Constabulary)
                Albert Rhodes          Turnstile Operator
                David Lackey           Football Supporter (Liverpool)
                Norman Ludlam          Turnstile Operator
                Jason Smith            Turnstile Operator
                Neil Laycock           Turnstile Operator

                Police Constable Kerry is a Police horseman with the Nottingham Police.
                On 15 April I989 he was working with the South Yorkshire Police horsemen
                at the Penistone Road North end of the ground. Together with other Police
                horsemen he went to the Leppings Lane end via the rear of the South Stand.
                He described the fans' behaviour relating to pushing from the rear of the
                crowd, ignoring instructions given by Police Officers on horseback and the
                opening of Gate C. He described similar experiences involving pushing and
                pressure by late arrivals in a larger turnstile area at the Nottingham
                Forest ground.

                Albert Rhodes has been a turnstile operator for the last ten seasons. On
                15 April I989 he was working in turnstile C in the A - G complex of
                Leppings Lane.   He described the build-up of fans about 2.30pm and the
                fans' condition on entering the turnstile - distressed, crying and
                suffering from the effects of crushing.   He mentioned fans attempting to
                enter the ground without tickets (final figure 30 - 40) sneaking in. He
                described the condition of some of the fans entering the ground in various
                degrees of drunkenness.

                David Lackey, with friends, arrived in Sheffield at 2.00pm, having
                travelled by train.   None were in possession of match tickets.   They were
                escorted to Leppings Lane, where they attempted to purchase match tickets.
                He did not see any fans drinking or drunk.    They were 'unable to purchase
                tickets and were moved away by Police Officers on horseback.    They waited
                on the bridge. He saw the Landrover arrive and instructions were given to
                Police horsemen to form a cordon.      He saw a concertina gate open and
                entered the ground with his friends.      They walked down the tunnel and
                entered Pen 3-    He was not concerned with the pen being full.      He was
                carried forward by a sudden unexpected push, ending up near to the front
                of the pen.   He felt a couple more surges, the pressure increased and he
                was in fear for his life. He saw Gate 3 open and a couple of fans go into
                the playing area. He saw one lad pushed back into the enclosure. He then
                saw a Police Officer standing on boards, shouting    for fans to push back
                and Gate 3opened a     second time and fans entered the playing area.    He
                noticed that there were fans coming from behind him and getting out. He
                left the pen via the tunnel.    The Jury asked him if he saw any barriers
                break, he replied, "No."

                Norman Ludlam has been a turnstile operator for the last seven to eight
                years.   On 15 April 1989 he was working in turnstile A in the A - G
                complex of Leppings Lane. He mentioned being offered.cash and tickets for
                the Kop end in order to gain entry into the ground.    He described crowd
                flow, crowd behaviour, the aggression and Police Officers in the area of
                the turnstiles.

 SUMMARY OF INQUEST 12.12.90



 Jason Smith has only been a turnstile operator for a couple of seasons.
 On 15 April 1989 he was working in turnstiles in the A - G complex of
 Leppings Lane. His description of the situation is similar to Ludlam. Up
 to 2.30pm he had taken 700 tickets.  Due to the pressure, he allowed fans
 through.    He mentioned approximately 150 fans gained entry without
 tickets.

 Neil Laycock is a part-time turnstile operator.   On 15 April 1989 he was
 working in turnstile No. 5 in the North Stand complex of Leppings Lane.
 His description of the situation is similar to the other turnstile
 operators.  He estimated approximately 30 fans attempting to enter without
 tickets and literally hundreds with tickets for Penistone Road North end
 of the ground.

 Mr Payne addressed the Coroner.    He expressed concern of the fact that
 certain Counsels were including disguised speech in their questioning of
 witnesses.   This, I believe, was directed against Mr King.    The final
 decision was that there would be no disguised speeches and evidence of
 opinions to be directed at experts only.

 Mr King addressed the Coroner.  He attempted to persuade the Coroner to
 allow information of medical conditions of witnesses (i.e. this witness
 injured or suffered trauma etc) to be made known to the Jury.  This was
 denied as the Coroner did not want the Jury to be swayed by emotion and
 sympathy.

 After the court had closed, West Midlands Police produced a video tape
 which South Yorkshire Police Traffic Officers had taken on the mobile
 video and showed litter on the route from Woodhead and the Snake Pass to
 the ground.

        SUBJECT:    SUMMARY OF INQUEST 13-12.90




        The following witnesses were called to give evidence.

        Stephen Copeland             Turnstile Operator
        Colin Milton                 Turnstile Operator
        Michael Buxton               Police Officer (South Yorkshire Police)
        Graham Wright                Police Officer (South Yorkshire Police)

        Stephen Copeland has been a turnstile operator since 1984.     On 15 April
        1989 he was working in turnstile F in the A - G complex of Leppings Lane.
        His description of the situation is similar to the other turnstile
        operators in relation to crowd behaviour and verbal abuse.    He mentioned
        fans offering him cash and tickets for the Spion Kop end in order to gain
        entry into the ground. He estimated between 30 - 50 fans offering him cash
        to enter the ground.

        Colin Milton has been a turnstile operator for six years. On 15 April 1989
        he was working in turnstile G in the A -G complex of Leppings Lane.    His
        description of the situation is similar to the other turnstile operators.
        He mentioned fans offering him cash and tickets for the Spion Kop end in
        order to gain entry into the ground.    He estimated about 20 fans offered
        him cash to enter the ground.

        Police Constable Michael Buxton was the driver of the Police Landrover on
        15 April 1 9 8 9 . He described his duties on that date, his attending at the
        Leppings Lane      end of the ground and the crowd of fans outside the
        turnstiles.     He mentioned using the P.A. system in an attempt to stop the
        fans from pushing forward and crushing those fans at the front.            He
        referred to his radio messages to Ground Control for the kick-off to be
        delayed but the reply from Police Sergeant Goddard was, "too late".        He
        mentioned Gate C must have opened because the crowd began to disappear.
        His first impression on entering the ground was that it was a pitch
        invasion by the Liverpool fans. He described his role on the playing area
        as assisting in the removal of bodies from Pen 3-

        Police Constable Graham Wright was a member of Serial 16, under Sergeant
        Payne, and was positioned outside turnstile G in the section of turnstiles
        marked A - G.   He described his duties at that location and the action of
        other Officers in the vicinity. He mentioned being passed a young child by
        Inspector Purdy and taking the child into the ground through Gate C to the
        First Aid room set up in the concourse area. He noticed that the crowd in
        the turnstile area had subsided.   He mentioned going round into the South
        Stand and his first impression was that it was a pitch invasion.         He
        described going to the perimeter fence of Pen 3 and assisting in the rescue
        of injured and dead fans.

SUMMARY OF INQUEST 13-12.90




The Jury asked the following questions.

(1)   Has Police Sergeant Goddard power to stop match.

(2)   Who has authority to delay kick-off.

(3)   The fans dropped off in Leppings Lane by coach.

The Coroner directed that Police Constable     Buxton was not a person who
should answer (1) and (2).

Police Constable Buxton replied to question (3) that there were far too
many coaches and therefore this was not allowed on this occasion.

                Police Sergeant Proctor was a member of Serial 19, under Inspector Sykes,
                and was positioned in the reception area, outside the perimeter gates at
                the Leppings Lane end of the ground.    He described the scene outside the
                gates in relation to ticketless fans, fans carrying cans of alcohol and the
                sudden arrival of a swarm of fans.      He mentioned that he attempted to
                control the pressure on the turnstiles by closing the perimeter gates.    He
                was later joined by Police Constable Scholey.    This created a gap between
                the gates and the turnstiles but not easing the pressure as those at the
                rear of the turnstiles queue continued pushing.       Pressure of the crowd
                forced the perimeter gates open, damaging the bolt securing the gate into
                the tarmac.   He saw Gate C open and pressure released.    He went into Gate
                A, into the North Stand, and saw what he thought was a pitch invasion.
                When he realised the situation, he assisted the .'walking wounded'.

                Police Constable Scholey was a member of Serial 19, under Police Sergeant
                Proctor.   His description of events are almost identical to Police Sergeant
                Proctor's.    His evidence only differs when on entering the ground, he
                entered Pen 2 and caused fans to pass the bodies over the fence to him.'

                Police Constable Taylor was a member of Serial 16, under Police Sergeant
                Payne, and was positioned outside the section of turnstiles marked A - G.
                At 2.15pm he was required to leave that location and escort a fan who
                wished to report the theft of his match ticket to the Gymnasium for C.I.D.
                to complete the necessary reports.  The circumstances were that the ticket
                was snatched, from the fan's hand.   He described the ctowd build-up, the
                fans without tickets, fans who smelled strongly of alcohol and those with
                tickets for the Spion Kop. He mentioned holding one of the perimeter gates
                closed, but the crowd pressure forced it open.  The crowd then disappeared
                through Gate C. He went into the ground, onto the pitch and assisted with
                injured fans.

                At the      conclusion   of   the   evidence,   the   Jury was   shown the   compilation
                video.

        SUBJECT:    SUMMARY OF INQUEST 17.12.90

        The following witnesses were called to give evidence.

        Colin Milton                     Turnstile Operator
        Ian Marsh                        Steward - Gateman
        Andrew Best                      Police Officer (South Yorkshire Police)
        Malcolm France                   Police Sergeant (South Yorkshire Police)
        John Bennett                     Chief Inspector (South Yorkshire Police)
        Malcolm Cobb                     Steward - Gateman

        Colin Milton was re-called in order that Mrs McBrien could ask him further
        questions.   These related to holders of tickets for the Spion Kop being
        given access to the Leppings Lane terraces.      He stated that a Police
        Officer gave him instructions to allow this to happen, but is unable to
        identify him.

        Ian Marsh has been a steward for 4 years.     On 15 April 1989 he was the
        gateman on Gate C.   He described the stewards' briefing and his duties.
        He mentioned the first opening of Gate C to allow a fan to be ejected and
        probably 40 or more fans entered the ground before they were able to
        safely close the gate.    He thought prior to the second occasion Gate C
        opened, if the gate had not opened people would die due to the crushing by
        the huge volume of fans outside.      On the second occasion, Gate C was
        opened by Police for five minutes and the fans walked through the open
        gate and headed towards the tunnel. On the final occasion Gate C opened,
        fans who entered had their match tickets checked by the stewards.

        Police Constable Andrew Best was a member of Serial 16, under Police
        Sergeant Payne, and was positioned outside turnstile G in the A - G
        complex of Leppings Lane.   He described the build-up of fans outside the
        turnstiles as being very quick between 2.20pm and 2.40pm.    He mentioned
        fans arriving at the Leppings Lane turnstiles without match tickets,
        tickets for the Spion Kop and those offering cash to gain entrance. Some
        of the fans were drunk, some had obviously been drinking and some were
        still drinking. He mentioned assisting two children, who were distressed,
        from the crowd outside turnstiles A - G. He mentioned arresting a fan who
        was drunk and taking him to the Police Room.       On his return to the
        concourse area behind the West Stand, he described assisting other Police
        Officers and fans in removing injured fans and bodies from the tunnel
        area.

        Police Constable Malcolm France was in charge of Serial 3 6 , under
        Inspector Ellis.    He described his duties as train reception at Wadsley
        Bridge Station and escorting the fans to the Leppings Lane end of the
        ground.   He mentioned fans without tickets and fans walking away from the
        ground enquiring about local public houses.      He assisted in forming a
        cordon with the Police horsemen, but after hearing a cheer from inside the
        ground he felt a great surge and the cordon fragmented.       He mentioned
        noticing the Landrover arrive and hearing messages transmitted from the
        loudspeaker, requesting fans to keep back.    After pressure decreased, he
        mentioned entering the ground and described his action near to Gate 4 of
        the Leppings Lane enclosure.

SUMMARY OF INQUEST 17-12.90



Chief Inspector John Bennett's duties were mainly of an administrative
nature.  He described the crowd density in Leppings Lane terraces and the
West Stand at 2.15pm.  He mentioned the great pressure outside Gate A and
organised a further serial to attend, to assist in relieving the pressure.
He described the problem caused by overcrowding, fans with Kop tickets,
wrong tickets, fans attempting to pay to get in and fans attempting to
sneak in.   He climbed on the roof of the turnstiles and described the
crush outside, the cordon formed by Police on horseback and the gap that
developed behind the horses.    He realised the gates had opened as the
crowd size reduced by about a half.

 Malcolm Cobb has been a steward for 27 years.      For the last 22 years he
 has been a gateman on Gate A. He described fans flashing money at him to
 allow them to gain entry (£10 and £20 notes). He mentioned having to lock
 the gate because of pressure outside.     Fans said, "If you don't open the
 gates, we'll smash it down."    He heard Gate C had been forced open.    He
 mentioned a Police Sergeant and some Police Officers attended and Gate A
 opened and hundreds of fans entered the ground and went towards the North
 Stand. He described the scene as mass hooliganism against his gate to get
 into the ground, no matter what.

                 The following witnesses were called to give evidence.

                 Brian Ridge                    Steward (Sheffield Wednesday F.C.)
                 Malcolm Bain                   Steward (Sheffield Wednesday F.C.)
                 Peter Garratt                  R.A.F.
                 Malcolm Hurst                  Programme Seller (Sheffield Wednesday F.C.)
                 Stuart Thorpe                  Steward

                 Brian Ridge has been a steward for 20 years.    On 15 April 1990 he was
                 working as a gateman inside Gate B.     He described his duties at that
                 location.   He mentioned seeing Police Officers outside the turnstiles,
                 checking fans.   He described opening Gate B and about 500 fans entering
                 the ground. Some of the fans lost their shoes, but none stayed to search
                 for them.

                Malcolm Bain has been a steward for 12 years.      On 15 April 1990 he was
                working as a gateman inside Gate C.       He described his duties at that
                location.   He mentioned 4 - 5 fans approaching him and offering him cash
                to enter the ground.    He described seeing fans pushing and children being
                crushed outside turnstiles A - G, at about 2.45pm.       Gate C was opened
                fully for 5 - 1 0 minutes. He heard a roar and all the fans rushed for the
                tunnel.   He made reference to seeing Police Officers blocking off the
                entrance to the tunnel in 1988.       The Coroner, however, questioned him
                regarding the date when the wall dividing the concourse was constructed.
                Bain agreed that the wall was built about 4 years ago and he therefore
                could not have seen the entrance to the tunnel in 1988.

                During the time Bain was giving evidence, Sergeant Griffiths had to order
                the public sector to be quiet, as relatives, especially Devonside, were
                laughing in a contemptuous manner at points of his cross-examination.

                Garratt, with friends, arrived in Sheffield at 10.30am, having travelled
                by private car.   They were in possession of match tickets. They arrived
                in Leppings Lane at 2.00pm, where they entered the ground. They followed
                fans into Pen 3, which was nearly full, but climbed over the radial fence
                into Pen 4, which was relatively empty.      The reason for this was that
                Garratt is only 5 ’4" tall and could not see the pitch. At 2.50pm, he felt
                uncomfortable in the pen and as a result of surges he was crushed against
                the perimeter fence. He mentioned seeing Police Officers on the perimeter
                track, looking towards the pens.    He remembers someone dragging him away
                from the fence and seeing 4 or 5 bodies lying on the ground within the
                pen. He mentioned losing his hearing, sight and not being able to shout.
                He left Pen 4 via the tunnel and was conveyed to hospital, treated and
                released.

     SUMMARY OF INQUEST 18.12.90




     Malcolm Hurst is a programme seller and is also a committee member at
     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. He was located in a booth near to Gate
     A at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.    He described the opening of
     Gate A, the fans rushing in and Police Officers forming a walkway
     directing them into the North West end of the Leppings Lane terraces. He
     mentioned locking his booth and staying inside after selling all his
     programmes.

     Stuart Thorpe has been a steward for 27 years and is chief steward in the
     West Stand.   He described his duties and those of his stewards in the
     Leppings Lane end of the ground. He mentioned seeing fans climbing over a
     wall and being caught by Police Officers.    From his vantage point in the
     West Stand, he saw fans in the reception area, pushing.      He described,
     "All hell broke loose" as fans gained access into the ground through Gate
     C.   The fans came upstairs into the seated area and he     instructed his
     staff not to prevent this. He mentioned that no stewards were posted in
     pens as he believed this a dangerous practice, especially if the visiting
     team were losing.   The Jury asked Mr Thorpe questions regarding visiting
     stewards, their clothing and any duties they performed.

                 The following witnesses were called to give evidence.

                Richard Beasley           Steward (Sheffield Wednesday F.C. )
                Ruth Cobb                 Police Officer (South Yorkshire Police)
                Christopher Watson        Police Sergeant (Nottinghamshire Constabulary)
                Kevin Tope                Detective Chief Inspector (West Midlands Police)
                Stanley Beechey           Detective Superintendent (West Midlands Police)
                Stephen Brown             Police Constable (West Midlands Police)

                Richard Beasley has been a steward for 9 years. On 15 April I989 he was a
                gateman on Gate C at the     Leppings Laneend of the ground.    He mentioned
                his duties on that day and compared the crowd behaviour with the I988
                semi-final.  He mentioned   the opening ofGate Cseveral times, once on the
                instructions of InspectorWhite.   He described    the gates swaying, a bang
                on the door and tickets being thrown into the turnstile area from inside
                the ground. The Jury questioned him on fans without tickets attempting to
                enter the ground, in comparison to the 1988 semi-final. The Coroner asked
                Beasley about directing the crowd who came in when Gate C opened.         He
                replied,  Had he been asked, he could have."     The Coroner asked why did
                you have to wait to be asked?       He replied, "Basically because I was
                frightened."   He mentioned one fan coming out of       the tunnel onto the
                concourse, who said, "There's going to be another Hysel here."

                Ruth Cobb was a member of Serial 3^, whose duties were coach reception at
                Claywheels Lane.     She described her duties there, checking fans for
                prohibited articles and the condition of the fans, some being happy drunk.
                She mentioned several groups of 7 - 8 fans apparently without tickets
                asking for 'spares'.    She was surprised to see large crowds still making
                their way to the ground at 3.15pm.    The Jury asked what instructions she
                had received regarding ticketless fans.   She replied that she advised fans
                that they would not get into the ground without a ticket.

                Police Sergeant Christopher Watson is a Police horseman with the
                Nottingham Police.    On 15 April 1989 he was working      with the South
                Yorkshire Police horsemen at the Penistone Road North end of the ground.
                Together with other horsemen, he went to the Leppings Lane end, via the
                rear of the South Stand.    He described the scene as chaotic, there being
                approximately 2,000 - 3,000 fans, most of them pushing outside the
                turnstile area.   He mentioned the crowd density and the steps he took to
                assist in relieving the pressure.    He mentioned Gate C opening and this
                relieved pressure almost immediatelely.

                Detective Superintendent Beechey and Detective Chief Inspector Tope of the
                West Midlands Police gave evidence relating to the taped interview under
                P.A.C.E. of Police Officers, in order to introduce this evidence as and
                when required by the Inquest.

          SUBJECT:   SUMMARY OF INQUEST 7-1.91



          The following witnesses were called to give evidence.

          Mark Dawson            Sheffield Wednesday F.C. Supporter
          Anthony Grier          Liverpool F.C. Supporter
          Simon Hughes           Liverpool F.C. Supporter
          Albert Marsh           Steward (Sheffield Wednesday F.C.)
          David Butler           Police Officer (South Yorkshire Police)
          Kevin Smallman         Police Officer (South Yorkshire Police)
          Robert Washington      Police Officer (South Yorkshire Police)

          Mark Dawson had tickets for the South Stand and arrived at 2.30pm with two
          friends who had tickets for the North Stand.    On arrival at the Leppings
          Lane end of the ground, Dawson described fans drinking and carrying cans
          and fans asking for tickets.      He mentioned fans pushing near to the
          turnstiles and Police Officers attempting to prevent this and move them
          back.  When inside the ground, he mentioned seeing fans climbing over the
          perimeter fence from Leppings Lane terraces.

          Anthony Grier, with friends, arrived in Sheffield at 1.30pm, having
          travelled by private car.   They were in possession of match tickets.   He
          mentioned fans drinking outside the ground. Grier and friends entered the
          Leppings Lane end of the ground via the turnstiles at 2.20pm and went into
          Pen 3-  He stated that prior to kick-off he and a friend were standing on
          a barrier, singing.   He described a male, 25/26, fainting nearby as the
          pen became very full. He made his way towards Gate 3 but turned back when
          he saw a large pile of bodies.    He was told to go along the tunnel by a
          Police Officer, but climbed into the West Stand (this was due to him
          thinking he would not be allowed back in to watch the game).

          Simon Hughes, with friends, travelled to Sheffield by private car.    They
          were in possession of match tickets.    They entered the Leppings Lane end
          of the ground at 2.15pm and went into Pen 3.      He mentioned seeing some
          other people he knew climbing onto barriers in that pen, near to the
          centre of Pen 3-   Between 2.40pm and 2.50pm he described moving from that
          position to the rear of the pen, speaking to a friend and returning to the
          centre of the pen, then once again returning to the rear of the pen,
          climbing onto a small wall near the tunnel that extends into the terrace.
          He described the tunnel being packed and being knocked off the wall.    He
          was then lifted into the West Stand.

          Albert Marsh has been a steward for 19 years. For the last six seasons he
          has been Assistant Chief Steward.     On 15 April 1989 he was supervising
          Gates A, B and C at the Leppings Lane end of the ground and the stairs
          leading to the West Stand. He described Gate C opening to eject fans. On
          one occasion 50 - 60 fans entered and on the second occasion the crowd
          surged in, knocking him to the ground.

 SUMMARY OF INQUEST 7.1.91


 David Butler was a member of Serial 14, under Police Sergeant Crawford,
 and was positioned on the concourse near to turnstiles A to G at the
 Leppings Lane end of the ground.   He described the behaviour of the fans
 and the atmosphere changing from good humoured to aggressive. At kick-off
 he went with other Police Officers onto the pitch via the South Stand and
 into Pen 4, where he assisted in removing bodies.         This Officer was
 subjected to severe cross-examination by Mr King (for the families) and
 prior to the conclusion of his evidence, Mr Hale (for Superintendent
 Marshall) asked him if anything stuck out in his mind regarding the fans'
 behaviour.  Police Constable Butler mentioned obscene comments being made
 towards a body of a female whose clothing had become dishevelled and a fan
 standing at the head of a body and refusing to move away.

 Kevin Smallman was a member of Serial 14, under Police Sergeant Crawford,
 and was positioned on the concourse near to turnstiles A to G at the
 Leppings Lane end of the ground.  He described the behaviour of the fans,
 the frustration and aggression shown towards him. He mentioned going onto
 the pitch.   He saw that the entrance to Pen 3 was congested by Police
 Officers and fans assisting in the removal of bodies. He enteredPen 3 by
 climbing over the radial fence from Pen 2.

 Robert Washington was a member of Serial 14, under Police Sergeant
 Crawford, and was positioned on the concourse near to turnstiles A to G of
 the Leppings Lane end of the ground.    He also described the behaviour of
 the fans, the frustration and aggression shown towards him.       He heard
 Inspector White say there was a pitch invasion and went with his serial to
 the South Stand area and saw fans on the pitch.

 On conclusion of today's hearing, Mr King addressed the Coroner requesting
 that Police Constable Butler be re-called to clear up ambiguity relating
 to the female body he referred to in his evidence when cross-examined by
 Mr Hale.   Mr Hale addressed the Coroner, stating that he only followed
 that line of questioning to redress the one-sided picture that Mr King was
 painting by trying to destroy the credibility of      thePolice andshow the
 Liverpool fans to be whiter than white.

     Police Officer he attempted to resuscitate that fan.       This fan was
     Christopher Traynor who died        in the tragedy.      Langley became
     unconscious   and   found he was on the pitch when he recovered
     consciousness.    He is unsure of which pen he was in, however Traynor

            The following witnesses were called to give evidence.

            Stephen Robert Curry          Journalist
            Trevor Higgins                Ex Police Sergeant (South Yorkshire Police)
            Paul Anthony James Eason      Station Officer (Ambulance Services)
            Peter Wells                   Divisional Superintendent
                                          (St. John's Ambulance)

            Stephen Curry is a Journalist for the Daily Express.  He arrived at the
            ground at 2.10pm and made his way to the press box which is situated in
            the upper section of the South Stand, above theplayers’ tunnel,
            arriving at 2.25pm.   He described the conditions in the Leppings Lane
            terraces from 2.45pm onwards, when he became concerned due to the
            developing situation in Pen 3.

            Ex Police Sergeant Trevor Higgins was a member of Serial 14 at the 1988
            semi-final and was positioned on   the concourse area    behind the West
            Stand.   He mentioned that he closed the gates at the entrance to the
            tunnel after receiving a command, the source of which he was unable to
            recollect.  It is now 34 months since that semi-final and as such under
            cross-examination his evidence was tested and he was unable to
            differentiate between his actions at league matches and semi-finals.

            Paul Anthony James Eason, a Station Officer with S.Y.M.A.S., arrived at
            the ground at 2.10pm and took up a position on the perimeter track at
            the corner of the North Stand and the Spion Kop.           He noticed a
            disturbance at the Leppings Lane end of the ground just before 3.05pm
            and together with other ambulancemen he went to that area of the ground.
            He described the situation in that area and the action his Officers took
            in dealing with casualties.

            Peter Wells was a Divisional Superintendent with the St. John's
            Ambulance and was in charge of the St. John's Ambulance personnel at the
            ground on 15 April 1989•    He mentioned that these first aiders were in
            position at all four    corners of the    ground at 2.15pm.He mentionedthat
            whilst visiting his personnel, he spoke to two female    fans in Pen 4 of
            the Leppings Lane end of the ground at about 2.45pm. He saw nothing to
            cause him concern.    He mentioned that at around the time the players
            came onto the pitch, he observed what he initially thought to be a pitch
            invasion at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.     He described how he
            and his    personnel became involved in the rescue operation and
            administered first aid to injured fans.

            conditions within the tunnel and Pen 3.     He mentioned assisting fans to
            climb into the West Stand and seeing fans attempting to climb over the
            perimeter fence and Police Officers preventing them.      He described the
            condition of one fan being assisted from the pen by Police Officers.     In
            the 1988 semi-final he mentioned six to seven Police Officers preventing

Q. Mr. Devonside, that is the only question I am going
   to ask you about matters of fact. I would like to
   just take this^opportunity to do something else. I %
   think you and Mr. Hicks together have taken a leading
   part in organising the relatives of the people who
   died at the match, is that right? - A. Yes, that is
   correct.
Q. What has your position been? - A. I have just
   recently resigned my position as secretary of the
   Group for personal reasons but X was secretary and I
   was the elected spokesman of the Group. I shared
   that position of spokesman along with Trevor.
Q. Mr. Devonside, I would like to take this opportunity
    to say that for all of us who have sat through this
    Inquest the common factor which has been obvious to
    us all in the relatives and friends who have given
    evidence, and also the people who have attended the
    Inquest, for all of whom it must have been a very
    painful and continuing very painful experience, the
  r words that come to mind are courage and dignity. 1
    would like to say that to you in your capacity which
    you have just described. - A. Thank you.

Q. And also to say that the grief which you have
   suffered is shared by all who have sat through this
   Inquest. - A. Thank you.
Q.        THE CORONERs   Mr. Devonside, I am most grateful
     to you. I think Mr. Payne expressed it very much
     better than I could have done. I think that was very
     nicely put, if I may say so, Mr. Payne, and I am sure
     I would like to have thought I could have done it as
     well. - A. May I just have the opportunity of just
     saying one thing please? I do not say this with any
     criticism in any quarter in any way. I would like to
     think that people within Sheffield, specifically
     yourself, sir, once the Inquests are over, will try
     and put a report together of some kind and
     investigate the incidents that happened in and around
     the gymnasium and the effect that it had on people in
     the way that they were treated on that evening. If
     society is to learn from such a disaster we need to
     get together on this and I would like to think that
     you and other people would grasp that opportunity.

            the perimeter track towards Pen 2.

            Jamie Lee Case's evidence in chief was similar to the witnesses Sephton and
            Singleton and described the conditions in Pen 3 and the circumstances of how
            they exited from that pen.

               The following witness gave evidence at the Inquest.

               David Malcolm Bownes              Chief Licensing Officer (Sheffield City Council)

               David Malcolm Bownes continued giving his evidence in chief to the
               Coroner as to hisduties and his knowledge of the procedure    adopted in
               the collation and   preparation of information relevant tothe issuing of
               Safety Certificates in respect of sports grounds.

               He was cross-examined by all the Counsels.    He mentioned the agencies
               who formed part of the working party were the Police, Fire Service,
               Health and Consumer Services, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and the
               Building Surveyors Department of Sheffield City Council. When Sheffield
               City Council took over as issuing authority no review of the certificate
               was made and no     amendment was made to the certificatewhen part of
               barrier 144 was removed or the radial fence installed. Between 1986 and
               1989 there were only two draft proposals raised regarding the Safety
               Certificate, these related to amendments to the terminology of the
               certificate not the actual conditions.     He stated that he was not a
               competent person     to comment on safe capacities in pens or the use of
               Police   or   Stewards    to  monitor   pens  regarding   over-crowding.

          lives, but further back fans appeared alright.    He mentioned seeing fans
          five to six rows back climbing over the bodies of those in front.       He
          assisted a young lad with a broken arm from the pen. When the pen cleared

                SUBJECT:   SUMMARY OF INQUEST 16.1.91



                The following witnesses gave evidence at the Inquest.

                Superintendent Roger Marshall    Police Officer (South Yorkshire Police)
                Trevor Hicks                      Liverpool Supporter
                Paul Hand                         Liverpool Supporter
                Shaun Michael Fortune             Liverpool Supporter
                Jeffrey Rex                       Liverpool Supporter

                Superintendent   Marshall   continued    giving   evidence  under   cross-
                examination by Mr Isaacs, for Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.         He
                asked   questions    relating   to    crowd    behaviour,  C.C.T.V.    and
                communications with Ground Control.     Mr Hale asked questions relating
                to Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations, behaviour of fans, using
                barriers and cordons and mounted Officers to control and direct crowds
                and their effect.   The Coroner concluded by asking questions relating
                to crowd figures and the effect delaying kick-off would have on fans
                outside.

                Trevor Hicks, with his wife Jennifer and daughters Victoria and Sarah,
                travelled to Sheffield by private motor car, arriving at 1.40pm. They
                were in possession of match tickets.    Victoria and Sarah died in the
                tragedy.  They entered the Leppings Lane end of the ground at 1.50pm.
                Trevor, Victoria and Sarah went through the tunnel into Pen 3-
                Jennifer went into the North Stand.     He then went into Pen 1.     He
                described the conditions as they developed in Pen 3 and the fans
                becoming distressed and agitated. He mentioned his attempts to attract
                the attention of two Police Officers who were on the steps leading to
                the Ground Control box at separate times, without success.           He
                described going onto the pitch via Gate 1 and finding the bodies of his
                two daughters and the medical assistance given to them. He positively
                identified the first Police Officer he saw as Superintendent Greenwood.
                He was able to make this identification after seeing that Officer in
                the corridor outside the chamber being used by the Lord Justice Taylor
                Inquiry on 30 May 1989*

                Mr Isaacs addressed the Coroner in the absence of the Jury as to the
                Coroner's loss of control over witnesses in relation to restricting
                them to what they saw and heard and not what they thought and their
                opinions. The Coroner accepted these comments.

                Paul Hand travelled to Sheffield by private motor car,, arriving at 12
                noon.   After visiting licensed premises, he went to the Leppings Lane
                end of the ground, arriving at 1.15pm. He entered the ground through a
                turnstile and went through the tunnel into Pen 3-      He described the
                conditions in the pen as they deteriorated.    He mentioned seeing two
                girls in front of him. One was supporting the other, who had fainted.
                After a massive surge, he lost sight of the two girls.      These girls
                were Victoria and Sarah Hicks who died in the tragedy.

    SUMMARY OF INQUEST 16.1.91



    Shaun Fortune travelled to Sheffield from Bristol by coach, arriving at
    1.30pm.  He attended immediately at the ground, which he entered by the
    turnstile at the Leppings Lane end of the ground, at 1.35pm. He went
    through the tunnel and into Pen 3- He described the conditions in that
    pen as they deteriorated.   He mentioned seeing two girls in front of
    him, one in a distressed condition.   After an almighty surge, he lost
    sight of the two girls. These girls were Victoria and Sarah Hicks.

    Jeffrey Rex travelled to Sheffield from Bristol by coach, the same
    coach as Shaun Fortune.      His evidence was virtually identical to
    Fortune's in every respect, including identifying the Hicks' girls.

    It was noticable that the evidence of Hand, Fortune and Rex progressed
    rapidly, taking forty minutes to complete. The hearing, which normally
    concludes around 4.00pm, over-ran to 5*20pm.      Fortune and Rex had
    travelled from Bristol in one vehicle and the Coroner allowed them both
    to give evidence in order that they could both return to Bristol
    together, eliminating transport difficulties.

    Mr Manning, for Superintendent Murray, addressed the Coroner.        He
    advised the Coroner that he felt from 4.00pm justice had not been done,
    he felt under pressure not to ask questions.

                 SUBJECT:    SUMMARY OF INQUEST 1 1 . 1 . 9 1




                 The hearing today was taken up with legal submissions relating to the
                 introduction of Superintendent Marshall's voluntary statement and the
                 discharge of the Jury.    The interpretation of Rule 37 of the Coroners
                 Act was discussed, the direction the Jury should be given in disregard
                 to the contents of the voluntary statement.

                  It was decided by the Coroner that he would not discharge the Jury, but
                  would direct the Jury to totally ignore everything that took place
                  during Thursday's hearings.   He would treat the senior Officers as he
                  did all the other witnesses and the PACE statements and tapes would not
                  be read or heard.    The Coroner addressed the Jury, advising them to
                  totally forget all the evidence given yesterday relating to what was
                  read, shown or what they saw.    They should ignore entirely from their
                  eventual consideration what was said by Superintendent Marshall.

                  What Mr King has done is effectively shot himself in the foot as he has
                  now been denied access to the PACE statements and videos.

            SUBJECT:      SUMMARY OF INQUEST 10.1.91

             The following witness was called to give evidence.

             Superintendent Roger Marshall      Police Officer (South Yorkshire Police)

             Superintendent Marshall was called and advised by the Coroner of his
             rights under Section 22 of the Coroners Act.   Deputy Chief Constable
             Jones read out Superintendent Marshall's recollection and voluntary
             statement.    The video showing his interview by Officers from West
             Midlands Police was shown.

             At the conclusion of the hearing on Tuesday 8 January 1991, in the
             absence of the Jury, the court discussed the introduction of PACE
             statements.   The decision to introduce the statements without editing
             was accepted by all parties.   Please see copy of attached transcript
             relating to this matter.

             After the lunch recess, Mr King addressed the Coroner wishing to bring
             to   his  notice   his  objection   to   the   voluntary   statement  of
             Superintendent Marshall, parts of which were prejudicial to his
             clients' case, the discharge of the Jury because of that fact and the
             fact that the transcript of Superintendent Marshall's evidence at the
             Taylor Inquiry should be read out to the Inquest.    The Coroner replied
             that having read the statements he did not exclude them because Mr King
             may say that we have missed something or supressed something.     He did
             not intend to discharge the Jury, but should Mr King decide on a
             judicial review over this matter, an early hearing rather than at the
             end would save time and money should a re-trial be necessary.         It
             should be noted that the remainder of the Counsels did not support his
             request for the Jury to be discharged.     Mr Hale informed the Coroner
             that he had no objection to the Taylor transcript being read out at the
             Inquest.

             On Friday 11 January      1991,   there   will   be   legal    submissions   in the
             absence of the Jury.

            SUBJECT:     SUMMARY OF INQUEST 1 9 . 2 . 9 1



            The following witnesses were called to give evidence.

            Graham Henry Mackrell              Club Secretary (Sheffield Wednesday F.C.)
            Douglas John Lock                  Security Officer (Sheffield Wednesday F.C.)

            Graham Mackrell was re-called and concluded his evidence under cross-
            examination.   His evidence included facilities for segregation on the
            Spion Kop, media attention on Mr Clough and the fact that the club
            viewed the Leppings Lane terraces globally rather than as pens.

            Douglas Lock was a Superintendent in the South Yorkshire Police between
            1982 and 1985, when he retired.       During that time he attended at
            football matches played at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and was in
            charge of Ground Control.    He described the method used when planning
            the policing requirement of football matches. He stated that it was the
            responsibility of the Police to monitor crowd density in the pens, the
            manning of gates, the filling of the pens, the blocking of the tunnel
            and the delaying of kick-off.     On retirement he took up the post of
            Security Officer at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. He mentioned the
            training given to Stewards, the liaison he had with Chief Superintendent
            Mole and the delaying of the kick-off before the 1987 semi-final.     He
            described that except for noticing that the Nottingham Forest fans were
            entering quicker than the Liverpool fans, he saw nothing that caused him
            concern.   He described the situation as it developed after he became
            aware that Gate C had been opened.

            The Coroner has decided that he will not be calling Mr Philips to give
            evidence.

            SUBJECT:      SUMMARY OF INQUEST 20.2.91


            The following witnesses were called to give evidence.

            Douglas John Lock             Security Officer
            Christopher Nicholson         Statistician

            Douglas Lock was re-called and concluded his evidence under cross-
            examination. His evidence included the duties of Ground Control and the
            compassion of what he expected from the Supervisory Officers and what
            was written in the Match Operation Order.   He also mentioned the design
            of the Police Control Box, crowd capacity, overcrowding in the pens and
            the view of the radial fence and gates when the pens were full.

            Doctor Christopher Nicholson has analysed videos and photographs in
            order to estimate numbers of fans entering the ground through Gate C,
            turnstiles A - G, numbers of fans in pens 3 and 4, the breaking of
            barrier 124A and the testing procedure on barriers.     The maximum total
            figure to enter through Gate C was 2,480 and the maximum total figure to
            enter through turnstiles A - G was 7,644     -   which gave a grand total
            of 10,124.   He also prepared a graph to show crowd flow figures through
            the turnstiles and Gate C. He selected the two best photographs of Pens
            3 and 4. He then prepared an estimated figure from a head count of fans
            in Pen 3, which was 1,576. He suggested that a similar figure should be
            considered for Pen 4.    An   estimate of the crowd density showed       that it
            was almost 50% over the figure given in the Green Guide.

            The Jury will be visiting Sheffield Wednesday Football Club next Monday
            or Tuesday in order to orientate themselves with the locations given by
            previous witnesses and to be shown the layout of the Police Control
            Room.

                 The following witnesses were called to give evidence.

                 Christopher Nicholson                     Statistician
                 Wilfred Eastwood                          Engineer

                 Doctor Nicholson was re-called and concluded his evidence under cross-
                 examination.   His evidence included the comparison of the examination of
                 barrier 128 with barrier 124A and the part corrosion played in the collapse
                 of barrier 124A.     His theory of the leaning crowd was questioned in
                 comparison to a dynamic crowd, as was the exercise in crowd density which
                 was carried out under laboratory conditions.

                 Doctor Wilfred Eastwood is a senior partner in the firm of Eastwood
                 Engineers. He was appointed in 1978 by Sheffield Wednesday Football Club as
                 Consultant Engineer.   He described his duties in an advisory capacity in
                 assisting Sheffield Wednesday Football Club preparing the stadium when it
                 became a designated ground and required a Safety Certificate. He mentioned
                 calculating capacities for sections of the ground and the upgrading to Grade
                 A of all barriers.      He referred to plans he had drawn up relocating
                 turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end of the ground to provide dedicated
                 entrances,to individual pens. This scheme was approved by the Working Party
                 but was not implemented due to the fire at Bradford Football Club.       The
                 resources set aside for this venture were re-directed to fire-proofing the
                 South Stand.   He mentioned that he viewed the Leppings Lane terrace as one
                 unit.   From correspondence he received, which referred to the pens being
                 under the control of the Police, he interpreted this to mean that a Police
                 Officer would be at or near the radial gates on match day.

                SUBJECT:        SUMMARY OF INQUEST 26.2.91


                The following witnesses were called to give evidence.

                Christopher Nicholson                              Statistician
                Wilfred Eastwood                                   Engineer

                During this morning the Jury paid a visit to the Sheffield Wednesday Football
                Ground.

                Doctor Nicholson was re-called to clarify why he     used certain photographs
                when he was estimating the crowd figures in Pens 3 and 4.     His explanation
                was that he used only the photograph where he could easily count frontal
                facing faces, the angle of other photographs meant he was unable toidentify
                a head, which would have resulted in a lesser degree of accuracy.

                Doctor Eastwood was re-called and concluded his evidence under cross-
                examination.     His evidence included theremoval of        barrier 144, the
                introduction of radial fences for segregation purposes and the release
                mechanism of the gates in the perimeter fences. The Jury asked the following
                questions:    Q.    Does barrier have specified life span and automatically
                condemned after a period of time? A. No life span as long as continues to
                satisfy and passes load test of 5 KN. Q. Safe method to repair wrought iron
                with low carbon steel?    A.   Perfectly legitimate.  No question of marrying
                mild steel playing any part in collapse of barrier.     Q.   Longest period of
                time allowed before random test? A. 5 years. Not allowed to test before 4J
                years, changed to 4 years in 1986, also 5 years cycle to 4 years between
                tests. Q.    Gradient of tunnel always been?    A.   Front part of tunnel wall
                completely rebuilt 1965- Concrete floor renewed 1965-

                The Coroner stated his intentions not to call Police Constable Smith, but to
                read his recollections under Rule 37-

               SUBJECT:     SUMMARY OF INQUEST 28.2.91



               The following witness was called to give evidence.

                Brian Leonard Mole            Chief Superintendent (South Yorkshire Police)

                Chief Superintendent Brian Mole was Divisional Commander of 'F' Division
                until March 1 9 8 9 , when he was transferred to 'B' Division, Barnsley. In his
                evidence in chief he described the working relationship he had with
                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club,          the command  structure at   football
                matches, the specific duties of senior officers and the confidence he had in
                their abilities.        He made reference to the system of raising manpower for
                football matches and the reason for reducing the manpower for the 1989 semi­
                final.         He described the preparation for the semi-finals held at
                Hillsborough in 1 9 8 7 /8 8 , when he was in command.  He mentioned the methods
                used to check for ticketless fans and the problems caused by ticket touts.
                He refuted the fact that any filtering or barriers were in position in the
                1 9 8 8 /8 9 semi-finals to check for ticketless fans. He described the initial
                use of radial fences to segregate fans of opposing teams and the way he
                perceived the radial gates would be controlled by the Police. He described
                the criteria for delaying kick-off and the effect this would have on fans
                already within the stadium, the teams and the implications this would have
                with public transport timetables after the game.

                 Brian Leonard Mole                            Chief Superintendent (South Yorkshire Police)

                 Chief Superintendent Brian Mole was re-called and continued his evidence
                 under cross-examination.    His evidence included crowd distributions, fans
                 finding own level on the Leppings Lane terraces when there is a capacity
                 crowd,   the  ineffectiveness   of Police Officers and/or Stewards when
                 positioned in full pens, the closing of the tunnel gates to control ingress
                 and the segregation of fans.    He explained the reasoning behind the change
                 in roles of Superintendents Greenwood and Marshall and the capabilities of
                 those Officers, the type of activity which the staff of the Police Control
                 Room would be involved in and the difficulties a breakdown in radio
                 communications would cause for the Ground Commander.       He described the
                 responsibilities of the Stewards, their briefing and duties.    He mentioned
                 the circumstances which would cause him to consider delaying the kick-off.

             mentioned the problems with radio communications when used in the talk-
             through mode.   He mentioned that disparity in crowd density is itself not a
             problem as the central pens being the most popular attract certain fans who
             will put up with a certain amount of discomfort to obtain the best view.

             he took charge of the rescue operation.    He mentioned the fact that he
             was the    subject of verbal abuse from fans and the hinderance       he
             experienced from the media during the rescue. During his evidence in
             chief and cross-examination he was advised regarding certain questions
             where he could exercise his privilege under Rule 22.      He declined to

            The following witness was called to give evidence.

             David Godfrey Duckenfield       Ch/Superintendent (South Yorkshire Police)

             Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was re-called and concluded his evidence
             under cross-examination.   He was asked questions relating to the time
             scale between the request to open the gates by Superintendent Marshall
             and the time taken for permission to be granted and the effect the
             opening of the gate had.    He described his view of the Leppings Lane
             terraces from the Control Box, the density of the central pens and the
             disparity between those pens and the outer pens.        He mentioned the
             conversations and thoughts he had when considering delaying the kick-off.

SUMMARY OF INQUEST 14.3.91


Police Constable John Martin Maughan was on the playing area at 4 minutes
past 3, when he saw Michael David Kelly lying near to the goal at the
Leppings Lane end of the ground.        Maughan began giving artificial
respiration to Kelly, who appeared not to be breathing.       After a few
minutes Kelly started to breath unaided but slipped into unconsciousness.
He assisted conveying Kelly across the pitch on a hoarding and left him
with ambulancemen near to the Spion Kop.

Police Sergeant Michael Goddard was on duty in the Police Control Box
situated between the South Stand and the Leppings Lane terraces.       He
described conditions within the Control Box.    He mentioned the Officers
present and their duties.   He described the problems the breakdown with
radio communications caused and the disruption to the members of the
Control Box.   He mentioned the requests by Superintendent Marshall for
the gates at the Leppings Lane end to be opened and the response by the
Senior Officers.  He described the developing situation as fans began to
climb over the perimeter fences and the action taken by Police Officers
to stop the game and commence the rescue operation.

            The following witnesses were called to give evidence.

            Dr. David Slater                     Pathologist
            Trevor Bichard                       Police Officer (South Yorkshire Police)

            Doctor David Slater carried out the Post-Mortem on Nicholas Joynes,
            Joseph Daniel McCarthy and Philip Hammond. During the resumed inquest in
            April/May 1990, he gave evidence in respect of their Post-Mortems but
            omitted to give the cause of death in respect of Joynes and McCarthy. In
            respect of Hammond, he was asked questions regarding a fracture to one of
            his ribs.   He stated that the injury was probably as a result of focal
            blunt pressure, but was unable to say what the actual cause of the injury
            was.

            Police Constable Trevor Bichard was re-called and concluded his evidence
            under cross-examination.    He was questioned as to his use of zoom
            facilities on the C.C.T.V. He described the panning of the C.C.T.V. when
            Gates C and A were opened.    Part of the compilation tape was shown to
            illustrate this function.

            The recollections of Police Constable 1285 Smith were read out to the
            court by the Coroner. Police Constable Smith has not been called due to
            ill health.

            The B.B.C. compilation video was shown, covering the time period between
            1452 and 1515-

            The Coroner introduced the following as documentary evidence;                  the

            The Coroner began addressing the jury under Rule 41 of the Coroner's Act.
            He quoted certain stated cases and advised the jury that their role was
            one of fact finding, not fault finding.     He described the verdicts they
            could reach, i.e. Unlawful Killing, Accidental/Misadventure and Open
            Verdict, and the different standards of proof each verdict required.    He
            outlined the various documents and video tapes he would be supplying the
            jury with to assist them in reaching a decision.

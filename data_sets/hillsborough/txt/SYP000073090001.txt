W he n we got off the            coach,                   de ci de d to stop with me and my son,

                                         GMrT
We met         up at the m o ut h of the tunnel               and star te d to walk          down y t .      I

d i d n ’t see a ny P o l i c e m e n    near        the tunnel a rea        nor did I see/any

stewards.          When we got         to the        end of the tunnel we went             t</ the   right.

We    p o s it i on e d o ur selves     in front of a barrier about                  eigbft feet      from

the      pitch perimeter         fencing and three feet               from the sectional             fencing

to our         right.     We were      very    comfortable         in our     posit/ons      until a bout

2.5 0     pm    (1450 hrs).       At    this       time there was a surge/of              people towards

us.       I was    t urned to my        right,       facing     the   clock    in' the    corner     of the

ground.          I c o u l d n ’t t hen move.         I    never   saw tliifpitch        a g a i n till about

3. 2 0    pm    (1520 hrs).       W hilst      I     was in thi_s_cr/sh I was            m o ve d forward

and      pinned a ga in s t     the    section fencing           I faflt t ightness        in my     chest

and                was    c om pl ai ni ng    of abdominal         pains.



T here were P o l i c e m e n on the track behind the goals and                           I could hear
                                                                                                 P AG E     3

people     shouting and        pleading with them to open the gates                        The

Policemen        ignored them.



As    I said I c o u l d n ’t move,         I was    fac     \ the next      pen which was       fairly

empty.      M any of the fans          in^thj,       T w e r e ^ e l pint| fans jjcj the   pej^was

in,     to climb over.         All                   u s , me    , my son and                all    got

lifted over the fen                        We got over and both me                   ,y son had     chest

injuries and                   said her          stomach was      very pa
            &


We got     out of this        pen,    thro ug h a gate          onto the    pitch.    This was      the

first     time    I realised that           something was         very wrong.        I saw a man

lying     on the     pitch,    his    trousers were          round his shoes and he was

o b v i o u s l y dead.    This was        very upsetting         to us all,    so we made       our way

to a caravan w it h i n the ground where we were                       given a cup of tea.           We

left     the ground about          4.30     pm    (1630 hrs)      an d were driven back          to our

coach by a P o l i c e m a n    in a Police           car.

These are my observ at io ns               on the day;



Wh en    I got out onto        the    pitch there were one or two P o li c e m e n helping

fans and getting stuck               in.     There were others,            trying to put fans        back

into the      pens    I had    left but          theyg'reatest m a jo ri ty jyf/ the Policemen,

I ’m a fr a id to say,        were    do i ng ynothi n g .       There wa* a line of P o l ic em en

a£ross     the    pitch,    just     stan/ing       there,      I ’m sure they could have          been

put to better         use behind the goals.

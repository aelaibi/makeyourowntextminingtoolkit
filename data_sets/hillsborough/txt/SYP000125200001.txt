 GETTING CRUSHED FROM THEN ON IT JUST GOT WORSE.         AT ABOUT 1445 (1445) 1450

 (1450) I THOUGHT THAT I HAD TO GET OUT OF Ti^E PEN BECAUSE I WAS BEING

 CRUSHED.    I HAD BEEN SEPARATED FROM            P O M A D E MY WAY TO THE FENCE

 BETWEEN PEN 3 & 2.     IT TOOK ME ABOUT 10 MINUTES TO\GET TO THE FENCE.       THERE

 WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE GETTING OVER THE FENCE.       I CLIMB&^OV^R THE FENCE INTO

 PEN 2 AND I WAS SURPRISED JUST HOW MUCH SPACE I HAD COMPARED TO WHAT I HAD IN

 PEN 3.     I LOOKED BACK INTO PEN 2 AND I COULD SEE PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER THE

 FRONT FENCE ONTO THE PITCH.    AT THIS STAGE I DID NOT KNOW ANYONE WAS

 INJURED.     I DID NOT KNOW THAT ANYONE HAD BEEN INJURED UNTIL THE GAME HAD BEEN

        <4
  STOPPED.       I THOUGHT THERE HAD BEEN A PITCH INVASION.   AFTER THE GAME HAD BEEN

  STOPPED I COULD SEE THAT THERE WERE INJURED PEOPLE ON THE PITCH LYING IN THE

  GOAL MOUTH.       AT ABOUT 15.20 HRS (1520) I DID SEE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE LYING

  ON THE PITCH IN JUST THEIR UNDERPANTS THEY LOOKED VERY BLUE AND WERE

  NOT MOVING.       I THOUGHT THAT THEY LOOKED DEAD.

 051

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER A STEWARD, A LOUD

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 I LEFT BECAUSE OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT SAID KEEP YOUR TICKETS AND LEAVE THE

 GROUND.

 052

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.




 053

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS Sl'QPPED?

 I THINK THAT THE POLICE OFFICERS THAT WERE ACROSS THE CENTRE OF THE PITCH

 COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER EMPLOYED HELPING AT THE LEPPINGS LANE END.    THERE

 WERE POLICE OFFICERS OUTSIDE PEN 2 THEY OPENED THE GATE ON TO THE PITCH

BUT DID NOT SEEM TO HELP THE TS^NS IN THE CENTRAL PENS.

 THERE WERE ALSO A LOT OF POLICE OFFICERS ALONG THE SIDES OF THE GROUND.

 T ^ Y ALSO COULD HAVE HELPED AT PENS 3 & 47
 THEY                                                      ^

 AFTER LEAVING THE GROUND THERE WAS NO INFORMATION FORTHCOMING FROM POLICE

 OFFICERS OUTSIDE THE GROUND WHEN ASKED ALL THEY SAID WAS MOVE ON.

 THERE WAS NO ORGANISATION OUTSIDE THE GROUND FOR THE FANS LEAVING.

 NO ONE ON THE GROUND WAS INFORMED OVER THE LOUDSPEAKER SYSTEM ABOUT WHAT WAS

 HAPPENING.

 054

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I THINK THAT LIVERPOOL FANS SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE OTHER END OF THE
                                                                            PAGE    9

 GROUND.   THE KICK OFF SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED AND THE FANS OUTSIDE INFORMED.

 THE POLICE OUTSIDE THE GROUND BEFORE THE GAME WERE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT

 STOPPING FANS COMING TOGETHER TO FIGHT.   RATHER THAN ENSURING THAT THEY

 ALL WENT STRAIGHT TO THE GROUND.

 THERE SHOULD BE SIGNS SAYING THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET AROUND THE OUTSIDE AND

 NOT HAVE TO GO DOWN THE TUNNEL.     THERE SHOULD NOT BE FENCES DIVIDING UP THE

 TERRACE INTO SMALL SECTIONS.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD W H ^ H YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?                      /

 OVERALL THE MATCH APPEARED BADLY ORGANISED.   I FEEL THAT LIVERPOOL SHOULD HAVE

 BEEN GIVEN THE KOP END, AS THEY HAD A LOT MORE SUPPORTERS.    THERE WAS A LACK

 OF INFORMATION OVER THE TANNOY AS TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING.     IF THE TANNOY HAD

 BEEN BETTER USED, THEN THE jtRWD MIGHT HAVE MOVED OUT OF THE PENS A LOT

 QUICKER.                   ^

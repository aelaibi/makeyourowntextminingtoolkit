LETTER FRO M MRS FALLON


I am sure that Private Office will send you and Mr Edmundson the attached letter
which the Home Secretary has had from Mrs Julie Fallon. She is the sister of Andrew
Sefton, a Hillsborough victim.

2.      She has sent a copy to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. The copy has a sticker
which reads ‘fo r the personal attention o f Lord Justice Stuart-Smith - and I would like
his responses to the questions I have raised with the Home Secretary at the earliest
possible time

3.      The letter is gratuitously offensive about Sir Murray personally and I am very
reluctant to show it to him. I do not think that there is anything to be gained by his
either seeing it or answering it. Whatever merits Mrs Fallon’s points 1 to 7 may
have, they are not matters for the Scrutiny.

4.      The only part of Mrs Fallon’s letter which seems to me to come within Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith’s purview is at the bottom of page 1 and top of page 2, where she
claims that he has only a ‘vague ... interpretation’ of his terms of reference.

5.       Mrs Fallon had a private meeting with the Judge in Liverpool along with her
mother, Mrs Sefton, and other members of the family. You may wish to see the part
of the transcript of the discussion which bears on this. I think we spelled out the
position quite clearly. I do not think that our responding to this further personal
attack on the Judge would be of any use to the Scrutiny, the Home Secretary, or Mrs
Fallon.

6.     We have had some more dealings with the Sefton family since the meeting in
Liverpool. Julie’s husband, Leo Fallon, gave the Judge a letter during our meeting in
which he demanded to see a copy of the police video of the temporary mortuary in the
gymnasium at the football ground. That is not in our gift, and after discussing his
request with the police I wrote to him to say so. He responded with a furious phone
message in which he ordered me (not too strong a word) to account for myself straight
away.




C:\HILLSB0R\MAIN\FALL0N.231
7.     I did not do this, since I had by then had long telephone conversations with
both Julie Fallon and Mrs Sefton. There was then some correspondence with Mrs
Sefton about the video and other issues.

8.      I attach copies of the most recent exchange to give you a flavour. We have
not been ignoring the Seftons/Fallons. I propose to respond to the latest letter as
attached, without showing it to the Judge. I am sure however that Mrs Fallon will
have some criticism of me if it should emerge - or if she deduces from my letter (quite
likely) - that the Judge has not seen it.

9.   I should be grateful for your advice. I would also be interested to see the
Home Office’s, or Home Secretary’s, response to Mrs Fallon’s letter.

Mrs Julie Fallon




Thank you for sending Lord Justice Stuart-Smith a copy of your recent letter to the
Home Secretary.


We discussed the terms of reference for Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny during
the meeting which we had with you in Liverpool, and I do not think we can add
anything to what we said then.   The other points which you raise in your letter are
not for Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to comment upon.




C F BONE
Secretary to the Scrutiny




G:\HILLSB0R\MAIN\FALL0N.231
Dear Home Secretary,

I sincerely hope that you take the time to read and digest the contents o f this letter, as I
do not write it easily. My brother, Andrew Sefton, was killed at the Hillsborough
football disaster in 1989 and I am proud to say that I am a member o f the Hillsborough
Family Support Group and continue to fully participate in our group’s campaign.

On a personal level however, I have reached a point where I feel the need not only to
direct a series o f observations and questions towards you, but furthermore, demand
that discussion around these areas takes place, by those that are elected and paid to
serve us.

I will not dwell on the reservations that I have with regards to your choice o f judge in
the present unprecedented scrutiny, for Lord Justice Stuart Smith’s crassness,
insensitivity, lack o f personal contact with real people, his lack o f understanding about
the case, and the inevitable questions that they raise both about his capacity to conduct
the scrutiny, and the reasons for your choice o f him, are self-evident to the nation as a
whole - rather I will simply direct my concerns, thoughts and questions to you Mr.
Straw, for you are the new Home Secretary with all the power, responsibility, high
profile and accountability that that position entails.

My concerns fall into two categories. The first are specific to Hillsborough and its
victims and the second are areas o f concern highlighted by the disaster, but with wider
relevance to every member o f the public. Furthermore I would urge you to remember
that your response to this letter, these issues and most notably Lord Justice Stuart
Smith’s recommendations will send not only a message to the country about your
willingness to deal effectively with what I believe to be criminal acts specific to
Hillsborough, but also with the laws, procedures and attitudes currently in operation
that allowed these acts to remain unchecked, and in some cases, seemingly rewarded.

Firstly then, having met personally with Lord Justice Stuart Smith and heard and
experienced his interpretation of the terms o f reference for the scrutiny - 1 feel
confident in saying that the terms o f reference are on the one hand so tight as to be
practically unworkable, demanding o f us as they do, the production o f new evidence
that has never been available to the police and/or the coroner, and yet completely
ignoring the fact that after 8 V2 years there is still evidence that no one outside these
two agencies has ever been given access to. Yet ironically, on the other hand, the
terms of reference and Lord Justice Stuart Smith’s interpretation of them are, I feel
exceedingly vague, claiming to want ‘to be advised o f anything that is deemed to be in
the public interest’, and yet when personally questioned on his understanding and
interpretations of this, Lord Justice Stuart Smith was unable to give my family a
response, and indeed I would go so far as assuming based on my experience o f the man
that in his final recommendation, his interpretation o f the term “in the public interest”,
will bear no resemblance to my families informed interpretation o f the term!
Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly obvious that these terms o f reference
completely side-step the real complaints and concerns - they cannot effectively
highlight the issues for which I have campaigned, and I would bet that they are not
what the public believe the Hillsborough victims are getting, for they will neither bring
out the truth about the events before, during and after the disaster, or fully recognise
the urgent need for a full, honest, credible, public enquiry; for it would appear that the
lies, the corruption, the falsification o f evidence, the collusion, the convenient
promotions and retirements, the sickening police compensations, the failures o f the
inquest system and the High Court, the fact that the police have never formally
accepted any responsibility for their actions and the reality that most o f the victims died
after 3.15 p.m. and yet none o f the evidence after this time has ever been openly dealt
with, just happens to fall outside the terms o f reference for this scrutiny, - so what
exactly is it that is being scrutinised?

Having brought to your attention my concerns, specifically regarding the scrutiny, I
will now turn my attention to the questions that I feel are highlighted by Hillsborough -
concerns that need attention, discussion and reform, “in the public interest”.

1.     Why, when in cases like ours, families are deliberately prevented from having
       access to vital evidence, evidence is falsified, hidden or destroyed. As
       vulnerable lay people we are badly advised, misled and pathetically represented,
       bullied, ill informed and legally ground down, and the sheer time scale o f this
       deception means that we are prevented from gaining access to the European
       Judicial system - is there no cause for redress? If you do not examine these
       fundamental injustices, then the message you will be sending is that the Police,
       and the judicial system exist as entities beyond examination, reproach or
       change, think carefully Mr Straw, if this is indeed the message o f the New
       Labour and New Britain then having lived with it as a reality for the last 816
       years, I am sure I can continue to do so, but having voted for massive change -
       can the public?

2.     Why, in a democratic system as sophisticated as ours, are the police still
       allowed to investigate themselves? The internal networks are too incestuous
       and binding to ever allow proper scrutiny - we all know this, it is insulting and
       outrageous, so when will it be addressed?

3.     Why, when in cases where the police have some alleged level o f involvement in
       a crime or in an act o f criminal negligence, are they allowed to monopolise and
       control the crime scene and indeed the access, quality and quantity o f the
       evidence given to the victims who ironically need to build any case against the
       police?
4.   Why are the police officers who have been negligent, incompetent or, as we
     believe in our case, criminal and corrupt, allowed to walk away with their
     professional and personal lives unscathed? I believe Hillsborough was the
     inevitable culmination o f all the powers and attitude bestowed upon our police
     force by the Thatcher government, their actions leading up to Hillsborough,
     during the disaster and since, all clearly show that they believe themselves to be
     invincible, beyond prosecution and even beyond criticism. For 8 V2 years they
     have publicly and privately laughed at my family and now they are laughing at
     you and your office, - so what as Home Secretary are you going to do about it?

5.   Why do we have a coroners system in this country that allows coroners to
     select biased evidence, bury relevant statements, fail to disclose interests, insult,
     bully and blame victims, mislead juries and still remain both employed and
     respected. As a nation we are becoming increasingly aware of the inadequacies
     o f the coroners system, so how much longer are we going to have to live with
     them before you act on our behalf?

6.   Why do we have a state of affairs in Britain that means that the more negligent,
     inept and even criminal, individuals are in a situation the better it is for those
     individuals and organisations involved - for the wider the responsibility net can
     be spread the less chance there is of internal disciplinary charges being brought,
     never mind criminal prosecution. Thus it appears that the message from the
     legal system in this country to all organisations and their employees is one of
     encouragement to negate their humanity and professionalism and if the worst
     happens, the advice is keep denying responsibility and continually blame other
     agencies and individuals, do this for long enough and the victims will simply go
     away. Well, Mr Straw, my family and I will not go away - 1 believe that just
     because the police, Sheffield City Council, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club,
     the engineers who installed the barriers and the Football Association are
     allowed to blame each other for their contribution to the disaster and it’s
     aftermath and walk away unscathed and with an air o f smug untouchability
      does not mean that I am unable to point the finger at the people that I feel to be
     responsible - surely a judicial system as highly developed as ours can adapt to
     counteract this appalling loophole, or is the foundation o f a criminal charge o f
      ‘neglect o f duty’ totally beyond us?

7.   Finally, I would draw your attention to the issue o f ‘Sleaze’; a huge impetus in
     your recent general election success. The nation voted resoundingly in your
     favour because they were sick o f the deception, corruption and the rewards
     that apparently went with this - please remember that the Hillsborough
     campaign presently has a large measure o f public support, simply because
     people can smell the sleaze around Hillsborough, the lies and the injustice stink
     and the majority o f people have realised that people like myself continue
     against unbelievable hurdles specifically because no-one has ever been held
     responsible for their actions, but more broadly because the inept procedures
     and systems that failed our family 8 V2 ago are still in place ready to fail the next
        set o f ‘disaster’ victims. Be assured Mr Straw, until the issues that I have
        outlined in this letter are addressed, regardless o f the findings o f Lord Justice
        Stuart Smith’s scrutiny and regardless o f your response to these findings my
        family and I will continue to fight for our right to justice and police
        accountability and M public disclosure on this matter by whatever means
        remain possible.

Yours sincerely




Julie Fallon

1               the South Yorkshire police?
2         R S . SEFTON:    Because once the investigation started I can
3               imagine, yss, he has to be involved,        he has to take
4               everybody's statements.     He does not have to be physically

 5              there with Professor Usher telling everyone how they good

 6              they were setting up this mortuary.         He had far too much
 7              involvement, sir, far too much and it should have been
 8              taken off him from the beginning.
 9        ORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       That is a complex question as to
10              whether or not he should have handed it over to some other
11              coroner.     The Coroner is bound to be involved from the
12             outset, is he not?
13        [RS. SEFTON:  I feel sure, yes, I feel sure he would be
14              involved.     They would notify him of the fatalities but I
15              will say that there is a statement here by Superintendent
16              Addis who had a 'phone call from Superintendent McKay at
17              twenty-five past three.     Dr. Popper went on at great
18              length saying that people were dead, everyone was dead,
19              those who had died were already spoken for at 3.15, that
20    ,         was it.
21                   Mr.     Addis had a 'phone call from McKay saying that,
22              and it was at twenty-five past three, that there was an
23              incident at Hillsborough Stadium and fatalities may be
24              involved.     He did not receive a 'phone call saying a whole
25              host of people are dead.
26        LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:  Yes.
27        MR. FALLON:   Can I ask just how long you two have be working
28             on this case?
29        LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I started reading the papers in the
 30              second half of July.
 31       MR.    FALLON: This year?
 32       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Yes.
 33       MR.    FALLON: 1997?
 34       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       1997.
 35       MR.    BONE:     About the sametime     for me.
 36       MR.    FALLON: I've got to go     on record to say I'm absolutely


                                                11
     1           staggered, absolutely befuddled that we can get so late on
     2           in the year after you have been working on this case for
     3           so long and so intimately that you go on record as not
     4           even being fully aware of the cases of Andrew Devine and
     5           Tony Bland and that you, sir, didn't even know how Tony
     6          Bland came to die.     I find that staggering.
     7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I did know, at least I think I knew
     8          how Tony Bland came to die but---
     9   MR.    FALLON:    What I am saying to you is that we have to,
10              because of the legal system in this country, we have to
11              put our faith in you and I'm asking just how much faith
12              can we put in you when you are showing of your own
                admission so much ignorance of the facts of the case and
w               yet you're say will have such sway within this country,        it
15              will have implications for the future of the law in this
16              country.    It will have implications for how the families
17              of Hillsborough have to live the rest of their lives.
18       MRS. FALLON:  Not just Hillsborough,      it goes right the way
19            through.
20       SIR.   FALLON:    It has repercussions for every future disaster,
21              this is a massive case, the ramifications of it are beyond
22              understanding and yet you appear to be making —      you
23              appear to be in a position to make a final judgment on
24              this case based on at least partial ignorance and I,
25              therefore, have to go on record to say just how little
26              faith we have in that.
27       JORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I am sorry that you feel that.    I
28              certainly did not know that Andrew Devine was still alive
29              and that he was recovering.     I knew that Bland had died.
30       1R.    FALLON:  Tony Bland.    He was a young man, he had a name,
31              he had a future.
32       JORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I knew that he had died,   I think I
33              knew but I wanted to check up from you, who know much more
34              about him than I do, that the reason why he died was
35              because the support was stopped.    There was a case about
36              it



                                           12
MRS. SEFTON:       Yes, there was, it was an unprecedented thing.
LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            I hope you will accept that I am
        human,    I have had a great deal to read.          I had a month's
        holiday in August,      I started working again in September.
       You think I should not have had a holiday?
MRS. FALLON:       No, what we are saying, we are genuinely not
       trying to get up your nose but what you to have accept is
       that we have had eight and a half years of repeatedly
       putting our case and people going,             "Thank you ever so
       much, right"--
MR.    FALLON:      "How interesting.        Next."
MRS. FALLON:       ---and when you have had eight and a half years
      ^of    that you end up being very, very distrustful of any
       kind of establishment figure whatsoever.             So what we are
       looking for are assurances that you are actually listening
       to us and also before I leave I would actually like to
       know what the possibilities are, what the range of
       possibilities are that you have open to you because
       actually I ’m not aware of what could come out of this.                So
       to some extent here we are again putting our case forward
       and putting--
MR.    FALLON:     Divulging information to you.
MRS. FALLON:         divulging information and I'm not actually
       certain what the potential outcome because as far as I'm
       aware I don't think there has been this kind of situation
       before.     We either have inquiries or we don't have
       inquiries, but a pre-inquiry inquiry all sounds a novelty
       to me.     So I would like to know before we leave what those
       options are.
LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            Can I answer that or try to answer
       it.    Did you come on Monday?
MRS     FALLON:     No, I didn't,      I was working.
LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            Have you seen my terms of
       reference?
MRS. SEFTON:       No, sir.
MRS. FALLON:       No,   I haven't.

               l




     1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          We can provide a copy of the terms.
     2             I tried to explain on Monday what ray terras of reference
     3             are.    They are to look for fresh evidence which might
     4             affect any of the judicial proceedings that have occurred
     5             so far.     By that I mean the outcome of the Lord Taylor's
     6             Inquiry; the verdict at the inquest of accidental death;
     7             the decision of the prosecuting authorities not to
     8             prosecute anybody for any criminal offence and the
     9             decision of the Police Complaints Authority not to pursue
    10             disciplinary proceedings against Mr. Duckenfield and Mr.
    11             Murray.
    12                     Those basically are the terms of reference.    What I
    13             am looking for is evidence•which has not previously been
    14   W         considered by any inquest or tribunal which might affect
    15             those decisions.
    16   MRS. SEFTON:          A scenario you are looking for, sir, if you will
    17             excuse me, is you have 10 people in the gym, right, and 2
    18             vicars or eminent people saying,     "Well, you know what, we
I 19               could not get them to die so what happened was we saw the
I
[   20             South Yorkshire police actually shoot them but that never

: 2i               came up because that was a real cover up", and it has to
    22             be as clear-cut as that, does it?
    23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          No, it does not have to be as.
    24             clear-cut as that.
    25   MRS. SEFTON:          So you will look for new evidence within the old
    26             evidence?
    27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          Of course I will, this is why I am
    28             listening to you and this is why--
    29   MRS. FALLON:          I'm sorry, we d o n ’t want to be aggressive or
    30             antagonistic.     You really, really do have to put yourself
    31             in our position.     We are talking yet again to people with
    32             absolutely no guarantee whatsoever that —       because all our
    33             past experiences lead to the fact that, one, we w o n ’t be
    34             listened to, and, two, anything we produce will be used
    35             against us.
    36   MR.       BONE:     Perhaps I can add a couple things to what Sir


                                                14
         1          Murray has said.     First of all, I think we do understand,
: 2                 we are beginning to understand very clearly, if we didn't
i

■ 3
                    before, the feeling that people in Liverpool have got
1 4                 about this whole, awful business from start to finish.
         5
                         Secondly,   in reading our terras of reference, which I
, 6                 have just given to Mrs. Sefton, you will see that we are
         7          here to make recommendations to the Horae Secretary.          Sir
I 8                 Murray can t just strike down inquest verdicts, or
I 9                 whatever.  His terras of reference d o n ’t allow him to do it
    10              and the law doesn't allow him to do it.
111                      Thirdly, at the end of the terms of reference is a
112                 very wide statement of what we can do.     We are making
    13              recommendations to the Home Secretary,    it says,    "Sir
    14              Murray can recommend, as a result of his Scrutiny, any
i15                 course of action which he thinks might be in the public
    16
                    interest."  That is rather wider than just looking for new
    17              evidence and so on.
18           MRS. SEFTON:    Can you tell me what exactly this extremely
    19             dubious terra "in the public interest" means?
    20       MR.   FALLON:   It's a fascinating---
    21
             MRS. SEFTON:       Sir, we have had it from everybody,    "We can't
    22             let you see this video because it's not in the public
23                 interest."    They did not go before the jury; it wasn't in
24                 the public interest.     Alan Green chose not to prosecute
25                 because it wasn't in the public interest.
26
                        So what is the public interest?  Because this force,
27                 the South Yorkshire force, I say it without any
28                                                                                      e
                   hesitation, has totally - in spite of what Lord Justice
29                 Taylor said - this South Yorkshire force had totally
30                 vindicated itself in the eye of the public.        They have
31                 made themselves invincible.
32           LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     In what way?
13           MRS. SEFTON:    Their attitude is: throw anything you like in,
14                 say anything you want, we will win.     I always remember
15                 Paul Mider, the Police Federation man, telling me that the
16                 person with the longest purse strings will win.       So it


                                               15
     1        doesn't how much evidence we have or how much evidence we
    2         d o n 't h a v e .
    3              Sir, this force has vindicated itself and, more
    4         importantly, it has made itself invincible and when people
    5         are allowed to do that they are a danger.     How many years
    6         on will it be before we have another Hillsborough because
    7         it will happen again because nothing has ever sunk in with
    8         that force, except covering their backsides, hiding
    9         evidence and making sure we go away.
10                 I don't know how long I'm going to live but
11            regardless they will take over.     I have a grandchild,    sir,
12            I would like to be able to say to my grandchild:     If
13            you're ever in any possible trouble please approach a
I             policeman.    Sir, I can't do that, not with what I know.       I
15            cannot do that.     It s not an ideal world but I would like
16            to think that I would be able to take my grandchild aside
17            and say: please respect the law, uphold the law and trust
18            the police.     How can I say it when these policemen have
19            placed themselves above the law and that is what they did.
20            They never thought for one second, sir, that we would ever
21            come back and want to see these statements, these
22            conflicting statements, the false evidence, the nonsense
23            that went on all to cover--
24       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Just a moment, the false evidence,
25            by that you are referring mainly to Dr. Bull, are you?
26       PROFESSOR SCRATON:     Can I just to make a point on this at the
27           moment that might help.      I think, as I made clear in the
28            comments I made on Monday morning,    I think that one of the
29            issues that is problematic relating to the terms of
30            reference is the interpretation of what is constructed as
31            fresh evidence.    What do we mean by fresh evidence?      Is
32           that evidence that has never been previously in the public
33           domain?   Is that evidence that has been taken, put before
34           the inquiries and not used, in other words, selected out
35            for want of a better phrase.
36                 I don't want to rehearse all that again but the

  Thank you for your letter o f 5 November with its enclosed photographs.

 You said when we spoke that you were concerned about why these photographs - which are
 plainly, as you say, stills from the police video o f the temporaiy mortuary - show more than one
  o y.       agree that the pictures seem to contradict what the police have told us about their
 ensuring as far as possible that the pictures they release do not do that.

 The explanation we have had from the police is that this does not apply to stills from the
 temporary mortuary video which form part of a body file on a Hillsborough victim and which
 they release under the terms o f the Coroners Rules to a relative of that person or to

                 The m aj o r i t y      of the       people        passing me          enroute      to the gro u n d were

                 Li verpool       fans,        although        it was a p p a r e n t        that    some were       under        the

                 A    large    p r o p o r t i o n of      fans were          carrying       cans    of beer / l a g e r     and were

               possession         of ^ny        such     items.

               Whilst      the    crowds were making                 their way        to the        stad i u m a number           of

               people Were            n o t i c e a b l y w a l k i n g along    Halifax Road            in the      opposite

               direction asking                for    "any spares".             This was       o b v i o u s l y tickets.

               At one point a g r o u p of a p p r o x i m a t e l y               thirty      people       g a t h e r e d on .the

               road surface.               I approached          the g r o u p who        split up on my arrival                   one

               of the men         put a wad of bank               n o t e s -in a,, wallet.            My first          impression

               was    that    he was         a ticket        tout.

               Up to a bout S . 30             pro there were a group                  of abaut 25 men sat on a                   wall

               on the      opposite          side     of Hali f a x Road.           These men were              in possession

               of a      large    number        of    beer    cans w hi c h      t h e y ■w e r e .c o n s u m i n g .    I did not

               notice what            time     the men       left the area.             During       the    period        I observed

               them they were              in high spirits-,           not      causing any major               disturbance.

               The    trail      of    people        passing my       point      seemed       never     ending,          between

               2.30      pm and 2 . 5 5        pm people were           running along Hali f a x R o a d towards

               About 3.0 0        pm I was           d i r e c t e d to the     stad i u m and a p p r o a c h e d        it via

               L e p p i n g s Lane.         Someone mentioned            that a gate            had    collapsed although

               I was      not told what              the actual       prob l e m was.

               The officer            in charge at 'this time was                   Inspector Sykes               who     in my

          An y o n e who was           brought          out    of the ground          dead was        placed     behind        our

           c ordon and any             inju r e d were          placed o p p o s i t e      us agai n s t    the       perimeter

          wall.         .At    one    point       the    number       of dead behind me w o u l d have                 numbered

           about        fifteen.

          A f t e r about        th i r t y m i n u t e s      I was    told tb       patrol L a p p i n g s     Lane     in

           order        to move       the    crowds of onl o o k e r s a way to make                   room for        the

           e m e r g e n c y services.             Most       people    ignored       our, requests         stating       they

           were     looking          for    friends,          relatives       etc.

           I remained           on L e p p i n g s Laile until             the   crowds      had    cleared and then

           resumed for a de-Jb.r i ef i ng                    in the N o r t h Stand.

           At   no time         did    I enter          the ground         other     than the access           r o a d . , 1 did

           not handle           or a s s i s t     any of the          injured/dead.

           It was        not    until       the    debri e f i n g     that      I became aware          of what was

           happening.            I did       not    realise          how things were          inside the         ground and

           a s s u m e d all     the       problems        had o c c u r r e d at     the    turnstiles.

           I must add that                 prior    to the m a t c h a great             deal      of s u p p o r t e r s were

           as k i n g    directions           to    pubs and see m e d more              concerned over            that than

           anything           else.

           As   I have s t a t e d          I was       tota l l y    in the     dark as      to events        that were

           taking        place       until    the       debriefing.           I was    not    in p o s s e s s i o n   of a radio.

           The manner           of the       fans       leaving      the    ground was abusive              and ext r e m e l y

          aggressive,            I feel       sure       that    if a prisoner was              taken there w o u l d have

           b een a 1ar ge            s c a 1e di stur faanee.

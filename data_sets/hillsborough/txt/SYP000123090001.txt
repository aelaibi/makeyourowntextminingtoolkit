                 SUBJECT:
                                 INFORMATION REGARDING HILLSBOROUGH INCIDENT


                 Briefly, on Saturday 15 April 1989 I was on duty at the Cup
                 Semi-Final football match at the Sheffield Wednesday Football
                 Ground, Hillsborough, Sheffield.

                Shortly after the kick-off, I was in the gymnasium engaged in
                receiving a number of fatalities from the Leppings Lane end of
                the ground.  However, one person, still alive, was initially
                brought into the gymnasium and laid on the floor in a semi­
                conscious position, looking in a bad way.   I went to attend to
                him and comfort him and after about half an hour or so, the
                man whose name I obtained as                     bprn         w
                of                               (Telephone number
                had recovered sufficiently to make his own way out or tne
                building.

                Mr          if he has not already been in contact with the
                Enquiry Team, may be able to assist in the enquiry.

                I request that this information be forwarded to the West
                Midlands Police Enquiry Team.

                      I am a male nurse working at Uhiston Hj/spital and I live at the above

                      address with my wife and two childrei



                      I am a .Liverpool supporte r/and on Saturday 15 April             (150489)     this year

                      I went to Hi 11sborough football ground in Sheffield to watch/the FA

                     Cup Semi Final tie between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest./                     I had

                      bought my ticket from Anfield for £6.00 for the Leppings / n terraces

                      I left my home at about        10.30am (1030) with the following         people:

                                                                         S-1110




We travelled in          s car, going directly to Sheffield and the only

travel delays we encountered were     in the Stockport area caused by pure

volume of traffic.



We parked the car in Sheffield in Overton Rd       just off the A616 at

about 2.15pm (1415) and made our way,     unescorted to the ground along

with other Liverpool   supporters.     Everyone was    in good humour.           I

certainly d i d n ’t see any disorder or fighting although I did see a few

supporters drinking    lager out of cans in the street,     but nothing was

excessive.



iW^ar rived at the entrance to the ground/at about 2.25 pm (1425) and

were   confronted by some blue wrought    i/on gates   inside which were a

few hundred people,    not queuing,   jusy crowded into the area.        I saw a

Merseyside mounted police officer t/ying to sort the crowd into some

order but he was fighting a 1os.incp batt 1e and all the time more fans

were arriving behind us.      At no time did I notice any stewards

outside the turnstiles and although I knew where to go due to the fact

that   I went to the   corresponding fixture   last year,   I was eventually

glad to get to the turnstiles and out of the      crush.     As I got into a

turnstile the crush was getting very bad but I d o n ’t remember seeing

any unauthorised entry into the ground.        Whilst waiting   in the crush

I d i d n ’t see any gates opened and once inside the ground I saw three

or four stewards with yellow or green tabbards and a similar number of

policemen who were saving    ’Make you way into the terraces,     t h e r e ’s

plenty of room insidye’ .



I d i d n ’t notice any signs directing me to the terraces but at the end

of the tunnel   I could see the/players warming up on the pitch so I
                                                                                       PAGE      3
                                                                                       S 1 110

made my way into the tunnel with                     and           By now it was a few

minutes to three o ’clock           (1500) and although it was a crush it was

fairly fluid with people anxious to get onto the terraces.                        I d i d n ’t

see any policing or stewarding at this point of the ground but there

was no disorder and I d i d n ’t see anyone drinking alcohol                 in the ground,



Once               and I had reached/the end of the tunnel we made our way

to the left terrace,          pen ’4 ’/ and I was su/prised at how full           it was

considering what the police and steward's had told us, but to our left

I could see empty terraces,             pens 6 a/fd 7 so we thought we would try

and make our way over there.                However     I was aware of the increasing

pressure    coming from behind as more and more fans came in and we were

being forced forward and to the left.                      Eventt^^illy I came to an abrupt

halt and I was by           now facing the rear of th/               terraces. Icould see

 fans being    lifted up into the West Stand /seating a r e a .                I managed to

turn around and face the pitch again ami                     thematch was,   by now,    under

way.      I had been s e p a r a t e ^ f r o m         and     and presently    I was aware
                                    /
of a hand grabbing at iny/leg.                   I reached down and took hold of his

hand.      I was shouting/to everyone that someone was down but the crush

was that bad no one y£ould move anyway.                     I was frantically trying to

 pull   the person uyy      grabbing at any part of him I could but it was

hopeless.       The p e r son next to me,          to my left then said that someone

else was down next to him but it was that tight in the crush nothing

could be done.________



\After about     15 minutes was suddenly aware of space being created

around me and when I looked down I saw two men.                      The first was a

white    lad aged about       19 y / s , he was      clean shaven with mousey brown,

                                                                                               PAGE      4

                 bloated           I checked for a pulse but there was none.           I also remember

                 he had a small amount of blood around his mouth.                 /The second man was

Dei ^            also white,        aged about 35 years with darker h a i / .      He was bigger than
lo
                 the younger        lad and he too was    clean shaven!/
                                                                          ,   His shirt had ridden up

                 his body exposing his chest but I cannot             recollect what sort of
 ?   r v   .

     cftl        clothing he had on.           He was also a blue      colour and when I checked for

                 his pulse,        I found none.



                 I then tried to revive         the/younger   lad by heart massage and mouth to

                 mouth resuscitation but I was getting no response so I then tried on

                 the older man.          Again there was no response and eventually someone

                 took hold of me and said I ’d done what             I could and that I should get

                 out.      I was then helped out onto the pitch through a hole             in the

                 front fencing.           I walked onto the pitch and sat down for a while

                 trying to get my breath back.             I was   in a daze and a couple of people

                 asked me if I was all         right and the next thing I remember        is being sat

                 on the perimeter track by the players tunnel and some women brought me

                 a cup of tea.          I eventually left the ground at sometime after 4pm

                 (•1600) but I ca n ’t really recollect events,           I was   in that much of a

                 daze.          I c a n ’t recollect anything that    I consider to be a criminal

                 of f en ce .



                 The    police seemed very slow Yo react to what was happening             in the

                 middle two pens.           It was cvovious to everyone       in the pens that they

                 were very overcrowded but the Police just d i d n ’t realise.              Nobody was

                 at the entrance to the tunnel           to stop people going down it but even

                 that would have been no problem if there w e r e n ’t segregating fences

                 running from the front to the rear of the terraces.



                 I cannot        comment on the way the incident was handled after the match
                                                                                  PAGE     5
                                                                                  S1110

        had stopped because      I was still dazed after the terrifying experience

        which I had gone through in the crush.



        I feel that if the same         lack of organisation had occurred with any

        other team at the Leppings Ln entrance a disaster would still have

        occurred.



        The bottleneck at Leppings Ln by its layout must be a contributory

        factor to what happened and I am only surprised that no one was killed

        in the crush waiting to get inside the ground.



        The traffic arrangements were also          inadequate.    We travelled along

        Snake Pass and didn't see any directions to Hillsborough,            eventually

        getting       lost and travelling to the ground from the same direction as

        the Nottingham fans.           M HOLLINGHURST.

                   Today Tuesday 24th April           1990 (240490)      I have been shown by PC

                  The first of the deceased persons               I attempted to resuscitate whilst          in

                   pen number four of the Leppings Lane terraces as stated in my previous

                   statement,       the youngest of the two victims,          I am now satisfied having

                   looked at the above mentioned photographs                is the deceased refejp^nce

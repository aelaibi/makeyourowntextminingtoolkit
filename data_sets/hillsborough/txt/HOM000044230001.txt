   re: M eeting w ith Jack Straw - Saturday 21* March 1998

   I would confirm that the Hillsborough Family Support Group are not able to meet Mr Straw
   on Saturday

   The prospect was discussed at great length at last night’s committee meeting and it was
   unanimously agreed that we are unable to give all our member family’s sufficient notice
   (remember many of them live outside Merseyside!) and to meet “in haste” will serve little
   useful purpose.

   We understand die diary problems and are prepared to wait for a mutually acceptable time to
   be proposed.

   Yours,




   Trevoi Hicks

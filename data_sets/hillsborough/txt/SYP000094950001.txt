LORD JUSTICE LAWS


                           These are linked applications for judicial review which require the court
to revisit the terrible disaster which took place at the Hillsborough Football Ground at
Sheffield on 15 April 1989. In what I will call the first case the applicants Mr
Duckenfield and Mr Murray (to whom I will refer as “D” and “M”), who are retired
police officers, seek leave to move for judicial review of the decision of the Director
of Public Prosecutions (“the DPP”) to refuse to take over and discontinue private
prosecutions which have been instituted against them by                                          Ann        Adlington (“AA”) on
behalf of the Hillsborough Family Support Group (“the HFSG”). The decision was
communicated by letter of 18 December 1998. On 15 March 1999 Latham J adjourned
the leave application to 22 March 1999 and directed that the parties should then be
ready to proceed with the substantive application if leave were granted. On 22 March
this court granted leave and proceeded at once to hear the inter partes application. In
the second case the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire (“the CCSY”) seeks to
challenge a decision of the South Yorkshire Police Authority (“the SYPA”) made on 5

                                                                             -2-

     Februarv 1999 to the effect that it lacked the legal power to fund the defences of D
     and M to the private prosecutions brought by AA. or to fund their prospective judicial
     review applications against the DPP. On 12 February 1999 Latham J granted leave to
     the CCS Y. joined AA as second respondent, abridged time and ordered expedition. On
     24 March 1999 this court (having reserved judgment in the first case the previous day)
     granted leave to D and M to challenge the same decision and, again, proceeded at once
     to hear the inter partes application. We now deliver our judgments in both cases.


                                  I will first set out the facts material to the first case, which also form the
     necessary background to the second. I will later describe the further facts which are
     specifically relevant to the second case.

                                   The football match at Hillsborough on Saturday 15 April 1989 was the
     FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool Football Club and Nottingham Forest Football
15   Club. In the events which happened 96 people lost their lives. The Divisional
      Commander in charge of police operations at the match was D, then holding the rank
      of Chief Superintendent in the South Yorkshire Police Force. The second applicant,
18    then Superintendent Murray, held the position of Sub-Divisional Commander and was
      also on duty at the match.


                                   On 17 April 1989 Taylor LJ, as he then was, was appointed by the
      government to conduct a public inquiry into the disaster. He heard the oral testimony
      of 174 witnesses between 15 May and 29 June 1989, and presented an interim report
24    on 4 August 1989. He found that the immediate cause of the gross overcrowding
      which had taken place, and thus of the disaster, had been the failure to cut off access
      to the central pens behind the goal (which were already overfull) when Gate C was
27    opened. He found also a number of contributing factors including the condition of the
       ground, police planning, police operations on the day, and the interaction of parties
       responsible for safety issues. Lord Taylor’s final report was delivered on 18 January
30    ' 1990 and included a number of recommendations relating to crowd control and safety
       at sporting events.
                                                                                 -3 -

                                   Meanwhile, immediately after the disaster, the West Midlands Police
 3    had been appointed to conduct a review of the policing operations of the South
      Yorkshire Police. In March 1990 the West Midlands Police reported to the DPP. After
     taking the opinion of two experienced leading counsel the DPP announced on 30
 6   August 1990 that in his view there was insufficient evidence to justify any prosecution
     for a criminal offence, relating to the disaster, against any member of the South
      Yorkshire Police Force. Then from November 1990 to March 1991 HM Coroner for
 9   South Yorkshire conducted an inquest into the deaths in the course of which 230
     witnesses gave evidence. On 28 March 1991 the Coroner’s jury returned verdicts of
     accidental death.
12

                                  Disciplinary proceedings for neglect of duty were instituted against D
     and M by the Police Complaints Authority (“the PCA”). But D retired from the Force
15   on 10 November 1991 on medical grounds, and so the proceedings against him fell
     away. On 13 January 1992 the PCA decided not to proceed with the case against M.
     On 27 August 1992 he too retired on medical grounds. Then on 5 November 1993 the
18   Divisional Court dismissed an application for judicial review brought by family
     members of those who had died, refusing orders of certiorari to quash the inquest


•
     verdict and to require a fresh inquest to be convened.


                                  On 5 December 1996 a documentary programme called “Hillsborough”
     was broadcast on ITV. The programme suggested that fresh evidence about the
24   disaster had come to light. The allegations made in the broadcast were investigated by
     the Crown Prosecution Service between March and May 1997. At length on 30 June
      1997                      the Home Secretary announced in Parliament that an independent scrutiny would
27   be undertaken by Stuart-Smith LJ in order to ascertain inter alia whether there was
     evidence relating to the disaster which had not been available to Lord Taylor, or to the
     DPP or the Attorney General for the purposes of their discharge of their statutory
30 • responsibilities. Stuart-Smith LJ’s report was presented to the House of Commons on
      18 February 1998. Chapter 1 paras 55-57 state:
                                                                                  -4-

                      “55 From mv meetings with the bereaved families and their
                      representatives,' I am left in no doubt that there was widespread
    3                 disappointment at the DPP’s decision not to prosecute. They find it difficult
                      to understand in the light of Lord Taylor’s trenchant criticisms of the South
                      Yorkshire police and the fact that the force had been paying compensation.
    g
                       56. What the Director of Public Prosecutions had to bear in mind, however,
                       is the significantly different and greater degree of culpability which is
    9                 involved in manslaughter, or culpable misfeasance in public office, as
                       against the degree of negligence which gives rise to liability, and
                       compensation payments, under civil law. Any prosecution of an individual
1   2                  police officer would have to establish his individual responsibility. It would
                       not be enough simply to prove the composite failure of the police operation.

^                      57. The causes of the disaster were many and complex. So far as these two
®                      officers [sc D and M] were concerned, the prosecution would have to prove
                       to the high standard required for a criminal conviction that the failure to
18                     give the order to close off the tunnel when Gate C was opened amounted to
                        the serious degree of recklessness necessary to constitute manslaughter.”


21         Para 5 of Chapter 7 (“Summary”) stated:
                        “... I have come to the clear conclusion that there is no basis upon which
                        there should be a further judicial inquiry or a re-opening of Lord Taylor’s
24                     inquiry... I do not consider that there is any material which should be
                        placed before the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints
                        Authority which might cause them to re-consider the decisions they have
27                     already taken.”

            On the same day, 18 February 1998, the Home Secretary announced in the House that
    30      he, the Attorney General and the DPP had veiy carefully considered Stuart-Smith LJ s
            report, and said: “We have no reason to doubt his conclusions” .


    33                                  The HFSG was clearly not satisfied with this result. There was first an
             abortive attempt on 26 June 1998 by AA to institute criminal proceedings agamst D
             and M in the South Sefton Petty Sessional Division. That was given its quietus on
    36       technical or jurisdictional grounds into which it is unnecessary to go. Then on 1j July
              1998                     Miss Adlington laid informations against them before the Leeds Petty Sessional
              Division, and summonses were accordingly issued by the Stipendiary Magistrate. The
    39        charges accuse D and M of the manslaughter of two of those who died at

      Hillsborough. John Anderson and James Aspinall. They also allege against both an
      offence of “wilful neglect to perform a public duty”; and in the case of D, a further
 3    offence of attempting to pervert the course of justice, said to consist in his having lied
      about the circumstances in which Gate C at the football ground became open.


 6                                Both D and M made representations to the DPP that he should exercise
      his power under s.6(2) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 (“the POA”) to take
      over the conduct of the proceedings initiated against them, and then discontinue the
 9   proceedings under s.23(3). In order to appreciate the contrary positions being taken
     and the issues in the case, it is convenient to set out the relevant statutory provisions at
     this stage.

                                  Section 3(2) of the POA provides so far as relevant:

                                      Representations had first been made to the DPP on behalf of D and M in
         early July 1998, after the commencement of the proceedings in the South Sefton Petty
27      Sessional Division which proved abortive. In the course of correspondence the HFSG
         again contended that it had discovered new evidence, which, it was said, had not been
         before Lord Taylor, the DPP, the Coroner, or Stuart-Smith LJ. At length, after AA’s
30      informations had been laid in the Leeds Petty Sessional Division, the considered views
          of the DPP as to the approach to be taken to a request to take over and discontinue a
          private prosecution were set out in a letter to the HFSG on 27 July 1998. The letter did
33      not contain a decision, but it explained the DPP’s policy:
                         “The policy where proceedings have been commenced by a private
                         prosecutor builds on that contained in the Code for Crown Prosecutors.
36                       The right to bring a private prosecution is preserved by s.6(l)... subject to
                         the power under s.6(2). The CPS will take over a private prosecution where
                         there is a particular need for it do so on behalf of the public...


                                                                                -7 -

               In the instant case where we have been asked by the defendants to take over
               the prosecution in order to discontinue it, we would do so if one (or more) of
               the following circumstances applies:
                      • There is clearly no case to answer. A private prosecution
                         commenced in these circumstances would be unfounded, and
                         would, therefore be an abuse of the right to bring a prosecution.
                      • The public interest factors tending against prosecution clearly
                         outweigh those factors tending in favour.
                      • The prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests o f justice.
              The CPS would then regard itself as having to act in accordance with our
              policy.
              If none of the above apply there would be no need for the CPS to become
              involved and we would not interfere with the private prosecution.
              Clearly there is a distinction between the 'realistic prospect of conviction’
              test in the Code [the Code for Crown Prosecutors issued by the DPP under
              s. 10 of the 1985 Act] and the 'clearly no case to answer’ test mentioned
              above. Accordingly we recognise that there will be some cases which do not
              meet the CPS Code tests where nevertheless we will not intervene. It has
              been considered that to apply the Code tests to private prosecutions would
              unfairly limit the right of individuals to bring their own cases.
              Before this decision can properly be made the CPS must be assured that all
              relevant material has been considered...
              Until there has been a detailed review of the many papers in the case the
              Crown’s position cannot be determined...”



                            There followed very substantial representations from D and M and from
the HFSG. At length the DPP communicated his decision not to intervene, as I have
said by letter of 18 December 1998. The letter merely stated:
             “We have considered the evidence, the representations made by the parties
             and all the relevant circumstances of the case. We have concluded that we
             should not intervene to take over any of the charges.”

The respective solicitors for D and M asked for reasons to be given. There followed a
letter of 1 February 1999 (the “reasons letter”) from the CPS’ Casework Director to
M’s solicitor from which it is necessary to cite at some length:
             “As you know, the Code for Crown Prosecutors sets out the general
             principles applied by the Service when (inter alia) deciding whether to
             continue a prosecution it has taken over; or whether to institute
             proceedings, or whether to advise the police to do so. It is correct that the
             CPS decided in 1997 that the evidence available at that time was not
             sufficient, in its view, to provide a realistic prospect of the conviction of
                                                                            -   8   -

                       either your client or Mr Duckenfield for any offence. However, it does not
                       follow that, when considering the evidence and the representations
    3                  submitted by the private prosecutor, and by yourselves on behalf of your
                       client, the CPS should seek merely to identify whether there is now any new
                       evidence sufficient to provide a realistic prospect of a conviction. The
    6                  decision whether to intervene in a private prosecution with a view to
                       terminating it calls for different considerations to be applied. It is quite
                       possible for a private prosecution to continue, notwithstanding that the CPS
     9                 is not satisfied, on the basis of its own assessment of the strength of the
                       evidence, that the evidence would pass the evidential sufficiency test in the
                       Code (that there should be a 'realistic prospect of a conviction’).
    12                 In broad terms, the reason for this is that s.6(l)... specifically preserved the
                       right of private individuals and prosecuting authorities and bodies other
                       than the CPS to bring criminal proceedings. This right is subject (among
                       other limitations) to the limitation in s.6(2) that the CPS may nevertheless
45                     take over the proceedings with a view either to conducting or to
                       terminating those proceedings.
    18                  Private prosecutors are not bound to apply the Code for Crown Prosecutors
                       when deciding whether to institute proceedings, nor do the courts apply the
                        evidential sufficiency test in the Code when deciding whether there is a case
    21                  to answer. The Service therefore recognises that it is not appropriate to
                        intervene to terminate a private prosecution without good reason. That
                        general principle has recently been endorsed by the Law Commission in its
    24                  Consultation Paper No. 149 'Consents to Prosecution’ (see paragraphs 6.3
                        and 6.4).
                        [The letter then proceeds to set out the DPP’s policy in the same terms as those
    27                  in which it had earlier been described by the three “bullet-points” in the letter
                        of 27 July 1998, save that it gives instances of the “public interest factors” test
                        as follows:
                        “examples might be where the prosecution is malicious, or vexatious; or the
#                       offence is one for which the defendant should clearly have been cautioned;
                        or where, although the offence may be serious, the defendant is terminally
    33                  ill.” Then the letter continues as follows]
                        In this case, I took the decision not to intervene... I concluded in respect of
                         the charges of manslaughter and wilful neglect to perform a public duty
    36                   (which, for the avoidance of doubt, were each considered against each
                         individual separately) that I could not say that there is clearly no case to
                         answer. It was not right, therefore, for the Service to take over the
    39                   proceedings with a view to terminating them.
                         I should add that, against that background and after specifically
                         considering the appropriate course to take in these circumstances, I
    42                   concluded further that it would not be right to intervene in respect of the
                         one remaining charge against Mr Duckenfield, of attempting to pervert the
                         course of justice, albeit I had formed the view that there was clearly no case
    45                   to answer on that charge alone. The charge of attempting to pervert the
                          course of justice is a serious one, particularly when levelled against
                                                                                     -9-

      3                gravamen of the criminality alleged against Mr Duckenfield and I
                        concluded that my approach to that charge should be led by my conclusions
                        on the charges of manslaughter and wilful neglect to perform a public duty.
      6                I also considered whether, nevertheless, there were overriding public
                        interest factors that should lead to the Service intervening with a view to
                        discontinuance, but I came to the conclusion that any public interest factors
      9                tending against prosecution did not clearly outweigh those in favour; nor
                        did I consider that the prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests
                        of justice...”

                                       The private prosecution of D and M presently stands adjourned in the
^ 5       magistrates’ court. Committal proceedings were due to commence on 19 April 1999.
          But we understand that date has been vacated. There is a directions hearing fixed for
          hearing later in April. The matter was earlier before the magistrates’ court on 21
 18       December 1998, an occasion to which I should refer because Mr Jones QC for AA
          contends that the applications in the first case have not been made promptly, as Order
          53 and the Supreme Court Act 1981 require (Mr Havers QC for the DPP likewise so
 21       contends but only in relation to the assault which is directed to the legality of the
          DPP’s policy; he says, as is plainly the fact, that D and M had notice of the policy by
          the letter of 27 July 1998). On 21 December it is said by AA that Mr Harrison QC for
 24       D and M indicated his clients’ intention to seek leave to bring an application for
          judicial review against the DPP’s decision, whatever the reasons for it (the reasons
          had not, of course, by then been supplied). Mr Jones contends that the application for
 27       judicial review could and should have been lodged then or very shortly thereafter.
          There is an issue as to the context in which Mr Harrison said what he said to the
          magistrate. It is clear from an affidavit sworn by M’s solicitor Mr Manning that Mr
 30       Hamson took the view (as, if I may say so, one would expect) that he would have to
          consider the DPP’s written reasons before finally advising as to a judicial review. As
          at 21 December 1998 a reasons letter was expected before Christmas, and Mr Harrison
 33       so informed the magistrate. In the event the reasons were not delivered until 1

         irresponsible to seek judicial review leave before the DPP’s reasons were available.
    6    And the letter of 27 July 1998 could not have been a proper trigger to seek leave; it
         contained no decision. It is true that a challenge only to the legality of the policy need
         not strictly have awaited the DPP’s reasons for applying it as he decided to do; but
     9   since D and M, very obviously, were at least as interested in the application of the
         policy as in its legality, overall it was perfectly proper and reasonable to wait for the
£        reasons letter before lodging any application for leave.

    15   The First Case: the Decision o f the DPP


                                       I may now turn to the substantive arguments in the first case. The lead
    18   skeleton argument is that prepared on behalf of M, which is adopted by D who adds
          further submissions to challenge the distinct decision of the DPP not to take over and
          discontinue the charge against him of attempting to pervert the course of justice. To
^1       that I will come in due course.


          Ss3(2)(b) o f the Act o f 1985
    24
                                        The applicants’ first submission is that the DPP’s decision fails to pay
          any regard to his duty under s.3(2)(b), which I have set out. It is put thus at #2.6 of the
    27 skeleton argument:
                         “The applicant’s point is that the policy and decision process in this case
                         have not recognised that the s.3(2)(b) duty is relevant to the exercise of
    30                   discretion whether to intervene under s.6(2) and apply s.23(3)”.



                                                                                     - 11 -

         In the course of his oral submissions Mr Hamson expanded this argument. He
         submitted that in deciding whether to take over and discontinue a private prosecution
     3   where the case is one of “importance or difficulty”, the DPP should bear in mind that
         it is ordinarily his duty to institute and conduct such proceedings. Accordingly, as I
         understand it, the suggestion is that the DPP should in some way entertain a
     6   heightened concern where such a private prosecution is launched, and his policy in
         relation to the potential discontinuance of such cases under s.23(3) should reflect this;
         presumably (for otherwise I cannot see how the argument can assist Mr Harrison) by
     9   leaning more favourably towards discontinuance than in other classes of case.


^                                     In my judgment this is a bad argument. S.3(2)(b) speaks only of the
    12   institution of proceedings by the DPP; contrast s.3(2)(a), (c), and (d), which require
         him to take over proceedings. Plainly the DPP would not institute proceedings with a
         view to discontinuance. Moreover, as Mr Havers submitted, had it been the
    15   legislature’s intention to require the DPP to treat “important or difficult” cases in a
         different way from others for the purposes of ss.6(2) and 23(3), it could have readily
         so provided and it is to be supposed would have done so. In my judgment the right of
    18   private prosecution preserved by s.6(l) is in no way qualified by s.3(2)(b), which has
         nothing to do with the discretion to take over such a prosecution under s.6(2) with a
         view to discontinuance under s.23(3). I consider that this conclusion is lent support by
     1   the decision of the Divisional Court in R v Bow Street Stipendiary, ex p. South Coast
         Ltd [1993] 2 WLR 621, in which Lloyd LJ, as he then was, said at 624:
                      “It will be noticed that section 3(2)(a)... provide[s] for the Director to take
    24               over the conduct of certain kinds of proceedings. By contrast, section
                      3(2)(b) provides for the Director to institute certain other kinds of
                      proceedings where it appears to him to be appropriate, having regard to the
    27               importance and the difficulty of the case. The difference in language is not,
                      in my view, accidental. It becomes of crucial importance when one turns to
                      section 6, which deals with private prosecutions... The effect of section 6(1)
    30               is to preclude a person from bringing a private prosecution in cases covered
                      by section 3(2)(a), (c) and (d) but not in the residuary category of cases
                      covered by section 3(2)(b). So far as section 3(2)(b) cases are concerned,
    33               there is nothing to preclude a private prosecution.” (Lloyd LJ’s emphasis)

          The DPP's policy fails to have regard to the fundamental purpose fo r which private
     3   prosecution is preserved by statute

                                       Mr Harrison's second submission was that the right to maintain a private
     6   prosecution essentially operates as a constitutional safeguard in cases where there is
         some suggestion of “ inertia, partiality or improper action” by the public prosecutor;
         and the implication is that where nothing of that kind is present, the DPP should lean
     9   towards intervention to stop the prosecution. Mr Harrison relies on statements of their
         Lordships in Gouriet v Union o f Post Office Workers [1978] AC 435. Lord
         Wilberforce said at 477B-C:
tfcl 2                 “This historical right which goes right back to the earliest days of our legal
                       system, though rarely exercised in relation to indictable offences, and
                        though ultimately liable to be controlled by the Attorney-General (by
    15                 taking over the prosecution and, if he thinks fit, entering a nolle prosequi)
                        remains a valuable constitutional safeguard against inertia or partiality on
                        the part of authority.”
    18
         Lord Diplock said this at 498B:

    21                 “In English public law every citizen still has the right, as he once had a
                       duty (though of imperfect obligation), to invoke the aid of courts of criminal
                       jurisdiction for the enforcement of the criminal law by this procedure. It is
    24                 a right which nowadays seldom needs to be exercised by an ordinary
                        member of the public, for since the formation of regular police forces
a                      charged with the duty in public law to prevent and detect crime and to
^27                    bring criminals to justice, and the creation in 1879 of the office of Director
                        of Public Prosecutions, the need for prosecutions to be undertaken (and
                        paid for) by private individuals has largely disappeared; but it still exists
    30                 and is a useful constitutional safeguard against capricious, corrupt or
                        biased failure or refusal of those authorities to prosecute offenders against
                        the criminal law.”
    33
          Reliance is also placed on a passage at para 7.50 in the report of the Royal
          Commission on Criminal Procedure 1981, which refers to the retention of the right of
    36    private prosecution “as an effective safeguard against improper inaction by the
          prosecuting authority”, and to a recent recommendation of the Law Commission,
          contained in para 5.26 of its fmal report on “Consents to Prosecution” (October 1998),

     requiring the consent o f the CPS.

                                   In my judgment this argument is also misconceived. The obiter dicta in
     Gouriet are not reflected in the 1985 statute, which was of course enacted some seven
6    years after Gouriet was decided. More particularly, it is simply quixotic to suggest that
     the DPP should allow a private prosecution to go ahead if there has been “inertia,
     partiality or improper action” by the public prosecutor - namely himself - but not
9    otherwise. Is he to be judge and jury on the question whether he has let the public
     down? Their Lordships’ dicta in Gouriet do not with respect provide anything
     approaching a compulsory template of a lawful policy to be adopted by the DPP for
12   the execution of his duty under ss.6(2) and 23(3).


      The Code fo r Crown Prosecutors
15
                                    The argument here, at least as originally put forward in M’s skeleton
      argument, was that because of his view (referred to in the reasons letter) that private
18   prosecutors are not bound to apply the Code when deciding whether to institute
      proceedings, the DPP has erroneously proceeded on the basis that the principles in the
      Code are irrelevant to his discretion under ss.6(2) and 23(3). But the DPP has nowhere
 1   stated that he regards the Code as systematically or generally irrelevant to his power to
      discontinue. Indeed, as I shall show, there are some aspects of the Code which are
      reflected in his approach to the question, how his policy should be applied in this case.
24   In truth, however, it could not be right for the DPP to apply across the board the same
       tests, in particular the “reasonable prospect of conviction” test referred to in the
       correspondence, in considering whether to take over and discontinue a private
27   prosecution as the Code enjoins Crown Prosecutors to follow in deciding whether to
       institute or proceed with a prosecution themselves; the consequence would be that the
       DPP would stop a private prosecution merely on the ground that the case is not one
30 which he would himself proceed with. But that, in my judgment, would amount to an
        emasculation of s.6(1) and itself be an unlawful policy; and in fairness Mr Hamson
                                                                                    -14-

        (^7 of M's skeleton) made it clear that he did not submit so much. The veiy premise of
        s.6(1) must be that some cases will go to trial which the DPP himself chooses not to
    3   prosecute.


                                     As it seems to me the only points remaining in relation to the Code
    6   concern the application of the DPP’s policy to the facts of this case, and I will deal
        with that shortly.


    9   The “clearly no case to answer ” test


|                                    The argument here (#7 of the skeleton) is that such a test is
12      impermissibly rigid. It is said that the policy excludes “any assessment of evidential
        deficiencies” and so amounts to an unlawful fetter of the DPP’s discretion; and that it
        “also leads to a distorted evaluation of the public interest factors”. In my judgment
15      the test involves no unlawful fetter of discretion. It is plain from the formulation “there
        is clearly no case to answer” (my emphasis) that the DPP only intends to stop private
        prosecutions on this ground where no reasonable decision-maker could conclude that
18      there was sufficient evidence for the case to go forward. That seems to me to be a
        perfectly proper approach. Such a prosecution could offer no legitimate benefit to
        anyone and would, potentially at least, be an abuse of the process of the court. The
    1   test rightly identifies a class of case which should always be stopped; if the case is not
        within the class, then the decision whether to stop it will, of course, depend on the
        other two tests which, in my judgment, amply contemplate an exercise of discretion in
24      which all material factors will be considered and whose application accordingly
        negates any unlawful fetter of discretion.


27                                   As regards any “distorted evaluation” of the public interest test, it is
        clear that the three aspects of the policy are individually self-standing. Their
        respective application in this case is a another matter, to which as I have said I will
30      come. But the applicants have a separate argument about the public interest test.


                                                                                    - 15-

       The “public interest factors” test
   3
                                    Here it is submitted (#8 of the skeleton) that the public interest
       necessarily involves consideration of the likelihood of conviction, so that the
   6   evidential test should not be hived off from that relating to the public interest. Mr
       Harrison also argues that the public interest test as formulated - “the public interest
       factors tending against prosecution clearly outweigh those factors tending in
   9   favour” - gets it the wrong way round; the test should be whether the public interest
       factors in favour of the private prosecution outweigh those against.


  12                                I see no reason why quite aside from the evidential test of no case to
       answer the DPP should not, within his policy as presently formulated, have in mind
       the likelihood or otherwise of conviction when considering where the public interest
  15   lies. And I see no basis for the suggestion that the law should compel the DPP to
       reverse the effect of the public interest factors so as to favour discontinuance unless in
       his judgment they clearly point in the other direction. The test as presently formulated
  18   seems to me designed to allow proper scope for the operation of the right of private
       prosecution. The private prosecutor is very likely to take a different view as to where
       the public interest lies than does the DPP, and s.6(l), I think, implies that he is entitled
(0£1   to do so. The approach urged by Mr Harrison would in effect require the private
        prosecutor to persuade the DPP that his view of the public interest is plainly right. I
        consider it strongly arguable that that would place an illegitimate constraint upon the
  24   right of private prosecution; but it is enough to hold, as I would, that the present public
        interest policy is perfectly consistent with the objects of the statute and thus well
        within the proper discretion of the DPP.
  27
                                     Mr Harrison directed similar criticisms to the third limb of the policy,
        but in light of what I have said about the public interest test they possess no separate
  30   force.


                                                                                   -16-

                             For all these reasons, the DPP’s policy overall is in my judgment a
      lawful one. The real question in the case is whether it has been lawfully applied. It is
      clear that (a) the DPP maintains his view that the “reasonable prospect of conviction”
      test in the Code would not be met in this case, but that (b) the “no evidence” test is not
      met either (save as regards the charge against D of attempting to pervert the course of
      justice, with which I deal separately below). In those circumstances, the application of
      the public interest test was crucial. In this context it is convenient to deal first with Mr
      Harrison’s submission that the reasons letter shows that the DPP has given improper
      and perhaps decisive weight to the “no evidence” test. He relies on the sentence which
12    follows the conclusion that that test is not satisfied: “It was not right, therefore, for
      the Service to take over the proceedings with a view to terminating them”, and
      submits that it suggests the author of the letter considered that that was the end of the
15    matter. However after dealing with the particular issue concerning the charge against
      D of attempting to pervert the course of justice, the letter continues: “I also
      considered whether, nevertheless, there were overriding public interest factors
18    that should lead to the Service intervening with a view to discontinuance”. I think
      the letter could have been better expressed, so as to make it clear that the public
       interest test is by no means secondary to the “no evidence” test. However I am quite
       satisfied that there was no intention to downgrade or sideline the balance of public
       interest factors. It is not really credible to suppose that author of the letter
       misunderstood or failed to apply the very policy which he had just clearly set out.

       The DPP’s judgment o f the public interest


27                             Mr Harrison submitted that in light of everything that had gone before,
       and not least Stuart-Smith LJ’s Scrutiny, there were no public interest factors
       favouring continuation of the prosecutions of D and M. He said that there is nothing in
30'    the reasons letter to show that the DPP accepted the suggestion, urged forcefully and


                                                                     - 17-

     at length by the HFSG in the course of their representations, that further evidence had
     come to light since the Scrutiny. With this latter proposition I agree. But the reasons
3    letter clearly implies an acceptance that some factors existed which favoured the
     prosecutions. It stated: “I came to the conclusion that any public interest factors
     tending against prosecution did not clearly outweigh those in favour” . What were
 6   those in favour? If in truth there were no factors which a reasonable decision-maker
     could regard as going in favour of the prosecutions, then the DPP’s decision would be
     vulnerable to a challenge on Wednesbury1grounds (as indeed Mr Harrison claims it is)
 9   since there would be nothing in public interest terms to weigh in the scales against
     discontinuance. When the case was opened there was no affidavit from the DPP
     dealing with the point, nor did Mr Havers’ skeleton argument articulate any such
12   factors. So it was that, effectively at the court’s invitation so that the matter could be
     clarified, Mr Newell swore an affidavit for the DPP on 22 March 1999. He is the CPS’
     Director of Casework and the author of the reasons letter. Paras 2 - 4 are as follows:
15                 “2. As I now recall, the public interest factors tending against prosecution
                   which I considered were as follows:
                          (1)                     Previous reviews of the case, in particular those carried ou
18                       the DPP when considering the question whether criminal
                          proceedings should be taken against Mr Duckenfield and Mr
                          M urray and the more recent report of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.
21                       (2) The fact that the Applicants had been told on previous occasions
                          that the DPP did not intend to prosecute.
^                        (3) The delay which had occurred between the commission of the
R                        alleged offences and the commencement of this prosecution and its
                          likely effect on the Applicants, although I took the view that delay
                          may be offset by the seriousness of the alleged offences (as is reflected
27                       in paragraph 6.5(d) of the Code...).
                          (4) The effect of the delay on the evidence, for example in terms of
                          the potential impairment of the recollections of witnesses.
30                       (5) The assertion made on behalf of Mr Murray of ill-health,
                          although I noted that no medical evidence had been put forward in
                          support of this assertion and that, as again reflected in the Code (at
33                       paragraph 6.5(e)), ill-health may be offset by the seriousness of the
                          offence.

36                 3. As against these factors tending against prosecution, there was in my
                    view one extremely important factor in favour of prosecution, namely the

              very  serious nature of the alleged offences, in particular, the alleged
              offences of manslaughter. In my opinion, the allegation that two senior
              police officers were responsible for the deaths of a number of people as a
              result of criminal negligence was a very grave allegation.

              4. Paragraph 6.2 of the Code reflects the considerable weight attached by
              the CPS to the seriousness of the alleged offence when seeking to strike the
              right balance as to the factors for and against prosecution. (I refer also to
              the opening words of paragraph 6.4.) Having carefully considered the
              factors tending against prosecution and this extremely important factor in
              favour of it, I came to the firm conclusion that the factors tending against
              prosecution did not clearly outweigh what I considered to be the very
              strong public interest in favour of prosecution.”



                             One of Mr Harrison’s complaints, advanced before this affidavit was
sworn, was that the policy should have taken account of para 10.1 of the Code which
includes this:
              “Normally, if the Crown Prosecution Service tells a suspect or defendant
              that there will not be a prosecution... that is the end of the matter... But
              occasionally there are special reasons why the Crown Prosecution Service
              will re-start the prosecution, particularly if the case is serious.”

 This is one of the points relating to the Code which, as it seems to me, bear on the
application of the policy rather than the policy itself; and para 2(2) of Mr Newell’s
affidavit shows that regard was had to assurances or statements made to D and M that
for his part the DPP would not prosecute. Clearly it was right to do so, within the
public interest balance. But I think there is a qualitative difference between the
situation where the DPP himself goes back upon a previous assurance not to prosecute
and one where the DPP does not change his mind but a private prosecutor chooses to
instigate proceedings.


                             In reply, having by then seen Mr Newell’s affidavit, Mr Harrison made
further submissions. While accepting that there could be a case in which a single
factor favouring prosecution might not be outweighed by a multiplicity of factors
going the other way, he submitted that if the raft of public interest considerations
favouring discontinuance in this case was held not to be enough to outweigh the single
                                                                             -19-

        factor of the allegations' gravity, it was difficult or impossible to imagine what set of
        considerations might do so; and the court should conclude that DPP had fettered his
    3   discretion by treating the seriousness of the allegations as overriding everything else,
        so that he had not in truth carried out a proper balancing exercise at all.


    6                                I would reject this argument. There is no reason to suppose that the
        factors against prosecution were not properly weighed and considered, and certainly
        no basis for the supposition that once faced with a private prosecution for something
    9   as serious as manslaughter the DPP would inevitably decide to allow it to proceed.


P                                    Mr Harrison submitted next that Mr Newell’s affidavit showed that the
12      DPP had transposed from the Code the “seriousness of the charge” factor as a
        consideration favouring the prosecution without also taking account of his own view
        that the Code test of “realistic prospect of conviction” was not met. I agree that the
15      DPP’s view of the prospects of conviction is a proper matter for him to consider,
        within the public interest test contained in the policy, when deciding whether to
        discontinue; but, as it seems to me, para 2(1) of Mr Newell’s affidavit shows that in
18      this case he has done so.


                                      Then Mr Harrison suggested that para 3 of the affidavit demonstrated
fcl     that the DPP’s view of the gravity of the allegation was informed simply by the fact
        that there was a manslaughter charge. He had not properly considered the real degree
         of culpability inherent in the facts alleged; and the gravity of the offence of
24      manslaughter can vary very widely. There is nothing in this. Mr Newell made it
         perfectly clear that he had regard to the species of manslaughter in question
         (“criminal negligence”) and it cannot sensibly be doubted that he was well aware and
 27 took account of the circumstances in which the alleged offences are said to have been
         committed.

                                    Lastly on this part of the case Mr Harrison submitted that the refusal to
       discontinue was simply perverse, given the “enormous weight” of the public interest
  3    considerations going the other way.


                                    The DPP might, in my judgment, lawfully have decided to discontinue.
  6    The tragic events at Hillsborough have been the subject of repeated, detailed, thorough
       enquiries. Nearly ten years have passed. But the judgment was for the DPP to make. If
       we acceded to Mr Harrison’s submission, we would I think usurp the role of the
  9    primary decision-maker.


                                     In my judgment the decision not to discontinue is no more unlawful than
  12   is the policy which the DPP applied.




        The first applicant: attempting to pervert the course o f justice


  18                                 Mr Harrison discretely submits that the decision to let the charge of
        attempting to pervert the course of justice go ahead was unlawful, because it runs flat
        counter to the “no case to answer” test in his own policy. It will be recalled that the
^21     reasons letter said:
                      “I concluded further that it would not be right to intervene in respect of the
                      one remaining charge against Mr Duckenfield, of attempting to pervert the
  24                  course of justice, albeit I had formed the view that there was clearly no case
                      to answer on that charge alone... in the context of the case as a whole that
                       charge is not the gravamen of the criminality alleged against Mr
  27                  Duckenfield and I concluded that my approach to that charge should be led
                       by my conclusions on the charges of manslaughter and wilful neglect to
                       perform a public duty.”
  30
         Paras 5 and 6 of Mr Newell’s affidavit state as follows:
                       “5. I was fully aware of the seriousness of the additional charge. I also
  33                  tentatively concluded that partial intervention... was in law open to the CPS
                       and I proceeded on that assumption. However, the existing policy did not
                       cover the situation which arose in this case, namely where the conclusion

               was reached that there was clearly a case to answer in relation to some of
               the charges but not in relation to others. (I can say that with some
               confidence, since I had overall responsibility for formulating the policy.) ...
               I concluded that it was in fact inappropriate to intervene only to take over
               (with a view to discontinuing) this additional charge.

              6. First, partial intervention was not, in my view, either appropriate or
              desirable. It seemed to me that the DPP should either intervene so as to
              take over the proceedings in their entirety or not at all. To have intervened
              partially would still have left the criminal proceedings in place in relation to
              the other charges which included the even more serious charge of
              manslaughter. Secondly, I took into account the fact that M r Duckenfield
              would not be left without any remedy in relation to this additional charge.
              On the contrary, he would be entitled to invite the Magistrates’ Court to
              dismiss it on the basis that there was no case to answer. Thirdly, the charge
              arose out of essentially the same events as the events which gave rise to the
              other charges and thus those events would be scrutinised in any event.”



                             I of course accept that Mr Newell did not subjectively believe - or intend
- that the policy covered this situation. But the policy has to be read objectively; there
can be no doubt that it gave rise to a legitimate expectation on the part of D and M
that it would be applied according to its terms. The first question, then, is as to the true
meaning of the policy on a fair reading of the letter of 27 July 1998 and the reasons
letter. It is true that the letters use the singular: “the prosecution” and “a private
prosecution”. But it is elementary that in criminal cases each count constitutes a
separate indictment; it is as if there are separate trials relating to each. And this is no
mere technicality; for it means, of course, that where there is more than one charge
any question whether there is “no case to answer” is, as regards each individual
charge, wholly discrete. I do not consider that the policy can fairly be read as
indicating that the DPP would necessarily either take over or discontinue a private
prosecution in its entirety. In my view the articulation of the “no case to answer” test
would be taken by any informed reader, facing a multiple private prosecution, to imply
that the DPP would consider whether in his view there was clearly no case to answer
on each charge.



                                                                             -2 2 -

                                      The DPP concluded that there was clearly no such case in relation to this
         charge against D, and yet decided to allow it to proceed. It follows, in my judgment
         that there is a breach of D’s legitimate expectation that the policy would be applied.
         The pragmatic factors spoken to by Mr Newell in para 6 can make no difference. Nor,
         of course, can the vigorous assertion by the HFSG that there is in fact a case to
 6       answer. What matters for present purposes is the DPP’s conclusion on that issue.


                                      For these reasons I would quash the DPP’s decision only so far as it
 9       relates to this charge against D. I make it clear that I say nothing as to what might
         follow as regards any further decision concerning that charge to be made by the DPP.


12                                    Otherwise, for the reasons I have given I would dismiss the application
         in the first case.

         The Second Case: the Decision o f the SYPA
18

                                      First I should describe the further facts which are specifically relevant to
         the second case. These must be read into the narrative of events which I have already
         given in relation to the first case; it seems to me clearer and more convenient to isolate
         here the particular facts which bear on the challenge to the decision of the SYPA.


24                                     The history shows that at earlier stages the SYPA had been prepared to
         provide financial support for D and M (and other officers) to be legally represented in
         matters arising from the Hillsborough disaster. On 7 December 1990 they resolved to
27       fund the representation of six police officers, including D and M, at the inquest. They
         had earlier resolved not to do so; the decision of 7 December was taken after
         considering “the most recent legal advice available”. Then on 1 August 1997 the
30   •   SYPA resolved to set aside £500,000 for financial assistance for police officers in
         connection with Stuart-Smith LJ’s Scrutiny. In both instances they had considered a
                                                                                      -23-

        report from the Chief Constable (or a joint report of the Chief Constable and the Clerk
        and Treasurer). The latter decision was said to be taken “in accordance with the
    3   principles set out in Home Office Circular No 77/87 Financial Assistance to Police
        Officers in Legal Proceedings”, to which I will have to refer.


    6                               On 27 February 1998, following publication of the Scrutiny, and
        considering that “there were indications that private prosecutions could be brought
        against 3 officers”, the SYPA resolved in principle to authorise consideration being
    9   given to applications by officers for financial assistance. On 5 March 1998 D’s
        application for such assistance was approved by the SYPA, and M’s was approved on
^       29 June 1998. It will be recalled that three days earlier, on 26 June, AA had first
12      sought to institute criminal proceedings against D and M in the South Sefton Petty
        Sessional Division. On 20 November 1998 M applied for further financial assistance
        in relation to the judicial review which was then seen to be in prospect should the DPP
15      decide to allow the private prosecutions to continue; and the HFSG had made it clear
        that were the DPP to take over the prosecutions and discontinue, they would seek a
        judicial review. On 21 December 1998 counsel for D and M indicated to the
18      Stipendiary Magistrate their intention to seek a judicial review of the DPP’s decision; I
        have already referred to this in dealing with Mr Jones’ misconceived argument that the
        first case should be dismissed on grounds of delay. The following day, 22 December
^1      1998, in a letter of over six pages AA made written representations on leading
        counsel’s advice to urge the SYPA that the decision to fund the defences of D and M
        was “unlawful, irrational, ultra vires and procedurally improper on various
24      grounds” . On 23 December 1998 D applied for further financial assistance in relation
        to the prospective judicial review proceedings. On 5 January 1999 AA wrote a further
        lengthy letter to the SYPA repeating and expanding her assertions that the funding
27      decisions were unlawful.


                                     Then on 5 February 1999 the SYPA passed the resolutions under
30      challenge, “that, on balance, the Authority has no legal power to provide financial

       assistance” to D and M in respect either of the private prosecution or a judicial review
       of the DPP’s decision. On 10 February 1999 the CCSY’s application for judicial
  3    review in these proceedings was lodged, and on the same day solicitors for the SYPA
       wrote to the Crown Office to consent to the grant of leave and seek expedition. They
       stated:
  6                  “SYPA passed these resolutions with great reluctance on the basis of advice
                     received from ourselves and Counsel...”

                                     The legality or otherwise of the decisions under challenge ultimately
^12    turns on the construction and application of s.6(1) of the Police Act 1996 and s. 111(1)
       of the Local Government Act 1972. I shall have to look at other statutory provisions,
       but it is convenient to set these out at once. The cross-heading to s.6 reads “General
 15    functions of poiice authorities”, and ss.(l) provides:
                      “Every police authority established under section 3 shall secure the
                      maintenance of an efficient and effective police force for its area.”
 18
        S.l 11(1) of the Act of 1972 in its present form provides:

 21                  “Without prejudice to any powers exercisable apart from this section but
                      subject to the following provisions of this Act, a local authority shall have
                      power to do any thing (whether or not involving expenditure, borrowing or
                      lending of money or the acquisition or disposal of any property or rights)
                      which is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the
                      discharge of their functions.”
 27

                                      S. 111(1) applies to police authorities (but in light of my conclusions it is
  30   unnecessary to go into the legislative history relating to that). Now, it might be
        thought - indeed this is the applicants’ case - that by s.6(1), securing “the
         maintenance of an efficient and effective police force” is plainly made the function
  33   of a police authority, and that accordingly it is no less plain that s. 111(1) empowers
         the police authority to do such things as fund the legal representation of police officers
         in proceedings if the authority reasonably concludes that to do so is conducive to that

                                                                                    -25-

         function's discharge. That has been the settled view of the Association of Chief Police
         Officers, the Police Superintendents Association, and (until 1998) the Home Office,
     3   The decision to provide such finance, in common with any decision taken under
         s. 111(1), would of course be subject to well known public law constraints enshrined in
         the Wednesbury and Padfielc? principles. There is before the court an affidavit of Mr
     6   Daines, Assistant Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, in which he describes what he
         regards as the “absolutely vital” requirement “that officers should know that if they
         act in good faith in performing their duties their Police Authority will support
     9   them in the event that they face litigation”. If as a matter of vires s. 111(1) allows a
         police authority to incur expenditure in furtherance of the general function seemingly
Q        conferred by s.6(1), then in my judgment the use of s. 111(1) to finance police officers
    12   legal expenses in litigation, including private prosecutions brought against them and
         the bringing of judicial review proceedings, cannot in principle be ruled unlawful on
         Wednesbury or Padfield grounds. The circumstances in which such funding might be
    15   provided in any particular case is another matter. The policy has in the past been to the
         effect that the authority must be satisfied that the officer has acted in good faith in the
         discharge of his duty; and I can see that, at least where a private prosecution is
    18   involved, there may be issues for the authority to consider which would involve their
         taking a view of the merits in advance of any trial. But in these proceedings we are not
         concerned with any question whether, when, or to what extent the SYPA might
         provide financial assistance to D or M. We are only to decide whether the power
         exists to do so at all.


    24                                 In fact the argument of the CCSY was put two ways by Mr Baker QC. It
         was first said that s.6(l) of itself, without the aid of s.. 111(1), enabled the funding
         decision. Alternatively, it was enabled by s. 111(1) read with s.6(l).

                                     Upon this issue Miss Baxendale QC for the SYPA submits that the
        apparently obvious relation between s.6(1) and s. 111(1) is in fact no relation at all.
        The essence of her argument may be expressed very shortly, as follows.


                                     (a)                                  S.6(1) confers no powers of any kind. All the powers possessed by
        police authorities are conferred elsewhere in the Police Act and by the local
        government legislation. S.6(l) does no more than to provide the purpose for which the
        authority's powers are to be exercised; it states the Act’s “policy and objects”, in the
        language of the Padfield case, as they apply to police authorities. If this is right, it
        would contradict Mr Baker’s first argument, that s.6(l) alone is enough to empower
        the SYPA to fund D and M.
12
                                     (b)                                           S. 111(1) cannot be read as enabling the authority to do anyth
        which is not ancillary to a power which is elsewhere conferred upon it. If this is right,
15      then taken with (a) it contradicts Mr Baker’s second argument which relies on
         s .lll(l).


1   8                                 There is no doubt that express powers are conferred on police authorities
         by a rafit of statutory provisions. Miss Baxendale says that such provisions support
         proposition (a) which I have set out, by application of the canon of statutory
fel     construction expressed by the Latin maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius. Thus,
         she submits, where Parliament has seen fit to confer a range of specific powers on
         police authorities, the intention must have been thereby to set the limits on what such
24 an authority may do and it cannot be supposed that s.6(l) provides an undefined and
          open-ended power to do anything else which the authority may choose, merely on the
          ground that in some way it may be said to support the general aim of “the
 27 maintenance of an efficient and effective police force” . The high water-mark of this
          submission is found in s.88(4) of the Act of 1996 which confers an express power to
          fund police officers’ costs in certain circumstances which do not include the defence
 30'      of private (or any) criminal prosecutions or participation in proceedings for judicial
          review.
                                                                                       - 27 -

                             I shall have to look in a little more detail at s.88(4). I have concluded,
however, that the correctness or otherwise of proposition (a) is not in the end at the
centre of the case. The reason is that in the particular statutory context proposition (b)
is in my judgment wrong; so that the SYPA is enabled by s. 111(1) (subject to
Wednesbury and Padfield) to finance D and M in the criminal and judicial review
proceedings even if s.6(l) confers no powers as such.


                             The scheme of the Act of 1996 involves the distribution of
responsibilities between three bodies: the Chief Constable, the Secretary of State, and
the police authority. The Chief Constable’s role is principally given by s. 10:
              “(1) A police force maintained under section 2 shall be under the direction
              and control of the chief constable appointed under s .ll."

              (2) In discharging his functions, every chief constable shall have regard to
              the local policing plan issued by the police authority for his area under
              section 8.”

(S. 11 provides for the appointment and removal of the Chief Constable, by the police
authority with the approval of the Secretary of State.) I should notice also ss.22(l) and
44(4):
              “22(1) Every chief constable shall, as soon as possible after the end of each
              financial year, submit to the police authority a general report on the
              policing during that year of the area for which his force is maintained.”

              “44(4) Every chief constable shall, as soon as possible after the end of each
              financial year, submit to the Secretary of State the like report as is required
              by section 22(1) to be submitted to the police authority.”

The role of the Secretary of State is principally given by ss.36 and 37(1):


              “36(1) The Secretary of State shall exercise his powers under the provisions
              of this Act referred to in subsection (2) in such manner and to such extent
              as appears to him to be best calculated to promote the efficiency and
              effectiveness                 of                 the                police.”

               37(1) The Secretary of State may by order determine objectives for the
              policing of the areas of all police authorities established under section 3.”
                                                                             -28-

As regards the Secretary of State s position I should notice also these provisions of the
Act of 1996:
              “38(1) Where an objective has been determined under section 37, the
              Secretary of State may direct police authorities to establish levels of
              performance (performance targets to be aimed at in seeking to achieve the
              objective.

               39(1) The Secretary of State may issue codes of practice relating to the
               discharge by police authorities established under section 3 of any of their
               functions.”

The role of the police authority is given first by the subsections of s.6 which follow
 subsection (1):
               “6(2) In discharging its functions, every police authority established under
               section 3 shall have regard to -
               (a) any objectives determined by the Secretary of State under section 37,
               (b) any objectives determined by the authority under section 7,
               (c) any performance targets established by the authority, whether in
               compliance with a direction under section 38 or otherwise, and
               (d) any local policing plan issued by the authority under section 8.

                (3) In discharging any function to which a code of practice issued under
                section 39 relates, a police authority established under section 3 shall have
                regard                      to                    the                    code.

                (4) A police authority shall comply with any direction given to it by the
                Secretary of State under section 38 or 40.”

 These provisions, of course, confer duties rather than powers. In relation to the police
  authority I should next notice ss.7 - 9:
                “7(1) Every police authority established under section 3 shall, before the
                beginning of each financial year, determine objectives for the policing of the
                authority's           area            during            that            year.

                 (2) Objectives determined under this section may relate to matters to which
                 objectives determined under section 37 also relate, or to other matters, but

              (3) Before determining objectives under this section, a police authority shall

              (a) consult the chief constable for the area, and
              (b) consider any views obtained by the authority in accordance with
              arrangements made under section 96.

              8(1) Every police authority established under section 3 shall, before the
              beginning of each financial year, issue a plan setting out the proposed
              arrangements for the policing of the authority's area during the year (the
              local                           policing                            plan).

              (2) The local policing plan shall include a statement of the authority's
              priorities for the year, of the financial resources expected to be available
              and of the proposed allocation of those resources, and shall give particulars
              of -
              (a) any objectives determined by the Secretary of State under section 37,
              (b) any objectives determined by the authority under section 7, and
              (c) any performance targets established by the authority, whether in
              compliance with a direction under section 38 or otherwise.

              (3) A draft of the local policing plan shall be prepared by the chief
              constable for the area and submitted by him to the police authority for it to
              consider.

              (4) Before issuing a local policing plan which differs from the draft
              submitted by the chief constable under subsection (3), a police authority
              shall          consult           the           chief           constable.

              (5) A police authority shall arrange for every local policing plan issued by it
              under this section to be published in such manner as appears to it to be
              appropriate, and shall send a copy of the plan to the Secretary of State.

              9(1) As soon as possible after the end of each financial year every police
              authority established under section 3 shall issue a report relating to the
              policing     of     the     authority's     area     for     the     year.

              (2) A report issued by a police authority under this section for any year
              shall include an assessment of the extent to which the local policing plan for
              that year issued under section 8 has been carried out.

              (3) A police authority shall arrange for every report issued by it under this
              section to be published in such manner as appears to it to be appropriate,
              and shall send a copy of the report to the Secretary of State.”

              (2) Subject to any regulations under the Police Pensions Act 1976, all

              expenditure of the authority shall be paid out of that fund.

               (3) Accounts shall be kept by each police authority of payments made into
               or out of the police fund.”

Thens.43(l):
               “A police authority shall, whenever so required by the Secretary of State,
               submit to the Secretary of State a report on such matters connected with
               the discharge of the authority's functions, or otherwise with the policing of
               its area, as may be specified in the requirement.”

S.92:
               “(1) The council of a county, district, county borough or London borough
               may make grants to any police authority established under section 3 whose
               police area falls wholly or partly within the county, district, county borough
               or                                                                    borough.

               (3) Grants under this section may be made unconditionally or, with the
               agreement of the chief officer of police for the police area concerned,
               subject to conditions.”

S.96:

               “(1) Arrangements shall be made for each police area for obtaining -
                  (a) the views of people in that area about matters concerning the
                  policing of the area, and
                  (b) their co-operation with the police in preventing crime in that area.

               (2) Except as provided by subsections (3) to (6), arrangements for each
               police area shall be made by the police authority after consulting the chief
               constable as to the arrangements that would be appropriate.”



                              Looking at the whole picture displayed by these provisions, it is clear
that the Chief Constable is in charge of day-to-day policing (s. 10(1)); the police
 authority has a role in relation to policy, or strategy (ss.7, 8 and other provisions); but
 this is subject to the overall direction of the Secretary of State (ss.37, 38, 39 and other
                                                                             -3 1 -

             provisions, taken with s.6((2) - (4)). The police authority holds the purse (s. 14). Those
             provisions specifically concerned with the police authority's role confer duties rather
     3       than powers, though in some cases there is clearly a discretion as to how the duty is to
             be performed (as for example under s.37). Other powers (including those contained in
             s. 111(1)) are conferred on the police authority by the local government legislation, to
     6       the extent that measures there contained were applied to police authorities by
             s,146A(l) of the Act of 1972. The powers so conferred are listed in a helpful note
             provided by Miss Baxendale. I do not propose to set them out. They include (apart
     9       from s. 111(1)) such matters as the disposition and treatment of staff and the
             acquisition and disposal of land.


    12                                    The critical point which in my judgment emerges from a consideration
             of the interlocking roles of Chief Constable, Secretary of State and police authority is
             that it cannot have been within the contemplation of Parliament in enacting the
    15       scheme, and in embracing within it s. 111(1), that the police authority should only be
             empowered to incur expenditure in support of those duties, and ancillary powers,
             which are specifically conferred upon it. The police authority holds the funds from
    18       which expenses for its local police force will be supplied: s. 14. It is inherent in the
             system (as Mr Baker submitted in reply) that the Chief Constable will apply to the
             authority for authorisation to incur expenditure; it may be for the use of resources such
*            as helicopters, or the installation of video surveillance systems in city streets, or a host
             of other things. No doubt the Chief Constable presents a general budget. We were not
             referred to any provision in statute which shows or suggests that the police authority’s
    24       power to accede to such requests rests in anything other than the combination of s.6(l)
             and s. 111(1). Given this, it seems to me plain that, in the particular context before us
             in this case, the legitimate scope of the ancillary power provided by s. 111(1) cannot be
    27       restricted so as to support only those powers and duties which are expressly conferred
             on the police authority. Those powers and duties are themselves ancillary; though they
             are very important, they take second place to the Chief Constable’s tactical role, and
    30   -   second place also to the Secretary of State’s strategic role. S. 111(1) must in context
             (whatever it does in other cases) allow the police authority to support what its express
                                                                                           -32-

powers and duties also support; and this is no lesF than its general function conferred
by s.6(l). If that is right, the authority may in principle decide to fund officers' legal
representation in proceedings no less than they may fund any other activity which the
Chief Constable might propose as being conducive to “the maintenance of an
efficient and effective police force for its area” .


                              This result is supported, if only ex silentio, by the decision of this court
in R v Derbyshire Police Authority ex p. Wilson (8 August 1989, unreported save in
 The Times). The court had to consider a decision of the police authority not to
contribute to the legal expenses of two police officers in relation to an auditor’s
enquiry. The court assumed that s.4 of the Police Act 1964 (the predecessor of s.6(l))
provided the power to grant financial assistance. However the point of principle was
not argued. The applicants also point to other materials. In 1962 the report of the
 Royal Commission on the Police was published. It indicated the then current practice
 in relation to the provision of financial support to police officers in civil proceedings,
 which included a requirement that “a constable must have acted in good faith in the
 intended execution of his duty” (para 196(a)). Para 197 stated:
                “In England and Wales a distinction is made between a private prosecution,
                in which the decision as to the support of the constable will be taken on the
                same basis as in the case of a civil action, and a public prosecution brought
                by the police or the Director of Public Prosecutions.”

 Home Office Circular 77/1987, published on 4 December 1987, stated:

                “... acting in pursuance of its general statutory duty to maintain an
                adequate and efficient police force for its area, the police authority has
                discretion to meet expenditure incurred by officers in all kinds of legal
                proceedings where the officers have acted in good faith in pursuance of
                their duties, or the interests of the force as a whole are involved...
                [Then under the heading “Private Prosecutions”]
                A police officer should be able to carry out his duties in the confidence that,
                if he acts in good faith and exercises his judgment reasonably, his police
                authority will support him. If, in a case where a member of the public
                brings a prosecution against an officer, the authority is satisfied that the
                officer has acted in this way, the authority should provide or fund legal
                advice and/or representation.”

                                                                            -33-

           On 17 February 1998 Home Office Circular 4/1998 was published. Unlike its
         predecessor it sits on the fence as regards the power of a police authority to fund
    3    defences to private prosecutions. It has no persuasive effect one way or the other upon
         the issues in these proceedings. The earlier Circular, though obviously not a source of
         law, may possibly possess some force as regards the purposes to be fulfilled by
    6    s.6(l)’s predecessor in s.4(l) of the Police Act 1964: see per Scarman LJ as he then
         was in Bristol DC v Clark [1975] 3 AER 976, referred to in Wilson. But there are
         great dangers in treating government pronouncements, however helpful, as an aid to
     9   statutory construction. I would prefer to base my conclusion, that s. 111(1) in principle
         empowers the SYPA to support D and M’s defence (and their participation in the
0        judicial review against the DPP), upon those considerations touching the correct
    12   construction of the material statutory provisions which I have already set out.


                                      If my Lords agree with this conclusion, it is enough to dispose of the
    15   case in the applicants’ favour. However we heard much argument on the question
         whether s.6(l) conferred on the police authority any power, in any circumstances, to
         take action not otherwise expressly authorised. This engages Miss Baxendale’s
    18   proposition (a) as I have described it, and her reliance on the expressio unius est
         exclusio alterius doctrine. It only has relevance if I am wrong to hold, as I have done,
         that s. 111(1) in principle enables the SYPA to fund D and M even if s.6(l) does not
     1   itself empower the authority to do anything. In this context I will deal only (and that
         shortly) with s.88(4) of the Act of 1996, which as I have said is the high water-mark of
         this part of Miss Baxendale’s argument.
    24
                                       S.88 contains a comprehensive scheme as to liability on the part of the
         police for torts. By ss.(l) the chief officer of police for a police area is liable in
    27   respect of torts committed by constables under his direction and control in the
         performance or purported performance of their functions. Without this provision there
          would be no such liability because police officers are not servants but office-holders.
    30   Ss.(2) provides in part:
                        “There shall be paid out of the police fund -
                                                                                     -34-

 6    Ss. (4) provides:-
                     “A police authority may, in such cases and to such extent as appear to it to
                     be appropriate, pay out of the police fund -
 9                         (a) any damages or costs awarded against a person to whom this
                            subsection applies in proceedings for a tort committed by that
                            person,
12                         (b) any costs incurred and not recovered by such a person in such

                            that has or might have given rise to such proceedings.”

       In my judgment this provision offers no support for Miss Baxendale’s reliance on the
18    exclusio alterius rule. S.88 is self-standing. It has no implications for the general reach
       of the police authority’s functions. And once s.88(4) was to allow the police authority
       to cover damages awarded against an officer in a tort action, it is no surprise that it
21    covers costs as well. If it did not, there might well be an argument - based on the
       exclusio alterius rule - that costs were deliberately excluded.

24
                                    In all these circumstances I do not think it necessary to go into the
       legislative history of s.6(l), or to canvass the arguments which were addressed to us as
27     to the construction or effect of its predecessor, s.4(l) of the Police Act 1964. In the
       end there are two possibilities: s.6(l) empowers the police authority to do things, or it
       does not. I have so far proceeded on the assumption asserted by Miss Baxendale that it
30     does not; but given that assumption, nevertheless for reasons I have sought to explain
       the SYPA possesses in principle the legal power to fund D and M.


33                                  In fact I think the better view is that s.6(l) enables the police authority to
       do things which reasonably support the function which s.6(l) confers. Such a power is
     • by no means open-ended. It would not allow the authority to invade the provinces of


                                                                                  -3 5 -

           considerable constraint.

                                        In the course of argument some time was spent, in fairness at the
           encouragement of the court, in seeing whether the specific provisions in the Act of
    6       1996 or the local government legislation, conferring specific powers on the police
           authority, left gaps which only s.6(1) could fill. Points were made about lower ranks
           rights of representation in legal proceedings, which are covered as appropriate by the
    9      Police Federation; and about the representation of higher ranks in various forms of
           legal proceedings. But the answer to the question we must decide, whether the power
0          to fund D and M in principle lies in the hands of the SYPA, cannot in my judgment
12          depend on a trawl through all the things a police authority is expressly empowered to
            do. The provisions which expressly confer and impose powers and duties on police
            authorities do not constitute an independent code. The police authority’s functions are,
15          to use a questionable modernism, symbiotic with those of the Chief Constable and the
            Secretary of State. So judged, and for the reasons I have given, they allow the use of
            s. 111( 1) to fund officers in the defence of private prosecutions and in judicial review
18          proceedings.


                                          I would allow this application. It will be appropriate to hear counsel as

^            to relief, and costs.

             I agree.

              I also agree.

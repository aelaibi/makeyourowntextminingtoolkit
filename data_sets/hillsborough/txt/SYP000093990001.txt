               I can remember whilst                 being moved forwards                 down pen number                  four that

                       the game    had been stopped,           I can remember seeing a large number                     of

                   supporters        being on the         pitch together with some of the football



                   After        the time    that    I believe       the game had been stopped              I was still

                   w h i 1st gra du al ly being m oved forwards                 down the terracing          I saw the

                   bodi es of two male             persons    draped over a crush barrier,                 both of these

                   people were          doubled over the barrier,               their     bodies were      lifeless and

                       limp,    they were    pinned up against           the    crush barier        by the weight and

                   volume        of people who were          crushed up behind them.

                   As     I was    pushed    past    this    barrier      it was     immediately to my           left side

                   and     I could see that          the barrier        ran from this          point    to the dividing

                    about this second person or the c l o n e s he was wearing

                       I have    been shown a plan of pervs^fhay^i /and four which                       incorporates        the

                       these    two males.

       ^\'*r       At the time          I saw these       persons    over    the    crush barrier,         I was    of the

opinion that            if they were        not dead they were             certainly          in a state of

complete        unconsciousness.

Having     seen these           two     persons    I was    pushed further             forwards     down the

terracing and towards                   the front       perimeter       fence    until       even tu al ly the

forw ar d m ov ement           stopped an d       I found myself          in a position about             ten or

twelve     feet away           from the     front perimeter fence and                  in     a midway

position        in that        pen.

After a further               few minute s    I deci de d to try and make my way back up

the     terracing        to    leave     through the       central       tunnel    beneath the West

Stand,     the tunnel           I had used to           initially get           onto the terraces.

1    cannot     be   precise about          what    time    I started           to force my way back up

the     terracing,        I think        I had been       in the    pen for some             time   between ten

and fifteen minutes,                  I hadn't     noticed muc h about            the events w hich were

o ccurring       on the        pitch.      1 can say that at the time                   I star te d to force

my way back up the               terracing.         I had not seen an a mbulance                    on the

pitch,     al                                                                                 "with people

the dividing            fence    to escape        the    crush at the front             of    pen number     four.

As    I worked my way back up pen number                         four    I saw another           person who

was     lying on his           back across        the    concrete       steps    of the terracing.             I

was     facing up the terracing               towards the West Stand and this man was                              in

front     of me to my           right with his head towards                 pen number           five and his

feet facing          towards      the dividing           fence    between       pen numbers         four and

three.

Whe n    I saw this man            I thought       that    he was       dead,    his    face was      very   pale

and his       lips were a blue             colour,       as best as       I can remember            his eyes

were     open and a p p e ar e d to be protruding a bn or m ai l y from their

sockets.         This man was            limp and lifeless.

1 would describe               this man as a white male? aged                   in 'ry is late forties         or

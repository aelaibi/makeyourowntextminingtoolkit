        IDENCE TO LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S INQUIRY

    Bob Whalley has been discussing with us the arrangements for
    submitting evidence to the Taylor Inquiry. As you know, oral
    evidence is being taken now and Sir Peter Taylor has asked that
    written evidence should be submitted to him by 12 June.

    My side of the Home Office will be preparing written evidence on
    the rationale for Part II of the Football Spectators Bill and on
    any other measures which the Home Office, rather than ACPO, have
    taken to promote effective crowd control with a view to preventing
    public disorder on football occasions.

    Bob Whalley will be approaching ACPO direct about the written
    evidence that they might submit.

    No doubt you will wish to organise within DOE evidence on the
    rationale for Part I of the Bill or for any other ideas that are
    likely to emerge in Parliament in this connection in the next few
    weeks. '

    Written evidence should be submitted to Bob Whalley at his Home
    Office address.

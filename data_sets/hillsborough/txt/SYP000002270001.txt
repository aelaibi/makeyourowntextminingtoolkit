             been a season ticket holder for at                least twenty years.       I have

             attended matches       in all    parts of the country and abroad with Liver poo!

             F ootbal1 Club.



             I obtained a ticket for the semi--final football match between

             Liverpool and Notts Forest to be played at Hillsborough,                    Sheffield on

             Saturday    15th April      1989 (150489)      from Anfield through my season

             ticket      The ticket was for the West Stand and cost £12 or £14.



             On the day of the match          I drove to Sheffield in my car and also took
                                                                                           PAGE

       my son                                          and Christophe         ARDS      I have

       known the EDWARDS            family for many y e a r s .   Mrs EDWARDS, Christophers

       mother did work for me for several years and I have known Christopher

       all his life, and have taken him to matches on numerous occasions

       be f o r e .



       We left Liverpool            at about quarter to half        past twelve   <1145 ~ 1230)

       and I picked up Christopher EDWARDS from his house.                    I have been to

       Sheffield on various occasions on business and to football matches at

       Hillsborough so I knew my way and by taking various routes                      I arrived

       in Sheffield at about 2.20 pm <1420)                wi thout any serious hold u p s .



       On arriving at Sheffield             I parked my car in a street at the rear of

       the Spion Kop end of Hillsborough Ground.                    Having attended the ground

       before         I knew that    1 could walk alongside the ground to the Leppings

       Lane end where our tickets were for.                  As we tried to walk to the far

       end of the ground along our normal                 route we were prevented from

       walking along these streets              by Police Officers who were stationed at

       the end of each of the small              roads.    Because of us being       prevented

       from walking along these             roads it took us approx twenty minutes to

       reach the Leppings Lane end of the ground,                  which would have only

       taken a few minutes            if we could have walked through the blocked off

       streets.         Because     these streets were blocked large numbers of fans had

       to do the walk around as we did and this caused a lot of the problems

       outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles.



       On reaching the Leppings Lane turnst\l^s                   there was a large

          sorganised crowd all attempting to get into the ground.                      I saw a

o r    number of fans climbing over the wall                by the turnstiles.        There was
U H    only one policeman I saw by the turnstiles and he looked like a

            Special Constable,         and I would not blame him for anything that

        ♦    happened at the turnstile,            I felt sorry for him.



            We were all       together    in the crowd          side the turnstiles,       myself, my

             son and Christopher EDWAItDS^'we were pushed around but it was not any

            worse than a normal          big match and in fact        I have been in worse crowd

             crushes at other grounds            in the    country.   We entered the ground

             through the turnstile and gave up our^JLA. ck e t s , at this t ime it was

            about twenty to three          (144C



             Once   inside the ground my son and myself went up the stepj^at the rear

             of the West stand to our seats and Christopher ED^ABffB left us and

             went to the Leppings Lane terrace because he had a ticket for the

             te r race      "his was the       last time    I saw Christopher alive

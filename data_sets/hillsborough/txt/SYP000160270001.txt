           Peter,

           Here is the promised draft.  It is rather long, but I
           find that such documents, once drafted, are easier to
           cut down than to expand.

TO;     Officers of the South Yorkshire Police
        submitting evidence to the West Midlands
        Police in connection with the public inquiry
        into the disaster at Hillsborough Stadium


FROM:   Hammond Suddards




Dear Officer,


My firm is acting on behalf of the South Yorkshire

Police in the preparation and presentation of evidence

to be submitted to the inquiry.



As part of this process, I requested that all Officers

directly concerned should, as soon as possible, prepare

a note of their recollections, in the form of a

statement, but including also matters of comment and

impression, whether or not this amounted to evidence,

as we normally understand the term.



Officers have responded magnificently to this request

and have provided, perhaps at some personal cost in the

recollection, graphic and direct accounts of the events

in which they were concerned, including, as requested,

matters of hearsay and comment.     These accounts are of

immense value to our Counsel in the preparation of a

case to ensure that no unjust criticism is directed at

any Officer of the South Yorkshire Police.




                                              /...   contd.
                        - 2 -



Subsequently, and as a separate matter, the South

Yorkshire Police were advised by the West Midlands

Police that, as they had insufficient manpower to take

formal statements from relevant Officers of the South

Yorkshire Police in the time available, it would be

appreciated if South Yorkshire Police Officers, who

were at Hillsborough, could effectively prepare their

own factual statements for submission to the inquiry.

This was agreed to in order to assist the West Midlands

Police.   The obvious way of proceeding was to look

at the statements which had been prepared at our

request, on the basis that if matters of hearsay and

comment could be removed, these would be suitable to

stand in the place of the factual statements which the

West Midlands Police would have taken had time

permitted.



Concern has been expressed to me personally and to

Senior Officers about the process of preparing

statements for submission to the West Midlands Police.



What must be kept in mind is that the statements for

submission to our own Counsel were intended to have an

entirely different purpose to those submitted to the

West Midlands Police.



The best comparison which I can give is in the

difference between the content of a report which

accompanies a prosecution file sent to CPS and the


                                          /... contd.
                         - 3 -



content of the CJA statements travelling with the file.

Invariably, the report includes many matters of comment

which are intended to assist the Crown Prosecutor in

presenting the case and in cross examining Defence

witnesses.   The CJA statements, on the other hand,

contain the facts to which the witness can depose under

oath in Court.



In the present case, the initial statements which were

requested effectively form a mixture of items which

would belong in the report and items which would belong

in the CJA statements.   My task in looking at those

statements has been to remove matters which would belong

in the report and to leave only those matters which

would belong in the statements.



My understanding is that statements which are submitted

to the West Midlands inquiry may be taken into account

in reaching conclusions, whether or not the Officer

making the statement is called as a witness.     It

follows that, where statements contain passages which

are critical of other Officers, senior or junior, I

have suggested that those should not be allowed to

stand, unless they amount to direct factual

observations, as opposed to matters of impression.

This seems to me only fair to the Officers concerned,

who may otherwise find some criticism recorded against

them, which they have not the slightest opportunity of

testing in cross examination.

I hope that this clarifies the position but, if any

Officer has a specific point which he wishes to take

up, then I will be pleased to deal with this.




Yours sincerely,

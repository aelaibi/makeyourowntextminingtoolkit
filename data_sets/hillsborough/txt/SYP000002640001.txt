At      about         2.15        pm we a r r i v e d                  in    S heffled and             parked         the       coach            on     the

There          was      only         one       occasion                that       the       Police     diverted            the      coach              to

This       struck           me     as    being       strange       also           because              there       is u s u a l l y       someone

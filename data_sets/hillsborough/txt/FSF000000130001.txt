               HILLSBGRGfJGH IS'QUBST ~ WH5SE ASE THE FANS?

The inquest into the deaths that occured at the Hillsborough Stadium
                 r &y‘ ThS FSA haS 136811 lavitad tD represent supporters,
as it did at the Taylor Inquiry. However, the Taylor Inquiry agreed to
riLn    k    k   thQ FSA laWyQrs’ but unfortunatly for this hearing no
funding has been made available and we therefore ws cannot play a
similar role, The PSA feels that it is abeolutly vital that it be
represented and we have requested funding from the Football Trust which
wae unfartunatly not forthcoming.


4w  S^ rS^ ^ , tl,e F? i,S        Cbair*E, today said "I do not bellevs
that the findings of this inquest will carry the validity that is
desirable if the fans, through the FSA, are not properly'represented m
order to ensure that critlcie M of supporters      considered i f f
balanced way, It ie essentia] that we be there. Ve are therefore todav
appealing direct to the Horns Secretary for funding.”

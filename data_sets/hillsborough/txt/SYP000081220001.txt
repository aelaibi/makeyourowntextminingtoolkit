              I am a married woman living at the above address with r^y husband.                           For

              the last 3 years          I have followed jfn d supported Liverpool Football

              Heart of England Liy/poqft Supporter's Club and regularly travel                        to

              most of the games? I am a season tick^T holder^      The Supporters Club

              is based in Coventry and run by>                 In April this year we

              i nf o rmed                  that we intended to travel to Hillsborough on 15th v

              April   (150489)        for the FA cup semi final, Liverpool against

              Nottingham Forest,          I had a season ticket allocated as I was a season

              ticket holder.



              On 15th April,          1989 (150489) my husband and myself left the house at

              about 9.30 am (0930 hrs) and travelled into Nuneaton, where we would
                                                                            PAGE      2
                                                                            S 2548

get on the S u pp or te r’s coach.     We got to Nuneaton in my F a t h e r ’s car,

he dropped us off fay the Parish Church,         where we were due to meet the

coach at 9.45 am <0945 hrs).



There were approximately 12 other people waiting to get the coach at

our pick up point.



The coach arrived on time and we boarded and took seats on the offside

of the coach near to the front.          Host of the other people on the coach

are aquai ntances through the Supporter's Club and I ca n’t say I know

them personally.     They are regulars on the coach.



The coach then went on to the next stop and pick up at H i n k 1e y , where

about 6 - 8 people boarded.          Then the coach went on to Leicester where

approximately six more     people got on.       The coach then went on to

Shef f ie1d.



We arrived in Sheffield about ff.OjB pm <1400 h r s ) and the co*yCh parked

where all the other suppo r te r ’ai/coaches were      parked,   thislwas about a

mile from the ground.      As we were about to leave the coach.

      asked for our prompt return to the coach after the match and we

alighted from the coach with the other people                we then walked

towards the ground.



        and I walked with three others, I gfoly know their Christian
       Wfo/Jg,7.        Al*
name s ,            and          % e arrivied at the turnsti 1 es at

Leppings Ln at about 2.30 pm <1430 h r / ) the queues were fairly large

but orderly and there were         people atput asking for any spare tickets,



       and I went through the \uf>nstiles quite quickly,           had a coffee

                                                                          S 2548

and went to our seats    in the North/Stand
                                North       f        about 2.45 pm <1445 hrs).



As I looked towards the Leppirras Ln terraces        I could see that the two

middle    pens were obviously fulll, bun, the outer terraces were not full

at all, with plenty of space.      mter   the kick off I became aware that

there was a problem in the Leppings Ln terraces,         but was unable to

tell what the problem was as the match was stopping,           I saw a lad about

20 he walked along the track past our stand and itiwas obvious he had

a serious arm injury.     He was being attended by d St John's Ambulance

man.     Back at the Leppings Ln end people were j^ming onto the pitch

over the fence.     I thought at first it was ^ p i t c h    invasion but as I

watched it became apparent that there was d problem in that end,            but I

didn't realise at that time the s e v e r i w ^ f   what was happening.



We eventually left the ground at about 4.30 pm and made our way back

to the coach, we arrived back at the coach just before 5.00 pm (1700

hrs) and most of the people who travelled on our coach had returned,

and as we got settled on the coach it became apparent that two people

who had sat at the back of the coach were missing.           We stayed till

about 6.00 pm (1800 hrs) and were then advised by the Police to carry

on which we did.



I d i d n ’t find out till Monday 17th                   70489)   that the two

people who had been missing off ou                       act died in the

disaster.     I didn't know the two 1                    ut can remember them

boarding the coach at Leicester bu                          seeing them again

that day.

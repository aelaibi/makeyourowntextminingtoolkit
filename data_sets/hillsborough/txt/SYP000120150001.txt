                                    to assist search of Nottingham supporters prior to entry.

                                    Mostly good humoured, some carrying cans of <5rink and

                                    apparently were unaware on restrictions to entry with/when

                                    intoxicants/ed.        A good proportion had obviously drunk some

                                    intoxicants but all were well behaved.          (My serial only

                                    arrested 3 for drunk trying to enter).          The Nottingham

                                    half a dozen never seemed to materialise.

                                    Operationally they posed no problem, not all the gates

                                    There were some Liverpool supporters with Nottingham end-

  wer* carrying cans of drink.                 They were advised accordingly            ,

  as regards entry.        Some of |hese supporters sat on the wall

  opposite the ground outside Charlie Brbwns - drinking from

  One man in his S O ’s^was selling tickets for the Nottingham

  It was about now I heard faessage on radio to effect " O p e n the

to Penistone Road to collect my serial to take them to

standby <Phase 2) at Leppings Lane End/South Stand.

from the door of the gym Insp. Sewell shouted me over and
tf’
asked me as to our duties and whereabouts of Insp. Beresford.

I told him we were covering Penistone Road and Inspector

was writing up his prisoner, with PC 2435 (he was still in

Police room documenting).   I was asked to bring my serial to

the gym immediately/ I went to round them up and told

Infijp. Booth/PS Hoyland that we had been taken off turnstiles,

although by now every few people about.    I took my serial to

'the/gym.-

Insp. Sewell instructed me to like my serial to the Leppings

Lane end as there was some unspecified disturbance/trouble

Insp. Beresford/PC 2435 were not with us - I took 8 PC's

onto pitch at ramp between Kop and North Stand.    As we walked

onto the side of the pitch the game had started - Liverpool      .

wesre playing to Kop end.   I looked to Leppinga Lane end and

could see supporters on the fence, on the inside not on.top

and I could see a few officers at that end on the track.

We Walked along the front of the North Stand #nd became aware

of a few supporters on the pitch at the LeppinfS Laine end,

some were just straying onto the pitch.    I asked them to

move of the playing surface, a couple were sat with their         1

backs to advertisement hoardings - I told them to move back       j

to the fencing at the Leppings Lane end.   There was no           j

undue alarm with these supporters - they were still watching

the match.  I then realised tljat the Liverpool supporters   j

were climbing out of the :Leppings Lane end and trying to get

into the North Stand.   We were near corner flag by now but

still no understanding of panic or alarm from supporters on

                             (Game stopped).

                             § walked along touchline from corner (Between N and W)

                             towards the goal asking supporters to keep off pitch and keep

                             caiia (supporters now wer numbered in 10 ’s)

                             I assumed match would restart after pitch had been cleared

                             as it was only overspill.

                             AT the left side of the goal (Facing L.L. end) I saw a man                           '

                             being given mouth to mouth by officers and then * iaam start®#

                             thumped his chest.               His colour was blue/grey.           I thought tht

                             at a semi final, there were photographers jostling to get         ‘

                             photographs of the man on the floor.                        I thought I would be

                             able to see it on               Match of the Day,

                             I then started to               realise that things were getting out of

                             notfaial proportions and a lot of supporters were on the

                             pitch all obviously suffering from crushing ^ f e e l i n g faint -

                             gasping for air               - and it was hot and especially in ari

                             Oveirpacked pen.              I could imagine some fainting.          More and

                             more people          were being carried out and being given mouth

                             to mouth,      I realised it was serious.                   I tried to call for

                             stretchers but all radio transmissions were incomprehensible.

                             I saw M r . Greenwood stood by the left hand goat post trying

                             ta Use the radio but he couldn't get through.                        I said let's

                             get the injured               off the pitch into the gym.          He said

                             "Yes do it."            I spoke to officers nearby and told them              to get

                             the injured moving into the gym, and everybody else VOuld

                             follow,'.

Photographers were pushing around the goal area trying to

get close ups of the injured/dead and I started pushing them

£way, supporters were incensed by their behaviour - it was

obscene..

It appeared the main problep was the gate to Pen 3, it was

crowded with officers/supporters trying to pull injured

through.    With PC 2130 Frost we managed to get to the gate

and at this point i realised the enormity of what had

happened,   there were two piles of bodies.^ n ^ ^ o the left

in the corner of the pen and one to theJL^&fe^of the gate

and directly under it, in the well beneath tl^e low concrete

wall,   They were all a pale grey colour with their mouths          •]

open - they were dead - some were twitching - I couldn’t

believe what I was looking at.     I then saw a man to my right

hanging onto the fence but trapped by his legs entwine^irl

the pile of bodies.     I then realised other people fjeremoyinf

and were alive but trapped by their legs.

Between the two piles      bodies was a clear area and t could

see a barrier had buckled, th^ right hand upright had folded

at the base where it went into the concrete step amd it had

buckled in a downward, forward arc to the left,      the cross

section was bowed.    The few steps behind the barrier were

clear and the remainder of the crowd were at the back of

the pens by the mouth of the tunnel.

I saw PC 1535 Fairclough sat on one of the ^teps trying to          !

pull somebody out from the pile of bodies,    he was crying.        j

Some supporters were angry, shouting at us, blaming us but          ]

it was difficult to understand what they were saying.         It    j

was either "Why did you open the gate? (one outside) Or             |

"Why d i d n ’t you open the gate?” (The one onto the pitch from j

Pen 3)     They shouted this voer and ov e r .

The blockage to gate 3 was being caused by a fat man who

^as dead, on top of the pile, his feet were trapped near the

base of the wall under the gate, and he was lying backwards

over the top of the pile.      Ifis shirt was up over his face.

He was first which had to be moved.        PC Frost and myself

managed to get into the pen and stood on the wall either

side of the gate, I was on the right he was on the left.

All the bodies seemed to have been sick and it hid run down

over the bodies into the well beneath t h e ^ a l l and T t was

swilling around my feet.      I could just about standi in the

well and hold onto the fence and I started to disentangle

the legs of the fat man, everybody had urinated themselves

I became aware of a strong and obvious smell Of beer/lager

some had even defaecated.                         .                        ;

AS I was pulling legs and moving the bodies up so they could

be pulled out onto the pitch I became a w a r e o f some pulling

on the bottom of my trdusers,      I could see a hand from the

bottom of the pile of bodies grabbing my trousers ~ somebody ^

war-srtll 1 alive.   The pulling on Bay trouser leg stopped.                   '<

Ch. Supt. Nesbit was by the gate on the pitch organising/

officers to pull bodies away, I could hear Su pt. G r e e n w o o d
                                                                               !
on a megaphone shouting orders.       PC Frost and myself were                 j

pulling legs apart and handing bodies up to Mr. Nesbit and                     j

he was pulling them away.      A large black     man suddenly came             j

from the pen and in a frenzy of strength moved bodies up                       j

to Mr. Nesbit, he eventually was ushered         away.     Once the

fat man had been moved the pile of bodies was cleared fairly

quickly,    the body at the bottom was that of a young child

lying face down, I passed it up onto the pitch.
           By this time the pen was nearly empty but some supporters

           had helped me move the bodies, a lot of people were crying

           When the pen was clear I went back onto the pitch - bodies

           were lying everywhere - photographers were acting like

           vultures still trying to get the best pictures,         I started

           pushing them away.    It was clear to the majority in the
I
           ground what had happened - Liverpool supporters started to

           migrate to the Kop end - and by the feelings/expressions

           it was obvious there was going to be confrontation with the

           Nottingham supporters.     I went down

           Insp. Booth started to form a cordon across the pitch and

           once formed moved it up to the half-way line.           Liverpool

           supporters were ushered back towards the Leppings Lane end.

           The situation appeared to calm down.

           It was about 1545 - 1600 and I gathered my serial and

           assisted with crowd control behind the Leppings Lane end

           as Liverpool supporters were leaving.       It was all very

           subdued by now everybody knew what had happened.

"Yes     do      it»“      I spoke          to o f f icers    nearby and told them to get

follow.

obscene.

It a p p e a r e d     the mai n       prob l e m was       the gate       to Pen 3          it was

crowded w i t h o f f i c e r s / s u p p o r t e r s       trying    to    pull       injured

through.         W ith PC 2 130 Frost                we m a n a g e d to get       to the gate

a n d at    this       point       I realised        the    enormity of what             had

happened,        there were           two     piles      of.-bodies,       one    to the       left

in the      corner       of the        pen and one          to the     left      of the      gate

an d d i r e c t l y    under       it,    in the well          beneath the        low concrete

wall,      T h e y were all a pale                  grey    colour w i t h their mouths

open - they were               dead - some were twitching                     - I couldn't

b elieve what           I was       looking       at.      T then saw a man to my right

hanging       onto      the    fence       but    trap p e d by his        legs e n t w i n e d      in

the    pile of bodies.                 I then       realised other          people were moving

an d were alive              but    trap p e d    by their       legs.

B e t w e e n the      two    piles       of bodies was a clear are a and                      I could

see a barrier            had buckled,             the    right hand upright             had folded

at the      base where             it went       into    the    concrete      step and         it had

buckled       in a downward,               f o r w a r d arc    to the     left.       The     cross

sect i o n was         bowed.        The    few steps          behind the        barrier were

clear a n d the          remainder          of the       crowd were at           the   back     of

the    pens    by the m o u t h           of the     tunnel.

I saw PC       1335 F a i r c l o u g h       sat    on one      of the     steps      trying        to

pull    somebody         out       from the       pile     of bodies,       he was      crying.

Some    supporters            were angry,           shouting at       us,     blaming        us but

it was     difficult           to u n d e r s t a n d what they were             saying.            It

was either           "Why did you           open the        gate?    (one outside)             or

"Why didn't            you open the          gate?"        (The one onto         the    pitch from

The    blockage       to gate 3 was             being       caused by a fat man who

was    dead,     on top of the            pile,       his    feet were         tra p p e d    near    the

base, of the wall            under       the gate,          and he was         lying      backwards

over    the top of the             pile.        His    shirt was          up over      his     face.

He was       f i r s t .jiilwrcff had to be moved.                 PC Frost       and myself

managed       to get      into     the    pen and stood on the wall                       either

side    of the       gate,      I was     on the       right       he was      on the        left.

All    the    bodies      seemed       to have        been sick and            it had        run down

over    the    bodies       into      the well        beneath the wall              and      it was

swilling       ar o u n d my feet.             I could just about                stand       in the

well    and hold onto            the     fence and          I started to disent a n g l e

the    legs    of    the fat man,          everybody          had u r i nated        themselves

I became       aware      of a strong           and obvious          smell       of beer/lager

some    had even defaecated.

As    i was    pulling       legs and moving                the    bodies      up so they        could

be    pulled     out onto        the     pitch    I became aware               of some        pulling

on the bo t t o m of my trousers,                     I could see a hand from the

bottom of the            pile    of bodies        grabbing my trouser s - s o m e b o d y                       I

was    still    alive.          The    pulling        on my trouser            leg stopped.

Ch.    Supt.    Nesbit was            by the     gate       on the       pitch o r g a n i s i n g              j
of f icers     to    pull    bodies away,             I could hear Supt.               Greenwood

on a m e g a p h o n e    shouting        orders.           PC Frost and my self were

pulling       legs apart and             handing       bodies       up to Mr.        Nesbit and

he was       pulling     them away.            A large        black man         s u d denly     came

from    the    pen and       in a frenzy          of s t r ength m o v e d          bodiesjup

to Mr.       Nesbit,     he e v e n t u a l l y was         ushered away.            Once      the

fat man had          been m oved         the    pile    of bodies was             cleared fairly

quickly,       the    body at the          bottom was             that    of a young         child

lying    face       down,    I passed          it up onto          the    pitch.

By this       time    the    pen was       nearly       empty but          some     supporters

                    once        formed      moved        it     up         to   the        half-way          line.         Liverpool

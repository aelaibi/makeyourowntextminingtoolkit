Dear Colin

Many thanks for your letter of 22 January 1997 (Ref P&R/CM). I am most grateful to you
for bringing the enclosed documents to my attention.

As you may know I met with my parliamentary colleagues who represent constituencies in
Merseyside and Sheffield to discuss the Hillsborough tragedy before Christmas. I have
since written to, and received representations from, the maker of Granadaâ€™s drama-
documentary on the tragedy, and from the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police.

The matter has now been taken up with Michael Howard and I am awaiting his response. I
will of course keep you notified of any progress.

Best wishes.

Yours sincerely,

               I am a single man residing at the above address.

               Further    to my questionnaire that                   I made on Wed n e s d a y       15 November         1989

               (151189).

               I entered       pen t h r e e from pen two at about               two thirty.            (1430)     I gained
 f t
               access    by climbing over the dividing fence.                           I took up a position

               w hich was v i rtually          in the     centre of the         pen.      There was still quite a

               bit of    room in the         centre of the           pen at that time.              I have marked this

               position on the separate grid plan using the figure one.                                     I remained

               in that position as the pen was g r adually filling up.

               From two thirty onwards,               <1430)        there were steady surges               from the rear

               of the    pen.     The surges weren't very strong,                       and were normal           for a

               football    crowd.

               I saw the pla y ers..: come onto the pitch at about five to three                                  (1455).
                                                                                                      PAGE            E
                                                                                                      S3597
    As they,          did so,    there was a strong surge          f rom the      rear of the         pen.          I

    think        that this was       in response     to the     players    coming onto         the    pitch.

    The surge          carried me forwards         down the     pen,    and diagonally to my

    right.           The surge    carried me towards         the dividing        fence between pen

    three and pen two and               I became    pinned up against        the fence w ith the

    right side of my body up against                  it.     I was aware of a crush barrier

    in front of me,             about   two to three feet away.            I have m a r k e d this

    second position on the seperate                  grid plan using the figure                1A.     I

    could not a c t u a l l y see the pitch,           but    I was a ware of a large             cheer from

    the       crowd and shouts of "Come on you               red men".      The game had o b v iously

    kicked off.          During the next four to five minutes,                    the pressure was

    increasing all           the time and      I felt very c h l o s t a p h o b i c . My only

    thoughts were on getting out of the                     pen and had no interest             in what

    may have          been h a p pening on the pitch. I couldn't see the pitch anyway

    and have          no recollections       of anything that happe n e d on the pitch.                        At

a time that             I w o u l d estimate    to be about      five past three           (1305),         I

m a n a g e d to get a foot onto the barrier                   in front of m e f a n d wit h the

help of a foothold from a lad on the other                             side of the fence,            I got                    j
                                                                                                                              I
onto the              crush barrier and was able to climb over the fence a n d go                                   \j

barrier at about                five    past three    (1505),    the Whole barrier was                iptact,

and           people were still         leaning up agai n s t    it.      It was as       I was      climbing                 \

over           the fence     that    there was a second st r o n g surge           in pen t h r e e .          It

was an obvious surge w h i c h sent                  people forwards        in the     pen;       At the

same           time as the surge,         I heard someb o d y say som e t h i n g like "Quasies

hit the crossbar" Quasie                   is short for Quasimodo,           which     is -a nickname

used by supporters                  for Peter Beardsley.         It was obvious           that B e a r d s l e y

had hit the             cross bar , although       I d i d n ’t a c t u a l l y see it.      AS s o o n as I

got           into   pen two,    I looked back       into pen three and could see the

           people    in the area behind the                crush barrier were all               leaning forwards.

           Their    bodies were angled forwards,                  and      people were      pressed up against

           the    person in front,          all al an angle of about forty five degrees.                                  The

           people    c o u l d n ’t move,    they were all          packed up against              the    person     in

           front while all          the other       people     in the      pen appeared        upright,        the

           people behind the          crush barrier were all at this                      forty five degree

           anqle towards       the pitch.

           Other    people were       trying to get out of pen three and                       I star t e d helping

           people out of       pen three.           Moments     later,      I saw a young           1ad being

           passed above       the    crowd towards where             I was standing behind the

           dividing    fence.        The young       lad a p p e a r e d   to have       come from the         centre

           of the pen and was          being       passed over       peoples heads,          feet first towards

           me.     He was facing upwards towards                  the sky.         The   lad was         passed

           towards the bottom right hand corner of the pen and was                                   passed over

           the front     perimeter       fence.          I saw the      lad as he was being passed

           down    in front of me about             three to four          feet away and could see that

           he was unconscious,           but still a p p eared to be breathing^

           The    lads face a p p e a r e d to be white and becoming paler.                         W h e n the lad

           was    passed over the fence,             he was     carried by other supporters a n d

           placed on the       playing surface of the                pitch near to the              right hand

           goalpost.      He was      lying on the six yard                line,    at a n angle w ith his

           head towards me and his feet towards                      the S p i o n Hop.        As soon as he was

           placed down,       I saw a man a p p r o a c h him and he had a look at the young

           lad.     Very shortly after,             the man placed a coat or possibly a track

   '       suit top over       the    lads       face.     I r ecognised the m a n that              covered the

                   would describe               the young       lad as about        s even or eight years                   of age.                                     He

                   was   fairly thin and had dark hair w h i ch was                           cut short w it h a fringe.

                   I think he wore a blue                    coloured Glas g o w Rangers             football            top which

                  was    short sleeved.                 The shirt was dark blue and had a motif across

                   the f r o n t , I'm not sure what                it said.          I cant remember a n y thing

                  else about his                clothing.       I would estimate             that    I saw that young                             lad

                  being passed out of the pen and being placed on the pitch at between

                  five     past and ten past three                  (1 S Q 3 - 1 5 1 0 ) .

                  At about          the same          time that    I first saw that young                 lad,         I also saw a

                  young girl w ho was                  pinned up against           the front        perimeter           f e n c e , in the

                  bottom right hand                   corner of pen three,            right    next to pen t w o .                She was

                  trapped        in the very corner               of the      pen, w ith her        body facing              towards'

                  the    pitch and her head was moving around.                               The girl      looked towards

                  her    right,           towards      pen two and I saw the side of her face.                              The girl

                  had the       look of desperation,                a final        look for     help.            f

                  There was nothing                   I could do,      it was      impossible to get at                   people                 in

                  that    corner,             the    pressure was      too    intense.        I carried on ass i s t i n g

                  people out of pen t h r e e .                 I would estimate             that   I saw that girl                      in the

          y^SL    corner of pen three at about                      seven or eight minutes                past three              (1307-

                  1508) .      She was still alive                then,      but    in a state of desperation.                                          I
    ,     ^                                                                   ^                              .



        -^JLS3/   now realise that the girl                     that       I saw was one of the Hicks sisters

L             rj that died at Hillsborough,                      a l t h o u g h I cant say w h i c h one               it was.                        I

                  recognised the girls                   face from m edia          coverage following Hillsborough.

                  The girl was wear i n g a                  jogging type top wit h a hood,                Icant          remember

                  the    colour          I didnt see         a n y thing else of her         clothing.

                  After a s s isting                people   out of pen three for some               time,            I became tired

                  and had severe                pain in      my right knee.         Beca u s e of this               I r e t i r e d to the

                  rear of the pen an d remained there.                             X did not go onto the                   p itch at                                        j

               As a result        of my experiences at Hillsborough

                                                                           I did not attend hospital

               I am a single man              residing at the above address.

              Furt h e r    to my q u e s t i o n n a i r e     that         I made on W e d n e s d a y       15 November            1989

               (151189).

               I entered         pen t h r e e from        pen two at about                   two thirty.        (1430)            I gained

              acc e s s    by climbing         over the dividing                   fence.           I took up a position

              w hi c h was v i r t u a l l y     in the       centre          of the         pen.     There was       still         quite a

              bit of room in the               centre of the                 pen at that time.               I have ma r k e d this

               position on the              separate       grid plan using the figure                        one.         I remained

               in that      position as the              pen was g r a d u a l l y filling               up.

              From two thirty onwards,                     (1430)           there were         steady surges          from the            rear

              of the       pen.       The    surges weren't                 very strong,            and were     normal           for a

              football         crowd.

               I saw the players              come onto the                 pitch at about            five to three               (1455).
                                                                                                      PAGE            2
                                                                                                      S3597

As they,       did so,       there was a strong          surge f rom the         rear of the           pen.           I

think that this was             in response       to the       players     coming      onto the        pitch.

The    surge    carried me forwards             down the       pen, and d i a g o n a l l y to my

right.        The    surge    carried me towards           the dividing         fence      between       pen

three and       pen two and          I became    pinned up against            the fence wit h the

right side          of my body up against          it.        I was aware       of a crush barrier

in front of me,          about       two to three feet away.               I have m a r k e d this

second position on the seperate                   grid     plan using the figure               1A.       I

could not a c t u a l l y see the         pitch,     but      I was aware       of a large         cheer         from

the    crowd and shouts             of "Come on you        red men".        The game        had o b viously

k icked off.          During    the next four        to five minutes,            the    pressure was

increasing all          the time a n d      I felt    very      c h i o s t a p h o b i c . My only

t houghts were on getting out of the                     pen an d had no interest                in what

m a y have     been h a ppening        on the    pitch.        I c o u l d n ’t see the       pitch an y w a y

a n d have no recol l e c t i o n s of a n y t h i n g that         h a p pened on the         pitch.            At

a time that          I w o u l d estimate    to be about         five    past three         (1505),          I

m a n a g e d to get a foot onto the barrier                   in front of me an d wit h the

help of a f o o t h o l d from a lad on the other                   side of the fence,                I got

onto the       crush barrier and was able                to    climb over the fence a nd go

into    pen two.        I realise       now that     the      barrier that       1 climbed onto was

the same one that             collapsed,     but at the time that               I climbed onto the

barrier at about             five    past three    (1505),       the whole       barrier was           intact,

and    people were        still      leaning up agai n s t       it.     It was as         I was      climbing

over    the fence that there was a second strong                         surge     in pen t h r e e .            It

was an obvious          surge w h i c h sent      people       forwards      in the     pen.       At the

same    time as the surge,             I heard s o m e b o d y say something            like     "Guasies

hit the       crossbar" Quasie          is short for Quasimodo,               which     is a nickname

used by s u pporters           for Peter Beardsley.              It was     obvious        that B e a r d s l e y

had hit the          crossbar,       although    I didn't a c t u a l l y see        it.      As soon as I

got    into    pen two,       I looked back       into     pen three and          could see        the
                                                                                                              PAGE          3

          people    in the area behind the                 crush barrier were all           leaning f o r w a r d s .

          Their    bodies were an g l e d forwards,             and    people were        pressed up against

          the    person    in front,        all at an angle         of about     forty five          degrees.         The

          people    couldn't move,           they were all        packed up agai n s t         the    person     in

          front while all           the other       people    in the    pen a p p e a r e d upright,       the

          people behind the            crush barrier were all at this forty five                         degree

          angle    towards      the    pitch.

          Other    people were         trying to get out of pen three and                   I started helping

          people out of pen three.                 Moments     later,    I saw a young           lad being

          passed above        the     crowd towards where           I was    standing      behind the

          dividing fence.             The young      lad a p p e a r e d to have      come from the        centre

          of the    pen and was         being      passed over      peoples heads,         feet first towards

          me.     He was facing         upwards      towards    the sky.        The     lad was      passed

          towards the        bottom      right    hand corner       of the    pen and was         passed over

          the front       perimeter       fence.        I saw the     lad as he was being             passed

          down    in front of me about             three     to four feet awa y and            could see that

          he was unconscious,             but still a p p e a r e d to be breathing.

          The    lads face a p p e a r e d to be white and becoming                   paler.      Whe n the      lad

          was    passed over        the fence,       he was    carried by other suppo r t e r s and

          placed on the         playing surf a c e of the pitch near to the                      right    hand

          goalpost.        He was      lying on the six yard            line,    at an angle wit h his

          head towards me a n d his feet towards                    the S pion Hop.         As soon as he was

          placed d o w n , I saw a man a p p r o a c h him a n d he had a                 look at the young

          lad.     Ver y shor t l y after,         the man     placed a coat or possibly a track

                                       lads f a c e .      I r e cognised the man that            covered the

          I didnt know that the man was a doctor at the time,                              but    I r e cognised

            face,     the doctor w a l k e d a way and started           looking at other            people on

            the    pitch.      I did not     see what became of the young               lad after       that.        I

            would describe           the young    lad as about        seven or eight years of age.                   He

            was    fairly thin and had dark hair w hich was                    cut short wit h a fringe.

            I think he wore a blue            coloured G l a s g o w Rangers       football      top which

            was short sleeved.            The shirt was        dark blue and had a motif across

            the front,        I ’m not sure what       it said.        I cant    remember a n y t h i n g

            else about        his    clothing.     I w ould estimate        that   I saw that young            lad

            being     passed out of the          pen and being        placed on the      pitch at between

            five     past a n d ten     past three     <1305-1510).

            At about        the same time that       I first       saw that young       lad,    I also      saw a

            y oung    girl w ho was      pinned     up agai n s t     the front    perimeter fence,           in the

            bottom        right hand    corner    of pen three,        right    next   to pen two.          She was

            t rap p e d    in the very    corner    of the     pen,    wit h her body facing           towards

            the    pitch and her head was moving around.                   The girl      looked towards

            her    right,     towards    pen two and        I saw the side of her face.                The girl

            had the        look of desperation,        a final       look for help.

            There was nothing           I could do,       it was     impossible    to get at         people    in

            that     corner,    the    pressure     was     too intense.       I carried on a s s isting

            people out of pen t h r e e . I w ould estimate that I saw that girl in the
            ~                                             /?£>Sjtirs<£^S          ?
             corner of pen three at about seven or eight minu t e s past three (1307-

■A©         1508).        She was     still alive    then,     but    in a state of desperation.                I
      -to
            now realise that           the girl    that     I saw was    one of the Hicks            sisters

            that     died at Hillsborough,          although       I cant say w hich one         it was.        I

            r ecognised the girls          face    from m edia       coverage    following Hillsborough.
                                                                                        ?             */<£>
            The    girl was wear i n g a jogging            type top w ith a hood,» I cant             remember

            the    colour     I didnt see a n y t h i n g    else of her       clothing.

            A fter ass i s t i n g    people out of       pen three     for some time,         I became       tired

            and had severe           pain in my right knee.           Beca u s e of this    I retired to the

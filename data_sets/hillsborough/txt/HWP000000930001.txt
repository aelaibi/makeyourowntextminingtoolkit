P.O. Box 88
Municipal Buildings                       __________________________
Dale Street                                 6th December 1996
Liverpool L69 2DH

Dear members of the working party,

Following the broadcast   of Jimmy McGovern's programme I feel
compelled to write with   my own experience of an F.A.Cup semi-final
at Hillsborough.  I was   supporting Wolves against Spurs in 1981
and was standing in the   opposite end of the ground to the Leppings
Lane En d.

It was quite obvious to me that the Spurs fans were packed into
the Leppings Lane End.  Throughout the game Spurs fans were
climbing over the perimeter fence and watching the match from
behind the advertising boards. There was no attempt at a pitch
invasion and no feeling of menace in the crowd.  It seemed a
simple reaction to an overcrowded section of the terracing.

I am wondering if any of the Spurs fans who were there on that
occasion have come forward with their experiences or if they could
be asked to do so.   I am also wondering if fans of other clubs who
were allocated Leppings Lane for F.A. Cup semi-finals have had
similar experiences.

If the authorities involved in the planning of the Liverpool -
Forest match had been doing their job properly they should have
drawn on the experience of previous occasions.  It appears that as
was all too commonplace at the time the police were solely
concerned with crowd control and totally disregarded crowd safety.

I speak as one of millions who said on that day "there but for the
grace of God go I".  It was a terrible day that had been waiting
to happen because football fans had been systematically degraded
by the authorities.  The status of fans at grounds was little
better than that of animals;  to be herded,contained, forced into
pens and treated like mindless beasts.

I wish you every success in your campaign to bring justice to bear
on those responsible for the deaths of your loved ones. You speak
for every ordinary football fan in the country when you challenge
the authorities' view that it was the fans who were to blame.

It was the fans who bought tickets, paid for their own transport
and went to Hillsborough in the belief that they were going to
spend an afternoon watching a memorable game which should have
been organised and controlled to the highest standards. Those
people who were paid, and paid very well I've no doubt, to provide
the organisation and control clearly failed to do so. This
demonstrated more than incompetence but rather a criminal contempt
for the well-being and safety of ordinary football supporters.

Yours very sincerely

Dear Sir

        Having seen the programme on the Hillborough disaster,
recently screened on I.T.V. I have come to my own conclusion that
the South Yorkshire Police appear to have some very setious
questions still to answer. I am concerned that there are many
issues that were not raised during the original inquest and I
fully support your campaign for a new inquest and urge you to
continue to lobby your M.P. and the Home Secretary until positive
steps are taken to find the truth of what did actually happen on
that tragic day.
In closing I would be grateful if you would pass on my best
wishes to all the families involved and assure you that if I can
be of any assistance in the future please don't hesitate to
contact me.




Yours Faithfully
                                                7 Dec 96

Dear reader,

            Following last week’s viewing of the Hillsborough tragedy, it was with
deep regret that I realised that the victims and their families were treated so shabbily
by the establishment
           I have written to the Lord Chancellor expressing my concern regarding the
inquest.
           I write so that you may know that your grievance has been heard and
noted by the common folk.



                              Your sincerely,

Dear Hillsborough Working Party,

I am compelled to write to you after watching 'Hillsborough' on Thursday 5 December. I
wish I knew what to say, except that I cannot conceive what families must have been
through and are still going through.

Some people remember where they were the day John Kennedy was assassinated and
others remember where they were when Nelson Mandela was released. I will always
remember where I was that Saturday afternoon, when innocent people just went to a
football match.

My husband and I wish you well in your quest for justice, for a disaster that should never
have happened.

Yours faithfully

6th D e c e m b e r      1996




Dear Home Secretary



In view of the recent remarks made by the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police that
Granada Television’s programme “Hillsborough” failed to shed any new light on the subject,
and of remarks made by the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher that “There will be no
whitewash”, I urge you to call a second enquiry for three reasons;


        1      It is now clear that several key witness committed perjuiy.

        2      It is now clear that vital video tape evidence was withheld.

        3      It is now clear that a number of victims were alive after 3.15pm.



The findings of the original Coroner’s healing and subsequent inquiry can surely no longer be
a matter of reliable public record.

It is your duty as a public servant and as one of the nation’s foremost judicial figureheads to let
justice be seen to be done.

I await your reply



Y ours sincerely

                          Subject:-               HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER



                                  I attended the football match between Nottingham
                                  Forest and Liverpool at Hillsborough on 15th April,
                                  1989.

                                 I was present at the Leppings Lane turnstile at
                                 what I believe were crucial times and I consider
                                 myself to be a witness who can be of assistance in
                                 the enquiries that are under way.

                                 I have attached an availability calendar which I
                                 request be forwarded to the Chief Superintendent,
                                 Operations, as requested.

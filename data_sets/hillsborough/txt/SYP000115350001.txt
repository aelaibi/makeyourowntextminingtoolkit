              effect    of opening            this   gate was      to   reduce      the   pressure on the N orth

              who were w it h o u t       tickets,      away from the         ground.         The    turns t i l e s were

         —             On Saturday 15th April 19^9        engaged,
  together with other members of the Merseyside Police Mounted
  Department, in giving ‘Mutual Aid* to the South Yorkshire Police,
  on the occassion of the F .A •Cup Semi-Final being pluywl          .
  Liverpool F.C. and Nottingham Forest F.C. at Hillsborough Football
  Club, Sheefield. I was riding Police Horse Ho. 10, NIMROD.           ,
                       The Merseyside Police contingent arrived at
  Sheffield at 1000hrs, and after refreshments and briefing by the
  South Yorkshire Police Mounted Inspector, Inspector EAND-DAVIES,
  we were deployed at 1130hrs.                                ^
                       I was detailed to patrol in company with
  Sergeant 17614 THOMAS of the South Yorkshire Police Mounted. We
  had responsibility for the LEPPINGS LAKE end of the ground, and
   in particular the turnstiles which were to be used by the Liverpool
  F.C.Supporters. Assisting us at this venue were Constables 1300
   GRUNKIL and 1696 STANBRIDGE of the Merseyside Police, and Woman
   Constable 3^7 HENWOOD of the South Yorkshire Police Mounted
  Department. Sergeant THOMAS took me and my colleagues on a short
   •tour* of the Football Ground to aquaint us with tha geograjjhy of
   the ground and then Sergeant THOMAS and 1 went around the surrounding
   streets in order that I would have some knowledge of the area.
                         At this time, about 1200hrs there were groups
   of youths, Liverpool supporters, in the area of theground and the
   surrounding streets, many of them drinking alcohol.              ^
   however no signs of disorder and the mood was one of good humour.
   Ve passed a couple of Public Houses and Off-Licences which were                                                       v

                           Prom 1300hrs to about lljOOhrs there was          |
     intermittent flow of supporters into the ground,
     at the turnstiles. The number of supporters in LEPPINGS^LANE «**
     was increasing, but many of them were reluctant to go into the
     despite numerous request from us, and other Police Officers* j
     of these supporters were sitting on the pavement, an vails and
     verges, drinking, but again no disorder was taking place.
                                                                                                               OV— " A
                  About “lUOOhrs we made a concerted effort to get
 supporters to go into the ground. Some did, but others chose to
 remain outside, and these people were moved away from the area of
 the turnstiles to allow easier access for those who wished to go
 into the ground.
                  About 11*15hrs a party of some 500 Liverpool supporters
 arraived at the ground, under escort from other Mounted Officers.
 These supporters entered the ground without problem, but shortly
 after the volume of people"~began to increase around the turnstile
 area. I noticed that entry through the turnstiles was slow* la
 part due to the fact that supporters were being searched prior to
 entering the ground. At this point there were* to the beat of ay
 knowledge, 9 Police horses in the area of the turnstiles and a
 further two Police Horses in LEPPINGS LANE trying to clear people
 from the roadway and adjoining areas. The crowd volume quickly
 built up and a crush began to develop around the turnstiles, In
 particular those giving access to the TERRACE area. The mood of the
 crowd at this time was one 'high spirits*, what may be described as a
 carnival atmosphere prevailed, with many people singing and chanting,
but all good-humourdley.      Constables GRUNNILL and STANBRIDGE entered
the confined area in front of the TERRACE turnstiles and began to
organise the crowd into order ley queues. I stayed outside the
confined area, supervising the entry of supporters into the NORTH
and WEST stands. Suddenly there was a large influx of supporters
into the turnstile area, and a serious crush began to develop.
Many of these supporters had arrived at the turnstile area from
the opposite direction from which we had been told to expect them,
and some of them where obviously under the influence of alcohol.
Serious crushing was now taking place and a line of h o n e s was
placed acrooa the front of the turnstile area to prevent further
access to the turnstiles. Constables GR8NNILL and STANBRIDGE
remained within the confined area of the TERRACE turnstiles a n d '
slowly were able to regain some order. A gap of about 10 feet
then developed between the supporters in the confined area and the
line of horses outside the confined area, and 1 saw the iron gates
at the entrance to the confined area shut. Despite there now being
space at the rear of the supporters at the turnstiles and despite
the loud and repeated appeals of the Mounted Officers, the crowd
at the turnstiles refused to move back and reduce the crushing. At        <
this point, one of the horses in the line of horse became agitated
and moved out of position, leaving a gap of about 10 feet In the
line of horses. The crowd which had been held back nowrft^rged
forward, forced open the iron gates and
people at the turnstiles. I saw people'
I saw people ducking under the horse to
there was nowhere for these people to go, other than into thtv&iftkf
the people in front, they continued to surge .forward, .'ijr tpir
Constables GRUNNILL and STANBRIDGE had removed their horse'tfcoi 3th*
crowd, because of the serious risk of injury to people la the orowd. ' 'K*
The crush became so dense that it was now a physical impossibility
to put horses back into the crowd.    I saw young children being
passed out' over the heads over the crowd, and other people being
pulled out over the side barriers, "espite vehement pleading from
the mounted officers the crowd would bot take heed and the crushing        a
intensified. The mood of the crowd had now changed to one of panio,        |
with some hostility. I began to fear for the lives'of people in the - "
crush, and felt that unless some drastic action were taken* then        V?
      -..Quid ondoubtedly be lost.  At that ptint I saw the .exlt'^gitt

through. I first thought that the gate had been forced and moved
to secure it, but quickly realised that it had been opened on

was only open for a matter of two minutes and was then closed again.
The immediate effect of opening this gate was to reduce the pressure

             people             were        pushing          back and            I found myself                  kneeling             on                 who

             seemed             to     be    unconcious,                 I tried          to    get       up    off    of    him        but      there        were

             panicking,                   t his       made     everything                worse       r ea lly.

             By       now       I w a s q u i t e nea r                to    th e      front        and    could       see       a    few       police

             officers                on     the       piVtch,       and      was       shouting           at    them    to       let       us    out,     but

             they          did       nothing/by              now       I had        screamed          so m u c h       that          when       I breathed            in

             I lost             th e      space        where        my      c h es t     had    been and          I couldn't                breathe

             properly.                    I gave        up     then,         I thought              I was      going        to       die,       I'd     seen

             people             brushing              past     me      during          all     this       crushing          with        their         e yes

             closed and                   seemingly            unconcious,                but       for    all    I know             they       could     have

             been          dead.            I can't          describe            t h e m at         all    it w a s     a    blurr.              I just^

             closed my                 eyes       and     thought            "Make        it q u i c k " ,       and    the          next       thing/i        know

             I was          l y in g        on    the     pitch and              a Saint            John's       Ambulance              man      wfcs    leaning

             .over m e,              I was        f lat      on my          b ack      and     X believe          he    had          been       p s u s c i tat ing

             me,       as       I was        definitely                out     cold.           He    put me       in the             recovery           position

             and       t o l d me           to    breathe           deeply          he    stayed          with    me    for          about       five     minutes

             then          went        off       to    help       someone           else and a Forest                   fan          stayed       with        me    on

             the       pitch           for       about       an     hour,       and       then       my    mates       found          me a n d        helped        me

             to w h e r e            the a m b u l a n c e s           were,

but      got    out a g a i n    because         I could       see a      lot    of    dead    people       l y ing     about

in    like      filing        cabinets,        I suppose         I was       n ear    the m a k e    shift       mortuary.

I just         wanted     to    come      hoijre a n d    get a w a y     from       it all.




                                                   we m e t      our    other        friends    and made          our    way

to    the      railway        station,       cauglu a         train     to L i v e r p o o l   and    came       home.




                  I don't       blame      anyone        in   particular         but    the    organisation             was

awful       and    I think       that      the   gates        onto     the    pitch     should       have    been

opened         sooner    and     the      realisation          of w h a t     was     happening       to    us   should

ha v e    been appreciated                sooner,        the Police, ojn t i ne         p i t c.hi j llsJL ..d-Ld n ' t w a n t

to    know and          I think      if    they'd        reacted       s o o n e / it m a y w e l l     have      saved

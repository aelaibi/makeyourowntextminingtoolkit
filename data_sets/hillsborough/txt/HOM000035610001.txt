     D ew
Thank you for your letter of 19 November about the release of medical records to the
Hillsborough Family Support Group.

It might help if I explain that the Home Secretary has asked Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to
carry out a scrutiny of evidence about the disaster at Hillsborough Football Stadium in order
to establish whether there is any significant new evidence which was not previously available
to Lord Taylor’s Inquiry, to the Inquests, or to the prosecuting or police disciplinary
authorities. If there is significant evidence, the Judge will see if it would have affected the
outcome of any o f the proceedings. I attach his terms of reference.

I have discussed your letter with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. He has no power to compel the
release of records from the Northern General Hospital for the purposes o f his scrutiny. But
we asked Mr Wardrope for the medical records relating to Philip Haxnmond and Lee Nicol,
two victims of the disaster who were treated at the Northern General Hospital, and he kindly
had copies sent to us.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith takes the view that the hospital should release medical records
relating to people who died in the disaster where these are requested by a person who has a
properly signed authorisation from somebody who is entitled to act as the personal
representative o f the deceased. The documents should then be copied at the expense of the
person requesting them.

I hope this is helpful.

                tXASJUtJU.

Dear Mr Bone

Northern General Hospital
Medical Records of Hillsborough Victims

I understand you have had some correspondence with Mr J Wardrope, Consultant in Accident &
Emergency Medicine, concerning The Scrutiny’s access to relevant medical records and I
understand Mr Wardrope has already supplied to The Scrutiny, copies of two victims’ records.

We have recently received correspondence from Ms Ann Adlington, Solicitor to the Hillsborough
Family Support Group, requesting copies of several other sets of records (see schedule attached).
Ms Adlington has confirmed that she has no legal authority to request release of these records on
behalf of The Scrutiny. In the circumstances I felt it appropriate to alert you to this latest
development and enclose a copy of my letter to Ms Adlington, which I believe is self-explanatory.

As previously indicated by Mr Wardrope, the hospital is more than happy to assist The Scrutiny
in whatever way it can, either by supplying documents to The Scrutiny or by Mr Wardrope’s
personal attendance, as deemed necessary. I am happy for you to write direct to Mr Wardrope or,
if you prefer, to myself, should you require any farther information.

Yours sincerely

Dear Madam

Hospital Records of Hillsborough Vkiflms

Further to our letter of 7 November, we have now discussed this matter in detail with our clients.

We understand that Mr J Wardrope, Consultant in Accident in Emergency Medicine, has already
provided two sets of records to the Inquiry at their specific request and Mr Wardrope has
subsequently offered to provide any further documentation or information to the Inquiry as may be
necessary. As Lord Justice Stuart-Smith is heading a Judicial Inquiry, then presumably he has
authority to request documents and the attendance of witnesses. We would comment that some of
the notes contain only post mortem information which would be the property of H M Coroner.

We note that you do not have any authority yourselves for the release of records. Mr Wardrope
has copied to the Inquiry his correspondence with Dr Ed Walker, to ensure the Inquiry is aware
of the hospital’s desire to assist the Inquiry objectively and practically. We do not understand your
reference to the Home Office when, as we say, our clients have indicated on more than more
occasion to the Inquiry their willingness to co-operate and provide documents to assist the Inquiry.
In the circumstances it would seem appropriate that the Inquiry should notify either the Chief
Executive or Mr Wardrope direct of their requirements.

We are copying this letter to the Inquiry for information.

M edical Records of Hillsborough Victims

We refer to your letter of 26 September 1997 addressed to Mr J Wardrope, Consultant in Accident

We should be grateful if you could let us know the authority upon which the applications for copy

Dear Sir

Medical Records of Hillsborough Victims

Further to my visit to the Northern General on Wednesday 24 September when you informed
me that requests for copy medical records should be directed to the hospital’s solicitors, I
enclose signed authorities from the next of kin.

I should be grateful if you would forward these to solicitors acting for the hospital as I am
unaware of their identity. I have tried to contact you by telephone to obtain this information
but have not been successful.

I thank you for your assistance.


Yours faithfully




Ann Adlington
SOLICITOR

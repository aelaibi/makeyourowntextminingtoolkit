                          TWELFTH DAY'S PROCEEDINGS

                          THURSDAY.   1ST JUNE. 1989.

                             (AFTERNOON SESSION)



                 SUPERINTENDENT ROGER L. GREENWOOD Recalled.

                    Cross-Examined by MR. HYTNER (Cont)

    Q. Mr. Greenwood, may I return to the questions that were being
       put to you before the adjournment.   It may be I shall have to
       ask you to answer questions that to you are hypothetical,
       because it may be you don't know the evidence that has been
       given to the Tribunal, or if you do you don't accept it.   I
       want you for the moment to accept as true the evidence given
       to the Tribunal so far, which is that on the opening of gate C
       at about 2.52 a large body of fans whose numbers are estimated
       I think between 1,000 and 2,000, swarmed through the tunnel
       and into pens 3 and 4.  The estimate may be a little out
       because people's estimates sometimes are.   So will you please
       assume for the purposes of my questions that at about 2.52
       some time after you had last viewed the terraces yourself
       something over 1,000 people swarmed into the back of pens 3
       and 4. Now, if that were true and if you had been told that
       was what was happening before the tragedy occurred, your
       actions would have been different, would not they? - A. I
       can't accept that that was true.   I cannot accept the
       assumption, I am sorry.

    Q. Mr. Greenwood, you have been in the Police Force a very long
       time.  Would you try and be helpful.  Would you please for the
       purposes of my questions assume that what I have put to you is
       true and assume that you had been informed of that before 3
       o'clock.  In those circumstances.

    Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Counsel is not suggesting at all
         that you were informed. - A. Yes, I see, my Lord.

    Q.        MR. HYTNER:   We know you were not.  If you had been
         informed, when you saw the crushing at the perimeter fence,
         the action you would have taken to deal with the situation
         would have been somewhat different, would not it? - A. If I
         had know - just to clarify - if i had known that 1,000 or
         2,000 had rushed in?

    Q. Yes. - A. No, I can't see the action would have been any
       different at the perimeter fence at the time I went to assess
       the incident.

    Q. Would not you then have considered it sensible....

    Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I am sorry, I have a horrible
         feeling you are at cross-purposes.  Your action would not have
         been different at the time you did what? - A. When I assessed

                                                        R.L. GREENWOOD


            the situation, when I was at the perimeter fence.

         Q. You mean after people were being crushed? - A. Yes.

         Q. No, I don't think that is what....

                 MR. HYTNER:   Yes, it is:

         Q. Would you not have considered in addition to the action you
            did take getting Officers into the tunnel at the rear to
            evacuate spectators at the back to relieve pressure at the
            back? - A. That was indeed considered and did indeed happen.

         Q. Mr. Greenwood, this is the first we have heard of that.   We
            know that a few spectators who were in the tunnel who were
            removed from the tunnel, but so far we have heard nothing of
            serials going into pens 3 and 4 at the rear to evacuate from
            the rear, or to advise people to get out at the rear to
            relieve pressure at the back.  Can you help us as to when that
            was done, on whose orders and how those orders were
            transmitted? - A. I can't help you in terms of how the orders
            were transmitted.  I can certainly help you to say it was
            categorically done, and there are photographs in existence
            which show that Officers came in through the rear of the
            tunnel.  I can further say to you, as I think I have said
            already, that when the crowd had been thinned out and it was
            possible to take people out, casualties, then they were
            removed also through that tunnel.

         Q. We know the casualties later were taken out.  That was when
            the disaster was completed. - A. That is correct.

         Q. What I am putting to you is this.  When you initially
            evaluated the situation you thought that the only thing that
            could be done at that stage which was in the early stages was
            to motion people back from the front? At that stage I am
            suggesting to you what should have been done was the
            evacuation of the surplus people at the rear to relieve
            pressure that was coming on to people at the front? - A. In
            the first instance the option that I took was on the basis
            that there was room for people to move back.

         Q. Yes, I know.  I am not criticising you, you see, Mr.
            Greenwood. - A. No, I understand that, sir.

         Q. Please understand that. - A. Yes, I understand that.    I am
            trying to explain it.  When that didn't work then the other
            option was that Officers would go round to the rear of the
            tunnel, and they did indeed do th a t . They went through the
            tunnel from the back.  It was not possible to get into the
            area of the disaster because people were still there and they
            had to clear a way through there.

         Q. Mr. Greenwood, you are not understanding what I am putting to
            you, and I hope I am putting it in easy, straightforward
            language. - A. If you want the answer as far as I am
            concerned, they evacuated that area in order to get to the
4

                                                     R.L. GREENWOOD


       disaster.

    Q. What you have just said in terms is they pushed their way
       through the crowd to get to the front.     That may well have
       been a sensible thing for some Officers to do to help at
       the front.   I am asking you about a different problem.     On
       the assumption which you reasonably made, and nobody
       criticises you, certainly I d o n ’t, on the assumption you
       made that there was room for people at the front to move
       back, you thought at that stage that the only thing you
       could do was to motion people to get back to relieve the
       pressure on people at the front.     Is that correct? - A.
       Yes, because there would not have been time, in view of the
       critical situation at the front, by sending Officers round
       to the back.   That was the only option in my assessment at
       that time to save life, and I thought it was capable of
       being saved.

    Q. If you had known that the extra numbers at the back were
       causing pressure which made it impossible for people at the
       front to move back, you would, would you not, have
       immediately and without delay, have sent orders to evacuate
       people at the rear to get people out through the tunnel to
       relieve the appalling pressures on people at the centre and
       at the front?




                                    /A. In my view that option
                                                              K. L. GREENWOOD



- A. In my view, that o pt io n was not a v a i l a b l e to me at
that stage in terms of the s a v i n g of life and t here was
r o om - I have s aid that - and I b a s ed my a s s e s s m e n t on
that and, in my view, at that p a r t i c u l a r s ta ge it w ou ld
have had no effect, in terms of O f f i c er s g o i ng in.        The
c r o wd were un aw ar e of what g o in g on at the front.

Are you s a y i n g that, on the h y p o t h e s i s that we have a sk ed
y ou to accept, that there was a s ur p lu s of 5 00 p e op l e or
so in each pen at the back, that it w ou ld not have h e lp e d
if 5 00 or more had been i mm ed i a t e l y e v a c u a t e d at the r ea r?
Is that what you are s a y i n g ? - A. No, I am not s a y i n g
that.     If the c r ow d had have gone out and by any m ea ns if
they c ou ld have been taken out at the back, then yes, that
w o ul d have assisted.

That    is what    I have been a sk i n g you ? - A.       Yes.

And if you h a d k nown the true situation, that is the
a ction you w ould have taken, is not it? - A. I k n o w the
true situation, b as ed on my assessment, and that is what                        I
b a se d my a ss e s s m e n t on and the acti on that I took.           I
c annot h y p o t h e s i s e about s o m e t h i n g that I do not b e li e ve
to be true.

Well, I c annot take that any further.                You do a p p r e c i a t e
what you are saying, Mr. Greenwood, that y ou are r e f u s i n g
to answer a q u e s ti on b a se d on a h y p o t h e s i s b ec a us e you
s i m p l y do not b elieve the e v i d e n c e that has been g i v e n ? -
A. I am not s a y i n g I do not be li ev e evi de n ce that has been
given.       I am u naware of e v i d en ce to that extent.

You may be at a d isadvantage.          H ave you n ever seen the
v ideos of the Gate C b e i n g o p e n e d and the c r ow d c o mi n g
t hrough Gate C? - A. Yes, I have, sir.           I have seen it
recently.

So you b el i e v e that Gate C was o p e n e d and y ou b e li v e that
a s w a r m came through it? - A. There were a n u mb er of
p eople that came through.       I have seen that on the video,
yes.      Not 1,000 to 2 ,0 00 I do not think that I saw,
b u t ....

You do not accept t ha t? - A. Well,              I am not sure.

That is fair enough.          Is it that you do not b e li e v e they
went s t r a i g h t t hrough the t u n n e l ? - A. I do not b el ie ve
t hey all did and I have seen no e v id e n c e on the v ideo that
w o ul d tell me that that is the case.

That is fair enough.          I think the Tribunal           will   understand
your e v i d e n c e ? - A. Yes.

Can    I now come to c r i t i c i s m s   made by my c li e nt s of the
                                        55

                                                                          R. L. GREENWOOD



     P olice c on d u c t when the incid en t occurred, a nd m ay I say
     at once that it will be put to y ou in s o m e w h a t more
     m o d e r a t e language than p e rh a p s my i n s t r u c ti o ns have come
     to me.         T here are c r i t i c i s m s in two p h as e s a nd I p r op o s e
     to put t he m to you and then to leave t he m with o ther
     P olice Officers.             Phase 1 is the r e a c t i o n of the P o li c e on
     the p e r i m e t e r fence to the initial o c cu rr en ce s.          That is,
     the initial c l i m b i n g over the fence and the s h o u t s from
     the crowd.          What is s ai d in c r i t i c i s m is that the P olice
     on the p e r i m e t e r fence did not r eact q u i c k l y e n ou g h and,
     u nr easonably, f ai l ed to u n d e r s t a n d that there was c r o w d
     c r u s h i n g a nd d an ge r to spec ta to rs .     Can I put it in this
     way to y ou ?        If it is right that s p e c t a t o r s in pen 5, I
     t hink it will be - that is the one, l oo king from the pitch
     to the terrace, on the left.                   It is the w in g pen on the
     left.         Do y ou u n d e r s t a n d the one I m e a n? - A. I k n o w w here
     pen 5 is, yes.

Q.   I am grateful.          I h ad got      it wrong.         Pens     1 a nd 2.

            LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR:           Looking       from the p i t c h ?

Q.        HR. HYTNER:    L o o k i n g from the p itch to the terraces,
     is on the left? - A. 1 and 2.

Q.    1 and 2, yes.        If it be true that s p e c t a t o r s in pens 1 and
     2 were s h o u t i n g to P olice on the p e r i m e t e r fence that
     there were p e o p l e b e in g k i l l e d in the a d j a c en t pen, w hich
     w ould be 3, and the P oli ce d id not r eact to t ho se shouts,
     w ould that d i s a p p o i n t y o u ? - A. V e r y much so, if that
     a p p e a r e d to be the case.

Q.   If Hr. B ruce Grobbelaar , w hose a t t e n t i o n was o b v i o u s l y
     given in part to the game that was g o i n g on, u n d e r s t o o d
     s ho ut s from the c r o w d that t h e y were b e i n g i nj ur ed and
     k i l l e d a nd the P olice were d o i n g n o t h i n g a bout it and
     w o u ld he h e l p - if P olice O f f i c e r s took no n o ti c e of him
     when he t old them to do s om ething, w o u ld that d i s a p p o i n t
     y ou? - A. I have a s k e d Hr. Gro bbelaar.               He was in the
     goal, p l a y i n g the game of football.           I     can a dd to that.               I
     mean, apart from the h yp oth es is , I do not know.

Q.   If it were true that, b ef or e y ou s aw him, b e fo r e y ou came
     upon the scene, if he h ad r e s p o n d e d to s ho ut s from the
     c rowd which he heard, a s k i n g for h e l p b e ca u s e p e op l e were
     b e i n g k i l l e d or injured a nd the P o li c e         were d o i n g nothing,
     and if he s poke to a P olice O f f i c e r a nd t here was no
     response, w o u l d that d i s a p p o i n t y o u ? - A. No, because, I
     mean, in fa ir ne ss to the P o li c e O f f i c e r concerned, he has
     to make an a s s e s s m e n t a nd a j ud g me n t of the s i t u a t i o n and
     at football m at c h e s t h r o u g h o u t all the c o u n t r y one gets
     s u r g i n g and s w a y i n g where p e o p l e b e co m e c o m p r e s s e d a ga i ns t
     the fence.           I think the fence acts as a b a r r i e r in that
     sense and t hey go back.             So it is his a s s e s s m e n t at the
'v j   L, M ~                                         56

                     p a r t i c u l a r time, in terms of what the s i t u a t i o n is, and
                     b ec au se a c omment is made from s o m e b o d y on the f ield as
                     such, then I w o ul d e xpe ct an e x p e r i e n c e d P olice O f fi c e r to
                     be able to take on b o ar d that c om m en t and make his own
                     judgment, but not n e c e s s a r i l y act on it b e ca u s e it m ay not
                     be the case that it is true.

                Q.   If the g o a l k e e p e r can hear those shouts, the P ol ic e on the
                     p er i m e t e r fence, who are c l os e r than the goalkeeper,
                     s ho u l d be able to hear t hose shouts, s h o u l d not t h e y ? - A.
                     One w ou ld have thought so, a l t h o ug h again, you know, one
                     is t a l k i n g about the q u e s ti o n of c r o wd n oise that I have
                     r e f e r r e d to this m o r n i n g and it is very e as y to s ay that
                     one p erson can hear what is s ai d when you are in a s t ad i u m
                     c o n t a i n i n g 54, 0 0 0 people.   I d ef y a n y b o d y to come up with
                     a c o n s i s t e n t answer on that one, that e v e r y b o d y is g oi ng

                Q. Hay I put this p o s s i b i l i t y to y ou for your comment, that
                   the failure of the Police - that, first of all, t here was
                   a fail ur e of the Police on the p e r i m et e r fence to act
                   q u i c k l y e no ug h to what was happening, and that that
                   failur e was due, not to the P o li ce O f f i c er s b e in g w i ck e d
                   or even that they were h o p e l e s s l y inefficient, but it was
                   due to the b r i e f i n g they had had, which o v e r - e m p h a s i s e d
                   the p o s s i b i l i t y of h o o l i g a n i s m and pitch invasion and did
                   not c o n c e n t r a t e at all on the p o s s i b i l i t y of o v e r c r o w d i n g
                   on the t e r r a c e s ? - A. No, I do not think that is the case
                   at all.         Those O f f i ce rs that work in that a re a are very,
                   ver y e x p e r i e n c e d Off i ce r s and, to make the s u g g e s t i o n that
                   t hey w ould be o nly looking at the q ue s ti o n of h o o l i g a n i s m
                   r ather than safety, I think is t o t a l l y wrong.

                Q. Now, we go to the next phase.                     T here is a c o m p l a i n t from
                   my c lients that, after the d i s a s t e r occurred, y ou c o u ld
                   g r o u p the Police into three s e p a r a t e categories.                   There
                   was a g ro up which b eh a v e d hero ic al ly , as d e s c r i b e d by you
                   in your own evidence;              there was a g ro up w hich was
                   inactive b ec a u s e of lack of l e a de r sh i p to tell t h e m what
                   to do; and there was a g r o u p which was inactive b e ca us e
                   t hey were frozen with shock.                    Now, I am sure y ou a ccept
                   the first group, the h er oi c group.                     Can we deal with the
                   g ro up that is a ll e g e d to have been inactive due to lack of
                   t heir own i nitiative or l e ad e r s h i p ?              It is right, is not
                   it, that a n um be r of P ol ic e O f f i c er s s to od inactive whilst
                   o thers - P olice O ff ic e r s and s p ec t a t o r s - were o r g a n i s i n g
                   t he m s e l v e s into d o in g s o m e t h i n g u s ef u l ? - A. At that time
                   my back was to the pitch.                  I c o u ld not see what was g oi ng
                   on b eh i n d it.      Again I c an no t c o mm e nt on that, but there
                   is n o t h i n g that s ug ge s t s that to me at all.

                Q. Well, Hr. Greenwood, I th ou gh t y ou had g iven e v i d e n c e of
                   just those people b ec au se y ou have d e s c r i b e d how P o li ce
                   O f f i c e r s were s t a n d i n g about and t h e y were f r u s t r a t e d and

    you have e x p l a i n e d g r a p h i c a l l y how the s heer f ru st r at i on
    got at t hem be ca us e there were too m an y P o l i c e m e n a r ou n d
    to be all d o i n g s o m e t h i n g u s e f u l ? - A. Yes, I m eant in
    r e l a ti o n to the fence, sir.              I was not t a l k i n g a bout the
    q ue s ti o n of c as ua l t i e s b e i ng removed, etc.




                                              /Q.   H av e you not seen.

                                      R. GREENWOOD



Q. Well have you not seen the video recordings of the casualties
   being removed and then the bodies being taken to the mortuary?
   - A. Yes, I have sir, yes.

Q. Have you not seen with your own eyes fans who were under
   no leadership at all, but who on theit own initiative were
   tearing down hoardings and on their own initiative running
   back and forth with bodies? - A. Yes, I have seen that sir
   and I compliment them on that, it is creditable and I have
   also seen Police Officers with them as well.

Q. Certainly, but at the same time there were Police Officers
   standing around doing nothing? - A. I don't think "doing
   nothing" is the right word, as I said this morning.  If
   the fans had not done that then we would have had to take
   action to do it, but we are talking there about a situation
   where you may want a resource, an additional resource in
   terms of the rescue and that additional resource was on tap.
   There were also potential public order problems in the ground
   as well.

Q. You see there is an impression that one gains - we have not
   heard Mr. Nesbit yet - but there is an impression one gains
   from reading statements, including that of Mr. Nesbit, that
   when he came on the scene things were chaotic and he was
   the one who organised as it were chains of Police Officers
   for example to get bodies out through the gates because
   before then there was no organisation at all; that he brought
   order where there had been chaos.   Now what I simply put to
   you is do you accept that before M r . Nesbit arrived there
   was a lack of leadership and organisation which resulted in
   some Police Officers being inactive when they could have
   been usefully employed? - A. No, I definitely do not accept
   that.
Q. Now the third group:  do you accept that a number of Officers,
   possibly very young and new ones, were suffering from a
   very intense degree of shock and were frozen into inactivity
   for that reason? - A. No, I can't speak of that at all.
   I certainly know of one Officer who went to the fence and
   it troubled him and the work that he actually did after that,
   he recovered his ground completely.  I am not aware of ai}y
   Police Officers that were totally frozen to the ground with
   shock at all.

 Q. Were you aware afterwards that a number of Officers indeed
    had suffered from shock as a result of seeing what they had
    seen? - A. Yes, I suffered ftorn shock sir.

 Q. No, I don't mean horror, you know:  "I am shocked by what
    I have seen".  You know what I mean by "shock", clinical
    shock? - A. No, I am not aware to that extent in terms
    of clinical shock, no.
 Q. It is right, isn't it, in fairness to any Police Officer who
    may have suffered from shock, which you dispute, but in
                                    R. GREENWOOD


fairness to anyone who did, it is not possible, is it, to
anticipate in advance of a new Police Officer coming into
that sort of situation how he will in fact react? - A. You
can't train anybody for a situation like that.

I was going to come to that.  Is it possible to train some­
body to deal with a horrifying situation which he has never
in fact encountered? - A. I think it is possible to train
to a degree in terms of experience but one can never tell
how it may affect somebody in those circumstances, but I
am not aware of clinical shock to the extent that you say.

Well it may not be right, you see.  I have no specific
evidence of clinical shock.  I am having to put to you the
instructions I have from those who claim to have witnessed
these things but the people concerned are not doctors.
Do you follow? - A. Yes.

      MR. HYTNER:  Sir, in view of your intervention when
I was cross-examining Mr. Murray, I hesitate to put
questions to Mr. Greenwood relating to the activities of
Mr. Marshall outside the ground.

      The only thing that occurs to me is this: Mr. Greenwood
was in his position the previous year and Mr. Woodward may
feel aggrieved, I don't know,  if I fail to put to M r .Greenwood
certain criticims that may be made of Mr. Marshall.

       Sir, I am really in your hands and Mr. Woodward's
hands.   I don't  wish to go over ground unnecessarily, but
I don't want to   be accused of being unfair later.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Well I think I already said,
Mr. Hytner, there is no point going to be taken from .here
about things not being put, but if you want to ask this
witness because he has had experience of the job that
Mr. Marshall was doing this year anything ....

      MR. HYTNER:  I don't want to for a very good reason
that it is distasteful to ask one Superintendent to criticise
the efforts of another Superintendent, they are the same
rank, and since I have put the questions already to
Mr. Marshall it may not be necessary unless Mr. Woodward
feels it would be unfair if I didn't.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Well Mr. Woodward can ask them
if he thinks it is right.

      MR. WOODWARD:  Well sir with respect if a criticism
is to be made of an Officer then my learned friend as he
has put it will have put it to that Officer.  To seek to
ask other Officers what their view is would lead to an
interminable ....

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  You are not going to regard it
as unfair then if he does not put criticisms of outside
the turnstiles to this Officer?
                                     R. GREENWOOD


      MR. WOODWARD:  Sir, I am not asking that Mr. Hytner
should enquire of other Officers whether they agree or disagree
with critisms of other Officers.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Thank you.

      MR. HYTNER:   That is the end of my cross-examination.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Thank you very much.   Yes,
Mr. Jackson.


                Cross-Examined by MR. JACKSON:

May I deal only with the one point that my Lord was asking
you about.  I understand that he thought Mr. Hytner was
going to ask you about it.

      Would you look please at photograph, Composite Album
No. 2, Photograph DB16/29, the first photograph in Composite
Album No. 2. - A. Yes.

Whether that be full, very full, fairly full is a matter
of semantics.     There were a lot of people there. Would you
assess the position that if another 100 were to go ifo it
would be extremely full, another 10%? - A. I don t know.
It is very v e r y difficult in terms of the photographs.

We won't pursue that. May I just ask you to look at the
photograph and then I want you to eonsider this: you are
the Commander of the Ground? - A. Yes.

At about that very moment this was happening outside.   Extra
Police horses, an extra Serial and a request for the gates
to be opened outside because of what we understand to be
a dangerous situation.  Would you not agree that it would
have been much much better if you had been informed of that
situation? - A. If any resultant action was going to be
taken then it would not be taken by me, so therefore I would
have liked to have been aware of it yes, but it was not
crucial in my view.
       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  That is what I am afraid I
 don't understand at all that "it is not crucial . I you
 are qoing to be monitoring the contents of those pens,
 isn't it crucial to know if - let's leave figures out of
 it - a large number more people are likely to be given at
 any rate the option of coming in to an already pretty full
 pen? - A. Yes, it is sir.

, Because you would then need, would you not, to look at it
  and see it might not cause danger but it might quite likely
  do so? - A. Yes, my Lord.   I have misled you to a
  in the sense that as I referred to earlier, f r o m the Control
  Box there is a view of the pens; they have got the view
  outside and it may well be that they are best placed to
  take the action if any action is necessary to accommodate
  that situation, but it would be better if I was informed
                                   R. GREENWOOD



so that I can go round there and assess it myself, yes.

      MR. JACKSON: Mr. Greenwood, the reason I ask is this:
we have heard that no one on the outside gave any thought
to the effect on the inside of the actions.  That is why
I am suggesting you are the person who would have done because
you were inside in command? - A. Yes, I was, but as I have
tried to illustrate to you, it is a flexible role in terms
of the question of the Control Box? the assessment outside?
the assessment inside.  I have worked in that Control Box
before for a number of years previously and I have taken
action from that Control Box in response to a situation that
may have developed, so it does not necessarily follow that
the Officer in the ground would respond to it.  I could have
been at the other end of the ground and it may need an
immediate response.

Q. You did not arrange something similar for gate 4 as I
   understand? - A. No.  Again difficulty with recollection, but
   I don't think that I can have perceived a problem in terms of
   what was going on at pen 3 at pen 4.  I think people were
   flowing freely through there.

Q.   As you later on discovered, one of the big differences between
     gate 3 and gate 4 was that gate 3 had a collapsed barrier very
     close to the gate? - A. Very much so.

Q. Just one final matter I would like to ask you about, and that
   is this.  You mentioned, and it may be for very good reasons,
   that you did not think the problem as it confronted you could
   be resolved by cutting down the fence? - A. It was not an
   option I contemplated in the first instance.

Q.    That is what I wanted to know.   I know you said you have
     thought about it many times in retrospect. What I really     want
     to know is at the time did it cross your mind that cutting
     equipment should be available as soon as possible so that it
     would be an option which could be available if the thing
     developed one way or another? - A. I cannot recollect.     I
     can't recollect at all.    I have given the reasons again in
     hindsight, and I base it on experience again.

Q. What is it? You can't recollect if you ever thought about
   cutting equipment? - A. I can't, no.

Q. There are obviously many things you could do with cutting
   equipment, but I am not going to explore them with you, not
   all of them, but just one that occurs to me and may have
   occurred to you, is that one could create another gate, as it
   were? - A . Y e s .

Q. A fairly small hole or number of small holes at difference
   places which would not cause the whole crowd to come forward,
   but would allow access for people to get through? - A. I
   don't think that would have been an option on this occasion at
   all.      It was severe at the front. As I say, I have a fear in
   hindsight and I can only say I probably base that on
   experience at the particular time.     Again going back to 1981,
   that once you open the gates you can't shut them, and you have
   got to allow people out, that is if you can get them out, and
   the sort of surging stampede effect from the back.     I can only
   s a y . ...

Q. What I don't quite understand, you have got a situation
   certainly it would appear on your assessment, in front of gate
   3 where there was a blockage at the gate itself? - A. Yes.

Q. I think you accept and indeed it has been suggested by my
   Lord, that if there was a gate further to the right or to the
   left which existed and could have been opened, that might have
   resolved the problem? - A. I don't think so.  Again it is
   difficult, but the major problem you have got here is you have
   got to come up from the terraces up some steps.  So you are at
   a lower level in that sense.  If you have had that effect of

                   people going down then, yes, that can block it as well, and
                   the general sort of melee.

              Q. Is it your considered view, and you have thought about it a
                 lot, that even in a situation of an emergency which had by
                 that time occurred there would have been no advantage in
                 having another hole in the fence which was the size, for
                 example, of the gate that existed? - A. That is difficult for
                 me to answer because I can't tell you how many people
                 eventually came through that gate and at what stage and
                 whether it would have saved life.  I don't know that.

              Q. Are you aware, Superintendent, that one of your Officers at
                 one stage was seen actually to be pulling the fencing away? -
                 A. Yes, I am aware of that.

              Q.   Obviously he was trying to do his best. Is that something you
                   would criticise him for doing that? - A. I would not criticise
                   him in those circumstances.  As I say, I believe that that
                   fence may well have saved life.

              Q.   What Iam trying to apply your mind to on this particular
                   subject, did you actually see him doing that? - A. No.

              Q.   If you had seen him doing it at that time would you have told
                   him to stop? - A. Yes, I think I probably would.  There might
                   have been something better he could have done at that stage.

              Q.    To put it to you quite clearly what i am saying is that if a
                   Police Officer is trying to tear it away then obviously it
                   would have been done much more effectively and efficiently
                   with a simple pair of pliers or pincers? - A. Oh, I think the
                   construction of the fence with a simple pair of pliers and
                   pincers would be totally impractical.

              Q. Or wire cutters? - A. Ordinary wire cutters, that would be
                 impractical.  I think again it is a question of what stage.       I
                 am talking about the early stages of the operation.

              Q. You say it was impractical for wire cutters, but the Officer
                 managed to do it with his bare hands. - A. I am not aware of
                 that.

              Q. That is the evidence, and you can see after the event part of
                 the fencing was actually away. - A. That is not at pen 3, is
                 it?   Am I right in saying that is not at pen 3?

              Q. It is pen 4. People were having problems in pen 4 as well. -
                 A. Different fencing though, I think, as well.

              Q. Different fencing between pen 3 and pen 4? - A. I think so.

                      Cross-Examined bv MR. KALLIPETIS:

    Q. Mr. Greenwood, you have referred to some photographs in
       support of your evidence that Officers had been sent via the
       tunnel to evacuate the Leppings Lane terrace? - A. Yes.

    Q. You were just about to produce some.  To which photographs
       were you referring, please? - A. I have some Police
       photographs which show.

    Q. Are these some that have not been disclosed to the rest of us
       in the form of bundles? - A. I have no idea on that.

              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Were they on there when you came
         to the witness box? - A. No, they are photographs I brought.

    Q.        MR. KALLIPETIS:   May I see them?

               MR. COLLINS:   Sir, while that is happening can I help,
         because obviously I have seen more evidence than perhaps
         everyone else.   As I understand it, and I think Mr.
         Woodward will confirm this, Officers were in the back of
         that tunnel at certainly by quarter-past-3. Indeed,
         Superintendent Murray yesterday gave that evidence, and
         for the record it is page 102 of yesterday's transcript,
         but there is no evidence so far as we have been able to
         find that anyone specifically sent Officers to that
         area .

              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Page 102 you are referring to, is
         that where he mentioned....

              MR. COLLINS:   Going round the back at about 3.15.      He
         says in his statement about 3.15.

              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   And finding about 50 people
         hanging about and an Inspector and some Officers clearing them
         out?

              MR. COLLINS:    That is right.  But as far as the evidence
         goes we have no evidence that any Officer in command
         specifically sent.   Certain Officers just went there of their
         own accord.  So certainly there were Officers round the back
         by 3.14 or whenever.

              MR. KALLIPETIS:   I am grateful for that, because
         reading the evidence that has been supplied to me it did
         appear by chance some Officers had been passing the tunnel
         and they saw some people emerging in a distressed state,
         and that is when they went in to assist, Sergeant Burns
         and Serial 16 coming from the back of the North Stand in
         response to the call to come to the pitch because of a
         pitch invasion.  That is why I wanted to explore that
         point if there was a command:

    Q. There was not one given by you, Mr. Greenwood? - A. No, not a
       direct command.

                                                  R.L. GREENWOOD



Q. For the record, this photograph Mr. Greenwood has produced is
   timed 15.13, and it shows Police Officers at the back of the
   Leppings Lane terrace emerging from the tunnel. I think it
   also shows that the tunnel is fairly congested as far as we
   can see it, certainly where it emerges on to the terrace
   itself.  Would you like to have a look at it? - A. Yes, sir.
   (Handed to witness) Yes, there looks to be a gap in front
   of it, but the there are people in the tunnel and Police
   Officers there as well.

Q. Mr. Greenwood, you were the most senior Officer in charge of
   the ground inside.   You were aware of the Major Incident plan,
   I take it? - A. Yes.

Q. You were aware that the assembly for casualties was the
   gymnasium entrance and the gymnasium itself? - A. Yes.

Q. When you refer in your statement that it is within your
   knowledge that an ambulance was parked between the Kop and the
   North Stand, were you referring to a Yorkshire Metropolitan
   ambulance or a St. John ambulance? - A. I don't know.   I don't
   which ambulance it was.  It was within my knowledge there was
   an ambulance parked there normally.  I understand there were
   two on this occasion.

Q.   As the most senior Officer inside the ground did you know     that
     is the station for the liaison officer of the Ambulance
     Service for this particular match? — A. No, I did not.

Q. You did not know that? - A. No, I did not.

Q. Do you know which Officer you sent to the ambulance at that
   far end? - A. Yes, I think do.  I think it was a Sergeant I
   sent down there.

Q.   Do you remember his name? - A. Sergeant Morton.

Q.   Do I understand your evidence also correctly that you yourself
     did not in fact put in a call for ambulance support? - A. No,
     I think what I said is I can't recall that.     I know ambulances
     had been asked for.   It may well have been me.     It may well
     have been somebody else.   I don't know.

Q.   As the Officer in charge on the ground, inside the ground, did
     you give any instruction for organising, first, to which
     entrance the ambulances were to come? - A. No, I did not.

Q. Secondly, where the casualties were to be taken to get to the
   ambulances? - A. I think there was certainly a discussion in
   terms of bodies.  I cannot refer specifically to casualties.
   I can't remember casualties.  There was certainly in terms of
   bodies.

Q. As far that afternoon was concerned, faced with the situation
   you were once you realised what had happened, did you give any
   instructions as to where casualties were to be taken to meet
                           72

                                                R.L. GREENWOOD


   up with ambulances that had been called? - A. No, I did not
   give any instructions.

Q. It is quite clear, is not it, from your observation as well as
   from what you have read and seen that in fact there were two
   areas which required ambulance support? There was the back of
   the Leppings Lane terrace and there was the front of the
   terrace? - A . Y e s .

Q. And casualties were being brought out to the rear of the
   terrace through the tunnel from the centre and towards the
   rear of the packed pen? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q. And other casualties were coming out of the front? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you give any instruction at all for the co­
   ordination of where the ambulances were to go to pick
   up whichever casualties were being brought out of the
   pens? - A. No.

                 Cross-Examined by MR. GLASGOW:

Q. Mr. Greenwood, have you got the larger of the two Police
   bundles, Vol. 1, the fat one?   Tab 5, please.   That is the
   letter sent by the Police to the <?lub after the 1981 incident,
   is not it? You have been referred to a little bit of it, but
   if you refresh your memory from the context I think it is
   fairly plain what it is? - A. Yes, it talks about the Semi-
   Final .

Q. Written t o ;the Chairman of the club? - A. Yes.   It is not very
   clear this copy.

Q. I am sorry, none of our copies is very clear, but I can
   probably help you if you have difficulty.  There is only one
   part I need to refer you to. What had happened, Mr.
   Greenwood, was there had been an exchange of letters between
   the Chairman and the Assistant Chief Constable. The Chairman
   had been putting forward the club's view as to how the
   incident arose, and this was a very candid reply from the
   Assistant Chief Constable.  I think that is right, is not it?
   - A. Yes, or the Chief Constable.

Q. I did not know the signature.  Is it in fact the Chief
   Constable? - A. I am not sure.  It could be.

Q. If we just go back one tab, to 4, we see the debriefing which
   had been chaired by Mr. Goslin, the then Assistant Chief
   Constable (Operations). - A. Yes.

Q. And you have already been referred to that.  It is clear, is
   it not, it was in the light of that debriefing that the reply
   was then sent to the club after the Assistant Chief Constable
   had exchanged his views with the senior Officers who had been
   present at the 1981 incident? - A. Well, I can't tie the two
   together because I have not read them, but reading....

 MR. GLASGOW:
Q. /I am sorry to have to ask you about it, Hr. Greenwood, but
    I think you are probably the only Officer that we may hear
    from who was present, other than Inspector Calvert.  Were
    you, in fact, senior to Inspector Calvert at that time? -
    A.  No, I was of equal rank.

Q. You were just the same.  It is a coincidence that your
   name appears above his? - A. Yes.

Q. Were you aware of the fact that the criticism which the
   Club were making, through the Chairman, was that the
   Police had apparently helped fans to climb over the fence?
   - A. No, I am not aware of that.

Q. If you go to page 3 of Tab 4, I think it may help you.
   Half-way down or a little more than half-way down the fat
   central paragraph, you see, about eight lines up from the
   bottom of that paragraph:

        "Hr. Herold said that this situation prompted the
        only criticism of the police by the   club in that we
        seemed to be helping fans to climb over the
        rai1ings."

   That was really what the Chairman of the Club, Hr. HcGee,
   had been saying.  Does that help to remind you of what was
   said at that meeting, I know a long time ago? - A. It does
   remind me of something, that myself and my colleague who
   opened the gates appeared to be under a great deal of
   pressure - my recollection is that it emanated from the
   Club - in terms of the fact that we had let out a lot of
   people on to the pitch.  I do recollect that.

Q. And that the criticism from the Club appears to be
   contained in that sentence, although I am afraid we do not
   have the letter, that the Police appear to have assisted
   people to climb over the fence particularly.   Do you see
   that? - A. Yes, I see that.   I do not recall that
   specifically.

Q. I am happy to assume that it is the Chief Constable’s
   letter, but the Police reply, in any event, at Tab 5 is
   saying, in terms, in the second paragraph, five or six
   lines down of the second paragraph of the letter of 5th
   June, 1981, Tab 5:

        "In this respect my only criticism of my senior
        officers is for not opening the gate earlier thus
        avoiding the emergency measure of allowing and
        helping spectators to climb over the fence. 11

   Do you see that? - A. Yes,     I see that.

Q. Refreshing your memory,    if necessary,     from the notes of
                            75

                                                  R. L. GREENWOOD



     the debriefing, was there, in fact, any criticism of the
     senior Officers for not opening the gate earlier?   I know
     that is what it says in the letter, but do you remember
     whether anybody was criticised for doing that because it
     does not appear in the notes? - A. No, I cannot recall
     that at all.   I think the feeling was one of criticism
     that we had actually opened the gates.

Q. With great respect, that had appeared from your evidence
   and I wondered whether you knew that the Club were being
   told that the senior Officers were being criticised for
   not opening the gates early enough? - A. I cannot
   recollect that at all.  I cannot recollect that.  The
   criticism, as I recollect it, seemed to be coming - I have
   no direct evidence - from the Club, that we had let so
   many people out on to the pitch, the question of
   semi-finals, future semi-finals, and the question of the
   state of the pitch.  That was the pressure that seemed to
   be coming.

Q. Hr. Greenwood, was it within your knowledge and is it fair
   to say that this incident marked the end of a period of
   rather poor liaison between the Club and the Police and,
   in fact, the period of very close liaison that we see
   growing after that stems almost directly from the
   co-operation which followed this incident? - A. No, I
   think it would be some time later than that.  I think the
   biggest development that I have seen was with the
   appointment of Hr. Lock, in terms of liaison with....

Q. You think it was some years later? - A. Yes.

Q.    In any event, it is right to say that the solution to the
     problem whichhad led to the    1981 incident was put forward
     by the Police, I think? - A., You mean in terms of side
     railings?

Q. The pens.  What we have called the radial fences? - A. The
   radial fences, yes.

Q.   That was your suggestion? - A. That was not my suggestion.

Q.   I am so sorry, I mean you on behalf of the Police? - A. It
     appears so, yes, although I could not recollect that.

Q. And at least, whatever other criticisms there may have
   been, there was complete co-operation between the Police
   and the Club over drawing up those proposals and putting
   them forward for permission to install them, was there
   not? - A. I cannot comment on that because I was not
   involved in the....

Q. You were not personally involved? - A. No.

Q. It would be right, would it not, as appears from the point
   which was helpfully put to you by Lord Justice Taylor,
   that if we look at photograph No. 45 again, it was the
   installation of those radial fences against - I am so
   sorry, it is the West Yorkshire 2.  Do you remember that
   photograph was drawn to your attention by Lord Justice
   Taylor - that we see the rather asymmetrical design, in
   that the gates seem to be disproportionate to the centre
   of the pens? - A. I am sorry, could you remind me of the
   album?

Q. It is paragraph 45 in the West Yorkshire bundle, the fat
   West Yorkshire Bundle, 2.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Is that the thick one?

Q.         HR. GLASGOW:     West Hidlands.  Did I say West
     Yorkshire?    I am sorry? - A. I have not seen that one
     before, sir.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I do not know if that is the
     one we looked at, but it does not matter.  It shows the
     same point.

Q.         HR. GLASGOW:I do apologise. Perhaps it shows    the
     same point, that the gate that we can see with the things
     hanging on it is not at all central to the pen and,
     therefore, if it is to be used for getting out, it would
     be happier if it were in the middle? - A. Yes.

Q. But it is apparent, is it not, from the history that we
   know, that the reason for that is that, of course, the
   gates were already in position at regular intervals along
   the front?

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Not very regular, in fact, but
     there we are.  It does not look asthough they regular,
     does it, if you look at the two on   our right there?

          HR. GLASGOW:   I will be corrected if I am wrong.     I
     believe, sir, they are regular, but....

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Really? 45 is very much a
     trump day then if that is the case because it may be
     symmetrical, but they are not equidistant.   Count the
     number of sections in between.   Take 46, for example.  You
     have only got four sections between the two gates on the
     left.   You have got considerably more than that on the
     next two, have not you?

          HR. GLASGOW:   We get it better - and I am indebted
     to my friend - we get it better from the plan, sir.   I do
     not know, has this got a reference number? Yes.   You
     remember the one that we have looked at.

                                                             R. L. GREENWOOD




                   LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Yes.

                   HR. GLASGOW:   Your point is perfectly right, of
              course.  Certainly on the right-hand side, against the
              high ground of 6 and 7, there is a very large space
              there.

                   LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Between 5 and 6?

                   HR. GLASGOW:   Between 5 and 6.  Say pens 6 and 7,
              but perhaps I am right in saying that Gates 1, 2, 3, 4 and
              5 - even that I cannot see - seem to be almost exactly
              spaced, are they?

                   LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Not exactly.   Not far off.

                   HR. GLASGOW:   I accept the correction:

           Q. But the difficulty, Hr. Greenwood, arose because - if it
              is a difficulty - the fences are put in after the gates
              are there, are not they? Do you remember that much? Do
              you remember the radial fences going in with existing
              gates? - A. No, I do not at all.   I do not know whether
              the gates are the same or the fencing is the same as
              1981.

           Q. Did you have any input - and that is not meant critically?
              - A. No.

           Q. Did you actually have any involvement in this work at all
              in 1981/82? - A. No, I did not.  I was present at the
              debriefing.

           Q. At the meetings? - A. Yes, at the debriefing meetings, for
              the purpose, obviously, of feeding information in as to my
              involvement, but I had no involvement in terms of
              improvements to the ground, etc.

           Q. Well, as one of the Officers then, at least, who was
              present at the debriefing? - A. Yes.

           Q. Was anything said at any later stage by an Assistant
              Chief Constable or Chief Constable to ensure that the
              problem which he had said to the Club existed about the
              gates not being opened in time was brought to senior
              Officers’ attention? - A. No, I thought they were opened
              at the time, from my recollection, early enough.

           Q. I appreciate that.  The position is that you think that
              the criticism that was being passed on to the Club in
              terms of "Hy only criticism of my senior Officers is that
              they did not open the gates in time"? - A. Yes.

                                                                R. L. GREENWOOD



               Q. If that was the belief of your Commanding Officer at that
                  time, he certainly did not tell you or any of the Officers
                  that you worked this ground with that the gates were to be
                  opened more promptly in future? - A. That is not within my
                  recollection at all.

               Q. So the position is that, after there had been this one
                  warning, if I may call it that, of the 1981 incident and
                  the Police had written to the Club, saying, in response to
                  their criticisms, "We think that the senior Officers did
                  not open the gates in time," absolutely nothing was said
                  to those senior Officers to ensure that that problem did
                  not arise again? - A. I cannot recollect at all that and I
                  cannot agree with the statement because it is not within
                  my recollection at all.

               Q. I see.   Did you, at least, know that the suggestion was,
                  not surprisingly, that the matter should be referred to
                  the Working Party, of whom the Club were not a member? -
                  A. I cannot even recall there being a Working Party at
                  that time.

               Q. It is said on page 2 of the letter, and I know you are not
                  familiar with it, but does it jog your memory at all:

                         "I consider it advisable for the Safety at Grounds
                         Committee of the South Yorkshire County Council to
                         v i s i t . ... "


                    - A. I cannot honestly remember that there was a Working
                    Party in existence at that time.

               Q. At least you can recall though that the solution, if it be
                  a solution - the only one that was offered - came from the
                  Police and from nobody else? - A. No, I cannot because
                  until it has been drawn to ay attentiion about the
                  railings, I could not even remember that.

               Q. Well, I will not press it with you.  Thank you for trying
                  that far.  I will bring you more up-to-date, Hr.
                  Greenwood, if I may, up to 1985? - A. Yes.

               Q.   If you can switch on to then? - A. Yes.

               Q.   You remember, at least, that the layout of the Leppings
                    Lane entrances were changed in 1985, again as a result of
                    co-operation between the Police and the Club in the
                    planning stages? - A. I remember that the turnstiles were
                    changed.   I know that an alternative plan was put forward
                    by the Police then and that was not the one that was
                    implemented.

               Q. Correct, and there was concern as to whether or not the
                  plan that was finally adopted was going to be satisfactory

                                                  R. L. GREENWOOD



   to the Police? - A .   I do not recall that.

Q. Would you like to look at Tab 10 of the bundle in front of
   you then?   I am sorry, it is 9.  I think 10 is omitted
   because it is the photographs.   Go to the very last page
   before you get to 11.   That is the page I want to ask you
   about, Hr. Greenwood, but if you would flip back two more
   pages, we can see what the document is that I am referring
   to? - A. Yes.

Q. Do you see it is a note of the meeting held at
   Hillsborough on 22nd January, 1986? - A. Yes.

Q. And, of course, this is the Working Party,     is not it? - A.
   Ye s .

Q. And you are, at that stage, a member of it? - A. I was at
   that meeting representing someone else, yes.

Q. You are a member of the Working Party, as recorded, I
   think? - A. No, my Superintendent was a member of the
   Working Party.  I was deputising, I think, for him on
   that....

Q. You are part of the team? - A. Yes.

Q. I see, and, because it is at the ground, of course,
   representatives of the Club were in attendance.  Do you
   see at the top there is a different heading, "Representing
   the Sheffield Club"? - A. Yes, I remember Dr. Eastwood.
   Dr.  Eastwood, I remember him being there, yes.

Q. Do you remember the groundsman, Hr. Ward? - A. No,     I
   cannot recall him.

Q. And back to the last page.  Do you remember that, in the
   course of the ground inspection, the Club wanted to know -
   if it helps your recollection, I think it was the
   groundsman, but it does not matter - the Club wanted to
   know whether or not the Police were satisfied with the way
   that the new layout of the gates was working, and somebody
   appears to have said the Police representative confirmed
   that the revised segregation arrangements - do you see
   that on the last page, under capital C, thefirst new
   matter? - A. The one that you are referring to is:

        "The Police representative confirmed that the revised
        segregation arrangements to the rear of the Stand
        worked well on by far the majority of occasions"?

Q. That is right, yes, and what is there being referred to,
   of course, is the segregation of turnstiles, is not it?
   It is the new layout of the turnstiles? - A. The layout in
   terms of being able to accommodate both away and home
                                             R. L. GREENWOOD



supporters at that particular end of the ground.

Which at that time was still a divided end, in shorthand?
- A. That is right, the wall and the door in the wall.

Do you remember that and, indeed, was it you - and I ask
the two questions at once - who confirmed that they were
working well? - A. No, I do not remember it at all and I
really cannot remember whether they were working well.   I
do remember the meeting because I remember the discussion
- well, I am not sure if it was the first meeting or the
second meeting - about the accommodation of the disabled,
so that certainly....

Does that help to jog your memory? That was the previous
matter? - A. Yes, we were looking for the disabled going
on to the Spion Kop off the pitch and, at the first
meeting, it would appear that we were going to get support
from the Local Authority, who might have been in a
position to impose conditions, as I remember, and at the
second meeting we did not get any support at all because
we were looking to get the disabled on the Spion Kop.




                             /Q. Right.   If that has.

                                      R. GREENWOOD


Q. Right, if that has helped you to orientate yourself may we
   now come back to;;the West terrace and Stand at letter C
   and remind yourself.   As you said you were deputising for
   your Superintendent? - A. Yes.

Q. But you were the Police representative? - A. I think there
   might have been more than one Police representative.

Q. Oh yes? - A. I was certainly at the meeting.

Q. But you are the senior Officer out of them, are you not?
   - A. Yes, from the Division.

Q. And if anybody was going to comment on whether these new
   gates were working well it would have been you, surely,
   because you were policing the ground regularly at that
   stage in command in that area? - A. Yes. As I say I just
   cannot recall.  I have specific reasons for recalling the
   disabled one, that is why it jogs my memory, but this one
   doesn *t.

Q. That is perfectly fair, Mr. Greenwood.  Could I put it in
   the negative if it does not seem unfair and the alternative
   to you? - A. Yes.

Q. If in fact the new layout of the turnstiles had not been
   working to your satisfaction, do you think you would have
   told the Safety Working Committee about that or at least
   the Club? - A. Yes, I think so.  In 1985 we were having
   large crowds then.  I cannot recall anything at that time
   apart from the crescent layout that was suggested which
   we all felt was a better idea, undue problems, I would say
   that, but I don't recollect it.

Q. Could I just bring you on to the next two years, 1987 and
   1988 which were both of course capacity crowds, both semi­
   finals, both policed by you, if again I can be forgiven
   for the shorthand? - A. Yes.

Q. Did anything at all happen in terms of the use of the new
   layout of the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end that
   caused you the slightest concern as to whether they were
   working well or not? - A. No, I cannot recollect that.
   If that had have been the case then clearly something
   would have been said about it. As I have said earlier
   it was a totally different crowd, totally different
   circumstances than what we had this year from what I have
   seen.

 Q. And if - I am sure we all wish we could - put the clock
    back to the day before this tragedy occurred and anybody
    had asked you whether you were satisfied that that en(*
    of the ground could cope reasonably well with the crowd
    that was anticipated, would you have had any qualms or
    concern yourself from your previous experience? - A. No,
    I would have said so the year before I think if that had
    been the case.

    Q. There is one last matter.  I wonder if you can remember back.
       Do you remember after the pens were first introduced, the
       radial fences were built and the pens were first introduced,
       the Club started to use numbered tickets for the terraces.
       Do you remember that? - A. I don't recall that.

    Q. No recollection of that at all? - A.  No, to behonest I
       can't even remember the question of radial fences being
       introduced as a result of the 1981 things

    Q. Do you remember any exchanges at all between the Police -
       I am not putting it to you that it was you because I can't
       I don't know which Officer it was - but suggestions from
       the Police about not having numbered tickets for pens
       because there may be packing of those pens and it would be
       more difficult for the Police on the ground? - A. I can't
       recall that at all, no.  I can't even remember numbered
       tickets.

    Q. No memory at all? - A. No.

    Q. I think I am in a position to put to   you with somecon­
       fidence that there were numbered tickets for quite a period
       of time but you have absolutely no recollection of that?
       - A. Serving what purpose?

    Q. So that as the fans came into the pens they were able to
       be told which pen they were in and the Police objected to
       that, courteously and understandably, because it made the
       process of packing those pens too difficult? - A. And fans
       were told by Police Officers you mean?

    Q.   Yes. - A. No, I can't recall.

    Q.   Absolutely no recollection? -A. No, none whatsoever.

              MR. GLASGOW:    Thank you for trying.

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I don't quite follow what that
         system was, Mr. Glasgow.   You say "numbered"?

               MR. GLASGOW:   Yes, there was a period of time when
         the pens were numbered.   We have certainly I think traced
         a ticketing system up to 4. We may have to call the printers
         of the tickets, but our understanding is when the pens were
         first introduced ...

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I only wanted to understand.
         You are talking about the number of a pen, hot the number
         of a ticket?

               MR. GLASGOW:   Oh no, no.

                LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: So a lot of people would have
         '3' on it and a lot of people would have '4' on it. Yes,
         I see.

                MR. GLASGOW:  Yes, precisely, but I have taken it as
          far as I can, sir, and thank you.

                  LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Mr. Woodward?


                          Cross-Examined by   .MR. WOODWARD:

     Q. Mr. Greenwood, may I ask you just about 1987, the semi-final
        that year to start with.  That was on a Sunday, I think?
        - A. Yes, it was.

     Q. Are you aware, in fact, that on that occasion, as in 1988
        and in 1989, there were turnstiles on the Penistone Road
        which were taken out of operation? - A. Yes.

     Q. The same turnstiles were not operating? - A. No.

                LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Well I had understood yesterday,
          was it yesterday, that the only occasion that had happened
          previously was 1988?

                MR. WOODWARD:  Sir, with respect when one looks at the
          question and answer, it may be sir that the question was put
          to the witness:  "So it only happened on one occasion?" and
          I think he agreed with that, but I think with respect, sir,
          the evidence will be that it happened on all three occasions.

                  LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Yes, thank you.

     Q.         MR. WOODWARD:  May I ask you now about 1988. You were
          working outside the ground in 1988 and a significant portion
          of your attention and time was given to going up and down
          Leppings Lane? - A. Yes.

     Q. There has been some suggestion that on Leppings Lane in 1988
        there was a cordon, a barrier, a filter of Officers.   The
        evidence is not consistent but it is to the effect that
        people were being sifted, sorted and asked whether or not
        they had got tickets by a system.  What do you say about
        that? - A. No, that never existed that feordon from my
        recollection.  It would be totally impracticable to introduce
        that.
     0. Part of the evidence includes the suggestion that there
        was actually a barrier put across the road at the Penistone
        Lane end, one of these metal barriers such as we see across
        Vere Road? - A. Penistone Road itself?

     Q. Somewhere along Leppings Lane put across ---

                   LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Leppings Lane, not Penistone
          Road?
                   MR. WOODWARD:   Yes, towards the Penistone Road end.

                LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Towards the roundabout?

                MR. WOODWARD:   Yes, of Leppings Lane.

     Q. Did anything like that happen to your knowledge? - A. No, no.

     Q.   Are you aware of any reason why that might have been done
          even? - A. No, I would not have done it.    It is impracticable
          to check people with tickets by way of a cordon. There are
          all sorts of ramifications in terms of the spin-offs there
          are going to be to that.   It would not be part of my strategy
          and I cannot recollect it.

     Q. You can't conceive of it having been done or the reason for
        it to be done in 1988 and to your knowledge it was not done?
        - A. Yes.

     Q. You say "spin-offs" if that happens.  What do you have in
        mind? What problems or difficulties does that give rise to?
        - A. Well you are talking I think in the first instance of
        how many Officers you would need to control a situation like
        that, how many Officers to undertake it.

     Q.   You would need the Officers first of allto present the
          barrier or to make the filter? - A. Yes.

     Q. And in the event of those Officers being confronted by
        individuals who were not to go through what would happen?
        - A. Yes, you would get a public order situation under those
        circumstances.

     Q. Those individuals would have to be dealt with in one way
        or another? - A. That is right.

     Q. Of course if they had simply turned round and went away that
        would be no problem.  Is it your experience that they would
        be likely to do that? - A. No, not within my experience,
        no.

     Q. Does that have manpower implications accordingly? - A. A
        tremendous manpower implication, yes.  It is an impossibility
        in my view to do something of that nature and it is fraught
        with danger.

     Q. Perhaps we don't need to go into all the details of the
        problems that gives rise to, but it would have a manpower
        implication? - A. Certainly.

     Q. What particular danger or problem would you foresee? - A.
        Well you are creating a public order situation there.
        The reaction of people.  What are you going to do with
        them?  If they have not got tickets are you going to
        detain them? The number of Officers you have got at that
        particular location.  You have got other supporters who
        will be coming along that will be held up and the whole
        thing could blow up very very quickly.

Q. Is that something even in hindsight you would do again if
   put in charge of a semi-final at Hillsborough? - A. I would
   not do that sir, no.

Q. May I ask you now about the opening of perimeter gates.
   You have been referred to the 1981 documentation which appears
   at Tab 4, amongst others, in the bundle.   If one looks at
   page 2 of the Minute at Tab 4 there is an observation in the
   third paragraph from the bottom, the centre paragraph of the
   page, last sentence, talking about the gates having been
   ordered open:

           "This was done by opening the gates, releasing
           a few spectators and then closing them to allow
           a steady flow.  This was difficult to maintain
           because as soon as pressure was relieved at the
           front the crush from the back filled the void."

     In terms of opening gates do you see a positive peril in
     having the perimeter gates open with people behind them? -
     A. Yes, I do, because people want to get out on to the
     pitch and that can create again a situation where there is
     risk of injury.

Q. It may be when all the evidence is looked at one will be able
   to make some informed view as to where the greater part of
   the injured were in 1989? - a. Yes.

Q. One view may be that they seemed to be substantially related
   to where the gates are.  Do you follow that? - A. Yes.

Q. If that is the case does it surprise you at all? - A. No,
   it would not surprise me.

Q. Is that because you might have some expectation of the con­
   sequences of having gates opened? - A. Yes.

Q. What is that? - A. Well the fact that you have this danger
   of the surging effect from the back which creates an even
   greater pressure at the front.

Q.   May I just ask you    about the surging and crowd   .

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Well that produces this almost
     Alice in Wonderland situation, doesn't it, that if you get
     crushing, the gate that you have got which was supposed to
     be there to relieve it, if opened is likely to cause more
     crushing? - A. That is a possibility, my Lord.   In 1981 ---

Q. So what, don't open it? - A. No, in 1981 we were able to get
   people through the gate at that particular time because the
   crushing was not as bad.  In 1989 it was not possible to get
   people through the gate because it was jam packed around it
   and I think that the crowd condition may - I wish I could
   comment better on this - may have altered as time went on.
   Certainly when I looked over the fence in the first instance,
                                     R. GREENWOOD


  as I have said, I am quite clear that two-thirds of my
  estimate of people were watching the game.  Now what
  happened as a result of the action that was taken then
  when people became aware or more aware that gates were
  open and that people were getting out I don't know, but
  I know what happened in 1981 when the gates were open
  and people got out.

Q. What I put to you is not facetious and it is all wrong if
   you are saying also that it would have been a mistake to
   try and cut holes in the fencing to get people out. You
   seem to be saying, unless I have misunderstood you, that
   given some crushing has occurred you should then actually
   be grateful for the existence of the fence unbroken because,
   it is going to stop it getting worse and I find that a
   rather extraordinary proposition? - A. No, when I was talking
   about the fence, if the fence had collapsed then people
   would have been trapped.   I think if that had gone down
   people that had not realised at the back what was actually
   happening at the front may well then have seen a way, like
   they did in 1981, of getting on to the pitch and may well
   have gone over the top, or there may well have been panic
   setting in which caused those people towards the middle
   where the pressure was less great, but still there if you
   wish, to want to get out when the poor people at the front
   were trapped by the wall.   If the fence had not been there
   then it would have been extremely difficult in my view to
   still get those people out that were trapped at the front
   by the wall in the well, so to speak.

Q. So you say that when the people were crushed, as you saw
   them when you arrived at the fence that time, if you could
   have waved a wand and lifted the whole fence away, that would
   have been a disadvantage rather than an advantage at that
   time? - A. It may well be in my opinion.  I saw it as being
   an exit. When I looked through over the fence the option
   that I saw was to get people to move back and there was room
   to do so and that would have eased the pressure at the front.

                                                                 R.L. GREENWOOD


               Q. May we just look, Mr. Greenwood, at the photographs, the
                  composite, of the fans in the ground, and DB 17/4, the 4th
                  photograph in the bundle, timed at   15.00. That shows the gate
                  to be open, probably gate 5.  Do you see? - A. DB 17/14.

               Q.    Is that gate 5, are you able to see.Looking at the back     one
                    can see the Howarth Timber sign, and then a projection in
                    the stand and a fence to the right    with a steward in a
                    yellow tabard or yellow waistcoat.     Would that be gate 5? -
                    A. I am not sure.

               Q.   Then at 15.02 one can see a photograph PR 1/10A and a number
                    of other photographs, PR 1/11A, PR 1 12/A, demonstrating that
                    there are Policemen giving their attention, including
                    yourself? - A. Yes.

               Q. To fans and that certain gates are already open by that time?
                  - A. That is right.  Going back to DB 17/14, it may well be 5,
                  because I think that is the Sergeant there at the entrance to
                  the gate.  I recognise him.

               Q. Are you able to name that gentleman? Do you know his name? -
                  A. I do, but I can't just recollect it.

               Q.   Is it Chapman? - A. No, I don't think so.  It is the one I
                    think that was very actively involved at gate 4.

               Q.   Mr. Swift, I think? - A. I think that may be the one, yes.

               Q.   Sergeant Swift.   You seized a Tannoy. You endeavoured to get
                    the fans to go back. - A. Yes.

               Q. You did other things following this event to organise and
                  assist? - A. Yes.

               Q. Did there come a time when you actually went round the ground
                  with your loud hailer? - A. Yes, I did.   There was some
                  trouble in the uncovered seats in the South Stand where it
                  appeared that it might be a conflict between Notts Forest
                  supporters who were allocated that part of the ground and
                  Liverpool supporters who may well have gone in there.    Police
                  Officers went in there to sort that problem out, and I
                  broadcast it to the crowd and asked for their assistance, and
                  it seemed to have a good quietening effect.   So I then went
                  the whole of the perimeter of the Spion Kop and the North
                  Stand at about 15-20 yard intervals, and asked for their co­
                  operation and told them we were dealing with a serious
                  incident, and would they remain where they were, and they
                  acceded to that and we were applauded on every occasion.    At
                  one stage what I would call the hard core singing, chanting
                  group of Notts Forest supporters in the Spion Kop were
                  silenced by the rest of the crowd.

               Q. May I move on to ask you about another matter.        Did you have
                  any dealings or discussions with Mr. Dalglish and Mr. Clough?
                  - A . Y e s , I d i d . I remember when we got the bodies, the
                  casualties, out of the pen I think was trying to get in touch
                             93

     with Mr. Duckenfield about the rest of the game, and I turned
     round and saw Mr. Clough and Mr. Dalglish on the pitch.  I
     thought that was not a very wise move.

Q. Did they appear to be coming towards the Liverpool end? - A.
   They were.

Q. Plainly with the best of intentions? - A. I am quite sure.

Q. But did you consider that to be imprudent? - A. Certainly in
   the circumstances

Q. And did you take them or cause them to be taken to the control
   room? - A. That is right.

Q. Did you take them? - A. I took them part of the way because I
   was on my way to the boardroom where I understood Mr.
   Duckenfield was.  In fact, Mr. Dalglish went into the
   boardroom by mistake, and he had to be taken by a Sergeant up
   to the control box, so I left them at that stage.

Q.   Just two other matters.   Before the kick-off did you go up to
     the control room at all?   Do you remember? - A. Not that I can
     recall.  I don't think I went at all.

Q. On that day you were wearing your Policeman's uniform, were
   you? - A. Yes.

Q.   You had your hat on with the braid on?   - A. Yes.

Q.   Did you have an anorak on? - A. Yes.

Q. What colour was it? - A. A black one, sir.

Q. We can see that on the photographs.  You were in fact the
   Officer that stopped the game? - A. Yes.

Q. Do you recall spending any time up at the control room before
   the kick-off? - A. No, otherwise I think I would have
   knowledge of what was going on outside.

Q.   Or standing at all, if not in the control room,      on the
     platform outside? - A. No.

Q.   You did not go up there? - A. Yes.

Q.   Because you are aware of Mr. Hicks' evidence? - A. Yes.        I
     have not heard it but I am aware of the thrust of it.

Q.   That was not you? - A. No.

Q.   Although    he said it was the same    gentleman that stopped the
     game?

          MR. COLLINS:    I think he said it might be.

          MR. WOODWARD:    Yes, might be.   He believed it was the

          sa m e :

     Q. Comparing 1988, the behaviour of the crowd then, people coming
        into Leppings Lane entrance in 1989, do you discern a
        difference? - A. Yes, there is a big difference in terms of
        the crowd flow and from what I have seen on television in
        terms of the mood as w e l l , the mood of spectators.

     Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   The mood of t h e   - A. The mood
          of spectators outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles, my Lord.

     Q. Have you in mind there was an incident where an Officer with a
        moustache on horseback is having a verbal exchange, to put it
        mildly, with a few fans? - A. Yes.

     Q. Apart from that have you seen anything on the video to show
        any bad temper? - A. No, I don't say bad temper in that sense.
        I said earlier it is a unique experience in my view.  I
        cannot understand - it is an uncontrollable situation by
        Police - I cannot understand in many ways that people, that
        supporters have gone into that situation.

     Q. You mean the numbers? - A. The numbers in that way, yes.  I
        can't understand the motives.  I wonder whether there is
        something which might be underlying the situation that is not
        clear.

     Q.        MR. WOODWARD:   What do you mean? - A. Well, it is only
          opinion, but from my experience of football supporters, and I
          am not talking about football supporters in general, I wish to
          make that perfectly clear, but minorities of football
          supporters when one talks of Stanley knives and lemon
          squeegees full of ammonia, Police Officers having
          their helmets slashed and not knowing about it, me
          having to brief my Officers in terms of searching, to
          be most careful if they put their hands in
          spectators* pockets because of the danger of cutting
          through Stanley knives;  the question of people not
          having tickets going to grounds.

     Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   You are talking in general, are
          you? You are not talking about this match? - A. I am talking
          about what I saw and trying to relate it to my experiences in
          general in football.  The question of forgeries which
          particularly has been evident on previous Liverpool fixtures.

     Q.        MR. WOODWARD:   What is the point or the suspicion in
          your mind? What are you saying? - A. I wonder whether it was
          from some people's points of view it may have been a concerted
          effort to get into that ground.

     Q. What do you mean? To embarrass the efforts of other people to
        maintain order? - A. No, I think if people are intent on
        by-passing Police operations and they wish to do
        something and get into the game, then it is feasible, it
        is possible that they could take steps to do that, and
        there is a strategy that underlies it to get into the

                                                R.L. GREENWOOD


     ground when they may not be allowed access because they
     don't have tickets.

          MR. HYTNER:   I wonder, sir, before Mr. Collins re­
     examines, my clients have suffered a little from lurid
     headlines.  The answer that has just been given is a little
     discursive.  I wonder if it could be made clear by the Officer
     that he is not saying that he saw a«aonia filled squeegees and
     Stanley knives on this occasion, otherwise it will be the next
     headline.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   He will correct me if I am wrong,
     but this is why I asked him about this match or not.  What I
     understood him to be saying is that he has over his Police
     experience come across these unpleasant incidents and that
     experience colours the view he then expressed that this might
     have been on this occasion a concerted effort to get in.   But
     I don't think he was saying he saw any of these particular
     things on this occasion.

          MR. HYTNER:   That is as I understand it, sir, and i am
     grateful to you for making that clear.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   That is right, is it, Officer? -
     A. Yes, that is right, my Lord.

                     Re-Examined bv MR. COLLINS:

Q. To be fair, Superintendent, the position is this, is it not,
   that you have put forward what can loosely be called the
   conspiracy theory? Right? Because in the view of the Police
   there are two alternatives, are there not? Either the
   operation went badly wrong or the operation didn't go wrong
   but there was a concerted effort by the fans whom you have
   identified to get into the ground willy nilly, and if you
   don't want to accept the Police got it wrong the only
   alternative is the conspiracy theory, for which there is
   precious little evidence if any? That is a fair way of
   putting it, is not it? - A. No, I don't think so, because in
   terms of the Police operation, the Police getting it wrong, I
   think there is another alternative to that, and that is the
   fact that if you are swamped by people, no matter what
   situation you are in, that is another alternative, and I don't
   class that as a Police operation going wrong.

Q. What do you class that as? - A. I class that as something that
   is beyond control.

Q. An act of God? Inevitable accident?   Is that really what you
   are saying? Something that could not possibly have been
   foreseen or dealt with or met by any sort of Police operation?
   Is that seriously what you are saying is a reasonable
   alternative? - A. I don't think it is an act of God.  I
   described it as a phenomenon.  It is something that is unique
   in my experience from what I have seen and what I have heard.

Q. May I just deal with one other matter.    The Sergeant Morton
                          96

                                               R.L. GREENWOOD


   you were referring to, the Officer you think it was you sent
   to the ambulance, that in fact I believe is Detective Sergeant
   Morton, who was in uniform on the occasion, but is in fact a
   Detective Sergeant? - A. Yes, that is correct.

Q. Can I ask you one thing about him, because it may be he will
   give evidence, and I think you ought in fairness be able to
   deal with this.  Do you recall seeing him specifically when
   you returned from having stopped the game to go back to the
   perimeter fence? - A. No, I don't.

Q. His recollection may be that you did and that he then pointed
   out to you there were a number of dead people, 30 or 40 I
   think? - A. Yes, I do recall it.  I don't recall it at the
   time but he has said it to me since.  I recall it.  He said,
   "The first three or four rows were dead and I told you” , and I
   don't recall that at the time.

Q. And he was saying to you that you, the Police, "We must get
   the crowd to retreat backwards and get immediate assistance,
   particularly oxygen". He mean I think medical assistance? -
   A. Yes.  I can't recall it in those terms.

Q. And you then commenced to use your personal radio, or to try
   to do so, but I think did not manage to get through, or did
   not believe you had got through? - A. Again I can't recall
   that.  It refers to the discussion when I was talking about
   ambulances, etc.

Q. Perhaps one thing which is more important, and it is this.
   You say it was your - I shall use the word "perception" - at
   the time you first went on to the fences that there was room
   for people to get back and the that the tunnel was clear, or
   not? - A . Y e s .

Q. You see, we know as a matter of fact people were still coming
   in through that tunnel after 3 o'clock.  Were you aware people
   were still coming in notwithstanding that the game had started
   and notwithstanding that the crushing had started to develop?
   - A. There were no people that I saw when I stood on the top
   of the fencing coming through that tunnel.

Q. You are sure about that? - A. I am quite sure.   It was clear.

Q. Because you see what may be thought, and I would like you
   finally to deal with this, is that if you are going to get
   people out the back, if your view is that the only way to
   alleviate the problem is to get people to go out out of the
   back, you must send someone round there to try to help to
   achieve that.  Is that correct? - A. Yes.




                               /Q. Because merely standing.

                                                           R. L. GREENWOOD



         Q. Because merely standing and doing that, particularly when
            the people are concentrating on the game, as they were, is
            not likely to do a great deal of good, is it? - A. That
            was the option I took.  It would have taken time for
            Officers to go round there.  I saw that as being the
            appropriate option and, if they had moved back, then that
            situation could have been retrieved.

         Q. All I am suggesting is merely standing on the front, when
            you say people are concentrating on the game towards the
            back of the pens, is, frankly, not likely to do much good,
            is it? Maybe this is hindsight, but looking back on it,
            and looking back on it, I hope, objectively....? - A. They
            did not continue to watch the game once I was doing that.
            I do not want to convey that impression.

         Q. You are saying they all began to look at you, are you? -
            A. Well, I am not saying they all were, but I am not going
            to convey the impression, and I do not wish to convey the
            impression, that they all continued to watch the match
            because that is far from the truth.

         Q. But one of the problems would appear to be that those at
            the back are not actually aware of what was happening
            round the front? - A. That is very true.  That is why I
            was using the fingers to point to the front, yes.

         Q.    But you did not think of taking the step of ensuring that
              Police Officers went round the back into the tunnel to
              hoik people out the back? - A. Not before I took that
              action, and the reason for it was because I doubt if it
              would have had any effect at all.

         Q. Well, that is as may be? - A. Yes.

         Q.    But are you telling us you did not think of doing it or
              you did think of doing it, but decided against it? - A. I
              cannot tell you the answer to that.   All I can tell you is
              that, certainly at one stage, I did not give a direct
              order, but I did, and was in possession of the
              information, have ensured that Officers were going round
              the back, but that was after the first option that I
              took.

         Q. As has been indicated, we know that Officers did go round
            the back? - A. Yes.

         Q.   But no senior Officer appears to have given an order to
              that effect? - A. I did not do that.  I do not think it
              would have had any effect.

                   HR. COLLINS:   I have no more questions, sir.

                              By LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:
                            98

                                                   R. L. GREENWOOD




Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Could I trouble you to look at
     Composite Album 2 again, please?  I think you probably
     have got it open there, have you? - A. Yes, I have, my
     Lord.

Q. I am concerned about your evidence that two-thirds of the
   people, when you got on the hoarding there, were still
   watching the match.  Can we just look at two photographs -
   PR17A, and we are told this is, I think, two minutes past
   three.  Do you follow? - A. Yes, PR17A, my Lord.  I have
   got that.

Q. I do not know whether that is you with the flat cap on
   down below, is it? - A. I think it is, yes.

Q. That is probably before you got on to the hoarding.   I do
   not know.  It is only two minutes past three, so there is
   not much of the match then? - A. Yes, I think that....

Q. If you look at that photograph, I think I am right in
   saying that it shows, on the left-hand side, pen 2? - A.
   Yes.

Q. With the gate at the back dividing it from pen 3? - A.
   Yes.

Q. And you can see somebody further down climbing over? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Now, I quite see that the faces you see in pen 2 are
   mostly looking towards the match, are not they? - A. Yes.

Q.   There are one or two right at the front behind the fence
     who are looking with interest to the side, but most of
     them, I agree, are looking at the match? - A. Yes.

Q. But if you look across to the right, and even more if you
   look at the next photograph, which I think shows pen 3
   better, it is different, is not it? There are quite a lot
   of people there who are turned round the wrong way, with
   the back of their heads towards the pitch.   In the middle,
   for example? -A. Yes, I see some there.    Yes.

Q.   There is a man in red just to the left of   centre looking
     towards the stand? - A. Yes.

Q. There are people towards the back of the left there
   looking to the side or upwards or anywhere but at the
   match - in white, towards the black fence on the left
   there.  Do you see a chap with sunglasses and a chap
   beside him looking to the left, as we look? - A. I have
   lost that one.   I am sorry.

                                                             R. L. GREENWOOD



      Q. Never mind that particular one, but, I mean, it is a very
         different picture from pen 2, is not it, even when you go
         back from the impacted front part? - A. Yes, there are
         people that are facing towards the back.   I did not see
         them.  I have seen these photographs before.   They are
         taken from a different angle than I looked at and it does
         not persuade me any different, in terms of the gaps
         between the people in the crowd, from when I looked over
         that fence.  This photograph is taken from an angle which
         is looking down on people.

      Q. And the only other thing - I am looking further forward in
         the bundle.  Photograph DB1631.  Again, I appreciate
         photographs can be misleading, but I am just wondering,
         standing on the hoardings, how much of that tunnel you
         could actually see with people crowded up to it? - A. From
         the level that I was looking at,a clear   impression that
         the tunnel - I am not saying in front of the tunnel, but
         there was not a horde of people coming into that tunnel at
         all.  It was a stagnant situation and the tunnel appeared
         to be clear to me, my Lord.

                HR. KALLIPETIS:   I am sorry, sir, may I just ask one
           question in relation to photograph PR19A?

                LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Yes.

                HR. KALLIPETIS:   There is an Officer in a flat cap
           down the front, slightly right of centre.  I wondered
           whether this witness could identify who that is.

                LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      With his hand forward?

                HR. KALLIPETIS:    Yes.

      Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Have you got that picture? -
           A.Yes, I have, my Lord.  Yes.     That looks to be me.

      Q.       HR. KALLIPETIS:     Indeed.       That is 1502? - A. I do
           not know the time on this one.        I cannot read that.

                HR. KALLIPETIS:    Sir, may      I pursue this for a
           moment?

                LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       Yes, please do.

                  Further cross-examined by HR. KALLIPETIS:

      Q.        HR. KALLIPETIS:   Mr. Greenwood, would you take it
           from me that it is 1502 and we are told by your solicitors
           that it is 1502? - A. Yes, I will accept that.

      Q. And if that is you, may I ask what you are doing with your
         arm stretched outright because it looks to me as if you

             are trying to push people back away from the pitch? - A.
             No, that is not the case at all.  I do not know where the
             photograph is taken.  If it is at 1502, I think it may
             well be on my first arrival there, when I am surveying the
             scene, and that is not the case at all, that I was
             pushing people back in any way, shape or fori,  It may
             well be a movement to try and get through to have a look.

        Q. If you are assessing the scene, Hr. Greenwood, would you
           look just behind you to your left-hand side?  Is there not
           a face of some person crushed up against the fence just
           above the head of the man in the red jacket facing the
           camera? - A.  Yes.  Yes, it looks so. Yes.

        Q.    Anybody seeing that would realise what the position was,
             would not they, Hr. Greenwood? - A. Not the extent of the
             position, sir, no.   One has to make an assessment in the
             p en.

        Q. What would be your assessment of that face crushed up
           against the fence there? - A. Clearly that there is some
           pressure in that particular area.

        Q. Hr. Greenwood, is not it somebody being crushed up against
           that fence? - A. Yes.  Yes, it would appear so.

        Q.    Hr. Greenwood, I was going to ask    you when I asked you
             questions earlier whether you had given an instruction for
             Officers to go round to the back to clear the tunnel.   I
             understand from what Hr. Collins has said that there is
             evidence that no instruction was given from a senior
             Officer, but in your evidence a moment ago you appeared to
             be suggesting that you did give an instruction? - A.   No,
             that is not true.   If I recall correctly, what I said was
             I do not recall giving a direct command, but I do recall
             ensuring that Officers were going round there.

        Q. What is the difference? - A. Well, the difference is
           somebody else may have knowledge that Officers have gone
           round there and, when I asked the question as to whether
           that has been done, then that information is passed to me
           and that I am told by other people yes,   that has already
           been done, similar to the ambulance situation that I
           mentioned earlier.

        Q. You see, the relevance of it, which was of assistance to
           this Inquiry, is that it appeared to me   from an
           examination of the evidence that a call   went out from
           Control that there was pitch invasion and that caused all
           the Officers at the rear end of Leppings Lane terrace to
           run round, come on to the pitch underneath the Control
           Box, and it was purely by chance that the serial that was
           under the North Stand ran past the entrance to the tunnel
           and realised that people were injured and that is why they

                                                    R. L. GREENWOOD



     went in there? - A. I cannot comment on that.   I know that
     other serials went round there.   I did not know that
     particular serial were there.   There were others that were
     there.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Now, Hr. Kallipetis,    I thought
     you wanted to ask one matter.

          HR. KALLIPETIS:    I am sorry, sir.    As always, one
     leads to another.   I am sorry.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Perhaps not to any more.
     Thank you.

          HR. COLLINS:   Now, sir, I would like to call Chief
     Superintendent Nesbit next, on the understanding that he
     cannot be here after the end of today.  I shall be five
     minutes with him in chief because, from now on, I do not
     propose to ask every Officer to go through everything.   I
     shall simply concentrate on those bits that are perhaps
     extra and can help the Inquiry because we have now called
     all the Officers who were, as it were, operational
     contro1.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Well, if you are literally
     going to be five minutes,    I imagine we can finish him
     today.

          MR. COLLINS:   Well,    I shall be about five minutes.

         CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT JOHN ARTHUR NESBIT Called

                    Examined by HR. COLLINS:

Q.        HR. COLLINS:   Superintendent, your full names? - A.
     John Arthur Nesbit.

Q. And you are the Divisional Commander for Operations and
   Traffic.  Is that correct? - A. I am, sir.

Q. And you were, as it were, OC the Traffic side of the
   operation order? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Now, I think - and I can take this very, very broadly and
   briefly - the Traffic side, there were no problems.  Is
   that correct? - A. None whatsoever, sir.

Q. And I think you got to the ground shortly after three
   o ’clock and went in through the entrance that leads to the
   back of the North Stand at the Kop end? - A. Yes.

Q. And as you approached the gymnasium, were you informed by
   Inspector Sewell  that the game had been stopped and that
   there were problems at the Leppings Lane terracing,
                                                J. A. NESBIT




specifically that there was an evacuation going on and a
number of people were believed to have been injured? - A.
Yes, sir.

I think you went out to the Leppings Lane end? - A. Yes,
sir.

Via the pitch, by which time there were a number of people
on the pitch? - A. Yes, sir.

I think an ambulance was just in the process of arriving,
was it? - A. No, sir, the ambulance arrived just shortly
after I got there.

Just after your arrival.   I am trying to recollect from
the video because the two were roughly contemporaneous? -
A.  Almost at the same time.

I think it was - and again I am speaking from memory -
approximately 17 to 18 minutes past three? - A. I think I
probably arrived a shade before that, sir.  It would
probably be round about 10 or 12 minutes past.

In any event, when you got to the end, you were aware, no
doubt, of that horrifying pile of bodies that we have all
seen on the video? - A. Yes, sir.

How would you describe what was going on on the pitch and
at the terraces when you arrived? - A. When I arrived, I
walked across the front of the goal and went to compound
3, the entrance to compound 3.   Around the perimeter of
the pitch there were a number of casualties.   There were
Police Officers, members of the St. John ’s Ambulance
Brigade and, indeed, spectators giving first aid to
obviously injured people.   As I arrived at the entrance to
compound 3, I noticed that the gate was being obstructed
by two bodies.   The lower one was lying face downwards and
sort of from waist upwards was lying on to the perimeter
track.  There were a number of Officers standing alongside
that and it is fair to say - and I have missed a bit out,
sir - as I walked there I could see Officers on the
perimeter fencing and spectators and they were lifting
people both out of compound 3 and out of compound 4, which
is to the right.

Indeed? - A. I told two Officers who were at the gate to
remove the obstruction and I then walked to my right and
behind the goal to the entrance to compound 4.  At that
time I saw Inspector Dews from D Division and Inspector
White from F Division.  It is fair to say that evacuation
of compound 4 was in progress and the gates were clear.
They were open, and people were being escorted and led out
of that compound on to the pitch.  Some were obviously
                      103

                                                  J. A. NESBIT



distressed.  I looked into compound 4, having seen in
compound 3 what I could see was a number of bodies, and I
could not see any bodies in compound 4, but I could see a
number of people up against the perimeter fencing in
distress, but certainly I could see no one who appeared to
be dead.




                                  /Q. Of course
                                      J.A. NESBIT



Q. Of course unfortunately Pen 3 was different, but what I would
   really like you to deal with is this:   it is clear from the
   video, certainly in Pen 3, that you took charge and formed
   a line of Officers out of that gate because things were not
   going perfectly in getting that pen evacuated? - A. That is
   true, sir. When I returned to Pen 3, the entrance, I could
   see that Officers again in their endeavours to relieve the
   problem there, were really getting in each other's way and
   not achieving anything.   Some spectators, and I am not
   criticising them for that, they obviously wanted to help as
   well, but with the narrowness of the gate which only basically
   allows one person to stand there, that little or nothing was
   being achieved, so I had to pull them out of the way.
   Eventually I told the Officers to form a chain and then to
   get the body out.   Now together with another Officer, I don't
   know who it was, we eventually got this powerfully built man
   who was lying face downwards, we pulled him out physically
   and then we started to evacuate that Compound 3.

Q. What impression did you get when you arrived of the state
   of organisation so far as the Police effort was concerned
   in and around the pens? - A. Well sir I think that the Police
   Officers were doing their best and working ....

Q. Indeed, but were they working in an organised way or was it
   every individual trying to help as best he could? - A. I
   got the impression, sir, that Officers were acting individually
   and on their own initiative by standing on the boardings or
   hoardings around the perimeter track and helping and lifting
   people out of 3 and out of 4.  I think it is fair to say,
   and I believe this quite genuinely, that by the actions
   that Officers were taking I think they did prevent a further
   loss of life by the actions that they were taking. Spectators
   as well I might add.

Q. I don't think anyone would doubt that and that individual
   Officers and spectators were doing all they could, but the
   point I am getting to, and I think you have dealt with this,
   is that they seemed to be doing it individually and there
   was a lack of co-ordination and direction from above.   Is
   that a fair way of putting it or not? - A. What I could
   not discount at that time, sir, is that they were acting
   probably before I got there on the instructions of someone
   who had given them the directive to stand on the ---

Q. Anything may have happened but I am concerned with your
   reaction when you arrived, and from what you have told us
   is it fair to say that your reaction on your arrival was
   that there appeared to be a lack of direction and organisation.
    - A. Yes sir.
 Q. And you stepped into the breach and started to organise
    and direct? - A. Yes sir.

 Q. I think you saw Mr. Greenwood with a loud hailer.   Is that

                                            J. A. NESBIT


         correct? - A. Yes, having relieved the obstruction in
         Compound 3 I moved to the left along Compound 3 to Compound 2
         and I noticed and became aware of it that there was obviously
         plenty of room in Compound 2 and the Officers in there were
         assisting people over the fencing.  From previous knowledge
         I knew that there was a gate between Compounds 2 and 3 on
         the lateral fencing which allowed access to either and I
         said to a number of Officers who were on the perimeter track
         to go through Compound 2, to go in Compound 3 and to start
         to relieve the pressure and get people out from the back
         through that gate.

    Q. And what about the tunnel.  Did you know whether or not there
       was organisation to get people out through that tunnel? -
       A. Well I didn't because one of the problems I had sir was
       not being part of the Operational Order for the match.  I
       did not have a radio.  I had no communication with anybody
       inside the ground.

    Q. But is that something that occurred to you as being a
       necessity? - A. I believe sir and from the recollection, I
       know I have seen the photographs, but I do remember when I
       arrived that there were Officers at the back of Compound 3
       when I arrived.

    Q.   I think that is right, I think there   were? - A. They   had
         not been sent there on my direction.

    Q.   But did you give any directions about going round the tunnel
         or did you not think that was needed in the light of what
         you saw of Officers at the back? - A. Well because I had
         seen Officers at the back when I arrived sir, I assumed
         that part of their brief or part of their instruction would
         have been for that very purpose, to relieve the pressure
         because that was the problem.

    Q. In fact it was an obvious move? - A. Yes sir.

    Q. I think also you were aware, and again I am not going to
       ask you to go into a lot of detail about this, but you
       were aware then and at a later stage of considerable hostility
       towards the Police in general by some of the spectators who
       had been on the terraces? - A. Yes, the fans who were still
       remaining in Compound 2 having I believe seen the injuries
       and the obvious fatalities, were directing abusive threats
       and shouting and generally derogatory remarks towards Police
       Officers on the perimeter track and from the West Stand as
       well, such things as "Murderers, f-ing Murderers" and that
       sort of thing.

    Q. Indeed, because they believed it was the P o l i c e d fault that
       this had happened? - A. That is correct.

    Q. The only other thing I would like to ask you about is this:
       I think you had yourself in the past had some experience
       of the effect of a barrier, in that case a wall, collapsing
                            106

                                         J.A. NESBIT


   with a large crowd on a terrace.  Is that correct? - A. Yes,
   it was at another ground in South Yorkshire at Millmoor
   Football Ground and it was a local derby involving Rotherham
   and one of the Sheffield Clubs, and I cannot remember ....

Q. Well it does not matter the details? - A. There at Millmoor
   they have a boundary wall which is about waist high, probably
   about 3'/3'3".

Q. So about the same sort of size as the barrier that collapsed
   in Pen 3? - A. But the only difference of the two grounds
   or the feature of the ground is that the boundary wall at
   Millmoor Football Ground is at direct level with the playing
   surface as opposed to the well or sump that they have on
   the terracing at the Wednesday Ground.  On that particular
   night, it was an evening match, the wall broke and a number
   of spectators were catapulted off the terracing on to the
   playing area and on to the perimeter track.  There was a lull
   and then people at the back seemed to want to know what had
   happened because there was obviously activity in that goal,
   when all of a sudden the people who had been standing probably
   3, 4, 5, 6 rows back came forward with nothing to hold them
   and they came over the top of the spectators who had already
   fallen through the gap in the wall.

Q. The impression you got from the pile of bodies that you saw
   having fallen down and others on top, is that oonsistent
   with your experience from the incident that you have just
   been referring to? - A. Well the only conclusion I could
   draw from that, sir, was that in the case of the Millmoor
   Ground because there was no obstruction that bodies were
   more evenly spread, I think.  In my opinion what has probably
   happened at Hillsborough was that again because of the crush
   barrier breaking, the people being surged forward, they were
   hitting an immoveable object, the perimeter fence, plus the
   well and I think people fell into the well, people were
   catapulted probably over the top, hit the fencing and came
   down unfortunately on top of the people who were at the front.

Q. So you had the combination of the breaking of the barrier
   and the well or sump and the perimeter fence all added
   together to make a fatal situation? - A. Yes sir.

         MR. COLLINS:   Thank you.

         MR. HYTNER: Mr. Nesbit, on behalf of the bereaved
   and the injured, may I take the opportunity of thanking you
   for bringing leadership and organisation to the rescue of
   those in Pens 3 and 4.

         THE WITNESS:   Thank you sir.


                 Cross-Examined by MR. WOODWARD:

Q. Mr. Nesbit, you arrived at the ground at about 3 o'clock?
   - A. Shortly after 3 sir.

                                        J.A. NESBIT



Q. So it had happened by the time you came upon the scene? -
   A. Yes sir.

Q.   You made your way to the terrace end? - A. Yes sir.

Q.   By the time you got there Police Officers were already
     engaged in sorting matters out? - A. Yes sir, that is true.

Q.   No doubt about it? - A. None whatsoever.

Q.   And there were in fact Police Officers, as you have said,
     stood on the low wall reaching up .... A. On the advertising
     boardings and reaching over on to the fence.

Q. Were they endeavouring to assist people to come up and to
   get them down out of the area of the press? - A. Yes, they
   were sir.

Q. If you had been put in charge and had to organise something
   is that the sortof thing you might have organised? - A.
   Yes sir.  I think with the limited access that one has to
   the Compounds 3 and 4 with the fencing that prevents any
   lateral movement and the narrowness of the gates which give
   access, the only way an evacuation can take place in my
   opinion is the way that the Police Officers were doing it
   by assisting and lifting people over the fence.

Q. It is the obvious thing to do whether of an individual's
   own initiative or as a direction by a senior Officer?
   - A. That is true, sir.

Q. It had a purpose and it was helpful? - A. It was successful,
   yes sir.

Q. Is it right that you observed that there were Officers in
   the terrace? - A. Yes, they were.

Q. However they had come to be there is that something you
   would have sought had you been put in charge to organise
   it you would have wanted to do? - A. I would have done
   exactly the same sir, yes.

Q. That was already happening by the time you came there? -
   A. Yes sir.

Q. Of course in the situation that confronted you there was
   distress, there was anguish and there were problems? - A.
   That is true sir, yes.

Q. There were fans who wanted to help? - A. Genuinely, yes.

Q. And there were people who may have made mistakes and got
   in the way of each other? - A. Yes sir.

Q. Is that something that could for certain have been avoided
   by organisation or not? - A. Well I think it is very very
                                        J.A. NESBIT


     difficult when you have so many willing hands who really
     wanted to help, but because of the confinement and the
     narrowness of the gates and the limited access to the
     compound I think by having too many people attempting to
     do too much too quickly they were achieving nothing.

Q. So if anything your criticism really is that too many people
   were doing too much? - A. Yes.

Q. Rather than of hanging about and not endeavouring to assist?
   - A. I think it is true sir.  I think if there had been more
   Police Officers available at the Leppings Lane end they
   really could not have done any more because of the sort of
   immoveable fencing and the very limited access to the areas
   where the tragedy had taken place in 3 and I believe some
   people say that there were fatalities in 4.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Would you subscribeto the view
     that if you had had some effective wire cutting material,
     machinery, it would not have been any use? -A. No I don't
     say that, my   Lord.  I think ifwe had extra gates or the
     gates had been bigger, I think there would have been more
     facilities for lateral movement on the terracing. I think
     Police Officers could probably have got in to move people
     laterally as   opposed to trying to move them back, I think
     if we had got the fencing down quicker I am sure it would
     have been better.

Q.         MR. WOODWARD:  It would have made the task a lot
     easier? - A. That is the word I am looking for.

q   . Of course with hindsight one can say "If only" or "If it
      happened again this is what we would do", but as you came
      upon the scene there what you seem to be saying is Officers
      were at it, they were working, and the sort of things that
      they were doing were the sort of things if you had come
      on earlier you would have organised them to do? ~ A.
      Probably so, yes, I would.


                        BV LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:

Q. I would just like you to help me a little further if you
   can about the sort of incident you mentioned at Rotherham.
   Do I understand you correctly that there the pitch level
   goes right up to the bottom of the terrace? - A. .Almost
   level.  I think there might just be a little sort of 2 or 3"
   step but it is almost at the same level, the boundary wall.

Q. The wall there came down? - A. Yes, my Lord.

Q. And you got people falling over on top of each other, is
   that right? - A. Yes.

Q. It may be an impossible choice, but if you are going to have
   fences that open very readily, is it your view that it is
^                                109

                                              J.A. NESBIT


         better the terrace should have a sump lower than the pitch
         level, or that you should have what you had at Rotherham?
         - A. I believe, my Lord, if the level of the terracing had
         been at the same level as the bottom of the fencing, I
         think people's perception of what was taking place would
         have been that much more apparent, because when I arrived
         at Leppings Lane it was not until you got within feet of
         the perimeter fencing that you were aware of the problem
         that was taking place in the well below the pitch level.
         I think if the perimeter fencing had been at the same level
         then (a) we would not have had people falling, we would
         have people pushed against the fencing but we would not
         have had them underneath the wall and against the fencing
         as we did on this occasion.  Does that explain it?

    Q.   Of course the fencing would  be so to speak transparent all
         the way down so you would have been able to see everything
         that was happening down to ground level? - A. Yes.

    Q.   So from the point of view of recognising what had happened
         from the pitch side, better to have it all on a level?
         - A. Absolutely.

    Q. But from the point of view of minimising injury from people
       all tumbling on top of each other if you open the gates or
       the gates are self-opening under pressure, what then? -
       A. Well it is a very difficult question to answer, my Lord.
       All I can say again is I can relate to the situation that
       they haye at Millmoor where I policed for a number of years,
       I have policed at Hillsborough and Bramall Lane, is that
       again when it was decided to erect the perimeter fencing
       at Millmoor, and it is only at the one end which is the
       visitors end, is that the access on to the terracing the
       gates are that much wider than they are at Hillsborough.

                                               G. McKAY


   - A. When I first arrived my attention was drawn mainly to the
   people who were waiting to get into turnstiles A-G, and I can
   only really comment on that section and the area of the crowd
   and the crowd up to the gates, because everything beyond that
   was beyond my sight.  It was really packed tight in there to
   the extent where the turnstiles did not seem to be operating
   properly.  The turnstiles are geared to accept one person at
   a time, and when people are pressed up at the turnstiles in
   such numbers it appeared that the people wishing to use the
   turnstiles did not have freedom to get in properly.

Q. But how would you describe the attitude of the crowd itself,
   of the people waiting? - A. The people who were in that area
   were wanting to get in quite urgently.  It was obviously quite
   uncomfortable in there.  They had got tickets, they were
   entitled to get in and one can understand their frustration at
   not being able to get freely through the turnstiles.   As the
   minutes went by the crowd swelled considerably in numbers.
   The Officers on horseback were having difficulty controlling
   the crowds.  There was one Officer who I believe was a
   Merseyside Officer, at one stage a can of drink with drink
   spilling from it was thrown at him.  There appeared to be
   a deliberate attempt by some members of the crowd to
   unseat that rider.  That was my perception of it, and the
   horse started prancing about in fright.  They were
   engulfed in the crowd. As a result you could not see
   people and Police Officers properly.

        At some stage, perhaps around 20-to-3, I saw
   Superintendent Marshall, and I heard part of a conversation
   between him and a man I know as Inspector Purdy, when
   Inspector Purdy suggested that the gates ought to be opened.
   I did not hear Mr. Marshall's response to it.  I don't think
   at that stage he was prepared to take that option.  Mr.
   Marshall went into the crowd and was lost to my sight.  I did
   not see Mr. Marshall again, but I was later to learn that he
   was in fact only yards from me all the time.  When a person
   went into the crowd on foot he was engulfed and soon lost to
   sight.

Q. Did the mood of the crowd change at all as the minutes wore on
   towards kick-off? - A. Yes, it did.  Quite obviously they
   wanted to get in.  I would have thought most of the crowd
   would have been prepared to wait patiently and take their turn
   in the turnstiles, but there were other members of the crowd
   who wanted to get in more urgently.  There were some members
   of the crowd who wanted to get in quite desperately, and there
   were other members of the crowd who were going to get into
   that ground come what may.  Terrific pressure built up from
   the Leppings Lane area.  Those wrought iron perimeter gates
   were closed at one stage in an attempt to relieve this
   pressure, this continual pressure on the crowd in this little
   penned in area behind the barrier leading towards the
   turnstiles.  It did not appear to work, and it seemed only a
   couple of minutes or so before those gates were burst open,
   before even the turnstiles had time to produce some space for
   the people this side of them.

                                                       G. MCKAY



                At one stage a young boy climbed out of the crowd on top
           of the wall, presumably with a view to going straight over the
           top.  He was about 12 years old, and I was dismayed at that
           stage to realise there were such small kids in that crowd.   It
           was apparent that the pressure, the crush in there was quite
           severe, and at-some stage, not lon& after Mr. Purdy had spoken
           to Mr. Marshall I spoke to Mr. Purdy and said that I agree
           with him that the gates really ought to be opened.

        Q. Indeed, shortly after that they were opened.   I say shortly
           after that.   We know when they were opened. - A. There were
           other events.   Other Officers arrived on horseback up the
           service road.

        Q. I don't think I need ask you to give details of    those because
           the picture has been painted by others and I am    only concerned
           with your overall impression of the situation.     Can I now come
           on to after the disaster occurred.   I think you   went into the
           ground, did you not, after the match had begun?    - A. I did.   I
           made my way again....

        Q. You went round to the gymnasium? - A. The back of the goal.
           As I cross the back of the goal at the Leppings Lane end I
           could see what appeared from that distance to be crowd
           spilling on to the track.  There were Police Officers making
           their way underground in front of the West Stand ;up to that
           area.

        Q. I am sorry "passed the goal". Did you go past the Leppings
           Lane goal or the other end? - A. No, the Spion Kop.  I did not
           give it a great deal of thought.

        Q. The only bit I want to ask you about is this.  I think you
           spoke to your Chief Superintendent Addis at about quarter-
           past-3 when it was realised there were likely to be deaths? -
           A. Yes.

        Q. Because you had to think in terms of setting up an incident
           room and a casualty bureau? - A. Yes.

        Q. I am not going to ask you details of time scales because I
           imagine that is not easy now, but in fact were you responsible
           for setting up the gymnasium as it were a temporary mortuary?
           - A. In the initial stages?

        Q. In the initial stages, yes. - A. I arrived back in the
           gymnasium as Chief Inspector Beal arrived back.  I had spoken
           to a Detective Sergeant earlier who had come from the back of
           Leppings Lane corner, and he said there were about 20 dead in
           the crowd.  I had been desperately hoping he was wrong.

        Q. Forgive me, I don't think we need the reasons why.  It is just
           the factual matters as to setting up the mortuary, if you
           would? - A. My arrival there coincided with that of Chief
           Inspector Beal, and he shouted, "Clear the tables out of the
           way.  We are going to make this into a temporary mortuary".

                                                    G. MCKAY


     That part of the gymnasium had been used as a dining area, and
     the tables were immediately moved out of the way.  As that was
     happening the first bodies started arriving.

Q. And were there dead and injured arriving in that gymnasium
   thereafter? - A. That is true.

Q. And grieving or distressed relatives or friends looking for
   their friends or relatives? - A. That is right.

Q. So it seems a certain amount of confusion built up in the
   initial stages.  Is that right? - A. That is right.

Q. What was done to try to overcome that? - A. Detective
   Inspector Charles was on duty at the match, and he was on duty
   in uniform.   I had a disadvantage being in civilian clothes.
   I spoke to Mr. Charles.    He I believe had just come in with a
   body.   I told him the public order situation within the
   gymnasium had to be controlled, and he grabbed some men and
   set about doing    just that.  From that stage on the people who
   were allowed in    were monitored.  Of course, by that time there
   were quite a number of people already in, grieving relatives,
   some people who were the worse for drink who had carried in
   bodies, doing their civic duty and were no trouble at all
   apart from the fact they were clearly intoxicated.     Other
   people who were extremely distressed who were perhaps
   relatives who could not understand the reasons for this
   carnage.   There were fights breaking out in and amongst and
   over the bodies.

Q. Are you able to    tell us what sort of time this state of chaos
   lasted? - A. No,    not really.   I have to say that after that my
   perception of time and the sequence of events becomes
   confused.  I can remember most of what happened, but there are
   certain parts - for instance, at one stage I went over to the
   control room.   I could not use a radio to tell them the state
   of play because of the amount of press that were around.     I am
   assured when I went over I was accompanied by Detective
   Inspector Towell, but I c a n ’t remember him being there.

Q. Did you have any problems with the press specifically in
   relation to the gymnasium and the mortuary? - A. I had none
   myself.

Q. You mentioned the press, and you say with the press about you
   could not radio.  I d o n ’t quite follow why not? - A. If you
   are going to give information to the press it wants to be
   accurate and needs to be factual.     If I am going to give
   information to a senior Officer I need to tell him exactly
   what has happened and what I think has happened.     That would
   not necessarily be the same information that I would
   subsequently want to give to the press.

Q. Does it boil down to this from what you have told us....

Q.          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     I am sorry I want to clarify that
     bit.    Because you would not want to give the press anything

                                                             G. MCKAY


                 you had not been able to verify or what? - A. That is right.
                 I would not want, for instance, to say there are so many
                 numbers of bodies or what have you, and for this to become
                 immediately available to the press and for it to turn out to
                 be misinformation or whatever.  If I am going to speak senior
                 Officers I want it to be in confidence until such times as we
                 decide exactly what we are going to tell the press.

            Q.        MR. COLLINS:   Would this be fair then from what you have
                 told us, that any people who were in that gymnasium in the
                 first half-hour or so after it was set up might well feel
                 there was a semblance of chaos and might well have been
                 distressed over and above their natural distress at perhaps
                 of losing a friend? - A. Oh, yes..

            Q. As a result of the situation.   It does not sound as if the
               situation was by any means ideal? - A. No.     In fact, it turned
               out to be in terms of efficiency I d o n ’t think we could have
               improved upon it.   But I don't know of any other way it could
               have been done or accomplished.   It was a scene that could not
               be planned for.   I have been a Police Officer now in this
               country and in Australia for nearly 30 years, and in common
               with Police Officers with this length of service I have seen
               my share of bizarre death and violent death.     In fact, that is
               mainly, I suppose, what I do for a living.     Nothing I have
               ever seen in my service prepared me for that.

                      I heard earlier today, this gentleman was talking about
                 shock.  I know how that scene affected me in spite o f ....

            Q. If I may say so, it has been obvious from the you have been
               giving your evidence a few moments ago. - A. I heard Mr.
               Greenwood say that he did not think that any of the Police
               Officers were in shock.   I would have been very surprised if
               they had not been.   I saw one particular Officer sitting in
               the Police room when I went in there to use the ’phone.   He
               was dishevelled.   He was obviously very hot.  He must have
               been working very hard.   He had got a huge tear in his
               trousers and he was sat there weeping.   Yes, I would be
               surprised if Police Officers had not been stunned by the
               enormity of what had happened.   It was a colossal afront to
               your sensibility.

            Q. I think in fairness to you as well you had an added thing on
               your mind which was that your young son was somewhere among
               the crowd at the ground.   Is that right? You had obvious
               concern.  I am glad to say he was not caught up in it, was he?
               - A. He was OK.  In fact, he took two distressed Liverpool
               fans to my home and they stayed with us overnight.

            Q. I think it was about the time Mr. Dalglish made his
               announcement that you handed over to Chief Superintendent
               Addis? - A. That is true, sir.

            Q. We can time that.  We know that announcement was made at 3.56.
               So it was just over half-an-hour, 40 minutes or so, after you
               had first started to set up the mortuary? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. I think later on things calmed down, in the sense that you
   were able, between you, to achieve a much greater order in
   the gymnasium.  Bodies were properly certified and laid
   out and proper identification was able to be achieved? -
   A.  Yes.

       HE. COLLINS:   I think that is all I need ask you in
  relation to your evidence about this matter.   Thank you
  very much.

       HE. HYTNEE:        I have only two questions of this
  Officer.

       LOED JUSTICE TAYLOE:   Can I just see - again not any
  pressure at all - but is there more than a question or two
  for this witness?  If there is, we will deal with it
  tomorrow.

          HE. WOODWAED:      There may be more than a question or
   two.

        LOED JUSTICE TAYLOE:    Yes, I think probably we had
   better - are you in difficulties tomorrow?

          HE. HYTNEE:     Oh, no.

       LOED JUSTICE T A Y L O E : Well then,   I think we will
  have cross-examination tomorrow.

       Tomorrow morning, as I said yesterday, there is
  available the facility of looking at the Control Box at
  the ground.  I do not know whether Counsel will avail
  themselves of that, but if they are, then I think it is
  available from half-past eight onwards.   I would propose
  that we sit tomorrow - or, put it this way, the Inquiry
  will be ready to sit at 10 o ’clock.  If the traffic causes
  those who have been there to be a minute or two later
  after that, obviously we will make allowances, but we will
  aim to sit as soon after 10 as we can.

       So far as any other timings tomorrow are concerned, I
  am going to see what the effect of the Hilk Cup tomorrow
  is likely to be and I do not at the moment know precisely
  what we are going to do about the latter part of
  tomorrow’s sitting, but I will decide that in a few
  minutes.

        HE. HYTNEE:   I wonder if I might make a plea for
   those who need to get away from Sheffield by car and, if
   there are going to be any road blocks, we are given an
   opportunity to get away.

        LOED JUSTICE TAYLOE:    You do not wish to be a
   prisoner on the wrong side of the Pennines!
                                                                 «

     HE. HYTNEE:   For once, it is not the other side of
the Pennines I am going to, sir.

     LOED JUSTICE TAYLOE:    Hell, it is a factor
obviously we will take into account.

      (The Inquiry was adjourned until 10.00 a.m.
                the following morning)

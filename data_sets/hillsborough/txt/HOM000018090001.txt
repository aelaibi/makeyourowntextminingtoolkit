     Dear Sir,
                                         Hillsborough Football Ground Disaster
     On behalf of the Robertson Group, we would all like to express
     our deep sorrow and regret concerning the accident at
     Hillsborough on Saturday.     We have some appreciation of the
     impact of this disaster, not only for the victims, their families
     and loved ones but also on all those involved. We would like £o
     help. We were the Consultants to Mr Desmond Fennell, OBE, QC,
     in the Kings Cross Underground Fire Investigation.     Currently,
     we are the Consultants to Lord Cullen in the Piper Alpha Platform
     Disaster.    We have been assisting British Rail with their
     preparation for the Clapham Junction Accident Inquiry and we have
     also been helping them in the reorganisation of their management
     of safety.
     Should any of our experience and services be of use to your
     Department, please feel free to contact us at any time.
    Again, let me express our deepest regrets for those who have
    suffered in this accident.

     Yours faithfully,




     DE Shillito
     Director

in pairs.          Before      the    event         one    of the        constables a t t a c h e d     to     the

serial       was    excused          duty at the           event and was           not replaced.

After     parading        for        duty at D o n caster           we were           conveyed     to H i l l s b o r o u g h

by bus.       On arrival             we went direc t l y to the North stand for a                              briefing

at    10.00am.



Immedi a t e l y after          the       briefing        I c o l lected        one     personal     radio       from the

gymnasium,          and a packed meal                for     the members           of my serial.           After

consuming          the meal      we went          d i r ectly     to M i d d l e w o o d Road,       arriving

shor t l y after        1 1am.       As    the serial                     (& office r sho r I I pai red up

two    pairs       on each side            of the     road.       I was        the only officer            in Serial

22 with a radio and                  I therefore           had    no means         of    contacting        the    other

memb e r s    of the serial               other     than by a        personal           visit,    w hich      could

involve a walk           of some 250 •••- 300 yards.

The    Inspector        in charge           of my serial            was     Inspector Humphf-!                   nd he

but the m a j o r i t y        stated       that     they w o u l d       be    closing       before    the      end of

From    the    time we a r r i v e d         in M i d d l e w o o d R o a d      shor t l y after        11 am    it was

noticeable       that     there    were a l r e a d y dozens        of football          fans       in the

area™    They were        purchasing     food stuffs          from the          local    shops and

walking about         in the streets as          if wait i n g       for f r i e n d s . The         vast

majority       of fans were Liverpool            supporters,.            At    that    time     they were

quiet and well          behaved,     wit h no a n i m o s i t y     being       shown to the             few

o ppo s ing fa n s o r to t h e P o 1 ice.

After    patrolling        the    length of our       d e s i g n a t e d area,        it quic k l y became

apparen t      that   the suppo r t e r s were       in the main making                 their way along

M i d d l e w o o d Road towards     the top of L e p pings              Lane,       and then turning

right and walking           along    W a d s l s y Lane,    away from the              dir e c t i o n of the

football       ground,,    I therefore       spent muc h of          the       time at       the

j u n ctio n   of M i d d l e w o o d Road and Wads ley Lane,                 as this was          the    busiest

part    of the     road and       from this     point      1 still        had a good view along

part    of M i d d l e w o o d Road and the      shop      premises.

The    number    of football        s u pporters     i n creased         steadily as time                passed,

until    there was a steady           flow of fans making                 their way along w a d s l e y

Lane    away from the        ground.     Many were         drinking           beer    from    cans.      A number

a sked directions          to the    nearest     public      house,           and a few who          had

o b v i o u s l y been drinking      asked    for   the     location of toilets.                    1 was

unable    to    inform them of the w h e r e a b o u t s           of the       public       houses      as     i did

not know the area,           but was     later      informed        by Inspector H u m p h r i e s              that

the    nearest     public    house w h i c h was      o pen was along W a d s l e y Lane

approximately         1 1/S miles away.          That was          the    direction          in w h i c h      the

s u pporters were walking.            In my    conve r s a t i o n s     with the        supporters             it

became a p p arent        that    they did    not want       to go to the              ground       because

they would       not be able        to get a drink          there.       The     steady s t r e a m of

s u pporter walking         along w a d s l e y Lane       a way    from H i l l s b o r o u g h S t a d i u m

continue d      until a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2.30pm,     by w h i c h time          several       hund r e d

people    had wa l k e d    that way.     Eve n after        that        time    there were          still       a

few fans walking           that way.

The    noticeable            flow of        people       returning      down W a d s l e y Lane         towards      the

groups      to begin with but                  gr a d u a l l y   increasing.       Many of these            people

were     carrying        cans and           plastic; bottles           of b e e r , cider       etc. , A few had

bottles       of wine.         It was apparent               that    the m a j o r i t y of these           people       now

walking       towards         the    ground had           been drinking,          and a large           percentage

of them were           in fact        still       consuming alcohol              from    cans      etc,,. The

presence        of alcohol           was      very evident,          ca n s ana     bottles        b e 1 n g ca r r i e d

by fans,        litter       bins     full       of     empty      cans, and other        cans left

on walls,         pavements          etc.      The      mood      of the supporters        had changed and

they were        now very boisterous,                     singing     and     chanting      etc,      and they

appeared        excited        due    to the          closeness      of the; kick-off           time.       I could

sea along L a p p i n g s Lane and                    could see that          there was a large

crowd      in L a p p i n g s Lane          outside       the     entrance     to the      ground,       which

increased a p p r o a c h i n g 3pm,              There were         still     hundreds       of    people      Detw e e n

W a d s l e y Lane and        the     ground.

At about       3pm     I was        requested           by one      of the    officers       in my serial to

attend      on M i d d l e w o o d R oad as             a result      of a complaint         by a member            of

the    public      regarding              Liverpool        suppo r t e r s   urinating       in his ga r d e n       and

then a s s a u l t i n g     him.         On my arrival            the matter had been dealt w i t h                 the

s a t i s f a c t i o n of   the     complainant           by anot h e r      officer,      and     no further

act ion was        requi red by the               complainant,

j u n c t i o n with L e p pings           Lane,       I had heard on my            personal        radio     that

there was a problem w ith s upporters                              causing a        crush at the L e p pings

As we     reached the          j u n c t i o n with L a p p i n g s Lane          I could see          that      there

were    now only a few            people walking             or     running       towards        the ground,         and.

that    the     crowd outside          the     ground had gone,               It was obvious             from      the

noise     of the       crowd    inside       the     ground       that    the match had kicked off.

I saw that        some     officers       standing         outside         the     ground beckoning              to us

and other        officers       to join them.           It was         obvious at that              time    that

s o m ethi ng    was   ser i o u s l y wrong,        due     to the quick               disappearance         of    the

crowd of fans          from Leppi ngs Lane,                the      radio     traffic,         and the actions

of the     officers at          the    entrance.        I beckoned            to the       other memb e r s         of

serials 22 and 23,              who were        at    the top of L e p p i n g s Lane,                to make       their

way to the        ground.       On our arrival             1 saw other            officers,         including

mounted       officers,        attempting          to keep several               dozen fans away            from the

entrance        gates,    and we were           i mmediately           orde r e d       to assist      them.       Many

of the     fans were        now highly agited at                   not    being allo w e d          into    the

ground,       and made      several      attempts          to walk        past      the officers.



Once    the     immediate       area    outside        the    gates       had     been     cleared,        I went

inside     the    external       gates       to the access             road outside            the west       stand,.

Several       casualties        had been brought              from       inside         the ground and. were

now    laying     on the ground          on the access               road,       being a t t e n d e d     to.     It was

apparent        that at     least      one     person had died..              I then a s s i s t e d       in that

area    to f o rm a      ’ c h a 1 n “ w :i.t h o t h e r o f f j.c e r s b e j/& e ej/ t h e c a sualties           and

fans    emerging       from the stadium.              This was           ya   p rjg v         f u lyth e r i n j u ry t o

t he   casualties        a nd to keep t h e dead a n or i n j u red fro m j i h e view of                           the

s u p p o r t e r s . I then a s s i s t e d    inkeeping a route                 open to' a llow

ambulances        to enter       the access          road,        and e n c o u r a g i n g    emerging

supporters        to   co operate        widlth        instructions.

The mood        of the    spect a t o r s      had now       changed.         M a n y were       tota l l y s u b d u e d

            and    obviously     in shock.        Many    others were        s h o uting and swearing at a

            the Police        officers    in a. vindictive m a n n e r , blaming             the Police        for

            whatever       had occurred,         and    being   e x tremely abusive.         None    of the Pol

            o f f icer s   responded     in an adverse way despite                 the    verbal    abuse,     and

            were asking        people    to     calm down and         co-operate with        e v a c u a t i o n and

            rescue     procedures.

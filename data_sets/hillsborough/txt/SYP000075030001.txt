           I am a Police Constable,         number 78,        of the South Yorkshire Police,

           currently stationed at renistone Police Station,                  which is part of

           Barnsley Division.

           At 8.30 am (0830)       on Saturday 15th April            1989 (150489),      I paraded for

           duty at Penistone Police Station as part of a Serial for duties at the

           F .A. semi-f i nal betweehsNiott ingham F orest and Liverpool due to be held

           at Sheffield Wednesday's Ground, H i ll sb or ou gh .

           Police transport then conveyed myself and others to W o m bw e11 Police

           Station, where we later liaised with other                  'B2' Officers and boarded a

           Police transit van and were then conveyed to Hi Ilsborough Stadium.

           After an in-depth initial briefing on the logistics and strategy to be

           implemented on the day,       given by both uniform and C.I.D. Senior

           Off i ce rs , a l 1 Serials then took a small snack type meal                 in the N
                                                                                    PAGE    S
                                                                                    S1929

Stand, where the previous briefing had been held.

At approximately 11.30 am (1130), after a further briefing by

Inspector, I was deployed, together with the rest of my Serial, inside
                \         PO/C < * S t O € GATG5-
the Ground at the\_eppings Ln end behind turnstiles 9 - 16. The

Serial Sergeant was        Police Sergeant      1757 B U R N S .   He informed us    that

we would work in pairs behind the turnstiles with female Officers

deployed behind themajority of males,           on searching         duties   in

accordance with the        Inspec to r’s previous briefing.

From roughly 11.30 am (1130) until          1415 or thereabouts,          the passage of

individuals    into the Ground was sparse with very few people coming

into the Ground.      The ones that did come into the Ground between these

times appeared to be family types          in good jovial mood.           As I say,

there    continued to be a steady flow, albeit sporadic,               of people

through! the turnstiles      into the Leppirigs Ln e n c l o s u w .      However,    at
              s o e   t Is-rijLes     •                        \                       i
roughly 2.15 pm (1415)       that same date,      there began a profuse build-up

of people outside the Ground entrances to the Leppings Ln end.

Through the activated turnstiles          I could see a large gathering of

people outside the Ground who were very tightly packed against each

other.

I as an individual member of my Serial,            continued with searching

duties at this time.       Presently, as more and more people filed in

through the busy turnstiles,        I was approached by several Liverpool

supporters who claimed that the situation outside was becoming                      rough

and unruly, with people starting to push and shove each other outside.

This situation continued for some minutes, and I remember stating to a

colleague that I knew something was about to happen,                  that we would

be having s o m e \ r o u b l e of some kind.

At approximately 1430 that same db&Xe, I saw that several young men had
                                             U N A u .
started to enter the ground by scalin g the outer perimeter w a l l and

roofs of the nearby turnstiles.
                                                                               PAGE          3
                                                                               SI 929

They were repeatedly told by myself and other Officers to refrain from

climbing    in this way.     The Liverpool supporters declined to take heed

and regardless of care,       continued to enter the Ground in this way.                It

was seen by myself that a vast majority of these persons,              together

with others that had entered by the more conventional means of the

turnstile, were smelling heavily of intoxicants.               I saw several

attempts by Officers to eject or arrest these persons              result in

failure,    due to the vast numbers        congregating at the time.     Officers

were trying to control the whole situation, which by now was becoming

chaotic and, as a result,       persons without tickets may have entered

onto the terracii

At approximately 145u, I sawh to my left in The Leppings Ln enclosure



now know to                     18 years,    b                        , unemployed,

of                           Liver poo 1         He was involved in an argument

with UIPC PEARSON ab out whether or not he had got a ticket to see the

football match in the Ground.         He became agitated and started abusing

the WPG and so I intervened.         As a result of            conduct and his

inability to produce a valid ticket of any kind,            he was escorted

towards the Police room, with the intention of expelling him from the

Ground.

During this time,       I was joined by Police Constable 853 BURKE w h o

assisted me due to             disposition,      that meaning that he was

st rugg1i n g .

At one stage,           struggled violently and as a result,        I was thrown to

the floor and          was heard to say,      “Come on lads,   come on", with the

intention of inciting other Liverpool fans into a fight with myself

and Police Constable BURKE.

Eventually,       after getting myself off the floor,           was placed in the

Police    room.     I remember at the time of falling to the Ground that
                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                  SI 929

I ’d better get up or else I ’d be trampled to death or at best,                  badly

kicked.

After    lodging         , my prisoner,   in the Police Detention Room,       the

normal     procedure for prisoners was followed, with regards to

documentation and searching.

I then took             to the Police cell bus which was parked outside, and

it was then that I realised that some form of disaster had occurred,

due to the vast number of bodies and injured laid outside the Police

Room inside the Ground.

Myself and Police Constable BURKE then tried to locate our Serial

Sergeant         1757 BURNS.   We were unable to do so, and now in retrospect,

this was probably due to the chaos caused inside the Ground on the

Leppings Ln end.          After trying to gain access to the pitch/terracing

areas via the Leppi ngsN]!>Rs^N^ W Stand area, Police Constable BURKE and

myself     returned to the rear of "'Wie W S t a n d .
                                                              .
It was here that I was approached b^s a doctor who stated he wanted to

knour^there all the injured w e r e . P x s c o r t e d him to the rear of the N
                      CAt S
Stand outside the gymnas ium area, where X then ass isted in the
        I r\j3
treatment of casualties.

At 1610 or thereabouts,          I left the gymnas ium area due to all of the

casualties having been conveyed to hospital.

I then returned to the rear of the Le ppi ngs Ln area and tried to

conso1e members of the public.            At this t i m e , most   people were,    though

di s tr au gh t, nevertheless understanding of the Police situation.

Others,      however,    some smelling of drink, were more abusive,         stating

the cause of the disaster to be any Police action,                 or inaction as the

case may have been.

At roughly 1700, all Police personnel were mustered in the N Stand

where Serial Sergeants after debriefing             could stand their respective

Serials down.          At 1830 my serial was stood down and I returned to

               I am a Police Constable of the South Yorkshire Police,                 currently

               stationed at Penistone Road Police,                 Station, which is part of Barnsley

               Division.

               On Saturday 9.4.88,            <090488)   I paraded at Wombwell Police Station as

&              part of a serial bound for public order/footbal1 duty at Hillsborough

               foo tb al1 ground for the 1988 FA Cup Semi-Final               between Liverpool and

               Nottingham Forest.

               After a briefing         in the North Stand inside Hillsborough football

               ground, my serial was deployed outside the turnstiles to the Leppings

               Lane end of the ground,            on searching duties.

               All       people entering the ground through the Leppings Lane turnstiles

               were searched.          Most    people accepted this as the "norm" and were happy

               to oblige.
                                                                     PAGE    2
                                                                     S 1929A

After the kick off my serial was further deployed to the rear of the

standing area behind the Le ppi ngs Lane goal,    to where the Liverpool

fans were located.

Individuals,   nominated by the serial sergeant,    whose identity I cannot

recall, were detailed to stand on the rear step of the terracing,          to

assist in any possible evacuation and to keep any overall       eye on

things   inside the enclosure.

This enclosure,    immediately situated behind the Leppings Lane end

goal, was very full and as a reuslt,     the officers detailed,   had to

stand at the entrance to the enclosure,      with the rest of us, as it

was   impossible due to the immense congestion of people within the

enclosure.

I for my part,    stood at the end of the tunnel which feeds the terrace

from the rear of the Leppings Lane turnstile area,      remaining here for

most of the first half of the game.       It struck me at the time that the

design of the security fencing was inhibiting the movement of persons

within the enclosure.

By this I mean that the end of the tunnel      opens out onto the terracing

immediately behind the Leppings Lane goal, and only a matter of

approximately six feet is faced with a steel      railing fence, which

transcends the terracing    right to the front wall.    This would mean

that persons entering onto the Leppings      lane terrace, would have to

turn sharply, almost    immediately,   on their exit from the tunnel either

to the right or to the left.     After a snack meal    in the gymnasium at

around the half-time mark,    I together with other members of my serial

returned to the Leppings Lane terracing area.

This time I took up a position at the rear of the Leppings Lane

terracing,   underneath the North Side of the West S t a n d , just to the

south of the uncovered standing/quadrangle terracing area.

I again saw that the place was full though a little better than the
    '- *                                                           PAGE

            area behind the g o a l .

            I can finally state that I saw nor heard of any problems            in relation

            to either     problems with the t un ne l, tunnel   gates,   or any other part

            of tha ground.

            After the fans had left the ground my serial wa stood d o w n , and we

            returned to Barnsley after the game.

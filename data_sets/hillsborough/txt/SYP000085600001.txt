                States;    I reside at the above address with my family & I am employed

                as a                     full time.      In addition to this I am also employed by

                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club as a Steward at football matches at

                the Hillsborough stadium.

                On Saturday 15th April            1989 (150489)     I was on duty at the Hillsborough

                stadium in my capacity as a steward in the North stand gangway T . A s

                a result of the incident at Hillsborough I subsequently completed a

                Stewards Questionnaire at my hoine address on 20th April               1989 (200489).

                Further to that Questionnaire/in clarification of a point I would add

                that at about 3,20pm (1520hy4)             I made my way onto the pitch itself to

                see if I could assist,            sho/tly after this I saw a group of about 6 or

                8 football supporters carrying a hoarding with a man on top, they

                appeared to be struggling with him so myself & some others who I don't
                                                                                 PAGE     2
                                                                                 S2986

                        - to assist,    I would say I joi ned this group at about the

                        if the pitch,    I remember the hoarding was blue in

                        i was a man on this hoarding who       I realised was seriously

         injured, we carried this man on the hoarding across the pitch.to an

         area adjacent to the gymnasium, whilst we carried          this man I realised

         he was infact dead, & some one       placed a Tee shirt across his face.

         ^11 I can remember about the deceased man was that he was a white male

         about 25 years of age stocky build with short brown h a i r , he did not

         have any facial hair but had some growth,         I can also recall that he

         *>ore blue denim jeans & a white        y^hirt or Tee shirt with some sort of

         motif on it.   I do not kn              3 mans identity.

                                                                                SIGNED

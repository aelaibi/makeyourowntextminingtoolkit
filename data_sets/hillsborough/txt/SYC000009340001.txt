        Dear Sirs,                         ,

        Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990..


        If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the teaths
        of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent
        on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified
        due course.

        I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
        evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations o
        coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial bu
        inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

        Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules the ^ q u e s t is
        under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
        witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
        this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

         Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
         to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
         appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me
         consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

         May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
         attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

         I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
         names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision
         to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

         I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
         heard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names
         submit.

Dear
              Sirs,

Re: 24SSI GL0V3R (deceased)
As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not- to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,



S.L.Popper,
H.M. Coroner.

Dear Sirs,

You .will be aware that I do not normally release post mortem
reports until the resumption of the Inquest, when they are
in fact put in as evidence.

However, in view of the numerous requests which I have received,
and the obvious distress which delay is causing to your clients,
I have decided that subject to certain conditions set out below,
I am prepaxdd to release to you upon request, the post mortem ,
report of your client(s).

The release of these post mortem reports are on the basis that:-

       a.     They have to be treated as provisional, and therefore
              subject to amendment or alteration until such time as
              they are given or produced in evidence at the Inquest.

       b.     They are to be used only for the purpose of bereavement
              conselling of the deceased's relatives or for proper
              legitimate purposes in connection with any legal proceedings
              in which solicitors may be engaged.

       c.     Subject to the.'cafe5H@, they are to be kept confidential Tontil
              they come into the public domain at the resumed Inquests.

I have your request for the post mortem report to hand in respect
of each of the persons listed on the attached sheet, and on the
assumption that you will confirm that the report in respect of
each of your respective clients is accepted on the terms set out
above, and in order to save further delay and upset to your client,
I enclose a copy of the relevant post mortem report. If for any
reason you cannot agree to the contents of this letter, please return
the post mortem report to me, without of course making any use of it.

The cost for the copy post mortem report(s) is 55p    per nheet (total £ l.lOp )
Please make your cheques payable to the City of Sheffield.

Yours faithfully,
                                  \

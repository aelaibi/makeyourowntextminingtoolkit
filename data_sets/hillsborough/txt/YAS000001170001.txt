HAKE:       Qualified Ambulanceman

VEHICLE:    S209

SHIFT:      1400 - 2200 hours (15 April 1989)


DATE AND TIME OF INTERVIEW:        19th April 1989, 1015 -    12200 hours



We had just radioed green at Northern General Casualty and we got an order
to stand-by, listening to the radio I was aware something was happening.
The next instruction was to proceed and stand-by at Herries Road Football
Ground.      Due   to   the fact   that   I realised something was     happening we
proceeded as quickly as possible.


At the junctions with Moonshine Lane we got a command to proceed Red to the
Gymnasium entrance at Hillsborough Football Ground due to the fact we had
both heard Leppings Lane mentioned we queried with Control whether it was
Leppings Lane or Penistone Road.          At this point we were still unaware of
the type of incident on arriving at the ground it was very difficult to
approach due to mass congestion of non-civilian vehicles, we had to cross
over the central reservation to get to the Gymnasium entrance and the
Police were finding it extremely difficult to hold back the crowd at this
entrance.


When we got inside I saw Station Officer Higgins he was waving me towards
him.      Leading Ambulanceman Flack then alighted from the vehicle, at this
point either Station Officer Higgins or Station Officer Eason told me that
there was     a youngster arrested at Leppings Lane.           At this point I was
concentrating on the vast amounts of people milling around so as not to
cause any further incident.         Station Officer Higgins then told me to get
our Ambulance on the pitch and drive up towards Leppings Lane to which I
replied that the entrance looked a little tight.             Station Officer Higgins
said that he thought I would be alright because a St John's Ambulance had
just gone through.
                                                                            /continued

    So due to the position I needed to reverse to swing the front end round to
    get down the slope to which Station Officer Higgins watched me reverse.             As
    I started to go down the ramp           it did infact become very tight, but I
    eventually got onto      the pitch.     When I got to the    bottom of the slope, I
    looked right and saw complete mayhem.         It appeared we were the first SYMAS
    vehicle on the pitch.


    I saw a blue light on the pitch at the Leppings Lane end, which was totally
    swamped by people surrounding it.         I then concentrated on locating Leading
    Ambulanceman Flack which I managed to do.          He was pulling a cot across the
    football pitch with a patient on it, assisted by Station Officer Eason and
    a Police Officer.     I did not proceed any further than the extent of the cop
    end penalty area, because of a potentially dangerous situation due to the
    amount of people running around on the pitch and not wanting to be in a
    similar situation to the vehicle in obvious difficulties at the Leppings
    Lane end of the goal mouth.


    I had    locked the door of my vehicle to maintain            a safe position.       As
    Leading Ambulanceman     Flack approached my vehicle I unlocked           the     door,
    removed the keys and got out.         I ran to the back of the vehicle and       opened
    the doors and because the casualty was already on a cot, I removed the non
    made up right-hand side cot and pulled it onto the pitch where it was
    immediately     commandered.    We loaded    the   patient    amidst   lots of    eager
    helpers, Leading Ambulanceman Flack jumped in the saloon with the Police
    Officer and continued to resuscitate the child.              I closed the rear doors
    returned to the drivers door and got in to the vehicle.           The passenger door
    opened and I noticed Station      Officer Eason who was wanting to use the
    radio.   I pulled him into the cab and told him to            shut the door.     I then
    manoeuvred to negotiate the ramp to leave the ground.

    As I approached the ramp I told Station Officer Eason to 'bail out' as I
    was ready to leave,      this he did.     I then commandered a Police Officer,
    whilst approaching the ramp, to watch me up the ramp and managed it without
    incident.      I had great   difficulty   leaving   the ground due to enormous
    amounts   of   people milling   about and    experienced   traffic   congestion on
    Herries Road.


    At some point we were told byControl        to change to ERC channel I attempted
    to call on ERC with no reply.           I reverted back to Channel 2      and gave
    details of the casualty and to which hospital we were going to.            Control
    then told me again to go backon ERC.


    We discharged our patient as fast as        possible whilst Leading Ambulanceman
    Flack continued resuscitation by CPR.        I cleaned our vehicle and equipment
    and we were mobile back to the incident within minutes.               We contacted
    Control on ERC which was still a bad reception and they told us to go back
    to the Gymnasium entrance on Penistone Road, doing this we experienced
    worse traffic and crowd congestion than we had previously.


    We entered the ground through the Gymnasium Car Park entrance as directed
    by the Police, Leading Ambulanceman Flack alighted from the vehicle, I went
    to the rear of the vehicle collected a cot and located my colleague.             We
    placed a casualty on the cot and returned with him to our vehicle.         I asked
    a Police Officer if he would back me onto Penistone Road which he did and
    then proceeded to the Northern General Hospital.


    On our arrival at the Northern General their           'MAJAX'   procedure was   in
    operation.      We were met at the resuscitation door by a doctor who told me
    to take the casualty to the Plaster Room.       We returned our equipment to the
    vehicle and started to return to the incident.             We called Control who
    instructed us to return to the Leppings Lane entrance, Gate 'O'.

On arrival at Leppings Lane we were confronted by mass crowds and had to
proceed with extreme care.    I noticed two fire appliances, one had 'Control
Unit' written on it.     We pulled in behind the queue of parked vehicles.
Police Officers were attempting to load patients on our vehicle, but we
advised them to take them to the front of the queue.       A Renault vehicle
pulled up behind us and I told the Police Officer that if he had any
walking wounded he was to put them on that vehicle.      The reason for this
was all the vehicles in front of me were front line 'E' vehicles.


As the queue started to move down, we were told a casualty was ready to be
moved at the front of the queue.      We collected the casualty with a minor
delay, and also conveyed a doctor and a paramedic with the patient.        We
conveyed the patient to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital.        Upon radioing
clear at the Royal Hallamshire, we picked up a West Yorkshire vehicle and
escorted him back to the ground to which again we joined a further queue of
Ambulances on Penistone Road.


We gave our body-bag up and from there we were directed to park up and
stand-by at Herries Road Bus Garage.     We were then called to the Gymnasium
entrance at Penistone Road.     We were briefed by ACMAO Jones and because we
were a 1400 - 2200 hours crew, we were returned to base.    On our route back
to base we dropped some clothing off at the Northern General that belonged
to one of our previous casualties.

POLICE INSPECTOR


FORCE OPERATIONS ROOM



On Saturday, 15 April 1989, I was the Duty Inspector in the Force Operations
Room working from 2 pn until 10 pn.           On coranencing duty I was aware that
the Major Incident Roan situated just off the main ^rations Hoorn was manned
and was controlling events in relation to the football match at Hillsborough.
Chief Inspector Edmundson was in charge of the I n c id e n t Roan and I had no
duties in respect of the event.

At about 1506 that day, Chief Inspector Edmundson came into the Cfcerations
Room and instructed me to implement Operation Support in respect of crowd
problems and injuries at the football match.           I iM*di*tely brought i* «.
the Command and Control system the pre-fomatted message             and    I then asked
Chief inspector Edmundson if the implementation had been authorised by an
officer of Assistant Chief Constable rank as instructions require*                    Whilst
corseting the format details I heard Chief Inspector Edmundson                         ***
ground control who replied that the ACC (Operations) was present and had
authorised it.     Again, Whilst ccnpleting the format, I queried the rendezvous
point but was unable to clarify i* 3t that stags.            Onoe c o rrp le te d I

PERSONAL



Dear Dr.

     Thank you for your note indicating that merabers of the Department are
prepared and willing to contribute to any research projects that are developed
after Hillsborough.

     During the last week                           Professor of Social Work at
Manchester Universityr, has been doing some planning and development work Â»ith a
group of staff and has agreed to try to co-ostiinate the research.   Frora uty
preliminary discussion with him it would appear that his primary focus would be on
social and organisational aspects of the Hillsborough writ, and if the Royal
Department was interested in developing work on a personal and psychological
perspective at first sight to appear to dovetail very well. I am copying this
correspondence to Howard Parker and will assusae that he will be in touch with you.
I have mentioned to him your interest in the cones!tment.

        Many thanks for your letter and your assistance.

                                         Yours sincerely,

Mr R M Whalley
Secretary to Lord Justice Taylor




You will recall that a request had been made last week for details of those
persons who were Injured at Hillsborough and where they were when they
received their Injuries. If It Is not possible to Identify where they were
Injured, then where they started In the pen and where they finished up.

The nominal records of all registered injured persons have been researched,
together with other relevant questionnaires. The grid positions of these
persons have been recorded and plotted on three master grids*-

Plan t Indicates a single position where the person Is able to identify
where he received the injuries.

Plan 2 Is the first position where the person was on entering the pens
through the tunnel.

Plan 3 shows their final positions.

I leave you to draw your own conclusions from these plans.

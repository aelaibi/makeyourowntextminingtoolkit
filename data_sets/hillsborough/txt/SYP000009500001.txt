      the g r o u n d , I saw people              climbing over          the fenci/f^f^ngtsitting                on the

      edge        of the    pitch.          It a p p e a r e d to be a    ’pitch     invasion*.           I was       not

      in poss es sion of a radio and did not know what was                                    being said over

      the        radio.

      The        football m atch was            still      in play but as         1 got    to the terracing

      end,       we were  told to form a cordon on the goal ^ine                               to prevent        fans

      serious        than a pitch          invasion was          taking       place.                                   x'

      some were        limping        others      holding       their       bodies.        The    injured       persons

      were     di rected to an area onto the                     pitch       in    front of the N o rt h stand

      where     the first aid             people were,

      At this        time,     we were      stood       in front       of    pen 4 and th4n a s si st an c e was

      given to p e o p l e climbing               over    the fence and             through the gate             in the

      fencing        near    to this       pen.

      As the     crowd        cleared      it was apparent             that       some    people    had collapsed

      and     I saw one male           in the      'well*       of the terracing,                several    officers

      were     giving a rtificial            r espiration to him and                     in an effort       to get the

      body out of the terracing with other                             officers          I commenced to k i c k

      down the fencing.

      officer                             am bu la nc e and got a stretcher.                      The male       person

      I returned to the               fencing and saw several                     other    bodies    on the

      terraci ng       in pen 3 .          By this       time    the    crowd had either             come onto          the

      pitch or moved               back up the terracing.                   O ff icers and        civilians were

      bringing        the bodies          onto    the    pitch.        Some were          being    resu sc it at ed and

      required as           the    pitch was       clear    of bodies,             I wa lk ed amongst           the   fans

      on the     pitch giving             help when needed but due                   to the shock          of    people

      there was        not very muc h any               person

On    return,         again with the serial,                   I went            to the area behind                     the W e s t

s tand w ith other                officers.

We were         then told to          return to our vehicle and went                                  on mobile

p a t r q 1.     My    initial       thoughts           on the matter                were   that         by the time our

serial         had a tt en de d at          the Leppings, Lane end,                     the    incident had

h a ppened and the a ss is t a n c e we gave was what we thought was                                                    right.

                     L/'
seeing dead bodies at a football m atch was o ve rw helming but as I have

said,     after        the    initial        shock,       everyone           got on with giving what

assistance            one    could.

As a     postscript,              I have w a t ch ed football                    on 50 f o o t b a l 1 1eague

g rounds        in this       country and              in Spain.            In this         country we treat

football         fans       like animals.               Being a Policeman,                   1 always                try and

treat     the     public          in a manner           I would        like to be treated mnyself.                               In

the    past at other               football           grounds,     the feeling you get                              is of being

led from         place to          place and just as the m i n o r i t y have                                changed      life

for everyone,               the    football           fan appears           to have suffered the most.

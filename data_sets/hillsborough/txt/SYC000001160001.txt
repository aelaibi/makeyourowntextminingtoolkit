  Dear


                                     Hillsborough Inquests

  You will by now be aware that I am resuming the Inquests on 19th
  November 1990 into the people who lost their lives at Hillsborough
  stadium. My intention is to sit until about 20th December 1990 and if
  the hearings are not completed by then to adjourn over the Christmas
  and New Year period. I would expect to resume on about 7th January
  1991.

  I am at present considering who I might wish to call to give evidence.
  I realise that this is something which you might not wish to undertake
  and I would therefore be grateful if you could please let me know
  whether if I felt you should be heard you would be willing to attend
  and give evidence.

   I would be grateful if you could please reply as soon as possible. To
   assist you I enclose a pro-forma which also asks for certain
   additional information. Please return it to my coroner's officer
   (listing) in the envelope provided.

   If you have any questions regarding this matter please contact my
   coroner's officer (listing):

       Det. Sgt. M.J. Tredgold, c/o West Midland Police,
       Hillsborough Inquiry, Nechells Police Station, Birmingham B7 5DA.

   His telephone number is 021 359 3820. Please do not phone him unless
   it is really absolutely necessary.

      Dear Sir/Madam

                                      Hillsborough Inquests

      I am actively considering the names of the people who I may wish to
      attend to give evidence at the resumed Inquests which are scheduled to
      commence on the 19th November 1990 and to continue thereafter until
      about 20th December 1990. If the hearings are not completed by then
      there will be a break for Christmas and New Year and I am planning to
      resume on about 7th January 1991.

      It is my normal practice not to issue subpoenas or summonses to
      witness who I wish to attend at Inquests as I find that most people
      are perfectly willing to come to Inquests by invitation.

      You will appreciate that with Inquests of the size and complexity
      associated with the Hillsborough Disaster it is very important that
      the attendance of witnesses should go as smoothly as it is possible to
      arrange. I therefore would like to have your confirmation that if I
      were to request you to attend as a witness you will in fact do so
      without a subpoena or summons being served upon you.

      When replying, would you please also let me have certain other
      information which I have set out on the attached pro-forma. Please
      return this immediately to my coroner's officer (listing) in the
      envelope provided.

       If you have any questions regarding this matter please contact my
       coroner's officer (listing):

           Det. Sgt. M.J. Tredgold, c/o West Midland Police,
           Hillsborough Inquiry, Nechells Police Station, Birmingham B7 5DA.

       His telephone number is 021 359 3820. Please do not phone him unless
       it is really absolutely necessary.

       You will of course be contacted again with further details if your
       attendance is going to be required.

                                   PRESS RELEASE



    By Hr J. Mervyn JONES, the Deputy Chief Constable of Cheshire and Officer in
    day-to-day command of the initial investigation and more recently has acted
    as the Coroner's Officer.


    He said:-


           "I have no comment to make about the verdicts, nor has the Coroner,
           Dr Stefan POPPER.


           The investigation into the circumstances surrounding the tragedy at Hillsborou^
           has been exhaustive and comprehensive.     At the height of the investigation
           nearly 500 West Midlands Police Officers were involved.               Upon completion
           of the bulk of the work by the Summer of 1989, the team was reduced to
           62, and from November 1990 onwards, a team of 12 Officers has been
           dedicated to supporting the Coroner for his Inquests.


           During the course of the inquiry as a whole, contact has been made with
           over 13,000 people, over 5,000 statements have been taken, 9,000
           questionnaires completed, over 2,400 photographs examined and 71 hours
           of video      viewed.


            The product of these extensive investigations was made available to
            Lord Justice TAYLOR, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Police
            Complaints Authority, and latterly to the Coroner.


            At the opening of the investigation I stated that this tragedy would
            be investigated thoroughly.; this we have done.




                                                                        Continued

         "As a matter of interest the Coroner's Inquests, sitting with a Jury, have
         been the longest running in recent history, if not for all time.                Including
         the interim inquests in April/May of last year the Coroner's Court sat
         for a total of ninety three days over a total of nineteen weeks.               There
         were over 520 appearances by witnesses and 540 exhibits examined.                The
         transcripts of the proceedings amounted to over 8,650 pages recording
         over 3.6 million words spoken.




         THERE WILL BE NO SEPARATE INTERVIEWS WITH MR JONES OR THE CORONER."

Mr. J. H. Rowlands,
Home Office,
Queens Anne's Gate,
London,
SW1H 9AT



Dear Mr. Rowlands,

Thank you for your letter of 13th November enclosing a letter from
Simon Hughes MP for Southwark Bermondsey.

 1„ I have to say that I am somewhat surprised :

 a. by the fact that I was first made aware that there was a letter
 from Mr. Hughes to the Homes Secretary when a reporter from a National
 Newspaper visited me at home shortly after 2 p.m on Sunday 9th Nov.
 1990.

 b. that the MP for Bermondsey is concerning himself with the running
 of inquests in Sheffield as I assume that neither Sheffield City
 Council nor myself nor an unnamed Liberal Democratic councillor nor
 for that matter Liverpool or Nottingham fall within his constituency.

 c. that a concern regarding a possible conflict of interest should be
 raised with me three working days before the recommencement of the
 Hillsborough Inquests particularly when I had already spent several
 days in April 1989 opening the inquests and had resumed with a jury
 between 18th April - 4th May 1990. The transcripts of the evidence
 of these hearings run to over 1000 pages. In addition there was
 extensive national publicity regarding those proceedings. The
 conclusion of the interim hearings on 4th May are themselves 5 months
 prior to the date of Mr. Hughes letter.

 2. Everything that is referred to in Mr. Hughes letter (apart from any
 references to Committee meeting matters of Sheffield City Council of
 which I have no knowledge) was known in April 1989. That was the time
 when anything regarding possible conflict of interest should have
 been raised and not 18 months or so later.

 3. I would remind you that a Coroner is an independent judicial
 officer and is an appointee and not an employee of the local
 authority. The latter have inter alia a duty to remunerate him and
 pay his costs and expenses but they do not control what he does or how
 he does it. They are not able to remove him from office which is a
 right reserved for the Lord Chancellor, and in presumably very rare
 instances, the Crown Court.
1 have sought to maintain good relationships with the officers of
Sheffield City Council, to behave responsibly with regard to the
incurring of costs and expenses and to keep them informed possibly to
a greater extent than was strictly necessary.

4. As I understand it I was the only eligible coroner under the
legislation unless the provisions of Section 14(1) Coroners Act 1988
had been implemented and some other coroner had agreed to take the
transfer, or the provisions of section 14(3) or 13(1)(a) and 13(2)
Coroners Act 1988 had applied which I do not think was or is the case.

Although a large number of the deceased came from Merseyside by no
means all did, and it would not in my opinion have been right to ask
the coroner in Merseyside or Liverpool to take over the inquests.

If I could have divested myself in April 1989 of the responsibility
for the inquests into the deaths caused by the disaster I have no
doubt I would have gladly assented and it certainly would have madean
enormous difference to my life.

5. It is inherent in the coronal system which is territorial in nature
that the coroner may come into conflict with the local authority.
This is no doubt one of the reasons why the coroner's position is as
is described in paragraph three of this letter.
                 /
The Coroners Act 1988 specifically mentions various disqualifications
from appointment to coronal office. I draw your attention to Sections
2 (2) and 2 (3). It seems therefore to me that had parliament wished
to include provisions to cover the sort of situation described byMr.
Hughes, it would have been childs play to legislate for it
particularly as sections 2 (2 ) and 2 (3 ) actually deal with the
appointment of a coroner who is or was a councillor or alderman.

6 . Whether it is a good thing that a coroner's jurisdiction is
territorial and that he is locally appointed as opposed to centrally
by say the Lord Chancellor is another question. I do not think
that this letter is the appropriate place to deal with these issues
though I may write to you again on this after the inquests are over.

The seperation of powers is very fine in principle but not so easy to
achieve in practice. For instance even the head of the judiciary is
himself a political appointee.

7. It goes without saying of course that should someone feel that
proceedings are defective then judicial review or the provisions of
Section 13 Coroners Act 1988 are open.

8 . You will no doubt be aware that in the normal course of things
should I require some expert legal help I ( and I believe coroner's in
general ) would in the first instance look to their local authority's
legal Departments for help.

I was however conscious from very early on that there was the
possibility of criticism of the Council's involvement in connection
with the disaster. I felt that it would be inappropriate to
consult with them as this could give rise to a conflict of
interest if I were to discuss matters with them when the officer's
or the Council's conduct might be called in question. I therefore
arranged for a meeting with the then Chief Executive and inter alia
agreed with him that it would be right that in the Hillsborough
disaster I would seek independent legal advice if I felt that I needed
it and instruct independent solicitors which I have done. I had
thought about the problem and in so far as it was necessary I had and
have continued to take steps to avoid difficulties arising.
In fact I seem to recollect that I approached some one in the Home
Office to see if legal help was available from you or treasury
solicitors but I was told that that was not possible.

8. I must say that I am not entirely happy with the suggestion that
has been raised and even less so with the timing and manner of its
making. I have had to devote considerable time to this reply which
could have been better spent in getting prepared for these inquests.

I hope the foregoing will be of assistance to you. Please let me have
a copy of Mr. Waddington's reply.




Yours sincerely,




S. L. Popper.

It has been brought to my attention that the Sheffield Coroner is paid at
a full time rate but does other jobs.

I am also troubled by the at least apparent conflict of interests between
somebody, although Her Majesty's Coroner, who is paid for by the City
Council, when he is at the same time conducting an Inquest Inquiry into
the liability of the same City Council.

I have discussed this matter with my colleague Alex Carlile, Q.C., who shares
rny concern.

I could set out the details further if this would be helpful and am aware
that this matter is now a matter of public debate in Committee on Sheffield
City Council. One of the Liberal Democrat Councillors in Sheffield asked for my
view on the subject and I said I would write to bring the matter to your
attention.

I am happy to discuss the matter with you if this would be the most
appropriate way to proceed. I should be grateful for a reply as soon
as possible.

                           Dear Stefan


                           In response to your letter of 14/10/91 I am sure that any spare
                           copies of documents relating to the Hillsborough Disaster Inquest
                           left over once the records are handed over to Chris Dorries's
                           satisfaction, (or to the City Archives), will be of little value or
                           interest except to you and it would be quite in order for you to keep
                           them for your personal career records.


                           I agree that time spent compiling an inventory of documents you take
                           for these purposes would be pointless.


                          Yours sincerely

 Once they got on the terrace she was seperated from
 her boyfriend and was pushed towards the net.       I askei
  "Did you hear whilst on the terrace, did you hear
 people shouting"?    "Yes" was the answer.    "Once we
 got through the tunnel people were shouting Stop
 pushing from behind, we are getting crushed, here,
 move back" but it didn't make any difference it was
 just getting worse.    On C92 she marked the plan where
 she heard the people shouting.    She then describes
 how she was pushed towards the front and how two men
 assisted her.    She was asked "Did you see any police
 Officers on the far side of the perimeter fence"?
 Her reply was "Yes I did, I saw then standing up and
 when people were trying to climb over they were telli lg
 them to get back in.    The men around me was shouting
 to try and tell them what was going on inside but
 they could not hear*.'. We also heard them telling
 people to move back but we just could not do that1    .1
 Thing then became even tighter and she went on to
 say that once the police realised what was happening
 they began to tear down the front.    This was after
 the match had stopped.    She was adamant that it was
 police officers'who were pulling the fencing down.
 She could not remember any fans doing i t . She said
 the activity was more or less opposite to where she
i»as. The enclosure somehow cleared and she
jSventually left back through the tunnel.     She was cros;
examined by Mr. Manning, she confirmed that there wens
jothers trying to get tickets and that she did not see
 the police landrover outside the gate.     In reply to
 VIr. King she confirmed that she joined the crowds
 outside the perimeter gate at about 2.45 p.m.      She
 ^asprobed about the position of the police officer at
 the perimeter fence.    She was asked "The people who
 "/ere trying to get out and the police officers trying
 :o get back in saying Get back in, what were they
 trying to get out of, what was the problem that they
 ''ere trying to get out of"? Answer "The fact is I
 :hink at that point there were actually people on the
 jround who had died and they were, trying to explain
 :his to the policemen at the time, they just wanted
 :o get out because you couldn't move".    Question "They
 wouldn't move, the people who wanted to get out"?
 Answer "No they were sort of crawling on top of
 iverybody". Question "How far was the police man fror
 :hat scene".   Answer "He was just in front of it he
’/as just outside the fence standing".    Question "So
.is far as you could see was looking into what you were
describing"? "Yes" Mr King went on "I get the
 .mpression it was sometine before the police realised
 what was happening and then they started to pull down
 the fen cing, is that right"?    "It seemed like thatr
 at the time, yes".    Cross examined by Miss Adelman
 she said she knew that people were on the floor
 because she was standing on some o| them herself.

           DR JOHN ASHTON



           I am a medical practitioner and senior lecturer in Community (Public)

           Health at the University of Liverpool,    On Saturday 15th April,

           (150489) I went to the FA Cup semi-final match at Sheffield with other

           members of nry family.   This year we travelled by way of the M62 and Ml

           because for the same event last year we had travelled on the direct

           route through the peak district and there had been very bad build-ups

           of traffic on the way home.    We left Liverpool at about 10.15 am

           (1015) and arrived in Sheffield at about 12.15 - 12,30 pn (1215 - 1230).

           Vie had a nieal at a pub some distance from the ground and afterwards

           walked perhaps 2 miles to the match.     While we were at the pub a coach

           load of Liverpool supporters came in.     They were boisterous but well

           behaved and there was good humour between them and the local people

           v?ho were eating in the dining area,

           We arrived at the Leppings Lane end of the ground at around 2.30 -

            2.35 pm (1430 - 1435) (myself, sons Matthew, 16 and Nicholas

       14 and nephew Carl Nichols, 24).          It was immediately apparent that it

       was going to be difficult to get in.         We had four tickets together for

       Row 2 of the West Stand, above the Leppings Lane terrace.          I had been

       particularly relieved to obtain scats this year because at last year's

       game in the semi-final we were in the terrace itself (in the right

       hand corner behind the goal) and it had been terribly crowded and

       unpleasant.

       Oil Saturday we found that outside the ground there were a large number

       of supporters trying to get in to a small number of turnstiles and

       that there was very little Police prescience,         I saw no stewards

       outside the ground.      There appeared to have been no attempt to

       marshall the supporters into lines in advance of our approaching the

       turnstile areas.

       We managed to get nearer to the turnstiles but the crush was beccffting

       unpleasant.       X heard a Police officer telling the supporters that

       it was their own fault for caning late.

       I decided that I did not want to go on because it was so unpleasant.

       Carl said it would only get worse and thet he was going in.           Matthew

       and Nicholas insisted on going in with Carl and they stayed where

       they were as I withdrew to the wrought-iron fence.

       After a few minutes I thought I wou.ld try again,         I could not see my

           family and assumed that they had managed to got through the

           turnstiles. When I    approached again it was now much worse and again

           I withdrew.   I was aware of an officer trying to close one of the

        wrought iron gates, but he had no chance on his own.          I noticed that

           there was now a Police landrover in the lane just outside the gates

           and my instincts and experience of 30 years as a Liverpool supporter

           told me that things were going badly wrong.       I went to the Police

           landrover and obtained the attention of one of the Officers.          I said

       to him, "You've got to get a grip of this situation, it is out of

      control, there is going to be a tragedy”. He seesried bemused and

       unresponsive. People were closing in around the landrover and I

       withdrew to the other side of the road to see if it v^uld ease off and

       I could try again,         The; time now must have been 2.45 - 2.50 (1445 -

       1450).

       After a few minutes I suddenly realised that everybody had gone in and

       I was able to walk up to the turnstiles and gain admission without

       difficulty after tendering my ticket.

       Once inside the turnstile it was at first unclear where I should go.

       There were no stewards in sight and the section labelling was

       confusing.        I   realised where the entrance was to the West Stand and

       went to get in after buying a programme.          At this stage I had no idea

       that things had actually now deteriorated to the extent that they had

       done.     It must have been just after 3.00 pm (1500).

       When I went to the gate into the West stand there were a few other

       people in the process of getting in and two Policemen were checking

       their tickets,          I then became aware of a man crying and beseeching the

       Police "There are kids dying in there," He said, "You've got to do

        something",

       He seemed to have cate out of the terraced area.          The Police were

        unresponsive to him.         They checked roy ticket and let me in.

           Once inside the stand area I turned up the stairs, now worried to

           check that Matthew, Nicholas and Carl were alright.      As I got to the

           top of the stairs it was difficult to make progress because there were

           so many people in the aisle.       At the top of the stairs I could begin

           to see why.       Many people were being pulled up out of the terrace and

           into the front of the stand.

           I could neither attempt to get down to row 2 nor see the boys.       I

       decided to make my way along the adjacent row.       Everybody was helpful

       and I was able to do this without difficulty.       It must have been about

       row 20.    When I got some way along it I looked down to see if I could

       see the boys.     First I saw Carl, then Matthew, then Nick,    I was able

       to make my way down to thesvi over the seats.

       When I reached th«so 1 could see that there were a large number of

       people on the pitch, people trying to get out of the terrace on to the

       pitch and people were continuing to care up in to the stand.          There

       segued to be few St Johns Ambulance people attending the people who

       were lying around the pitch and I could see people lying on the pitch

       unattended.     There was a large line of PoHce Officers across the

       pitch at the centre circle.        The tannoy told the supporters who were

       on the pitch to get off it,

       The pressure was bad where we were so I made my way back seme rows

       with Matt and Nick. Carl stayed where he was to help pull people up

       from the terrace.     When we got further back we had a clear view of

       what was happening on the pitch; it seared incredible.        The time must

       have been about 3.15 pm (1515),

       The overwhelming impression was of a large and growing number of

       casualties and not much response.        The supporters were now inpatient

           and angry at the slowness of the response to the emergencies. There

           appeared to be only one or t w stretchers on the pitch and one

           ambulance was making its way around frcm the far comer.     The

           supporters were chanting for assistance to be brought to the injured

           who were lying on the pitch.    The next thing was that many of the

           supporters who were on the pitch began to tear down the advertising

           boards and organise themselves into stretcher parties.     This    all

           happened very quickly.

           I heard the tannoy appeal for doctors to help.     I could see that the

       situation was really bad and could count six people who appeared to

       be dead near the goal mouth,        I made sure that Matthew and Nicholas

       were safe with Carl and that I knew where they were and made my way

       out down the back of the Leppings Lane Stand.

       On the stairs a Policeman was attending somebody who was injured.           The

       injuries did not appear to be critical so I asked the Policeman where

       I should report to help.        He did not know.   I went back into the stand

       and brought the boys out and down the stairs to place them somewhere

       safe and In sight.      I then tried to find somebody in charge to tell me

       who to report to.      I asked several Officers, but none of them knew,

       rhere were people lying everywhere in the yard area between the Stand

       and ’.he turnstiles.     I asked the officer who was in charge and he

       indicated a senior Officer.        I approached this Officer and told him

       that I was a Doctor and asked him who was in charge of emergencies and

       where I should report.      He said he did not know and that he had just

       arrived. By this stage I realised that there was no organised

       response and I was angry.        I asked the Officer for his number but he

       did not appear to have one.        I askod for his name.   Ho said he was

        Inspector GRACE.      I left him and went to see what I could do.

       All around were people either dead or unconscious, or seriously hurt.

       The supporters were fantastic.        They were all helping each other and

        trying to resuscitate people.       Individual Police officers were also

        doing what they could.      At no time did I see anybody attack a Police

        Officer# nor did I see anybody who was drunk,

           I carte to the conclusion that somebody needed to take an overview of

           the situation and began to go round all the casualties to appraise

           them.   There* did not secsn to be any St Johns Ambulance workers

           around at all. I became aware that some casualties were being taken

           out into Leppings Lane itself and I went out there.      There was one

       ambulance.       The time must have been about 3.30 - 3.35 pn (1530 -

       1535).

       The Police were beginning to put people into the ambulance and I

       realised that a system of prioritising by triage was needed.             So I did

       this.     I went around and either checked people myself or asked the

       person who was attending than.        There were two or three other health

       workers in evidence who ware assessing, resuscitating and doing what

       they could.       There appeared to be no medical or emergency equipment.

       The dead were taken to one side and I allocated the other casualties

       to category one or category twD.           I told the Pol .ice who should be

       despatched by ambulance next and who could wait.           The Officers were

       mostly very good.       They took my instructions and acted on then

       immediately.       By this tin® there wa3 a steady flow of ambulances,          it

       must have been 3.45 or 3.50 (1545) or (1550).            I became aware of

       a local general practitioner who had arrived at the scene.            Over the

       next half an hour we worked together as a team, sorting the casualties

       and despatching them in the ambulances.           An anaesthetist arrived fron

        somewhere and fire-engines came with resuscitation equipment, but all

        of this was really too late.        By 4.25 pm (1625) it was all over.

        The serious casualties had gone to hospital and what remained were

           people with minor injuries, shock and distress and        a line of dead

           people.   I went to check that my family was alright and when I came

           back a Police Officer asked roe to certify the deaths.        A general

           practitioner had already started this at one end of the row of

           bodies.   I started at the other.       I think the time was 4.27 or 4.29

           (1627) or (1629) and I think 1 certified five or six dead.           Only

           one of whom could be Identified frc*n documents on his body.

           During this whole period the public were fantastic, although shocked

           and angry.    On one occasion at the end, a group of young men came past

       the dead, and one of than expressed his anger at police who were

       standing there.     I told him to 'cool it', that it was not helpful and

       he stopped.     I saw no other episodes like this at all, although there

       was a general atmosphere of anger at what had been happening. I

       remember thinking how restrained everybody was,

       It must have been about 4,30 - 4.35 (1630) - (1635).        There did not

       sean to be anything else for me to do behind Leppings Lane.          I checked

       that Matthew and Nicholas were alright with Carl and then made my way

       to the gymnasium around the side of the ground to see if I could be

       of any help there,      I had becoine aware that otlier casualties had been

       taken to the gymnasium.

       At first I had difficulty finding it as nobody could give me

       directions.     When I arrived there I v«nt in and found that it was all

       over.     At one end there were tables (I think three) which must have

       been used for processing details of the injured.        There were now no

       casualties in this area.        At the neat; end of the gym were rows of

       bodies.     On my way past I noticed a large display of photographs and

        information on the wall of the gym showing LiveT-pocl supporters who

       were thought to be pickpockets, etc.

   Q    I left the gym and returned round to the lappings      La ne   end to check my

        family again.     They were alright.     I thought that I should go back to

        the gym to see if there would be a debriefing of people involved in

        the errcsrgeney response, so all four of us went round.        This time it

        was difficult to get near the gym because there was a large cordon of

           Police around it.   I spoke to an officer and he let us through when he

           knew I was a Doctor and I left Carl, Matthew and Nick safely behind

           than and went to the gym.

           This time it was very difficult to get in.     There was tight control on

           the door,   I explained why I wanted to go in and was allowed to enter.

       I asked about a debriefing but nobody could help.      Those who had been

       helping were being cleared out of the gym.       Just then a senior officer

       called all the officers together at one end of the hall for a police

       briefing.      I don't know what it was about.   I left.

       On our way back to Leppings Lane         encountered a Police officer who

       was in great distress and being comforted by another.        I put my arm

       around him to comfort him as well.       He was sobbing uncontrollably and

       saying that now the police would get the blame,       Another officer was

       angry and told roe that he felt that they had been let dawn by the

       senior officers.      He said that nobody had taken charge and that when

       senior officers had come they liad been of little use and just got in

       the way.

       Wo left the ground and returned to the car to drive home.        We must

       have left the ground by about 5 o'clock (1700).

       I would like to say that I have been following Liverpool Football

       Club for over 30 years and that I am familiar with the normal range of

       behaviour of club supporters.      Before the match on Saturday the

       crowd mood was buoyant and generally good humoured. I feel that since

       the Heyscl disaster an attitude of mind has been cultivated which

   ^   regards all football supporters as members of a sub-human species to

       be contained,      As a result crowd safety has taken second place.      On

        Saturday 2 believe that this belief about football        supporters

        contributed to the apparently slow initial response by the police to

        what was happening.      It seemed that they mi.si.ook the tragedy for crowd

           trouble.

           It is difficult to know how many lives might have been saved if the

           emergency response had been more effective, but in my opinion on this

           occasion It was woefully inadequate.

N otes for guidance of Junior Hospital staff concerning deaths which should be reported to the Coroner:—

1.    T he occasion s w hen a C oroner has an interest in the death o f any person are broadly set ou t in the
      C oroner’s A ct, 1887, Sec. 3 (1) as follo w s:— “ W here a C oroner is inform ed that the dead b od y o f
      a person is lying w ithin h is jurisdiction, and there is reasonable cause to suspect that such person has
      died either a violent or an unnatural death, or has died a sudden death o f w hich the cause is unknow n,
      — or under such circum stances as to require an Inquest in pursuance o f any A ct, etc.

2.    Violent death
            This m ust be interpreted broadly and does not'm erely con n ote crim inal violence. A n y traum a,
      how ever it is caused and for w hatever purpose it is inflicted (e.g. therapeutic) is violen ce w ithin this
      definition.

3.    Unnatural death
            This defies a com prehensive definition based u pon b iological principles and can, therefore,
      only be defined in term s o f legal convenience th u s:—

      (a) D e a th s d u e to p o is o n s. A ll deaths due to p oison s for w hatever purpose taken or adm inistered
      and under w hatever circum stances. Thus accidental p oisoning and therapeutic p oisoning, including
      sensitivity reaction, are included.

             D eath due to salm onella typhi-m urium is included som ew hat anachronistically in this category
      because o f its old classification as fo o d poisoning. In view o f the p ossible con fusion still o f certain
      chem ical p oisonings w ith this con d ition it is advisable to investigate fully any deaths attributed to
      this organism .

      ( b ) P o s t o p e ra tiv e d e a th s.   A ll deaths occurring w ithin 24 hours o f operation. T hese w ill alm ost
      w ithout exception be disposed o f by the C oroner w ithout Inquest but it is in the best interests o f the
      m edical and nursing profession that th e facts in these cases should be scrutinised by the C oroner as
      an im partial observer so that ill inform ed criticism and suspicion can be m et. A t the sam e tim e the
      public w ould feel protected against the possibility o f m alpractice if u ntim ely p ost-operative deaths
      are subject to scrutiny. “ O peration” in this context includes any procedure in volving the use o f any
      instrum ent for therapeutic or d iagnostic purpose w ith or w ithou t anaesthetic.

      (c) D e a th s d u e to n e g le c t.      A ll deaths in w hich neglect (including self neglect) has p layed a part,
      whether it is in relation to food , warm th, or m edical attention. O nce m ore it m ay w ell b e that m ost o f
      these deaths w ill be passed as due to natural causes w here the elem ent o f neglect is slight, or in the
      case o f self neglect, com es w ithin the accepted n otion o f freedom , but it is desirable that the facts
       should be scrutinised first.

      (d ) D e a th d u e to in d u stria l d isea se.     A ll deaths arising from or accelerated by industrial diseases.
      M any o f these are already covered b y Section A . The com m onest in this Sheffield area is pneum o­
       coniosis but others, including industrial neoplasm s m ay o n rare occasions arise.


 4.    Sudden Deaths, the cause o f which are unknown
             In this category it m atters not that the deceased was under treatm ent or regular surveillance,
       if death w as n o t expected to occur w hen it did as a natural consequence o f a diagnosed con d ition ,
       then it is sudden and in the interest o f accuracy these deaths should be reported for investigation.


 5.    Inquests in pursuance o f any Act
             T h ese are o f little concern to the doctor in the ordinary course o f events, apart from deaths due
       to industrial disease w hich have already been m entioned. T he on ly addition one w ould m ake to this
       fo r practical purposes is the notification o f deaths o f foster children (Public H ealth A ct, 1936).


 6.    W ar Pensions and Disability Pensions
              In these cases it is unusual that the disability concerned does precipitate the death, but if it does
       or is thought to be a factor the m atter w ill o f necessity be reported to the C oroner. Even if the
       disability is n o t a factor the M inistries concerned are desirous that autopsies are carried ou t and
       under the circum stances the easier m ethod to effect this is to report the m atter to the Coroner.
            Note on Death certification

                  Deaths are sometimes reported to the Coroner unnecessarily by the Registrar o f Deaths because
            o f ambiguities in the statement o f the cause o f death. This causes distress and inconvenience to
           relatives. Certain terms, when not suitably qualified, raise doubts in the Registrar’s mind and it is
           important that the appropriate qualification should be added when any morbid condition is men­
           tioned which might, under other circumstances, be caused by any o f the factors referred to above.
           Thus ‘abortion’, ‘septicaemia’, ‘cirrhosis’ and ‘pulmonary fibrosis’, when not reportable, should be
           qualified by ‘spontaneous’, ‘non-traumatic’, ‘non-alcoholic’ and ‘non-industrial’ respectively. This
           list is not exhaustive but covers the com m on sources o f misunderstanding and illustrates the point.

           Notes on Procedure

               The reporting o f cases to the Coroner is a matter o f urgency and not something which can be
           postponed until the day before the proposed funeral. Doubts which cannot be resolved by senior
          members o f the hospital staff can be put to the Coroner or one o f his staff by telephone. If there is
          any possibility o f a crime being associated with the death, consultation should be made even at
          night. Notification should never be later than 9.00 a.m. on the day following the death, given by
          telephone in the first place, and confirmed by a letter handed to the relatives or in any other way
          suggested by the Coroner’s officer in the light o f circumstances. Delays in reporting cases lead to
          unnecessary distress and inconvenience to relatives.

N otes for guidance o f Junior Hospital staff concerning deaths which should be reported to the Coroner:—

1.   The occasions when a Coroner has an interest in the death o f any person are broadly set out in the
     Coroner’s Act, 1887, Sec. 3 (1) as follow s:— “ Where a Coroner is informed that the dead body o f
     a person is lying within his jurisdiction, and there is reasonable cause to suspect that such person has
     died either a violent or an unnatural death, or has died a sudden death o f which the cause is unknown,
     — or under such circumstances as to require an Inquest in pursuance o f any Act, etc.”

2.   Violent death

        This must be interpreted broadly and does not ’merely connote criminal violence. Any trauma,
     however it is caused and for whatever purpose it is inflicted (e.g. therapeutic) is violence within this
     definition.

3.   Unnatural death

         This defies a comprehensive definition based upon biological principles and can, therefore,
     only be defined in terms o f legal convenience th u s:—

     (a) Deaths due to poisons. A ll deaths due to poisons for whatever purpose taken or administered
     and under whatever circumstances. Thus accidental poisoning and therapeutic poisoning, including
     sensitivity reaction, are included.

^        Death due to salmonella typhi-murium is included somewhat anachronistically in this category
     because o f its old classification as food poisoning. In view o f the possible confusion still o f certain
     chemical poisonings with this condition it is advisable to investigate fully any deaths attributed to
     this organism.

     (b) P ost operative deaths. All deaths occurring within 24 hours o f operation. These will almost
     without exception be disposed o f by the Coroner without Inquest but it is in the best interests o f the
     medical and nursing profession that the facts in these cases should be scrutinised by the Coroner as
     an impartial observer so that ill informed criticism and suspicion can be met. At the same time the
     public would feel protected against the possibility o f malpractice if untimely post-operative deaths
     are subject to scrutiny. “Operation” in this context includes any procedure involving the use o f any
     instrument for therapeutic or diagnostic purpose with or without anaesthetic.

     (c) Deaths due to neglect. All deaths in which neglect (including self neglect) has played a part,
     whether it is in relation to food, warmth, or medical attention. Once more it may well be that m ost o f
     these deaths will be passed as due to natural causes where the element o f neglect is slight, or in the
     case o f self neglect, comes within the accepted notion o f freedom, but it is desirable that the facts
     should be scrutinised first.
|
     (d) Death due to industrial disease. All deaths arising from or accelerated by industrial diseases.
     Many o f these are already covered by Section A. The commonest in this Sheffield area is pneumo­
     coniosis but others, including industrial neoplasms may on rare occasions arise.

4.   Sudden Deaths, the cause o f which are unknown

          In this category it matters not that the deceased was under treatment or regular surveillance,
     if death was not expected to occur when it did as a natural consequence o f a diagnosed condition,
     then it is sudden and in the interest o f accuracy these deaths should be reported for investigation.

5.   Inquests in pursuance o f any Act

          These are o f little concern to the doctor in the ordinary course o f events, apart from deaths due
     to industrial disease which have already been mentioned. The only addition one would make to this
     for practical purposes is the notification o f deaths o f foster children (Public Health Act, 1936).

6.   War Pensions and Disability Pensions

          In these cases it is unusual that the disability concerned does precipitate the death, but if it does
     or is thought to be a factor the matter will o f necessity be reported to the Coroner. Even if the
     disability is not a factor the Ministries concerned are desirous that autopsies are carried out and
     under the circumstances the easier method to effect this is to report the matter to the Coroner.




                                                                                             \
                 I




       N ote on Death certification

             Deaths are sometimes reported to the Coroner unnecessarily by the Registrar o f Deaths because
      o f ambiguities in the statement o f the cause o f death. This causes distress and inconvenience to
      relatives. Certain terms, when not suitably qualified, raise doubts in the Registrar’s mind and it is
      important that the appropriate qualification should be added when any morbid condition is men­
      tioned which might, under other circumstances, be caused by any o f the factors referred to above.
      Thus ‘abortion’, ‘septicaemia’, ‘cirrhosis’ and ‘pulmonary fibrosis’, when not reportable, should be
      qualified by ‘spontaneous’, ‘non-traumatic’, ‘non-alcoholic’ and ‘non-industrial’ respectively. This
      list is not exhaustive but covers the com m on sources o f misunderstanding and illustrates the point.

       N otes on Procedure

           The reporting o f cases to the Coroner is a matter o f urgency and not something which can be
       postponed until the day before the proposed funeral. Doubts which cannot be resolved by senior
      members o f the hospital staff can be put to the Coroner or one o f his staff by telephone. If there is
      any possibility o f a crime being associated with the death, consultation should be made even at
      night. Notification should never be later than 9.00 a.m. on the day follow ing the death, given by
      telephone in the first place, and confirmed by a letter handed to the relatives or in any other way
      suggested by the Coroner’s officer in the light o f circumstances. Delays in reporting cases lead to
      unnecessary distress and inconvenience to relatives.

It is the statutory duty o f the coroner (see para. 06.03) as soon as practicable,                                                        15.01

post.

The Coroners (Amendment) Act 1926 conferred a power to hold an inquest                                                                    15.02
without a jury in certain cases: Coroners (Amendment) Act 1926, s. 13(1): see
para. 01.09. The obligation to hold an inquest with a jury remained
specifically in relation to deaths com ing within one or more (see R v.
H am m ersm ith C oroner ex parte Peach [1980) 2 W.L.R., 507) o f five categories:
Coroners (Amendment) Act 1926, s. 13(1), (2).
   Section 19 o f the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 extended one of
these categories, s. 56(2) o f the Criminal Law Act 1977 removed two o f those
categories and s. 62 o f the Administration o f Justice Act 1982 has added a
further category.

 The present state o f the law has therefore developed as follows:                                                                        15.03
     A coroner, having jurisdiction1 shall, as soon as practicable, summon a
 jury2; but he may hold an inquest without a jury3, unless there is reason to
 suspect4:
 (a)    that the death occurred in prison or in such circumstances as to require
        an inquest under an Act other than the Coroners Act 1887: Coroners
        (Amendment) Act 1926, s. 13(2)(b); or

 (b)        that the death was caused by an accident, poisoning or disease notice
            of which is required to be given to a government department or to an
            inspector or other officer o f a government department or to an

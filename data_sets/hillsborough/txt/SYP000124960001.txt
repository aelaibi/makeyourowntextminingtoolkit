 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 •1) MANY POLICE NEAR TO THE PENS 3 AND 4, ONCE FANS HAD CLIMBED OVER IN OBVIOUS

 DISTRESS ONTO THE PITCH, APPEARED TO ACT STRAIGHTy^WAY.                         THE OTHER OFFICERS

 WHO WERE THERE IN BACK UP APPEARED STILL TO BE /NA£j                         I AND TREATING THE

 EVENTS AS A PITCH INVASION.           NOW THESE I N A C T W E                RS IN LINE ACROSS THE

 PITCH STILL DIDN ’T DO ANYTHING EVEN WHEN DEAD FANS ON MAKESHIFT STRETCHERS

 WERE CARRIED THROUGH THE LINES.

 2) I SAW OFFICERS WHO AFTER MATCH WERE MOVING INJURED FANS OUT OF SHEFFIELD,

 IT APPEARED TO ME THAT THEIR ONLY CONCERN AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED WAS TO

 CLEAR SHEFFIELD OF FANS.



 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1) LACK OF CROWD CONTROL AND SUPERVISION AT J/HE ftg0UND/#Y POLICE AND STEWARDS,

 IE;   LACK OF QUEUES, APPEARED TO BE G E A R ^ / o R 'PU&KTIC ORDER SITUATIONS ONLY.

 2)    FAILURE TO REALISE UNTIL TOO LATE THAT THERE WAS A VERY SERIOUS SAFETY

 SITUATION IN PENS 3 AND 4.

 1)    ONCE POLICE WERE DEPLOYED ONTO THE y£ST TERRACE TO STOP A POTENTIAL

 A~CH    INVASION, THEY WERE JUST STANDING AROUND AND DIDN’T APPEAR TO BE

 HELPING, ONLY A SMALL NUMBER TOOK/SELF    INITIATIVE AND HELPED.

 2)    IT LOOKED AS IF IT WAS THE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS WHO TOOK THE INITIATIVE

 TO HELP THE INJURED FANS AND NOT THE POLICE.     I DID NOT SEE ANY SENIOR POLICE

 OFFICER NEARBY.           C A T ”                     C Q N < f^f

 3)    COMPLETE LACK OF CONTROL BY THE P0L3/?E AND ALSO LACK OF INFORMATION

 GIVEN OUT TO THE FANS IN THE GROUND./ N O ONE KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

 4)    COMPLETE LACK OF MEDICAL EQUIPMENT IN SUCH A CASE OF AN EMERGENCY AS

 DID HAPPEN.

 ^     PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ORGANISED INTO QUJgOES BY THE POLICE OUTSIDE THE

 GROUND AND TICKETS SHOULD HAVE BEEN CHECKElf FROM A DISTANCE AND TO STOP

 PEOPLE WITHOUT TICKETS GETTING NEAR THE/GROUND.     THERE WAS A LACK OF POLICE

 PRESENCE, COMPARED WITH LAST YEARS MA t/ h .

 WAS A TOTAL LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN POLICE, GR0l|£4D OFFICIALS AND

 STEWARDS.

 YES, FROM ABOUT 2.40PM (1440) THERE WEF^       URGES AS PEOPLE MOVED FORWARD, THIS

 BEING APPARENTLY CAUSED BY MORE PEOP/E COMING INTO THE REAR OF THE ALREADY

 OVERCORWDED CENTRE TERRACES, WHILST THIS WAS A CONTRIBUTORY FACTOR,         I WOULD

 E^jpPECT THAT THE MAIN COURSE OF THE CRUSHING WAS THE APPARENT LACK OF CROWD

 CONTROL. SURELY THIS SECTION SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSED OFF, AT LEAST AT 2.30PM

 (1430).


Q16

 Q4 b

 WERE YOU INJURED,    IF SO, DID YOU ATTEND HOSPITAL IN SHEFFIELD?

 NO.


017

 049

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS, OR THE

 INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 ALL I CAN REALLY SAY IS REFERRING BACK TO THE SURGES,       IN THE TERRACES BEFORE
                                                                           PAGE    S

3P M* <1500) WHICH WAS CAUSED BY TOO MANY PEOPLE     THE TERRACES AND MORE AND

MORE COMING IN, DURING THIS PERIOD POLICEME          STEWARDS APPEARED TO WATCH

THE APPAULING SITUATION GET WORSE WITHOUT TAKING ANY ACTION.

<352

DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

NO.

Q53

DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON TJ4£ WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

MY IMMEDIATE THOUGHT WAS THAT THi    -&ERE FACED WITH A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION

BUT NOBODY SEEMED TO BE IN CHARfll    AS SOON AS FANS TRIED TO GET OUT OF THE

       OSURE SOME POLICEMEN APPEARED TO BE TRYING TO PUT THEM BACK AND THIS

RESULTED IN 1 OR 2 ASSAULT!    ON POLICEMEN, WHICH   CONSIDER WERE UNDERSTANDABLE

IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

G54

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1. THERE SEEMED TO BE A LARGE POLICE PRESENCE PARTICULARY IN THE STREETS

AROUND THE GROUND BUT UNLIKE LAST YEAR THERE WAS NOT ANY CORDON OF POLICE

CHECKING TICKETS PRIOR TO ARRIVA lT a T THE ENTRANCE TO THE GROUND.

2.THERE WERE PEOPLE WITHOUT TICKETS WE HAD BEEN ASKED ON 2 OR 3 OCCASIONS IF

WE HAD SPARE TICKETS, HOWEVER THIS IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR A LARGE GAME,     I FORMED

 IT WAS THE F ^ S b0O CARRIED EVERYONE OUT ON THE BOARDS, USING THEM AS

 STRETCHERS,    IF THE POLICE WOULD HAVE DELAYED THE KICK OFF FOR 20 MINUTES THEN

 NO ONE WOULD HAVE PANICKED AND RUSHED TO GET INTO THE GROUND.


Q19

 A
 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 IT WAS DISGUSTING THAT THE COACH DROPPED US OFF AT LEAST A MILE UP THE ROAD

 WHEN IT HAD COME RIGHT PAST THE GROUND AND COULD HAVE DROPPED US OFF THERE,

 WE WERE DELAYED GETTING INTO THE GROUND BY ABOUT 20 MINUTES, DUE TO THAT. NO

 ONE WAS ORGANISING THE CROWD OUTSIDE THE GROUND, NO ONE WAS DIRECTING FANS

 INTO QUEUES.    THERE WAS ONLY A COUPLE OF POLICE OUTSIDE BUT THERE WAS LOADS

 THROUGH THE TURNSTILES.

401     WHERE I WAS SITTING IN THE NORTH STAND I COULD   SEE THE CENTRE PENS WERE

 PACKED BUT THERE WAS LOADS OF ROOM IN/fHE OUTER PENS.     I NOTICED THIS AT

 3 O ’CLOCK WHEN THE GAME KICKED OFF

 IF THE LIVERPOOL FANS HAD BEEN G/VEN MORE TICKETS I D O N ’T THINK ANY OF THIS

 WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.    THEY G O y 4,000 MORE TICKETS THAN US EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE

 AN AVERAGE OF 19,000 MORE SyPPORTERS THAN THEM.

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE FANS IN THE WEST STAND WERE VERY GOOD AND TRIED T O « £ l P BY PULLING THE

 PEOPLE OUT OF THE PENS. MANY POLICE ON THE PITCH JU^T STOOD THERE DOING

 NOTHING TO HELP. THE RESPONSE TIME FOR THE ARRiy^L OF THE FIRST AMBULANCE TO

 ARRIVE WAS ATROCIOUS. ALSO IT TOOK FAR TOO bmiG FOR FIRE SERVICE PERSONNEL TO

 BRING CUTTING EQUIPMENT TO REMOVE FENCING ETC.

Q52

NO

G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OF OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 BEFORE THE POLICE REALISED WHAT WAS GOING ON THEY DIDN'T APPEAR TO BE

HELPING ONCE THEY KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON THEY STARTED HELPING AND TORE

 THE FENCE DOWN.     I THOUGHT THE AMBULANCE COULD HAVE GONE ACROSS THE PITCH

RATHER THAN INCHED ITS WAY AROUND.         I THOUGHT THAT TOO MANY POLICE STOOD

 I^ T H E MIDDLE INSTEAD OF HELPING AT Tye OTHER END,

Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?                                        _

 THE ORGANISATION OUTSIDE OF THE GROUND SHOULff HAVE BEEN BETTER.           THEY SHOULD

HAVE CORDONED OFF THE AREA AND ASKED FOR TICKETS.            AS IT WAS THERE WAS TOO

 MANY TRYING TO GET IN THE GROUND AND N O J E N O U G H POLICE,   I ONLY SAW TWO

POLICE OFFICERS ON FOOT OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILE THEY HAD NO CHANCE OF

 ORGANISING THE CROWD EVEN THEY WERE BEING CRUSHED, THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN

MORE INCLUDING HORSES.       THE SIZE AND AMOUNT OF TURNSTILES COULD BE

 I ® R E A S E D TO ALLOW EASIER AND QUICKER ACCESS TO GROUNDS.      THE PERIMETER

 FENCING SHOULD HAVE BETTER ESCAPE ROUTES,      IF FENCES LIKE THAT HAD BEEN

 AT BRADFORD WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.        THE PENS ARE TOO SMALL HAD PEOPLE

 BEEN ALLOWED TO SPREAD OUT OVER WHOLE OF THE STAND PERHAPS SO MANY MIGHT

 NOT HAVE DIED.

 INFORMED THE CROWD ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING, POSS USING THE ELECTRONIC

  100 POLICE OFFICERS FORMED UP JBY THE NORTH STAND TOUCHLINE, THEY LATER

  STOOD IN A LINE ON THE HALFtyftY LINE.    THEY SEEMED TO BE DOING NOTHING,

  INJURED AND DEAD WERE BEING CARRIED THROUGH THIS LINE, YET THEY STILL

  STOOD THERE WHEN THEY COULD HAVE BEEN HELPING OUT.



  IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD>JHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO

I THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?                /

  1.    I WENT TO THE 1988 (000088) yg>EMI~F INAL THERE.      I HAD A WEST STAND

  TICKET IN 1988 (000088).     I ENTERED AT 2.30PM (1430) THERE WAS A BAD

  CRUSH THEN, NO QUEUES, A fc^SS OF PEOPLE.

  2. A LACK OF TURNSTILES, 20,000 PEOPLE T                 GET IN THROUGH ONLY A FEW

  ENTRANCES.     I THINK THIS IS CRUCIAL, A            AL SHOULD BE MADE OF

  THIS POINT.     I THINK THIS IS THE MAJOR REASON FOR THE TRAGEDY

  3. ALSO, POOR POLICE ORGANISATION

  4. POLICE OFF I'                    _ FANS IN PUBS BEFORE THE GAME.

 5. NOT ENOUGH POLICE OR STEWARDS OUTSIDE THE GROUND CONTROLLING THE CROWD.

 6. I HAVE HEARD THROUGH A LOCAL PAPER THAT LIVERPOOL F.C. REQUESTED A

 CHANGE OF VENUE TO OLD TRAFFORD, THIS CHANGE WAS DENIED BY THE F.A.

 SO I THINK THIS WAS WRONG.

 IN 1988   <000088)   I DID NOT SEE A FOREST FAT^UNTIL I ENTERED THE GROUND.

 SO I CAN SEE THE POLICE AGREEING TO GIVE/THE SPION HOP TO FOREST AGAIN TO

 MAINTAIN ORDER IN 1989 <000089).      Byf LIVERPOOL HAVE A MUCH LARGER

 FOLLOWING SO THEY SHOULD HAVE PER*<APS HAD THE SPION KOP END.

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WA>         HE INCIDENT WAS

HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 I THINK MORE POLICE COULD HAVE HELPED Air       HE LEPPINGS LANE END,   INSTEAD

 OF FORMING A CORDON IN THE MIDDLE         rTHE PITCH.   LACK OF AUDIBLE INFORMATION

 OVER THE LOUD SPEAKERS,        THE SITUATION WAS LEFT TOO MUCH FOR THE FANS TO

 DEAL WITH.

 A LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 ON OUR OWN ACCORD.

 G52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NOTHING AT ALL.



 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS tQR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS

 HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH W^SsSTOPPED?

 INDIVIDUAL POLICE OFFICERS DID n H ^ S E E M TO qSE THEIR INITIATIVE, THEY

 SEEMED TOO FRIGHTENED TO MOVE, TOO ShQW TO REACT.      BUT CREDIT MUST BE

 GIVEN TO THOSE WHO DID FIGHT FOR P E O P L E V E S .


G19

 <254

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 NOTHING REALLY.

 I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE PEOPLE OF SHEFFIELD FOR THEIR HELP & SUPPORT

 ON THE DAY OF THE DISASTER, ALLOWING STRANGERS INTO THEIR HOMES TO

 MAKE PHONE CALLS HOME & GIVING REFRESHMENTS, ETC.

 THERE WAS NO ORGANISATION, NO ONE SEEMED TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON - ONCE THE

 EMERGENCY SERVICES REALISED THAT /T WASN’T JUST ANOTHER PITCH INVASION THEY

       STUCK IN.   PULLING FANS OUT /)F THE PENS ONTO THE PITCH, AND TRYING TO

 RIP DOWN THE FENCING.     I ALSO SAW FANS RUNNING AROUND WITH THE INJURED ON

 MAKESHIFT STRETCHERS (ADVERTISING HOARDING).     THE AMBULANCES ARRIVED ABOUT

 1520 HRS, BUT THE FIRE SERVICE ARRIVED ABOUT 1545 HRS.     I THINK THERE SHOULD

 HAVE BEEN MORE AND QUICKER MEDICAL ASSISTANCE.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH/YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I FEEL THAT THE OPENING OF GATE ’B' WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO, IF IT HADN'T

      BEEN OPENED PEOPLE WOULD HAVE D/ED FROM CRUSHING OUTSIDE,
_3BE
 I THINK THAT THE TUNNEL SHOULD HAVE/ BEEN BLOCKED OFF BY STEWARDS/POLICE TO C O M M

 STOP ENTRY TO PENS 3 AND 4 WHICH W^RE OBVIOUSLY FULL TO THE LIMIT.

 YEAR POLICE OFFICERS WERE CHECKING TICKETS SOME DISTANCE FR          'GROUND.

 THEREFORE ONLY AUTHORISED PEOPLE GOT NEAR THE GROUND.

 DOWN BY THE GOAL.    ONE MAN WE HELPED HAD SPINAL INJURIES, WE GOT OTHER PEOPLE

 THE LACK OF ORGANISATION AND POLICING OUTSIDE THE GROUND.     THE BAD DESIGN OF

 THE ENTRANCE TO THE GROUND.     LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN POLICE OUTSIDE AND

 THOSE INSIDE.     THE GATES SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN OPENED, THE KICK-OFF SHOULD

 HAVE BEEN DELAYED AND INFORMED PEOPLE OUTSIDE WHO WOULD THEN HAVE STOPPED

 PUSHING.     THERE WERE ONLY 2 TURNSTILES OPEN AND I NEVER SAW ANYONE GO THROUGH

 TH EM .   THE POLICE WERE SLOW IN REACTING TO PULLING PEOPLE OUT THE FENCING,

 THE PERIMETER AND BARRIER FENCING. ALSO NO-ONE KNEW WHERE THEY WERE GOING

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED

-’a FTEFT THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE POLICE WERE OBVIOUSLY GOING THROUGH A DRILL ON THE PITCH OF PREVENTING A

 POSSIBLE RIOT BETWEEN FANS.       THEY REMAINED IN POSITION ON THE HALF WAY MARK

 AND AT VARIOUS ENTRANCES.     AFTER A WHILE THE LINE DISAPPEARED.    THE P A

 SYSTEM WAS NOT UTILISED AT ANY TIME, ONLY BY DALGLIESH

     053

     DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

     AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED? \

     I THOUGHT THERE WAS A DISTINCT LACK^QF LEADERSHIP, ACCEPTING THERE WERE

    DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES.       THERE APPEARED TO BE A LOT OF OFFICERS STANDING

    (J|UND NOT GAINFULLY EMPLOYED FOR A LONG TIME ONCE THE GAME HAD STOPPED.

     IN FAIRNESS THERE WERE OTHER OFFICERS WHO WERE DOING A GREAT JOB ONCE THEY

    KNEW WHAT HAD HAPPENED.       I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE WHOLE POLICE

    OPERATION FROM START TO FINISH.

    G54

     IS THERE ANYTHING T HAT YOU                WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

I    JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

     I WENT TO THE SAME MATCH LAS      YEAR         it;ING OPERATION THEN WAS FAR

    SUPERIOR TO THIS YEAR, OUR TICKETS WERE CHECKED BY POLICE OFFICERS PRIOR TO

    REACHING THE TURNSTILES, WE WERE SHEPHERDED TO THE TURNSTILES IN ORDERLY

    g UT u ES   AND LAST YEAR WE WERE DIRECTED IN THE CAR AND KEPT AWAY FROM THE GROUND

    THIS YEAR WE GOT VERY CLOSE TO THE GROUND BUT WITH LITTLE POLICE DIRECTION.

    PRIOR TO THE GAME THERE WERE MANY OFFICERS, UP TO 20, NEAR THE SHOPS WHO

    WERE JUST CHATTING IN A GROUP WHEN THERE WERE LOTS OF FANS MILLING IN THE ROAD

     IN LEPPINGS LANE.      THEY COULD HAVE BEEN UTILISED AS LAST YEAR TO ORGANISE

    THE FANS ON APPROACH TO THE TURNSTILES.

     IT APPEARED THAT EVERY FAN WAS BEING SEARCHED JUST IN FRONT OF THE TURNSTILE

    AND THIS, IT APPEARED TO ME, WAS CAUSING FURTHER DELAYS       FOR FANS TO ENTER

     THE GROUND.

     IN MY OPINION THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE BETTER INSIDE THE GROUND BEHIND THE

 •1)   WHEN THE MATCH WAS STOPPED ABOUT 100 POL&CE OFFICERS FORMED A CORDON.          I

 THINK THEY SHOULD'VE USED A SMALLER NUMBEGK IN THE CORDON AND THE OTHERS COULD

 HAVE BEEN BETTER USED BY GIVING FIRST (j/lYi.    2)   THE FIRST AMBULANCE ARRIVED

 f ® R L Y QUICKLY BUT THE 2ND AMBULANCE/TOOK TOO LONG TO ARRIVE.      3) FIRST AID

 EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES WAS TOTAULY INADEQUATE.        4)   THE PUBLIC ADDRESS

 SYSTEM WAS INEFFECTIVE AND WAS WOT      USED TO INFORM PEOPLE OF THE SITUATION.          IF

 IT HAD BEEN USED CONSTRUCTIVELY, ALOT OF PROBLEMS COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED            (IE

 THE FOREST FANS WOULDN’T HAME BAITED THE LIVERPOOL FANS). 5)         WHEN WE TRIED TO

 LEAVE THE GROUND THE POLICE PREVENTED US FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES BUT THEY DIDN'T

 TELL US WHY.   WE LATER FOUND OUT FROM OTHER SUPPORTERS THAT IT WAS TO ALLOW

 EMERGENCY SERVICES FREE ACCESS.     6) I DIDN'T SEE ANYONE TRYING TO SELL OR

EVEN MENTION FORGED TICKETS FOR THE GAME AND I HAVE HEARD ABOUT THEM ON SOME
 P^pVIOUS MATCHES.    7)   I COULD SEE   THAT THE CENTRE PENS ON THE LEPPINGS LANE

 TERRACES WERE PACKED FULL. THE TWO      WING PENS HAD ROOM TO TAKE MORE FANS

 ESPECIALLY THE WING BY THE POLICE BOX. 8)       ST JOHNS AMBULANCE STAFF WHO WERE

 ON DUTY IN THE MAIN DID THE BEST THEY COULD BUT THERE WERE SOME WHO WERE

EITHER TOO YOUNG OR INEXPERIENCED AND THEY COULDN'T COPE AND IN SOME CASES

 BROKE DOWN.

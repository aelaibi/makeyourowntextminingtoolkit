               Whenever      in the past there has been a conflict of opinion between the

               public and the Police,             I have tended to side with the Police.

               Last Saturday 150489 at Hills^brough changed all that.                 My experiences

               last Saturday 150489 startafl about 50 yards from the ground,

      i        Friends and I were walking to the ground and there was a fan walking
S lQ »
        ^     towards us away from the ground,                when a mounted policeman moved

               alongside us and shouted to the fan "Are you stupid or something,                   the

S54i'-         ground is that w a y ” to which the fan replied "I think it must be you

                   ho is stupid,        I am walking away because I d o n ’t have a ticket."

               This sort of Police attitude seemed to prevail the nearer w*"" got to

  r1'         the ground and to me it seemed to prevail all afterno

               We arrived at the entrance to the turnstile areas
                                                                                    PAGE    2
                                                                                    S2475

            control,    unlike at Anfield no matter the size of the crowd the Police

            always have control.

            We experienced difficulty in getting to the turnstile as already a lot

            of pushing was going on and people were complaining about the crush.

            Once we were in our seats we noticed that no one seemed to entering

            the extremities of the Lepping Ln stand but were coming in via the
             (JL
 ,   ^      Centre.

         1 “^Already peo/Tl.e were trying to get over the fencino^dTnto the almost

            uno c cupi ed( ext r emi t i es and also were being puj/fed up to the stand

            above.

            The time was now about Jg.45     1445 and even though we were towards the

            Kop end it was obvious/to us that there was a problem and my friend

             commented that the start should be delayed.

            Why,    one asks was this not apparent to the Police who were a lot

             closer than we were and one     presumes had close circuit TV to assist

             them in monitoring what was     going on.

            However,    to our surprise the match started on time and people were


KSV'        still    trying to get into the almost empty extremities only in much

             larger numbers now.

            When eventually the game was stopped the Police         inside the ground

            moved in mass to the Lepping Ln and seemed to act as though the pitch

            was being invaded,     this opinion was   confirmed about 5 minutes     later

            when some 60 or so extra Police      came into the playing area from the

            entrance beside the Kop and were immediately dispersed to take up

            positions    in front of the West Stand just as though the spectators

            there were going to invade the pitch.

            They were told in no uncertain manner that they were needed at the

            Lepping Ln end of the ground,     to help the spectators who by now were

            beginning to spill onto the      pitch and some very obviously      in great

            distress and in need of medical attention.
                                                                                 PAGE       3

         Fellow spectators were trying to give the kiss of life to friends

         w h i1e ,P o 1i c e , who I understand are trained in first aid,   just stood by

         watching and not appearing to care.

        Such actions       did not endear the Police to the many people like myself

        who saw what was going on but could not do anything to help.

         My experiences      last Saturday 150489 told me and a lot of others who

         were there that the South Yorkshire Police have a lot of questions to

         answer as to their lack of crowd control,       their apparent     indifference

         as to helping the injured and their general attitude towards the

         s pe ctato rs .

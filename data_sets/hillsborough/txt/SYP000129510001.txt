You can select the mode best
suited to the conditions th a t
you are operating in; whether
inside o r . . ,



...  outside, the mode o f operation
is changed without any fuss




V ersatile
Consider the security organisation. Here, the environment o f the security
o ffice r is constantly changing, as his day-to-day a c tivity takes him from
one w orking situation to another.
A t one mom ent, the ambient noise level calls fo r a telephone hand-set as
the only means o f satisfactory comm unication. PF8 is a telephone hand­
set — b u t it is also a conventional hand-held portable. A nd, in areas where
poor reception m ight otherwise in h ib it clear contact w ith his control, only
operation in the hand-held mode w ill provide an adequate solution. Just as
simply, PF8 is a body-w orn u n it, w ith no external connections — antenna,
microphones and loudspeaker are all integrated.
PF8 is versatility.
Use it as a 'telephone handset'                    Or conventionally in the 'hand-       Or even as a body-worn unit
                                                   held' mode




P ractical
Pocketfone 8 represents more than mere electronic re-design. It results
fro m a careful study o f all the requirements o f the user, fro m the p o in t of
view o f both its efficiency and its practicality.
The result? The perfect blend o f electronic and ergonomic design.
Weighing as little as fifte e n ounces, PF8 can be clipped to the lapel or top
pocket when the situation demands a conventional com m unicator. The
audio level control and press-to-talk switch are both conveniently at hand;
and the ultra-sensitive loudspeaker-microphone is positioned to ensure the
clarity and q u a lity o f sound reproduction so essential to unambiguous
two-way com m unication.
As a telephone handset, to o , PF8 has no equal. For ease o f operation and
the c o m fo rt o f its user, it is shaped to f i t naturally in to either the right
hand or the left. The specially-designed microphone and tw in grille system
in the base allows complete and clear voice pick-up fro m either side.
As a hand-held portable, these same advantages again set PF8 apart from
its contemporaries.
No additional antenna is needed, nor is any earpiece, extra loudspeaker or

                                                The personal radiotelephone o f today is only as good as its d u ra b ility.
                                                This means m axim um re liab ility in the field. A nd it means minim al m ain­

                                                many cases, u n it failure can be remedied simply by substituting one plug­

                                                Its power supplies, too, place PF8 in a class o f its own. Chosen fo r th e ir

Bor the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

Dear Sirs,
                    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
                     Emergency Lighting Installation
         Further to our discussions with Mr. K. Jones, we would
like to set down in detail our proposals for the upgrading of
the emergency lighting facilities at the above Club.
     At present there is a large central battery system
providing 240 volts D.C. which is arranged to serve the West
and South Stands, and adjacent areas.   This is achieved by en
automatic changeover on mains failure, from AC mains to the
DC battery supply for those circuits providing the essential
tungsten lighting.      For the North Stand and adjacent areas,
     is available a second YEB supply to act as a back up in
the re
the event of a loss of the normal supply.
     We are proposing at this stage that new emergency circuits
and fittings be installed to serve the Penistone Road exits,
Spion Kop, the North Stand, the North-West Terrace, the West
Stand, the South-West Terrace and the Leppings Lane exit.
The existing normal lighting for the West Stand will be excluded
from the battery load, and the spare battery capacity made
available will serve the new emergency installation.
     The duration of the battery supply will be substantially
unchanged by this redistribution of load, and will give more
than adequate time for clearing the ground.   As these are
existing grounds, we would not recommend to the Club that
their installations should comply in all respects with the
standards set for new premises, especially as the 3-hour
duratIon recommended for emergency battery capacity is quite
inappropriate to the particular needs of safety.
     We are not proposing at this stage to recommend improvements
to the South Stand emergency lighting.   Subject to approval,
we would suggest that the system be reviewed when the time
comes for replacement of the central battery.   At this time
the load reduction which could be achieved with a new emergency
lighting layout would permit a considerable saving in the battery
replacement cost, and this would offset the cost to the Club of
the new emergency lighting installation.
     We are enclosing a set of drawings corresponding to
these proposals (1610/101 to 106) for which we are now seeking
tenders.   We would look forward to your comments and suggest
that it may be appropriate to arrange a meeting with the Fire
Prevent lion Officers concerned if further discussions are required.
     We would also wish to have their comments on the proposed
locations for the Fire Alarm call points shown on the drawings.

                                   Yours faithfully,

     Dear Sir,

     Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

     I have now received the detailed comments of all of the disciplines
     represented on the Working Party.

     These have been collated into the attached schedule which, together with
     plans, confirm formally in writing the matters discussed by the Working
     Party with the Club over the series of meetings held so far and which
     the County Council feel require attention so as to secure reasonable
     safety at the Ground.

     They are, of course, Individual requirements on specific matters and are
     additional to the general requirements set out in the specimen form of
     General Safety Certificate forwarded to the Club with my letter of
     8 th December, 1978, and discussed at the meeting held on 13th December,

     1978.

     After the Club has bad the opportunity of considering the schedule, perhaps
     you would let me know which of the requirements you feel will be able to
     be carried out in the close season.

      Should you have any queries, Mr. D. Vaughan of my staff (ext. 422) would
      be happy to discuss them with you.

                                               Yours faithfully,




                                               Chief Executive

             Examination and Testing of the Electrical Installation

          The South Yorkshire County Council have indicated that the
 electrical installation must comply with the standards required by
 the Institution of Electrical Engineers for the issue of an Inspection
 Certificate.                         To establish compliance inspection and tests will be
 required as follows:-


 1.          Visual Examination
                    All equipment and cabling must be examined visually so
             far as is practical.                                                   This will require removal of access
             panels, but need not involve dismantling or examination of
             cabling which is inaccessible.                                                   Such cabling and equipment
          would be assessed on the basis of the electrical tests
             described below.                                      The visual examination should reveal no
             evidence of significant physical damage or any likely
             possibility of this occurring.


 2.          Polarity Checks
                    Every appliance or motor and every socket outlet must
             be checked for correct polarity of connections, and every




                                                                     Registered in England - No. 1134531
EASTW OOD Er PARTNERS




       single-pole control device or fuse verified to be
       connected in the live conductor only.


  3.   Earth Continuity
              A separate test of every earth-continuity conductor
        is required to establish that the impedance measured
        from each appliance or fitting to the consumers earthing
       point does not exceed the appropriate value.


  4.   Earth Loop Impedance
              To establish that an earth fault will cause a
        sufficiently high current flow to operate fuses or
       circuit-breakers, an "earth-loop impedance" test is
       required for each sub-circuit or fitting.


  5.   Insulation Test
              Each circuit must be tested as part of a group
       containing at least fifty outlets to a voltage not less
        than 500 volts d.c., and the insulation resistance under
        the specified conditions must not be less than one megohm.


  6.   Ring Circuit Continuity
              A check is required to ensure that all the conductors
       of any ring circuits are continuous.     This will normally
       require each conductor of the ring to be 'broken' and
       reconnected.
                                  T




  7.   Circuit Loadings
              The highest likely circuit loads must be assessed and
       a check made to ensure that this is within the capacity of
        the appropriate cables and fuses.     The loading may be
       assessed from a knowledge of all the appliances and fittings
                                                                 SHEET

         which are likely to be in use together, or if more
         convenient by measurement of currents in each circuit
         during a period of maximum demand.


         The above tests will require a full knowledge of the
   installation and the rating of all equipment and cables.
   Unfortunately, it appears that the Club do not pxj^ss any
   drawings of the electrical installation.
         We have been in touch with Mr. Bownes of Bownes & C o . , who
   has a certain number of relevant drawings in his possession but
   none at all relating to the South Stand installation.    If we are
   not able to locate a sufficiently complete set of drawings it
   will be necessary to do an electrical survey to establish the
   arrangement and ratings of the various circuits and appliances.

 Dear Sirs,
                                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                                       Emergency Lighting Distribution

              Tenders are invited for an emergency lighting installation
 at the above site in accordance with the enclosed Specification
 and Drawings (1610/101-106 inclusive).
              Due to the nature of the work it is essential that all Tenderers
 visit the site and arrangements for this purpose should be made with
 ourselves.                 The contract will be in accordance with the General
 Conditions of Contract as issued by the Institution of Electrical
 Engineers and will be placed direct by the client, Sheffield
 Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
              Tenders are to be fixed price, including for all cost
 increases up to the agreed completion date.                                                              The work is intended
 for an immediate start and completion is required by 16 November 1979.
 The Contractor shall allow for interruption of his work which may

 to reach this office not later than noon on Monday 1 October 1979.


                                                                                           Yours faithfully,




                                                                    Registered in England - No. 1134531
                            SPECIFICATION FOR

                       EMERGENCY LIGHTING DISTRIBUTION

                    AT SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB.


1*    description
1-1        To meet the current standards required by the Safety of
      Sports Grounds Acts 1975, modifications and extensions are
      required to the existing emergency lighting system at the above
      grounds.

1-2       At present there is a large central battery system
      providing 240 volts D.C., which is arranged to serve the West
      and South Stands and adjacent     areas.    This is achieved by an
      automatic changeover on mains     failure from AC mains to the
      D.C. battery supply for those circuits providing the essential
      tungsten lighting.     For the North Stand and adjacent areas there
      is available a second YEB supply to act as a back up in the
      event of a loss of the normal     supply.

1*3        The certifying authority     now requires a separate system
      of emergency lights independant of the normal lighting.        It is
      proposed at this stage to install new emergency circuits and
      fittings to serve the Penistone Road exits, Spion Kop, North
      Stand, North-West Terrace, West Stand, South West Terrace and
      the Leppings Lane exit.     The existing normal lighting for the
      West Stand will be excluded from the battery load and the spare
      battery capacity made available will serve the new emergency
      installation.

1.4       The new emergency system will be in accordance with this
      specification and the drawings listed below.

      1610/101      Emergency Lighting - Site Floodlight Pattern
      1610/102      Emergency Lighting - North Stand, Access Areas
      1610/103      Emergency Lighting - North Stand, Seating Area
      1610/104      Emergency Lighting - North & West Stand Sections
      1610/105      Emergency Lighting - West Stand
      1610/106      Emergency Lighting - Circuit Schematic

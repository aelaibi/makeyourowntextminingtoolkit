          (Between these times I noticed a large number of Nottingham forest

          fans drinking outside the Owl Public House on Nee psend Lane,                     they

          numbered a p p r o x .   70” 100 at 11.00am (1100) and steadily increased as

          the kick off time approached.)

          A number of Nottingham Forest supporters were leaving this pub in a

          drunk state and they were carrying bottles of beer which had been

          supplied at the pub.

          Walked to the ground intending to meet with serial 5 at the Leppings

          Lane end of the ground for duties during the match.

0,    At that time the players were just leaving the field and I saw a

large number of Police officers making the i r way towards the Leppings

Lane end of the ground,       I could see at that time people      coming onto

the pitch from the Leppings Lane terraces.          I remained in my position

between the Kop and North stand and at about 3.10pm          (1510) my

attention was drawn to a Liverpool        supporter who had left his seat

and was stood in the front gangway nearest the Kop end and he was

shouting and waving his arms towards the Notts. Forest supporters.

The Forest supporters near the front        corner could see this youth and

they moved towards the front perimeter fence shouting and making

violent gestures     in return.    I arrested the Liverpool     supporter and

took him to the Police      room at the rear of the North stand.

I then went into the gymnasium to complete paperwork.            At approx.

3 .25pm (15E5) when I was in the gym I saw dead bodies being brought

into the gym and I assisted with laying the bodies          in an orderly line

in the gym and dealing with friends and relatives of the d e a d .

I remember on two occasions during the following 20 minutes having to

forcibly remove men from the gym who were         intent on venting angry

feelings against the Police.

I    then assisted in carrying bodies from behind the North stand in the

gym (1 am unable to remember any descriptions of the bodies moved but

they didn't involve any women or young children).           I then assisted

ambulance    personnel to take a man from the pitch to an a m b u l a n c e .      He

was situated near the Kop end of the ground on the pitch.

1 then assisted in public order on the pitch at about 3,50pm              (1550)

         pitch was of anger against the Police for "Allocating them the

         Leppings Lane end of the ground" when their   level of support was

         twice the size of the Notts- Forest   Following.

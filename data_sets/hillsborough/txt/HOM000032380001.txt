          Dear Clare

          Re: Hillsborough Scrutiny

          Thank you fo r speaking to me this morning and for clarifying your role in Mr
          Straw's office.

          I have spoken to the journalist at the Express and am reasonably satisfied that
          the particular article was speculative. It has, however, served to illustrate the
          need fo r proper dissemination o f information/decisions relating to the
          Scrutiny’s report.

          As I explained, we understand the need fo r progress and yet are prepared to
          be patient, preferring proper deliberation to knee-jerk reaction.

     Please accept this fax as a formal request to Mr Straw that he considers very
     carefully the means o f information dissemination and places the interests of
     the fam ilies very high on the priority list. As I indicated in our conversation, I
     am more than willing to assist, on a confidential basis if necessary, in this
     regard.

 I   In the interests of fair play, could you also advise whether the Family Group
 /   will receive a copy o f the report at the same tim e as the South Yorkshire
      Police.

     Finally, I would advise that myself and the HFSG committee are scheduled to
     meet Liverpool’s MP’s at the House o f Commons on the evening o f the 16th
     February 1998. This meeting is to update them of the Family Group’s position,
     intentions etc., and is something we have been trying to arrange since
     Christmas. It may/may not be useful to any “communication” programme you
     need to plan.

     Regards




     Trevor Hicks
     Chairman

12.8.97



Dear Lord Justice Stewar t Smith

We would like a new inqui ry into the tragic

events    of that dayi fâ€™DrfisB'srBP&lruaasians .

We lost our only son Paul who was           just 14.

I almost lost my life also,I         suppose     some

would call me lu cky .T her e was little or

no evidence of us available.

At the mini      inquests we were not allowed

to ask any contro ve rs ia l   q u e s t i o n s ,therefore

we were not allowed to qu estion any medical

evidence.

The 3.15pm cut off time.

Why a fleet of am bulances       and trained medical

teams were not allowed onto the pitch and

also why the Victims were not taken to

hosp i t a l .

Why reserve      squads of police were not used.

Why were the vitims      the only ones to be tested
for alcohol levels.

A lot of une ss en ti al wi tnesses were used to try

to emphasize the amount of alcohol            consumed.

Whe ne ve r senior police officers were asked

imp ortant questions      they were told by the

Coroner that they were not abliged to answer.

How can anyone     find out what hap pen ed when this

is s o .

I also think the Coroner was wrong to tell the

Jury that he would only accept a unanimous

verdi ct and that after the Jury had been out for

two days change his mind and tell            them he would

accept a ma jority vote.

A bi rthday treat should not end in tragedy.

Many lies were p ri nt ed about the tragic             events

of that day which the public          still believe to

be true.We just want the true facts out in the

open.In other words we want Justice.

My wife attended 60 days of the inquest

tr ave lli ng to Sh ef fie ld by train or bus          each

week.As    one of the Legal Rep re se nt at iv es       of

the police    said to her a f t e r w a r d s ,"This   should

never have takein place        in this court"

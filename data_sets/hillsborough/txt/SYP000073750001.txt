               I arrived            at    the a p p r o a c h         to    the L e p p i n g s      Lane      e nd    of    the H i l Isfaor ough

               Stadium         at     1425      h ou r s .     I wa s       accompanied             by m y £ 7 y e a r        old       son a n d a

               young       man      of    17.        We    all      had a v ali d          ground        ticket.            The    immediate

               approach          to      the    turnstiles             a distance             of    some      70 yards,           was    full       of

               a     jostling         crowd      of       Ii ckeI      hoIders          trying       to m a k e       their       way    to    the

               turnstiles.                There       wa s     no     semblence          of    orderly         q u e u e s , with        some       k in d

               Despite         the       lack    of       organisation and                 frustration,               the    mood       of    the    fans

               remained          reasonably               co-operative.                  To    emphasise            this,     one       of    the

               horses         was     very      close        to me         and a c c i d e n t a l l y     almost       knocked my

               spectacles             off.       The       officer          apologised             and   we   exchanged            smiles       and      I

               stroked         the       h o r s e ’s nose.

literally            catapulted                through          the    turnstiles.                  Over        the       last      ten yards

one      had    no     control            whatsoever              o ver        our     movements.               Once       through            the

turnstile            all       three          of m y    party         came        together.              My

son a t t e m p t e d          to    remonstrate                with       a    police        officer           regarding               the _1a c !•••:

of    organisation                  on    the       approach          to       the     turnstile.               He was         warned             by a

steward         standing             alongside             the     officer             to    keep       quiet       because             other

f a ns    who     had made               similar        protests               had     been       forcibly          ejected             from       the

ground.

We    then moved               away and             went     to    use         the     toilet       situated              in f r o n t        of    us

under      the       s tan d .           As    we    came       out    of       the     toilet          we    were        directly            facing

the      rear     of      the       turnstile           area       and         were     immediately                aware       of       the

opening         of     one      of       the    gates        alongi.de            the       turnstiles.                 The    time          was    now

Just      after        144G         hours.           Anticipating                 the       ensuing          rush       I t ook         my

companions             to      the       right,        aiming         to       t ake    our       place       high        up on the

terracing            to     the      left       of     the      Leppings             Road     Stand          fa c i n g     the     playing

area.          The     jjrevious              year's       experience                had ale rte d            me    that       this          was    a

sensible          a rea        to    s t a n d , both           f r om a s a f e t y          view       po int         and    it also

provided          an      excellent             view.           I have          a vivid mental                  pi c t u r e ,      as we

hurried         past        the      now       infamous           tunnel          leading          to    the       ill-fated

sections,            of     turning            my    head and          noticing              there       was       nobody          to    be       seen,

either         spectator             or       official.

The      high     up a r e a         we       entered        was      very        full,       but       with       no     crush.             We

positioned             ourselves               within        f eet     of       the     blue       boards.              Looking          down

from      my    high        vantage            s pot    I could            see       the     two midcl 1 e pens                :i.mmediateIy

empty.          The       area       on       the    far     r i ght       around           the   electronic               scoreboard               was

attention            then       became          diverted           when         the     Liverpool             team        t oo k    to       the

same       time       I was       conscious                of a f e w        people         entering            our      section       behind

and      alongside           me.           There         was     no    lar g e      influx         just, b e f o r e       the       kick     off

where         I was        standing.

The      game       had     been       in       progress          for       some       five       minutes          with Liverpool

pressing            home     an       attack          at    the       far    end,        with      a    corner        followed         by a

shot       which       hit       the       woodwork.              I believe              t h is    shot       to    be    significant

because          it m e a n t         a tremendous                surge          down      the     pens       behind       the L i v e r p o o l

g o al     to    try a n d        see           w h a t was       happening.               This        is the      norm a l      reaction

on    the       terracing             at        any      football           match.         From        my va nt a ge       point       I was

then       immediately                aware        of      fans       trying        to     come        over     the      metal       fence

behind          the    goal.           Some        had      been       successful               and were           being      led d o w n        the

touch!ine             by    the       Police .             Others       were        being         stopped          climbing          out    of

the      pens       despite           their        obvious            protests.

At    the       same       time       a Senior             Police       Officer            ran f r o m        behind       the       Liverpool

8y    t hi s     time      a few more                 fans       had man aged              to     escape        from      the    pens.           One

fan      on     the    field          of        play ap p ea re d           to     be p l e a d i n g        whilst       he was       being

forcibly            led     to    the           s i d e of     the     p l a y i n g are a .

Behind          the    goal       the       two       pens w e r e          a seething             mass       of    people       with

A    few      people       were        being          passed          from       the     back      of    the       pens    to    the       front.

The      front        of   the        pens        next      to    the       fence        seemed         to    be    flat    without          the

Within          two    minutes             of     the      teams       leaving           the      field       I realised             something

was      very wrong.                  On    reflection,                I have          come       to    the     conclusion            that    my

alarm         was     confirmed             due       to a       combination               of     medical          experience

combined            with     an       intimate             knowledge             of y e a r s      of a t t e n d a n c e       at    football

matches          on    the       terracing.

I quickly             realised                t h at    help would             be    required, on                the      pitch.           I

informed             my    son what                I was      doing       and       because          I was          so    close       to       the

entrance             to    the       terracing               I. h a d    entered,             I quickly             made       my way          down

the    stairs             to    find          a Steward            to    get    me       to    the       s ide      of    the    pitch.

I quickly             f o u n d a S t e w a r d who                accepted              what       I was        telling         him a nd            he

took       me    through             a    tunnel         under          the    main          stand,       where          a Police          Officer

again       accepted             my       explanation               of    being          a    trained          nurse       and       let       me    on

to    the       pitch.

I raced          to       the    area           immediately              behind          the    goal       net.           The    narrow             gate

belonging             to       the       pen       behind       the      net    was          open,with Police                   Of f i cers

trying          to    pull       flaying               bodies       through          the       narrow          opening.

Other       Officers             appeared               to    be    trying          to       instruct          the       fans    to    push          back

in th e         pens.

I helped             Officers             pull         people       through          the       g a t e.        ye     were      pulling             any

part       of    their          body          we    could       get      hold       of.

On    reflection                I realise               now     because         their          bodies          were       level       with          the

bottom          of    the       gate          t hat     they must             have       been       lyi ng       on      top    of    people,

because          the       gap       between            the     bottom         of    the       gate       to     the      floor       of       the

terracing             was       some          three      feet.

The    first          casualties                   I helped         pull       through          the       gate        were      conscious,

but    very          shocked.                 I attended            to    t h e m at          the    back        of      the    goalmouth             on

the    n e11 ing .              The i r r e c o v e r y w a s             c o m p a r a t i ve 1 y        qui ck a n d          sin'ip 1 e w e r e

moved       away          from       the       immediate            a r ea.         Very       quickly           I was         aware       t hat      we

were       pulling             out       unconscious               bodies.           i can          next       recal l         working             on a

young       m a n who           once          he   was       conscious          seemed          to       have       c h es t    injuries.                 I

looked          around          the       goal         mouth       for    a    stetcher             or    something             to    remove          him

to a       p l ace        for    him          to   get       treatment.

The    scene          around             me    remained            completely                chaotic,          with       everyone             trying

eventually                found          a stretcher               lying       on the          pitch with                which       I quickly

 officers               to    h e l p me          lift     the      patient            on      to     the      stretcher.               By    this

time        he was            complaining                 about        the      pain        in his          chest.           We    quickly             made

our        way      to       the       corner        of    the      field         between             the      main        stand    the       Kop and

took        the        young           man     behind         the      stand         to     the             Johns         Ambulance           room.              I
                                                                                                         ....                                           N.
 then        ra n       b ack      on     to      the     field        to    the       goal         mouth.           In that        sho r t

 interval               of    t i me     a     lot      more      bodies          were         lying        behind          the    goal.

People,             of all             descriptions,                were a tt em p t i n g                m o u t h to m o u t h

resuscitation                      and       cardiac          massage.               On     the       right        hand      side       of    the       goal

 net       a young            girl        wa s     being f o r k e d            on     by a m a n           w ho     stated        he wa s         a

surgeon.                 1 moved             to    the     body        n e xt     in      line        and      worked with              a young

 police           officer              u n til     the     patient           appeared               to    be    starting           to    come          r o und

 I then mo ve d                   on    to     the      n ex t    person who                was       lying        unconscious               and

 unattended                  in    the       goalmouth.              I was        working             alone        in this         instance,

giving            both m ou th               to m o u t h        and    cardiac             massage,            an    impossible              and

 hopeless               situation.                 The     patient           started             vomiting            to     complicate             the

 issue .            I     was       conscious             of a n        elderly           white          h a i r e d St     John Ambulance

ji~ia n    w o r k i n g a 3.o n g s i d e m e .                 I requested                s om e       swabs       to     clear

an        airway,            all       that       was     forthcoming                was     a dry          sponge.           By    this       t i me        it

was        after          15 3 0       hours       and     we     st ill        had       no     e q u i p m e n t of       any    sort       to        work

with.             It      was       just         after        that      that       I was            c o n s c i o u s of    the    first

ambulances                   beginning             to m a k e       their         way       on      to    the      p i t ch .      Eventually                I

 realised               t hat      I had          lost     the      battle           for     t his        young       mans        life.        I

 looked aro un d                   but       I could          not      see      any more              unattended             bodies.

At        t hat     time          our     ranks         had      been       swelled          by a m b u l a n c e          crews        and    firemen

w i t h s o rne o x y g e n .

 I. ne xt         left        the       field        making         my way           behind           the      main       stand     to       the

gyntnas 1 urn, w h e r e                  I understood                 s ome      of      the       injured          were     being          taken.

Again         I found another                        scene        of    chaos.              The       only      entrance           to    the       gym

was        a d oor           of    similar           dimensions              to      t hat       found         in a n y      household             room.

                                                                                                                                    S1801

Directly           outside        this       door       was     the St         Johns        Ambulance             room,       the    space

was    becoming            jammed        full      of    people          with     comparatively                   minor       injuries.

The    area        was     also     rapidly           filling         with       people          presumed          dead.

I next       assisted            police        to m a k e       some      sort        of    pathway          to    the    door       of    the

gym    by    he I pi ng a n d o r g a n i s i n g             the m o v e m e n t          of    both       the    prospective

dead     and        the    seriously           i n j u r ed.        Inside        the       gymnasium             the    space       was

roughly        divided           i nto      two,      half      for      the     dead       and       the    rest       for    the

1 iv i n g , w i t h       tables        set     up     to    interview           the       relatives.                 I began       to

work     with        the    injured          in the          g ym nasi urn a t a r o u n d 1 5 5 5 h o u r s .                     I was

conscious            of a r o u n d      three        doctors         in a t t e n d a n c e ?         but w h e n       I arrived

there       was      still       no m e d i c a l       equipment           of a n y        sort.           One    doctor          shouted

across        the     gym     for      some      drugs        to    treat        an    injured          fan w h o        was

in    obvious         pain.         There       was      nothing          available              so    I volunteered                to    go

to    the    St      Johns       Ambulance            room.         I was        informed             that       they    were       not

allowed        to     carry any             d rug s .

1 rushed            back    to    the       gym asking             some     Senior          Police          Officer       on       the    way

if    they     could        obtain          some      equipment           for     us.           Quickly,          three       sm all

plastic            boxes    -jr r i v e d    with       medical          e q u i p m e n t , plus           an    emergency          case

with     drugs        in    it.

I began            passing       out     the    meagre          items       of    equipment             to       the    doctors

present.             There       were       s t ill     only       roughly a dozen                    injured          in the       area.

I prepared            ten     intravenous               li nes      ready        for       the    medical          officer          to    set

up a n d we          commandeered              police         officers           to    hold       the       I.V.       packs       because

we    had    no      stands       to     attach         them       to.     By     then          some    semblence             of    order

was    being        maintained              in the       part       of    the     gymnasium             given          over    to    the

i n j u r e d ,,

The    other         side    of     the      gymnasium             was    rapidly           filling          with       the    presumed

dead.

One    of    the      doctors          present          had     taken       one       of    three       stethoscopes

available            to    enable        him    to      declare          them     clinically                dead.

I next       tidied          up    the    medical              equipment               as     most     of    the     injured         were

being    rapidly             removed          to    hospital,

I then       began       to       realise          the       full       extent           of    the     disaster,           for      there

were    already          o ve r      fifty         bodies          l y ing        on     the     flo o r .      My    f i nal       act     in

this    carnage          was       to     comfort            and       stay       with        th e    husband        of    the y o u n g

girl    whom       I had          seen a ttended                  to        behind          the goal.          At     l e a st      I knew       she

had    had    the jbest            of a t t e n t i o n           t h at     had       been      a v a i l a b l e in the

c ir c umstances.

I stayed       with          him whilst             he       gave           the     necessary           details           to    the police,

and    then    a    local          vicar        took         over           f r o m me.

When    1 left          the       gymnasium,                to m y a m a z e m e n t           it was        st ill       only       1645

hours.        The       longest           hour      a n d a h alf              of m y         life.




PERSONAL       QBSERVATION-S




1.     Comparsion             of     the      organisation                    with       the     previous           y e ar.         The

previous       year          I arrived             at       the    same        area         of a d m i s s i o n     at    1450

hours    with       my       daughter.              Before             we     reached          the     turnstiles              at L e p p i n g s

Lane    we    had       to    go    through             a    police          filter           system        whereby        it was

ascertained             tha t      we     did      have        the      appropriate                  match     tickets.             This     y ear

no    such    system          was       set     up,



S.     Both    years          I was        delayed             because            of     travelling            difficulties.                 The

appropriate             authorities                had       decided           to      i n i t i a t roadworks                 on   the     M62

to    commence          around          a week          before          each        game.            Surely     the       matches          could

have    been       taken          i nto    consideration                     when        setting        up t h e s e       roadworks.

by a    line       of    stewards             and       police          officers              who     gently       but     firmly

prevented          us    from       entering                the    t un n e l       to      'the m i d d l e    sections.                 It had

                                                                                                                              SI 801

been    decided         that       these        sections           were     already          full    to       capacity.         Thi s

year     no    such     precaution              was    in o p e r a t i o n .




4.     I can        understand            the       police     officers           at    the       turnstiles          wishing        to

open     the    gates        to    relieve           pressure         and avoid           injury         to    life    or     limb,

but    in t h e s e     days       of     ultra modern               and    sophisticated                personal

communications,                surely          it    could     h av e      been    done       in    conjunction             with

their     central         police          control        a rea at          the    side       of    the    electronic

score b o a r d .




5.     Very     recent         national             publicity         has    assured          us    t hat      surveillance

cameras        at    football           grounds        means         that    any       problems          can be       dealt     with

within        two    minutes         of      their     occurrence.

Surely        with     the p o l i c e         central        control        post       w ith      its    battery        of TV

monitors        available,              they        should     have        been able          to a s c e r t a i n     the     need

to    close     the m i d d l e         sections         when        they    became          full.




6.     Observing          from       the       outside        it a p p e a r s     to     h av e    taken       far    too     long

for    the a u t h o r i t i e s        to     decide        t hat    it w a s     n ot      a s ecu r i ty      p r o b 1em a n d

that     the    f ans     genuinely             needed        help.         Working          with    and al o ng si de          the

individual           police        officers           in the         immediate          disaster          area,       I have

tremendous           praise        and       admiration            for     their       efforts.           Overall        at    the

scene ,       however,         there         appeared         to     be a    lack       of    co- or dination and

genuine        leadership.




7.     For     an    extremely            long       t ime    we w e r e     without          any    form       of m e d i c a l

equipment           of a n y      description.                I still        cannot          understand          why     the    local

H e a l t h A u t h o r i t y ’s M a j o r          Medical        Disaster        Te am was         not       called       upon.      I.

understand           t hat     all      Health        Authorities            in t h i s       country         have     a major

disaster        polic y.           It     is    impossible            to a c c u r a t e l y       estimate        the
                                                                                                                PAGE    9

             difference         this      would   have    made    in s a v i n g   life.     I do,   however,

             believe        t hat   the    Liverpool      fan s   should     have    been    given   the   chance

            S t a d ium at        1 42 5    hours       I wa s      accompanied             by m y 2 7 y e a r       old       son and a

            young     man      of    17.         We    all   had a valid            ground       ticket,          the    immediate

            approach         to     the     t urnstiley a            distance          of    some    70 y a r d s , was             full       of

            turnstiles.              There        was     no s e m b l e n c e    of    orderly        q u e u e s , with           some       kind

            of    order      trying         to    be m a i n t a i n e d    by t h r e e      mounted          polj/ce o f f i c e r s .

            Despite        the      lack     of       org anisation and             frustration,               the m o o d      of       the    fans

            remained         reasonably               co-operative.               To    emphasise          this,        one     of       the

            horses was            very      close       to me a n d a c c i d e n t a l l y a l m o s t           k n o c k e d my

  became        severe.           After        approximately                ten minutes              al l      three      of     us      were

  literally           catapulted              through          the    t u r n s t i l e s . ^ Over          the      last      ten yards

  one     had    no    control             whatsoever           over       our     movements.               Once      through            the

  t u r n s t i le all       three          of m y    party          came       together.            My

 son attempted               to       remonstrate              with a       police          officer         regarding            the       lack

  of     organisation             on       the a p p r o a c h       to    th e    turnstile.               He w a s      w a r n e d by a

  steward        standing alongside                       the    officer           to     keep      quiet       because          other

  fans     who    had made             similar        protests             had     been       forcibly          ejected          from         the

'^ground.

 /We t h e n m o v e d a w a y a n d               went    to use          the     toilet        situated            in f r o n t        of    us

’ under     the       s t a n d as we          came       out    of       the     toilet       we w e r e       directly            facing

  t he    rear    of       the    turnstile           area and were                   immediately aware                   of     the

  opening        of    one       of    the     gates       alongide             the     t u r n s t i l e s.        The   time        was      no w

  just after           1440 hours.                  Anticipating                the     ensuing        rush         I took       my

  companions           to    the       right,        aiming          to    take       our     place       high       u p on      the

  t e r r a c i n g to      the       left     of    the L e p p i n g s          Road Stand           facing         the      playing

 area.          The    previous             year's        experience              had a l e r t e d       me    that      this was             a

  sensible        area       to       st a n d ,    both       from a safety                view     point a n d          it a l s o

  provided an              excellent           view.           I have a v ivid menta l                      picture,           as we

  hurried        past       the       now     infamous          t u n n e 1 leading            to    the       ill-fated

  sections,           of    turning          my     head and          noticing           there       was       nobody       to      be     seen,

  either        spectator             or    official.

'The      high    up a r e a we             entered        was       very       full,       but w i t h        no    crush.           We

  positioned           ourselves              within       f e et     of    th e      blue     boards.              Looking         down

  from     my    high       vantage           spot    I could             see     the     two m i d d l e       pens      immediately

  behind        the    goal       were        jammed       to    capacity with a seething mass                                   of

  people.         To m y s u r p r i s e            the    pens       on the          left a n d       right         were      half

  empty.         The       area       on    the     far    right a r o u n d            the    electronic             scoreboard               was

  attention           then       became        diverted          when       the L i v e r p o o l         team       took      to     t he

       same       time       I wa s      conscious             of a f e w          people          entering         our      section        behind

      and alongside                 me.        There          was     no     large       influx       just        before        the     kick      off

      The     game       had       been       in    progress            for      some     five       minutes           with Liverpool

       pressing          home an a tt a ck                at     t he      far     end,       with a       corner         followed          by a

       shot       which       hit      the w o o d w o r k .            I believe             this    shot        to    be     significent

     >/because          it m e a n t      a tremendous                  surge       down       the    pens        behind        the L i v e r p o o l

      on the           terracing          at a n y        football            match.           From my          vantage         poirvjf I w a s

        ehind          the    goal.           Some       had     been        successful             and were           bi^i nc # Use     firat»             ^

      away        from       the    immediate             area.            Very     quickly          I was        aware        that     we w e r e

       pulling          out      unconscious              bodies.             I can n e x t          recall         working        on a y o u n g

      man     who       on c e     he w a s        conscious            seemed       to       have    chest         injuries.            I looked

      around           the    goal       mouth       for       a stetcher            or       something           to    remove        him       to a

       place       for       him    to    get       treatment.

      The     s c e n e a r o u n d me             remained           completely              chaotic,          with      everyone          trying

       to    do    their         own     thi n g ,       fans and            police       all       mingling           together.            I

       eventually             found a stretcher                       lyi n g      on the          pitch with which                I quickly

       returned          to      the     inju re d man.                 I literally                ordered        three        police

              issue.           I was        conscious             of a n         elderly white               h a i r e d St J o h n A m b u l a n c e

              man    working             alongside              me.     I requested               some       swabs        to    clear

              an airway,             al l    that was             forthcoming              wa s      a dry        sponge.         By    this          time       it

              was    after          ,1530 h o u r s         a n d we        still       had     no     equipment           of a n y     sort          to w o r k

              with.        It w a s         just a ft er              that       that    I was         conscious           of    the    first

              a m b u l a n c e s beginning                 to m a k e       their       way      on    to     the    pitch.           Eventually                I

              realised          that        I had       lost          the    battle        for       this      young       mans     life.             I

              looked around                 but    I could             not       see a n y m o r e         unattended            bodies          led       down

              the    touchline              by t h e        po l i c e .         Others       were      being        stopped        climbing               out

              of    the   pens           despite        their          obvious          protests.            At     the    same     time a            senior

    ^         police      o f f i c e r ran f r o m               behind         the L i v e r p o o l        goal        and a pp ro ac he d              the

              referee.              He    immediately                 stopped        the      g a me,      ta k i n g b o t h t e a m s      off           the

              pitch.           By    this        time       a    fe w m o r e       fans      had m a n a g e d       to       escape       from          the

              pens.       One        f a n on the               field       of    play a p p e a r e d         to    be    pleading          whilst             he

              was    being          forcibly           led to          the       side    of     the     playing           area.        Behind             the

              goal     the      two       pens w e r e           a seething mass                  of    people        with       little          or       no

              movement          either           backwards             or    forwards.               A few        people        were    being             passed

              from     the      back        of    the       pens       to    the     fr o n t .        The     front       of    the    pens          next       to

              the    fence          seemed        to    be f l a t w i t h o u t           the       usual        bobbing        he ad s .

              Within      two m i n u t e s            of       the    teams        leaving          the     field        I realised             something

was     very wrong.                 On     reflection             I have          come     to     the    conclusion                that       my

alarm      was       confirmed             due      to a     combination                of m e d i c a l      experience

combined with an                     intimate            knowledge           of y e a r s       of a t t e n d a n c e        at    football

matches        on the           terracing.

(|L q u i c k l y    realised            that       help would              be    required         on the          pitch.           I

informed            my    son what            I was       doing and              because        I wa s      so     c l o se    to       the

entrance            to    the       terracing            I ha d e n t e r e d ,         I quickly made                  my way          down

the     stairs           to    find a Steward                to       get    me    to    the      side      of     the    pit c h .           I

quickly        found a S t e w a r d who                   accepted what                 I was       telling            him a nd         he

took     me    though a tunnel                      under        the m a i n       st a n d ,     where a          police          officer

a g a i n a c c e p t e d my          explanation                of    being       a trained            nurse a nd            let       me    on_

to    the p i t c h .

I raced        to        the a r e a       immediately                behind       the     goal      net.          The    narrow             gate

belonging            to       the    pen      behind        the       net w a s     open with            police          officers

trying        to     pul 1 f l a y i n g           bodies        through          the    narrow         opening.              Other

officers            appeared          to      be    tryijT^j/to         instruct           the     f an s     to    push       back          in

the     pens.            I helped          officers          pull       people          through         the      gate.         We w e r e

pulling        any        part      of     their         b o d y we     could       get     hold        of.        On    reflection                I

realise        now        because          their         bodies        were       level     with        the      bottom        of       the

gate     that        they must             have      been        lying       on t o p      of     people,          because          the       gap

between        the        bottom         of    the       gate     to    the       floor      of    the      terracing              was       some

three      feet.

At    that     time           our    ranks         had    been        swelled       by a m b u l a n c e         c r e w s a nd         firemen

with     some        ox y g e n .

I next        left        the       field making             my way          behind        the m a i n s t a n d          to       the

gy mn a s i u r n , w h e r e        I understood                some       of    the    injured were               being          taken.

Again       I found another                    scene        of    chaos.           The     only      entrance            to    the       gym

was    a door            of s i m i l a r      dimensions              to    that       found      in a n y        household             room.

Directly            outside          this      door       w as    the St J o h n s           Ambulance             room,       the       space

was     becoming              jammed       full      of     people with              comparatively minor                       injuries.

                                                                                                                                             S1801

    The     area       was       also      rapidly             filling         with     people         presumed            dead.

    I next        assisted              police         to m a k e        some     sort     of     pathway            to    the       door       of       the

    gym     by h e l p i n g a n d             organising             the m o v e m e n t        of    both       the      prospective

    dead and           the       seriously             i n j u r e d.       Inside       the      gymnasium               the    space          was

    roughly           divided           into        two,       half      for     the    dead and            the      rest       for     the

    living,           with       tables         se t      up    to    interview          the      relatives.                I began             to

    work     with          the    injured            in the          gymnasium a t around                     1555 hours.                  I wa s

    conscious              of a r o u n d       three          doctors         in a t t e n d a n c e ,       but w h e n        I arrived

    there        was       sti l l      no m e d i c a l        equipment           of a n y      sort.           One      doctor          shouted

    across        the       gym      for       some       drugs       to    treat an          injured          f a n who         wa s

    in o b v i o u s        pain.          There          was     nothing         available            so     I volunteered                  to go

    to     t he St J o h n s            Ambulance              room.        I wa s      informed            that       they were             not

    allowed           to    carry a ny              drugs       in    it.        I began         passing          out      the m e a g r e

    items        of    equipment               to    the       doctors         present.           There        were        still        only

    roughly a dozen                     injured           in the a r e a .             I prepared             te n     intravenous                lin e s

    ready        for       the m e d i c a l         officer          to    set     up a n d      we     commandeered                 police

    officers           to       hold     the        I.V.       p a cks     because       we      had     no    stands           to a t t a c h

    them     to.           By    then      some        semblence            of    order       was      being ma int ai ne d                  in the

    part     of       the       gymnasium            given        over      to    the    injured.              The        other       side        of

    t he    g y m n a s i u m was          rapidly             filling         with     the      presumed            dead.           One     of      the

    doctors           present           ha d    taken          one    of    three       stethoscopes                 availble           to      enable

    him     to d e c l a r e         them       clinically               dead.         I next         tidied         up the          medical

    equipment              as m o s t      of       the    injured were                being      rapidly            removed          to

    hospital .              I then         began          to    realise          the    full      extent          of      the    disaster,

    for     there          were alr ead y              over       fifty        bodies      lying         on the           floor.           My     f i nal

    act     in t h is           carnage         was       to    comfort and             stay with             the      husand         of     the

    young        girl       whom        I had        seen attended                to    behind         the     goal.            At    least          I

    knew      she      had       ha d    the        best       of a t t e n t i o n     t h at    ha d      been available                   in the

    circumstances.                      I stayed with                 him w hi ls t        he     gave        the      necessary             details

PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS




1.     Comparsion            of    the     organisati on with                  the     previous          year.           Th e

previous       year         I arrived          at    the      same     area     of a d m i s s i o n at            1 450

hours     w ith my daughter.                       Before      we    reached          the    turnstiles             at L e p p i n g s

Lane    we    had      to    go t h r o u g h a          police      filter       system whereby                   it w a s

ascertained            t ha t we        did    have       the a p p r o p r i a t e     match        tickets.              This      year

no    such    s y s tem was         se t      up.

2.     Both years            I was       delayed          because       of     travelling            difficulties.                   Th e

appropriate            authorities             had       decided       to    initiate            roadworks          on the M 6 2

to    commence         around a week                before       each       g a me.     Surely          the m a t c h e s        could

have    been       taken      into       consideration when                    setting           up t h e s e      roadworks.

3.     When    we      came       through          the    turnstiles           for     1 9 8 8 g a m e we          were       met    by a

line    of    stewards            and    police          officers       who      gently          but f i r m l y    prevented

us    from    entering            the    tunnel          to   the    middle         sections.                It h a d    been

decided       t ha t    these       section were              already          full     to       capacity.              This     year

no    such    p re ca u ti on was             in o p e r a t i o n .

4.     I can u n d e r s t a n d         the       police      officers         at     the       turnstiles             wishing       to

open    the    gates         to    relieve          pressure         and avoid          injury          to     life      or     limb,

but    in t h e s e     days       of    ultra moden and                sophisticated                personal

communications,               surely          it    could      have     been        done     in     conjunction with

their     central           police       control         a r e a at     the     side        of    the    electronic

s coreboard.

5.     Very     recent        national             publicity         has a s s u r e d       us     t h at     surveillance

cameras       at    football            grounds          means      that      any     problems          c a n be d e a l t          with

within       two    minutes         of     their         occurrence.

Surely with            the    police          central         control        post      with       its    battery           of T V

                                                                                                                                              S1S01

             m o n i t o r s available,                 they    should        have      been able           to a s c e r t a i n     the       need

             to     c l o se    the m i d d l e         sections         when      they    became          f u l l.

             6.      Observing            from       the      outside       it a p p e a r s     to    have       taken       far    too       long

             for     the       authorities              to    decide      that       it w a s    not a s e c u r i t y         problem and

             that      the      fans      genuinely            needed       help.         Working          with and alo ngside                  the

             indi v i d u a l        poli ce o f f i c e r s          in the       immediate          disaster          a r ea,     I have

             tremendous              p ra i s e    and adm irati on               for   their     efforts.             Overall           at    the

             scene,          however,          there         appeared       to     be a    lack       of    co-ordination and

             genuine           leadership.

             7.      For       an    extremely           long       t i m e we w e r e     without          any       form    of m e d i c a l

             equipment              of a n y      descri p t i o n .        I still        cannot          understand why                the    local

             H e a l t h A u t h o r i t y ’s           Major       M e d i cal    Di s a s t e r T e a m w a s        not    called          upon.

             I understand               that       all       Health Authorities                 in t h i s      country        have       a major

             disaster           poli c y .         It    is    impossible           to a c c u r a t e l y      estimate           the

             difference              this w o u l d          have    made     in s a v i n g     life.          I do, however,

             believe           that     the L i v e r p o o l        fans     should       have       been given             the    chance.

                 On Saturday 15 April                       1989 (150489),                I went to the FA cup semi final

                 Liverpool             for the Liverpool                    end but they had sold out.

                 From Nottingham the 4 of us travelled to Sheffield in                                                      car.     We

                 d i d n ’t stop anywhere on the way to Sheffield and there were no real

                 traffic delays except for a slight one just off the motorway.

                 We got to Sheffield at about                                1.30 pm (1-330) and we parked fairly near

                 to the qround.                   It was only about a five minute walk away from the
                                                                                                                              S3250

                    ground.          We walked to the ground.                        There weren't a lot of           people

                    a r o un d at this           tirne.       There were       police about         but we d i d n ’t have      to

                    ask       for directions            I didn't       notice any supporters               consuming alcohol

                    and       I d i d n ’t witness any disorder,                     fighting    or drunkeness       on the way

                    to the ground.

                    A lt h o u g h   I had a Spiori Kop end ticket                      it was my        intention to get       into

                    end,       and went         to the     turnstiles at Leppi^igs Ln we got there at about
5.o.£               10 to 2, 5 to 2..                There were         no queual at the turnstile.                  There were

                    Police       outside         the t urnstiles and yr also               saw one or two moun t e d

                                                                             fards outside         the    turnstiles    but    there

Ul                  w e r e n ’t many fans about at this                     time.       There were 4 or 5 turnstiles                    in

                    front       of us.          We went       to the one on the           laTft.       I spoke    to the

                    turnstile          operator and asked               if I coulyf go          into     the Leppings Ln end,

                    I showed him my Liverpool                        supportecrcIub        card and he told me us go to

Ca T                the turnstile               on the far        right.       We went     to that        turnstile and

                    a g a in    I showed my supporters                  club card to the turnstile                 operator.         He

                    said something               like     "we were expectJTng this               to happen and he          let me

                    :i. n ,            had also         got a ticket          f£ r    the S pion Kop end,         he h a d n ’t got a

                    my t i c k et        in a     I went       th rou^n the turnstile.

                    I saw a couple               of stewards         on the      inside    of tne        turnstiles.       i didn t
                    see any Police               there     but at that time             it was     really empty anyway.              I

                    d i d n ’t see any other              gates      other     than the     turnstiles        either    open or

                    being       opened.          Me? it her    did    I witness any una u t h o r i s e d entry to the

                    ground.          Once       through the turnstiles we made                     our way straight        through

                    the       tunnel      into the        terraces.          I c a n ’t remember         if there were any
CAT                 police       or stewards            in the/'tunne 1 or at either                end of the      tunnel.      I

            at this       time.       I did not see a barrier                 break    in pen 3 and of            course           I

            was    not    near to it in any            case.        At the time of taking                up my viewing

            jammed up against me at my back and againt my sides.                                     1 c o u l d n ’t

            over    the top.          Another    policeman stood behind him catching                            people as

                             Testing of Crush Barriers
         The barriers at the North West corner of the ground
are due to be tested this year, which will complete the first
 fiv»year cycle.   As the ground is being used by a congress of
‘Jehovah's Witnesses during early July, we shall be carrying
out the tests during June.
         Mr. Sheriff will be informed of the arrangements so
that he can carry out his usual inspections.


                                                       Yours sincerely,

Dear Dick,
                          Testing of Crush Barriers
             You will know that one of the requirements of the
Certificate of Ground Safety is that all the crush barriers
are to be tested on a five years cycle.   The final batch in
the present cycle are all those in the north-west corner.
          I presume you would like us to do the testing. It
is normally done in June or early July so as to leave time
for any minor repairs or replacements before the season starts.
We usually find that one or two of the barriers have become
weakened by rusting.   Any necessary strengthening has usually
been cars led out for about £1,000 or a little over in previous
years.
          If there are any dates you would like us to avoid
please let me know.


                                    Yours sincerely,

           I am a married man and I live at the^above address M/ith my wife and

           family*     I am a keen supporter ot Liver poo l/'foa/tbal 1 club and am

           result of being an agent I am guaranteed tickets for games that

           Liverpool       play in.

           On Saturday 15th April       1989 (150469) Liverpool were playing Nottingham

           Forrest,    in tjje semi final of the FA Cup competition,                       the game was to

           be plaByed/at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield I had a ticket for the

           also had a ticket for the West Stnad.                                 got his ticket through

           being a season ticket holder.                               and I travelled to Sheffield,                 on

           a mini bus not a company bus,                 just one belonging to a lad I knew who

           was going to the match.              He is a mate of                      I’m not sure of his

Two of my other brothers Gar;/ and Stepheri/Har r i son were were going to

the game*       They had tickets for the tei/ace at Leppings Lane end of

the g r o u n d .   They were going to travel on a coach to Sheffield-                 I had

been at the same fixture at Hillsborough ir ^ ^ 9 B &              a n d again I was

in the West Stand*

I told Gary and Steve that I would meet them in Sheffield before the

game, at the place where I had met Gary last year being the top of the

hill at Leppings Lane,        beside the shop Steve wasn't at last years game

I never gave a time to them,          just before the game.

On the day of the match,        I left my house at 9.50 am <0950)              I walked to

the car park of the                                 near my home and met the mini        bus

on the car park.        There was a couple of fellas already on this bus

and we left at once,        stopping for petrol.           We then made a few local

stops,    to pick up some others and left                       about 10*45 am <1045)

 to head for Sheffield*

On the way we travelled through Stockport,                 some of the journey was by

motorway and we were subject t o ^ t ^ f f i c          delays.    We made no stops en

route*      It was a warm dry day.          We had cans of coke on the         bus but no

alcohol.       Our vehicle was not checked b y           Police.    At about 1.30 pm

<1330) to 1.45 pm <1345) we arrived in Sheffield I think it was the

A55 Mapley Grove area.         We approached the ground at the end in use by

the fans of Nottingham Forrest.              We drove past the Hillsborough

ground,     passing a pub called the Nottingham something or other,                    this

pub was opened.         We drove towards the other end of the ground and up

the hill at Leppings Lane.

I had arranged to meet Gary and Steve in this area.                      It was very busy

with fans      in the area.    I kept       looking            the window for my

brothers and I saw both Gary and Stephen                 standing    together outside a

row of shops at the top of the hj/Ll at Leppings Lane.                    The shops

include a chip shop,       boutique,    off licence etc.     I would say this was

around 1*45 pm.     I told             I ’d just seen our brothers;          di dn *t

see them*     I had the windoM/ seat*       I don't believe either of my

brothers saw me on the coach as it drove past them.              The traffic was

very heavy*

It was so busy,    including all side streets,         that we had to drive quite

a way to find a place        to park.     We parked near to a primary school,       I

don't know the name of the school,          or the    road it was in.   We had to

walk to the ground from there.

      and the rest of the lads and I walked together to the ground

passing the point where I had seen Gary and Steven around 2 pm

<1400).     I was at the place where I had earlier seen my brothers but

they had by now gone*         I stood around for 3 or 10 minutes but when I

couldn't find them,    I     left realising they had left for the ground.

On the approach to the ground it was chaos,            with huge crowds outside*

       and I stayed together      it was>terrible outside in the crowd.         We

managed to get in thorugh the tdrnstile and made our way to th e West

Stan d .   I took up my seat ^fler 2.30 pm <1430)          it had taken me a long

time to get entry to the ground.          My seat was close to the North Stand

end of the ground.     I could see the area^Jseneath the centre of the

West Stand was very busy.

I heard the tannoy say the kick            f would be delayed for 15 minutes

but this never happened and Wtey kicked off on time.

As play began I was continually being distracted by events taking

place in the terrace below us*           I stood up now and then to look down*

In the West stand there was people standing as there was confusion

over the seating arrangements*

I saw people coming over the top of the perimeter fence and one young

lad ran onto the pitch*        As people came out of the Leppings Lane

terrace and were carried onto the pitch,             I at first thought they must

have fainted*     I then saw a heavily built man at the rear of the

Liverpool goal and he had a coat placed over his face.          The result of

this was that people through the West Stand rose up to see what was

going on.     This man was on the back of the goal net..

More people began spilling onto the pitch from the Leppings Lane

terrace.     The game was stopped and the players were taken off-       It

became apparent that the situation was quite serious and becoming

worse.I    could see the perimeter fence being pulled apart by fans and

Police*     People were using hoardings as make shift stretchers*       I

heard the Tannoy asking poepie to remain calm,       I saw more and more

bodies by the goal area of Lepings Lane being covered up.

         and I remained in the stand for a while it was not possible to

leave the West Stand at that time*

Once most of the stand emptied,          and I left-     It would be around 4

pm*

With         I looked for Gary and Stephen,   enquiring of coach drivers

where they were from*     We searched the area but could not find them*

I phoned my mothers home to ask about Gary and Steve-          She hadn't

heard from them*     I just imagined that they were unable to get to a

phone,    I fully believed that they would have got out of the crowd

s a f e l y *I got home in our coach arriving at about   10.00 pm (2200)*    I

had phoned my mother again,    stopping on the journey home to do so,

she still Jsadn't heard from Gary or Steve.*

At aboydft 11 am <1100) on the following Sunday morninq my brother James
 ^ 15;
H a r ^ s o n telephoned me to say that he had identified the bodies of

 fry and Stephen to the Police     in Sheffield and that they had lost

their lives in the football disaster*

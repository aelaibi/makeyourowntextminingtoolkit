               called       the      players             off,       that      I realised              something              serious        ha d

               happened.             I sa w a            lot     of    people           climbing         out       of    the       pens     no w a n d

               falling       down         to    the            g r o u n d , in     pain,       and with           exaustion.                My     initial

               reaction        was        that       I        th o ug ht there had              been a         pitch          invasion,            but       I

               then      saw a ma n            in his 2 0 ’s w a l k                on to        th e    pitch          his     r ig h t    arm     was

               broken,       a n d at          right          angles,         to     his      upper      arm.           Two     ambulance           men

               rushed       onto      the       pitch          to     deal        with     this       man,     but       I saw        him     refuse

               their      attention and                   gestured            for       them     to     go    to    the a r e a        behind           the

               goal      which       by n o w        was       a mass        of     p e op l e,       I ytent       to       the    toilet         at    this

               point,       and when            I returned                                        ^Sid ,       "A y o u n g         lad     had     been

using        t h e m as m a k e             shift       stretxhers.                People         in the         stand a r o u n d             me,

were      shouting               to    these       Police          officers,            forming        lines,          to      go a n d        help

at     the      Leppings              Lane       end,    as    they         had    got     first       aid       qualifications.

So     I said          to                   "I    c a n ’t sit        h e re      and     witness          this,       I ’m g o i n g          to

Once      we      got       to    the       fixed       penalty        6 yard           box     area,       I couldn't               believe

                         I then went               looking          to    se e    if     I could        see       the       friends          I had      travelled

                         wit h,      and      other       mates          who     I knew        were     at     the      match,           about      twenty

                         people       from a         local          football           teams        that     I play          for       had     gone     to    the

                         match       fortunately               they       were        all     ok.

                         Together          with my mates                  we     left       the A r o u n d       at    about          15.45     hours,           of    our

                         accord,        and made           our       way       back      to    *ur     car,       and       returned          to Eastharn.

             p       I feel          that      the       deployment              of    thfi p o l i c e      along           th e    North       Stand,        and

               order      situation       were     v ery abrupt,          and   they     even         brought     Police      dogs

               onto      the    pitch,     it w a s    difficult         to   understand          the    reasoning          behind

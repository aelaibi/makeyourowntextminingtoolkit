                                        ck       it    was       clearly             evident          that       the    majority           of

N o t x s L P o rreess t    supporters                had    arrived               at     the    ground          but    the     Liverpool

    uppdrters          were          still       streaming                down       towards          the    ground          from     th e

opposite          side          of    the     roundabout.-                    However,           we    were       constantly              being

asked       by    Liverpool             supporters                   in       cars      where     they       could.■-■park           their

cars      right        up       till    the       last       minute             and       the    fans       were       directed           up    past

Niagara          on    the       main        road.

As    the       time       neared       kick          off,       I. w a s       stood       near       the       Sergeant         and      heard

on    the       radio       about       problems             being             experienced             at    the       Leppings           Lane

end      and     repeated             requests             from       somebody/             I believe             Supt.        M a r s h a l 3. to

1 then          heard       a    request          that       all          available             officers          attend        at    t he

Leppings          Lane          end    which          I did          together             with    all       my     serial.

On    a rrival         the       f o re court          i nt o        the       g ro u nd wa s         c 1ea red        of     f a ns a nd

there       were       a    number          of    mounted             officers             present- a n d          numbers           of     police

officers          milling             about.

A    drunken          Liverpool             supporter                was       stood nearby            and        about       twenty           or

thirty          Liverpool              supporters            were             in   the near           vicinity          the    majority              of

them      drinking.

We    were       then       instructed                to    form          a    cordon       and       prevent          any    more

Liverpool             supporters              into         the       ground          until       further          notice..

The      drunken           supporter             mentioned                earlier          began       arguing          with      one      of       the

mounted          officers              insisting            on       his       r i g h t to     enter        the       ground       and

unfortunately                   he     was    knocked             over         and      Ibelieve            the    horse        stood          o n him.

After       a    few       minutes          stood          outside,             I saw       Supt.       Marshall             hurry towards

us    and       told       us    to    go     into         the       ground          as    our    help       was       needed.        At        that

point       I thought                that    there          had       been         crowd        trouble       and'on          entering              the

terraces          saw       that       there          were       a    large          number       of    people          on    the     pitch          1

thought          there          had    been      a     pitch          invasion.

•However,           I seem          to    remember              that       the       pen      I entered                was       empty       and     that

 one    of     the       barriers             inside           the    compound              was        twisted          and       collapsed              on

 the    ground,                     \          -=    •

 I believe              I saw       a    number'- of            shoes          on    the      terracing                but       cannot        be    sure

 whether        it       was       then       or     minuts          later          when      I was          on    the       perimeter              track.

 I walked           onto          the    perimeter              track          through            the       gate       which       was       open        and

 then     saw       a    man       being       carried               towards           me     and       it       was    obvious          that        he

 was    dead        and       I    then       saw     a    further             two     who        were       in    the       same       way     which

 came    as     a       great       shock.            I hurried                towards            the       pen    where          the    people

 were     corning            out    and       assisted              with       carrying               two    bodies          out,       they        had

 been     passed             out    and       they        were       both       laid         on       the    grass          to    the    left        of

 the    goalposts                 (facing           down       the    ground)            I    cannot             remember          what        any       of

  t he se people l o o k e d like                         or    what       they        were           wearing.

‘‘H o w e v e r , w h i l s t t h e r e it                was       obvious          that         there          was    insufficient                 room

 to    lay     the       people          down        and       I tried          together               with       other          officers

 including              an    Inspector              to    clear          more       ground            to    the       left       of    the     goals.

 However        there             wars    large           numbers          of       Liverpool               supporters             wandering

 about,        again          many       of    them        drunk          and       c o n t i n u a l ly'. g e t t i n g          in    the     way,

 some     of    them          saying          they        were       looking           for        a    friend          or    relative           or

 acquaintance.

 The    scene           was       one    of    total           confusion             and      there          was       no    organisation

 but    due     to       the       fact       that        it    had       happened            so       unexpectedly                this        is    n ot

 surprising.

 By    this     time          numbers          of     the       Liverpool              supporters                 including

 particularly                 youths          of     17-S5          age    group,           many        of       them       the    worse        for

 drink       began           shouting          abuse           at    the       Notts         Forest          supporters                who     they

 reckoned           were          laughing           at    them.           A    number            of    them       began          running           up

 the    field           towards          the        Notts       Forest          end,         together             with       other       officers

 I followed              and       turned           them       back.

 Once     this          had       been    done        their          rage       was      turned             on    us,       weformed            a    line

             across           the       field       and       I was       stood       on    the       left         hand       side    together           with

             PC    Brookshaw                 < A 1 ) ? PC      3131       Lewis       (FI?)          -and w h i l s t         there    was       subject          to

             quite        an       amount          of    abuse       ''You b l a c k        bastards",               "I       hope    you're, f ucking

             happy        now you             b a f tardg." and             others.

  ‘          A    l ot    of       it    was       also      aimed        towards          the       £'.A'.

             I    remained              at    this       point       until       about          4.35         pm w h e n       I    returned       to     my

             serial           on    Herries             Road.

             Whilst           1 had          been       in    the    ground       1    never          saw      any       stewards,          at    the

             Leppings              Lane       end       especially          on    entering              the        ground.           Throughout            the

             period           I was          in    the       ground       I had       no    idea        what        was       going    off       as     I had

             become           separated             from       my    serial.

             I    expected              that       shortly          after       entering             the      ground          full    use    would          be

             made        of    the       public          address          system,,         in    an     effort           to       direct    rescue

             attempts              and       probably          more       importantly                inform         the       spectators          as     for

             nearly           an    hour          nobody       knew       what    was       happening.                   The       system    was       only

             used        once       and       that       was    to    inform          the       crowd         of    the       replay,       (apart         from

             a    short        message             from      Kenny        Dalglish.)

             It    would           have       been       particularly             helpful             to      know       where       medical,

             assistance                 was       available          as    we    ended          up    with         two    points       at    opposite

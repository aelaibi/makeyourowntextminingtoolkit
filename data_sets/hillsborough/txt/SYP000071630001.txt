                   up the        hill    away       from the        bridge.

                   T here was a          constant           stream       of people         going     past me who were all

                   Liverpool        Su p p o r t e r s .      I sold all             my hats and scarves w i t h i n half an

                   hou)

                   At a bout       2.4 5      pm I w a l k e d      down to the            bridge     in L a p pings Lane and

                               on the      bridge      just w a t c h i n g          the   crowd'.\^There w a s N ^ u s t a solid

                   m ass    of    people w a i t i n g        to get       into the          gorund             ere was       no proper

                      eue      people were           just     cr owded         round the       entrance         gates.        I saw some

C\.CC_OJSV%        of the        crowd     climb over           the      bridge and walk a long                 the    river.        I. got

.             ,   /the     impression           that       they were       going        to try and        get into the          ground by

                   walking        along       the    river and then              climbing       over        the wall to        get    into

                   the     ground.         I would          e s t imate    that at          least a hund r e d         people got       into

                   t h e g r o und t hi s way.

                   The     police       saw    them     climb over             the    bridge    but      did nothing          to stop

                   them,,        I would              that      there were about               five m o u n t e d officers            there

                   a n d a bout      twenty         f i^«    foot     officres         there.        There was         no way    the

                   Pol i c e     could     contorol          the    crowd at this             time    because         of the size       of

                   the     crowd.        The     police        c o u l d n ’t move         because    the    crowd was         so tight.

                   I saw       police      officers          by the turns t i l e s           pulling       people      out    of the

                   crowd an d over              the wall

                   I saw the exit               g^ate on the          ttTrnstile           block C being        opened        1 did not

                   see wno        opened       it,    a r           of    people went          thor u g h    the gate.          The    crowd
        C_
                   was     packed       so tight        that       it was       impossible         for    them all       to    rush

                   t hro u g h at once.              This     secerned to relieve               the      pressure       on the       crowd

                   still       waiting        to go t h r o u g h        the    turnstile.

                   I then        left    the a rea to go back                  to the        car-^o      find                    I have

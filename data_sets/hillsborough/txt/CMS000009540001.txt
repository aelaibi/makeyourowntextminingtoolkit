Dear

Thank you for your recent letter to the Minister ofi Sport  which
has been p assed to this department in view of our responsibilities
for the Sa fety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.

Lord Justice Taylor reco gn ise d, in his Final Report on the
Hillsborough Stadium disaster, that there is no single solution to
achieve crowd safety and cure all the problems of crowd control.
However, he was satisfied that seating does more to achieve these
objectives than any other single measure.     He also considered that
moving to all seated accommodation was consistent with the policies
of both FIFA and UEFA.   This is a view with which the Government is
in agreement.  Lord Justice Taylor recommended that all clubs in
the First and Second Divisions of the Football League should
provide seated accomodation only by august 1994 and all clubs in
the Third and Fourth Divisions by August 1999.     The Government has
agreed to this timetable and supports its implementation.

The Government have also made available £100 million to the
Football Trust over a five year peri od to assist clubs in carrying
out these ground impr ov eme nt s.

I hope this information is of use to you in your research.

                                                                                  Yours sincerely

Dear Mr. Atkins,


                        As part of my             course I am required
to look at a number of moral and social issues.    I have chosen to
look at the question of all seater stadiums as laid down by Lord
Justice Taylor in his recent report after the Hillsborough disaster.
I would be grateful for your views on all seater stadiums espesially
whether or not you believe them to be safer than the presant
stadiums.
                     Yours Sincer]^

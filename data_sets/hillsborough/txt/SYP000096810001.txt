                SUBJECT:               HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND


                              Together with other    officers I attended at the above ground
                    about 3.25pm this day- responding to ’Operation Support' and during my
                    attendance I assisted other officers already t h e r e . J O
                              At the scene a



                                                 and




                    made themselfs known to me. It later transpired that             brother
                    had been killed and that he had another younger brother still missing
                    bel«ived to be one of the dead also.
                                During my conversation with the two men it became apparent
                    that they were aware of money being handed over at the turnstiles, they
                    themseltfs had obtained stand tickets from their home town but had apparently
                    done a deal with other tickets so that they could stand with their own
                    fans in another part of the ground.
                                Being aware of the subsequent enquiry I asked them if they would
                    be willing to make statements to the fact that they saw money being handed
                    over etc., They agreed that they would be willing to oblige.

            Together with other A3 officers         I attended at the above ground about

           3.25pm this day responding to 'Operation S u p p o r t ’ and during my

made themselves known to me.    It later transpired that

brother had been killed and that he had another younger brother still

missing believed to be one of the dead also.



During my conversation with the two men it became apparent that they

were aware of money being handed over at the turnstiles,        they

themselves had obtained stand tickets from their home town but had

apparently done a deal with other tickets,    so that they could stand

with their own fans in another part of the ground.



Being aware of the subsequent enquiry I asked them if they would be

willing to make statements to the fact that they saw money being

handed over etc.    They agreed that they would be willing to oblige.



In view of this match being an all ticket match and the obvious

consequences of such a practice,   if true,   I ask that this

correspondence be forwarded to the incident enquiry team for their

information please.

X>L                At 2,55pm, Saturday, 15 April 1989, I was on duty at the Sheffield Wednesday
            3 Football Ground where a football match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest
      SfTlL^&
                   was to take place*

                   At this time I had made my way to Gate A, at the lappings lane side of the ground
                   There was a Serial of Police Officers at that gate and I saw that the gate was
                   being forcibly moved from the outside#

                   The gate which was of a flding/sliding type was being forced side to side and
                   inwards at the same time and looked to be in^the process of breaking down#
                   An official gateman was holding onto the bolts which kept the gate secured#
                   He was having to keep the bolts pushed up# I looked through a glass observation hi

                   were arguing with Officers in this vicinity re the trouble outside and all
                   were saying that someone was going to be killed in the crush#
              it
                   I continued to assist the gateman at the gate and at this point a Police
                   Sergeant (not known) stated that Ground Control had ordered the gate to be

                    The gateman then pulled down the bolts feeding the gate and I opened the right

           At 2.55pm,    Saturday,      15 April,   1989,   I was on duty at the Sheffield

           Wednesday Football Ground where a football               match between Liverpool

           and Nottingham      Forest was to take place.



           At this time I had made my way to Gate A, at the Leppings Lane side

           ot   the ground.     There was a Serial of Police Officers at that gate

           and I saw that      the gate was being forcibly          moved from the outside.



           The gate which      was of a f old in g/ s1i d i n g 'type was   being forced side to

           side and inwards at the same time and looked to be in the process of

           breaking down.      An official gateman was holding onto the bolts which

           kept the gate secured.         He was having to keep the bolts pushed up.                I

  .Looked through a glass observation hole in the gate and saw a mass of

  supporters all    pushing towards the gate and those that were in direct

  contact were the culprits attempting to force it open.



  As a result   I contacted Ground Control and asked that Mounted Section

  be directed to this position to ease the melee outside.



  Whilst this was taking place supporters were        climbing over the wall

  into the ground at this point.      Supporters   coming into the ground via

  the turnstiles were arguing with Officers        in this vicinity re the

  trouble outside and all were saying that someone was going to be

  killed in the crush.



  I continued to assist the gaternan at the gate and at this point a

  Police Sergeant    (not known)   stated that Ground Control   had ordered

  the gate to be opened.     The gatemen argued that they had no such

  orders and at first refused to open the gate.        They were over ruled

  by the Sergeant and at this time I advised the gateman to stand near

  to the wall and that I would pull open the door as I feared he would

  be crushed.



  Ihe gateman then pulled down the bolts securing the gate and I opened

  the right hand gate and someone else opened the left side.         The crowd

  surged into the ground and all      I could do was to assist them in

  keeping on their feet as they moved forward.

           At 12.30 p m , Sunday,    16 April   1989,   together with the PS 454 Chapman,

           Dc ___________________ and Police Constable                who was totally

           unconnected with S a t u r d a y ’s events but who has a good knowledge of

           the events and surrounding areas and who was           present to assist   in

           identifying    locations as they took place,        I viewed the video tapes.

           Mrs        r was also present to take notes.



           The purpose of the review is effectively to scan fairly quickly and

           to identify incidents of apparent significance with reference to the

           event    in question.



           On the first tape to be viewed         (which is indexed 14) - which records

           in some detail      the build up and problems which occurred at the

           Leppings Lane end of the ground as well as shots of other parts of

           the ground - starts at 11.59am.



           This video is taken from a static camera mounted on the south/west

           corner of the west stand.        It gives views to the Leppings Lane

           turnstiles a. to g. and one to 16 and a view inside and beyond gates
                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                 R3

"A *, ’8* and           "C* and into the roadway of Leppings Lane.



There     is nothing significant until           circa 1420 when the review

commences and shots of Leppings Lane end terrace area shows spectator

concentration to be sparse.               It shows the continual   build up of

Liverpool        supporters on Leppings Lane around the turnstiles and their

subsequent entry into the ground.



At   14.32.22 a densely packed crowd of at             least 3,000 spectators     is

clearly seen back from the turnstile area into the main road and

officers       including mounted officers are having apparent difficulty in

exercising effective            control   because of an overspill away from the

turnstiles            into the south stand access    road of 1,000 or more

spectators.            A significance of this is that as pressure mounted on

the turnstiles there was no opportunity to relieve that pressure by

overspilling            into the service road.     The frame at 14.40.51

illustrates this very clearly.



At 14.42.43 spectators            seen climbing over turnstiles wall,



At 14.46.42 spectators            in significant numbers start     climbing over

turnstiles a. to g.



At 14.48.12 gate            ’C ’ is opened and spectators move from the service

road area through the gateway into the area on the ground side of the

t u r n s t i le s.



At 14.48.29 two mounted officers are               clearly seen by the gate

attempting to control            the spectator    influx.
                                                                             PAGE

By 14.48.59 following the relax of pressure            in the service area it is

now seen that mounted officers have managed to force the crowd back

towards the proper side of the turnstiles.             Barriers across the

service road on the wrong          (south stand)   side of the gate are firmly

under    police    control.



At 14.49.40 a panning shot shows          large numbers of spectators still

coverging on these turnstiles along Leppings Lane from Middlewood

Road    (Sheffield end).



At 14.50.05 a second          panning shot shows   large numbers of spectators

arriving on Leppings Lane from the Penistone Road end and the total

number of spectators amassed outside the turnstiles at this                point is

estimated in the region of 3,000/4,000.



At 14.50.29 a fairly large section of the crowd have now come down

the service road up to the barriers,          that    is across and up against

gate    ’C ’.



At 14.52.19        this shows the outer boundary gates adjacent to Leppings

Lane closed,       separating the spectators between those gates at the

turnstiles and the        larger number beyond the gate in Leppings Lane.



At 14.52.23 gate        "C"   is again opened and spectators moving through in

large n u m b e r s .



At 14.52.39 a mounted officer is visible             in the service   road outside

this gate trying to control spectator movement.              The service   road is

now practically empty.          Huge numbers of spectators are seen in

Leppings Lane outside the boundary gate.             Again we are talking of
                                                                         PAGE
                                                                         R3

several    thousands of people.



At 14.52.46 at least four mounted officers are         in the service    road

and the pressure again has been removed in the service          road area.



At 14.52.50 there appears to be a breach at the service gates and

spectators    in very large numbers move down the service road and again

through gate    *C’ which is clearly seen to be open.       Mounted officers

attempt to maintain control but are soon overwhelmed by the numbers

who walk not run through the gates.



At 14.53.24 the whole       process accelerates.   It appears   possible that

many spectators    in Leppings Lane at this    point became aware of the

open gate and the opportunity to enter the ground this way.             The

crowd movement now shifts from walking to running towards the gate

but in the main on moving through the gate         reduces to a walk.     Many

hundreds are now seen entering the ground in this way.           Once through

the gate the crowd is quite orderly almost         leisurely in terms of its

further movement    to spectator areas.



At 14.54.16 a thousand       plus spectators are seen densely packed

outside the turnstiles       one to 16, the crowd is surging and the whole

situation from their       point of view must have been one of personal

danger.    A police officer     (possibly an inspector or chief    inspector)

on the turnstile    roof    is seen using a radio and ignoring spectators

climbing on to the roof possibly because he considers that sensible.



At -14.55.01 looking out to the barrier gates this shot shows a

residual    crowd of 2,000 plus,    possibly 3,000,   still on the outside of

the turnstiles extending       into Leppings Lane with large numbers still
                                                                          PAGE
                                                                          R3

approaching from the Penistone Road end.



At 14.55.05 the crowd is now solid from gate        ’C ’ along the service

road out into Leppings Lane and towards Middlewood Road           (Sheffield)

and it is estimated 2,000 people are seen.         People are now seen

entering through gate     'C' and through the turnstiles,       possibly at

this point unrestricted,     in their thousands.     This   is shown

continuously up to 14.56.02 when the camera shot changes.



At 14.56.33 this shows the police again achieving more effective

control.   The crowd in the service road is much smaller,          mounted

officers are across the service road and the boundary gate appears to

be closed and again under control     holding clearly several       hundreds

and possibly a thousand plus spectators out in Leppings Lane.



At -14.57.50 spectators    in very large numbers are still entering this

same area through the service gate,     through the turnstiles and by

climbing over the top of the turnstiles so the area behind the stand

on the turnstiles    is densely packed with a crowd still moving towards

the tunnel entrance.      It should be noted that all the shots         referred

to so far show as the crowd entering through gate           ’C ’ and turnstiles

a. to g., the spectators almost universally are moving towards the

tunnel   entrance to the terraces and there is virtually no movement

nor any activity by anyone to direct these same spectators             to the

south side of the west stand.



At 14.57.54 this shows the gate separating spectators entering

through turnstiles one to 16 and those through turnstiles a. to g.

which is normally closed and manned by police officers and stewards

as open, as far as   could be seen unmanned and large numbers of
                                                                        PAGE
                                                                        R3

spectators are moving from the one to 16 area to the rear of the west

stand and possibly to the tunnel      entrance.



At 15.00.14 this shows that the barrier in the service road has now

been advanced towards Leppings Lane past gate        ’C* and entrance

through that gate is now stopped but spectators        in large numbers are

still moving through the turnstiles and climbing the surrounding

wall.   The crowd overall   is now greatly reduced but nevertheless

large numbers of spectators still appear to be approaching the

turnstiles from the Middlewood Road      (Sheffield)   direction.



At 15.02.50 whilst the pressure spectators entering the turnstiles is

now much reduced once through spectators appear to be running towards

the tunnel   entrance.



At 15.02.54 the camera changes location to a static camera situated

on the south side   inside the ground adjacent to the police control

centre focusing on the Leppings Lane end terrace over        pen two.     The

crowd at this southern end of the terraces        is loosely packed and

there   is no problem whatsoever.



At   15.03.11 the section   of the crowd in pen four is now seen climbing

over the safety barrier     onto   the pitch (an earlier shot at 15.03.04

shows the safety gate open).



At 15.03.23 again shows     fans   climbing over the safety barrier and the

safety gate to be open.



The shots immediately following show fans panicking and large numbers

scaling the safety fence and spilling onto the pitch.         Increasing
                                                                       PAGE      7
                                                                       R3

numbers of police officers are seen on the track assisting to rescue

people and an ambulance also arrives     (15.16.00) at this end of the

ground.



At 15.21.05 this shows a single spectator climbing the fence after

which this ceases   indicating that the pressure of the crowd on the

spectator side by this time was greatly reduced.



At 15.26.08 the camera position moves and we now see the Leppings

Lane terrace from approximately mid south stand position.          There are

hundreds of spectators on the pitch, an ambulance      is stationary by

the safety fence and what   is significant    is the relative freedom of

movement now on the terraces   in pen three.    Fen four   is relatively

tightly packed.



At 15.27.30 members of the fire service are seen arriving on the scene.



The review then moves to video tapes taken at ground level         by the

Underwater Search Unit using portable video equipment.       Four tapes

were taken,   three of which were   recorded on to one 60 minute working

copy,   the remaining one re-recorded onto another working     copy.



The tape VRM 2 shows the crowd overspil      from the Leppings Lane

terraces and views of the temporary mortuary in the gymnasium at

Hillsborough.



The tape VRM 3,   shows views of the Leppings Lane terrace after the

ground had been cleared.    It clearly shows that the wired safety

fence has been effectively cut and peeled back,      probably to

facilitate the release from the terrace of members of the crowd.            It
                                                                             PAGE
                                                                             R3

is not known who achieved this,        it may have been the fire brigade.



The same tape later shows a crowd barrier distorted and snapped.



The same tape also focuses on a gents wristlet watch on the Leppings

Lane terrace which is broken and stopped at eight minutes            past

three.     This    is a calendar watch which also    indicates   15 April.



On tape VRM 4 this shows        clearly views of the Leppings Lane terrace,

gates    ’A ’, ’B* and    *C’, access tunnel and turnstiles.     It also shows

very clearly gate        *C* as a corrugated concertina type gate.        It tends

to show the gate       is undamaged and there     is no,evidence of it having

been forced.



The remaining tape        (VRM 1), the last five viewing minutes are shot

from hand-held equipment at the Spion Hop end towards Leppings Lane

terraces.       This   is done at ground level.    Section commences with

officer stating time as 3.03pm exactly and views the crowd climbing
                                                                     %

over the perimeter fence onto the track.            It pans from right to left

clearly showing that emergency gates three,          four and five are open

with police officers        in attendance.   It also shows that some of the

crowd are obviously injured and receiving medical attention.                Further

time check of 3.06pm with comment that game is stopped.



VHS tape marked 13 - with commentary shown as 1159 to 1435.              This     is

wrong as the commentary runs from 1159 to 1504.



At   14.33.01     this shows a close-up of the main gate at Leppings Lane

end with a very large number of densely packed spectators.               The scene

is calm.

At    14.59.10          this          shows       a    scene         of    the    Leppings           Lane       terrace         at   its

northern          end.           There       is a m p l e         space         fo r    spectators          with       g a ps    visible

on    the    terraces.




At    14.59.54          t h is        shows       f an s     being         let     in t h r o u g h       gate    one       on to     the

southern          end       of    the       Leppings           Lane        terrace          where        again    there         is a m p l e

room and          g ap s     on       the    terraces             are      clearly           visible.




At    15.00.15          a    line       of      spectators                can    be     seen       unhurriedly walking

along       the    track          in f r o n t         of    the      Leppings              Lane    terrace       having

presumably             been       let       out       of    the      terrace           at    some    po int      and    being

admitted          at    gate          one.




At 15.00.41             the crowd in the area of the division line between pens

two/three are at the back of the terrace and are seen to be

apparently surging and some fans appear to be climbing over this

barrier          post but the whole situation                                     is very minor.



At    15.02.21          t hi s        shows       police          officers             hurrying          from    the     track       in

front       of    the       south       stand          towards            the m i d d l e      of L e p p i n g s      Lane      terrace

a n d at     15.02.35             t hi s     shows          many      spectators              climbing          out    of    the

terrace          area       onto       the      pitch.




At    15.03.34          this          shows       fa n s     who      have       left        the    terrace       onto       the     pitch

sitting          down       calmly          and       the    appearance                is of a m i n o r         pitch       invasion.

Police       officers             in the          area appear                fairly          unconcerned.




For    continuity                of    t hi s     see       t a pe    indexed           tape       14.

E N D OF   REPORT
At 12.30 pffi. Sunday 16 April 198:9. together with the PS 454 Chapman, DC
              and,.-Police Constable.'      who was totally- .unconnected,.with;-
Saturday's\:events '-hut who has a'good knowledge-’of "the. -events ;and -surrotmdin
areas and who was present to assist inidentifying locations as they took
place, I viewed the video tapes. Mrs           was also present to take notes

The purpose of the review is effectively to scan fairly quickly and to
identify incidents of apparent significance with reference to the event in
question.

On the first tape to be viewed (which is indexed 14) - which records in some
detail the build up and problems which occurred at the Leppings Lane end of
the ground as well as shots of other parts of the ground - starts at 11.59am.

This video is taken from a static camera mounted on the south/west corner of
the west stand. It gives views to the Leppings Lane turnstiles a. to g. and
one to 16 and a view inside and beyond gates 'A', ’B' and 'C' and into the
roadway of Leppings Lane.

There is nothing significant until circa 1420 when the review commences and
shots of Leppings Lane end terrace area shows spectator concentration to be
sparse. It shows the continual build up of Liverpool supporters on Leppings
Lane around the turnstiles and their subsequent entry into the ground.

At 14.35-22 a densely packed crowd of at least 3,000 spectators is clearly
seen back from the turnstile area into the main road and officers including
mounted officers are having apparent difficulty in exercising effective
control because of an overspill away from the turnstiles into the south stand
access road of 1,000 or more spectators. A significance of this is that as
pressure mounted on the turnstiles there was no opportunity to relieve that
pressure by overspilling into the service road. The frame at 14.40.51
illustrates this very clearly.

At 14.42.43 spectators seen climbing over turnstiles wall.

At 14.46.42 spectators in significant numbers start climbing over turnstiles
a. to g.

At 14.48.12 gate 'C ! is opened and spectators move from the service road area
through the gateway into the area on the ground side of the turnstile.

At 14.48.29 two mounted officers are clearly seen by the gate attempting to
control the spectator influx.

By 14.48.59 following the relax of pressure In the service area it is now seen
that mounted officers have managed to force the crowd back towards the proper
side of the turnstiles. Barriers across the service road on the wrong (south
stand) side of the gate are firmly under police control.

At 14.49.40 a panning shot shows large numbers of spectators still converging
on these turnstiles along Leppings Lane from Middlewood Road (Sheffield end).

At 14.50.05 a second panning shot shows large numbers of spectators arriving
on Leppings Lane from the Penistone Road end and the total number of
spectators amassed outside the turnstiles at this point is estimated In the
region of 3,000/4,000.

At 14.50.29 a fairly large section of the crowd have now come down the service
road up to the barriers, that is across and up against gate 'C '.
At 14.52.19 this shows the outer boundary gates adjacent to Leppings Lane
closed, separating the spectators between those gates at the turnstiles and
the larger number beyond the gate in Leppings Lane.

At 14.52.23 gate 'C' is again opened and spectators moving through in large
numbers.

At 14.52.39 a mounted officer is visible in the service road outside this gate
trying to control spectator movement. The service road is now practically
empty. Huge numbers of spectators are seen in Leppings Lane outside the
boundary gate. Again we are talking of several thousands of people.

At 14.52.46 at least four mounted officers are in the service road and the
pressure again has been removed in the service road area.

At i4 .52.5O there appears to be a breach at the service gates and spectators
in very large numbers move down the service road and again through gate 'C'
which is clearly seen to be open. Mounted officers attempt to maintain
control but are soon overwhelmed by the numbers who walk not run through the
gates.

At 14.53-24 the whole process accelerates. It appears possible that many
spectators in Leppings Lane at this point became aware of the open gate and
the opportunity to enter the ground this way. The crowd movement now shifts
from walking to running towards the gate but in the main on moving through the
gate reduces to a walk. Many hundreds are now seen entering the ground in
this way. Once through the gate the crowd is quite orderly almost leisurely
in terms of its further movement to spectator areas.

At 14.54.16 a thousand plus spectators are seen densely packed outside the
turnstiles one to 16, the crowd is surging and the whole situation from their
point of view must have been one of personal danger. A police officer
(possibly an inspector or chief inspector) on the turnstile roof is seen using
a radio and ignoring spectators climbing on to the roof possibly because he
considers that sensible.

At 14.55-01 looking out to the barrier gates this shot shows a residual crowd
of- 2,000 plus, possibly 3,000, still on the outside of the turnstiles
extending into Leppings Lane with large numbers still approaching from the
Penistone Road end.

At 14.55-05 the crowd is now solid from gate 'C' along the service road out
into Leppings Lane and towards Middlewood Road (Sheffield) and it is estimated
2,000 people are seen. People are now seen entering through gate 'C' and
through the turnstiles, possibly at this point unrestricted, in their
thousands. This is shown continuously up to 14.56.02 when the camera shot
changes.

At 14.56.33 this shows the police again achieving more effective control. The
crowd in the service road is much smaller, mounted officers are across the
service road and the boundary gate appears to be closed and again under
control holding clearly several hundreds and possibly a thousand plus
spectators out in Leppings Lane.

At 14.57.50 spectators in very large numbers are still entering this same area
through the service gate, through the turnstiles and by climbing over the top
of the turnstiles so the area behind the stand on the turnstiles is densely
packed with a crowd still moving towards the tunnel entrance. It should be
noted that all the shots referred to so far show as the crowd entering through
gate 'C' and turnstiles a. to g., the spectators almost universally are moving
towards the tunnel entrance to the terraces and there is virtually no movement
nor any activity by anyone to direct these same spectators to the south side
of the west stand.

At 14.57.54 this shows the gate separating spectators entering through
turnstiles one to 16 and those through turnstiles a. to g. which is normally
closed and manned by police officers and stewards as open, as far as could be
seen unmanned and large numbers of spectators are moving from the one to 16
area to the rear of the west stand and possibly to the tunnel entrance.

At 15.00.14 this shows that the barrier in the service road has now been
advanced towards Leppings Lane past gate 'C' and entrance through that gate is
now stopped but spectators in large numbers are still moving through the
turnstiles and climbing the surrounding wall. The crowd overall is now
greatly reduced but nevertheless large numbers of spectators still appear to
be approaching the turnstiles from the Middlewood Road (Sheffield) direction.

At 15.02.50 whilst the pressure spectators entering the turnstiles is now much
reduced once through spectators appear to be running towards the tunnel
entrance.

At 15.02.54 the camera changes location to a static camera situated on the
south side inside the ground adjacent to the police control centre focusing on
the Leppings Lane end terrace over pen two. The crowd at this southern end of
the terraces is loosely packed and there is no problem whatsoever.

At i5 .O3 .ll the section of the crowd in pen four is now seen climbing over
the safety barrier onto the pitch (an earlier shot at 15.03.04 shows the
safety gate open).

At 15.03.23 again shows fans climbing over the safety barrier and the safety
gate to be open.

The shots immediately following show fans panicking and large numbers scaling
the safety fence and spilling onto the pitch. Increasing numbers of police
officers are seen on the track assisting to rescue people and an ambulance
also arrives (15.16.00) at this end of the ground.

At 15.21.05 this shows a single spectator climbing the fence after which this
ceases indicating that the pressure of the crowd on the spectator side by this
time was greatly reduced.

At 15.26.08 the camera position moves and we now see the Leppings Lane terrace
from approximately mid south stand position. There are hundreds of spectators
on the pitch, an ambulance is stationary by the safety fence and what is
significant is the relative freedom of movement now on the terraces in pen
three. Pen four is relatively tightly packed.

At 15.27.30 members of the fire service are seen arriving on the scene.

The review then moves to video tapes taken at ground level by the Underwater
Search Unit using portable video equipment. Four tapes were taken, three of
which were recorded on to one 60 minute working copy, the remaining one re­
recorded onto another working copy.
The tape VRM 2 shows the crowd overspil from the Leppings Lane terraces and
views of the temporary mortuary in the gymnasium at Hillsborough.

The tape VRM 3, shows views of the Leppings Lane terrace after the ground had
been cleared.   It clearly shows that the wired safety fence has been
effectively cut and peeled back, probably to facilitate the release from the
terraces of members of the crowd. It is not known who achieved this, it may
have been the fire brigade.

The same tape later shows a crowd barrier distorted and snapped.

The same tape also focuses on a gents wristlet watch on the Leppings Lane
terrace which is broken and stopped at eight minutes past three. This is a
calendar watch which also indicates 15 April.

On tape VRM 4 this shows clearly views of the Leppings Lane terrace, gates
'A', 'B' and 'C', access tunnel and turnstiles. It also shows very clearly
gate 'Cr as a corrugated concertina type gate. It tends to show the gate is
undamaged and there is no evidence of it having been forced.

The remaining tape (VRM 1), the last five viewing minutes are shot from hand­
held equipment at the Spion Kop end towards Leppings Lane terraces. This is
done at ground level. Section commences with officer stating time as 3.03 pm
exactly and views the crowd climbing over the perimeter fence onto the track.
It pans from right to left clearly showing that emergency gates three, four
and five are open with police officers in attendance. It also shows that some
of the crowd are obviously injured and receiving medical attention. Further
time check of 3.06 pm with comment that game is stopped.

VHS tape marked 13 - with commentary shown as 1159 to 1435-   This is wrong as
the commentary runs from 1159 to 1504.

At 14.33-01 this shows a close-up of the main gate at Leppings Lane end with a
very large number of densely packed spectators. The scene is calm.

At 14.59.10 this shows a scene of the Leppings Lane terrace   at its northern
end. There is ample space forspectators with gaps visible     on the terraces.

At 14.59.54 this shows fans being let in through gate one on to the southern
end of the Leppings Lane terrace where again there is ample room and gaps on
the terraces are clearly visible.

At 15.00.15 a line of spectators can be seen unhurriedly walking along the
track in front of the Leppings Lane terrace having presumably been let out of
the terrace at some point and being admitted at gate one.

At 15-00.41 the crowd in the area of the division line between pens two/three
are at the back of the terrace and are seen to be apparently surging and some
fans appear to be climbing over this barrier post but the whole situation is
very minor.

At 15.02.21 this shows police officers hurrying from the track in front of the
south stand towards the middle of Leppings Lane terrace and at 15.02.35 this
shows many spectators climbing out of the terrace area onto the pitch.

At 15.03.34 this shows fans who have left the terrace onto the pitch sitting
down calmly and the appearance is of a minor pitch invasion. Police officers
in the area appear fairly unconcerned.

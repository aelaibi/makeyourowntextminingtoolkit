              Re: Hillsborough Crush Barrier - SGS Report Ref: TD 70039

              Please find enclosed Figure 1.15 which was initially missing from
              your report copy.

              Furthermore, would you please note that the caption on Figure 1.14
              is incorrect; it should read Hand Rail 2/3 - fracture at support
              3 and not 2.

              For the attention of: Dr J. Weaver - Director

              Dear Sirs,


              Re: Hillsborough Crush Barrier - Correction to Report


              Please note that the failure of Leg Support No. 3 (rear leg) has
              initiated around the bottom gusset plate rivet by ductile overloading
              under a combination of bending and tension.

              This has resulted from the plastic collapse of the rear leg at ground
              level, and buckling of the front leg above its reinforcement. Hence
              the head of the barrier would have hinged away from the rear leg at
              the bottom rivet.

              It follows therefore that the failure sequence is initial overload
              at the rivet followed by ductile tearing along the corner angle and
              that the point of initiation illustrated in Figure 1.43 is incorrect
              (this area actually represents the final area of material to fail).

             The start of the ductile tear can be seen in Figures 1.41 & 1.42 at
             the edge of the rivet hole opposite to the ductile overload section
             arrowed in Figure 1.42.

             Yours faithfully,
                                                                                                           D EPT. TD

                       Leg 4 - close up of fracture. Note: right hand
                       fracture is typical of ductile fracture under bending
                       tension; left hand fracture is flat and of
                       'crystalline' appearance.

Sir William Halcrow & Partners Ltd)
 HILLSBOROUGH BARRIER   124A     PROPOSED MATERIAL TEST PROGRAMME


 1.   ALL COMPONENTS

 Prepare a coding system for all components giving a unique
 identity to each component of the barrier, samples to be
 extracted and to test specimens prepared therefrom. A
 drawing(s) showing the system and its application to the
 barrier shall be prepared and the actual barrier parts
 indelibly marked and photographed before extraction of
 samples.  As well as on the sample the marks should appear on
 the material adjacent to the sample.

A dimensional survey should be made of all components and
features and their relation to each other. Section sizes and
thicknesses in the original and corroded conditions should be
measured as well as the extent of corroded areas and their
relationship to contiguous parts.


2 HANDRAIL

On each original length (3 lengths ?) of rail except short
extension adjacent to Leg 1:

Chemical analysis, longitudinal tensile tests, transverse
macro section, with Vickers hardness, and micro sections.



On welds at Leg 2, and adjacent to Leg 2, and on any other weld
which may become apparent during examination, except for that
at Leg 1:

Macro sections with Vickers hardness and micro sections. Weld
sections to be transverse to direction of weld.



3.LEGS

On angle sections and straps of Legs 2,3 and 4:

Chemical analysis, longitudinal tensile tests, transverse macro
sections with Vickers hardness tests, micro sections.



4. FRACTURE SURFACES

Handrail fractures at Legs     2, 3 and 4:

To be examined to determine mode of fracture and influence of
corrosion thereon. At Leg 2 examine welded joint for assessment
of original soundness and and influence on corrosion mechanism.

Leg member fractures in Legs 3 and 4:

To be examined for evidence of effects other than exceedance*of
tensile or shear strength.

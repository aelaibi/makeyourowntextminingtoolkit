Detective           Constable         Hirst       and     I then         commenced a               p atr o l      of    the

H i l l s b o r o u g h and N e e p s e n d areas.                 The    whole       a r e a was          at     this       t ime

very     busy,       I was       surprised          to see         large      cr ow d s     outside              public       houses

forty     or    fifty       men    and     youths        stood       outside          those         premises            drinking

for    disorder existed.                     I was        informed           by P o l i c e       Sergeant        Dent       that

appeared          reasonably           quiet      by      t hi s    time.          Radio      traffic          on Channel           19

Fo r    a few        seconds           there was             a    confusion               of m e s s a g e s     over     the    radios

and     then a m e ss ag e                 was       broadcast             by     force Control              on C h a n n e l    1 VHF

responding               for    perhaps              one    or    two       minutes          in     case     further

UHF.        The     situation             inside       the       gymnasium            wa s     one       of    confusion

simply       due     to a       lack       of    information.                  This        was      inevitable                I believe

a s at      that     stage          nobody       knew       th e    extent           or    full      nature             of    the

disaster          which        had    occurred.              On my way               into      the       gymnasium                I s aw      one

or    two m e m b e r s        of    the    public who              were       hastily            trying           to    find

stretchers           or barri ers               to    use as        improvised               stretchers.                     It w a s      c l e ar

that     something             terrible          had    happened.               At        t hat     po int         I was          in no

doubt       t hat    there          were    fatalities              and       serious          casualties.



After       several         minutes         in the          gymnasium Chief                    Inspector                Beal       <F 1 S u b -

furniture           (which          had    been       there        for    refreshment                and       clerical

purposes).              I believe           he t o l d       us     that       casualties                were        coming         into        the

gymnasium.              The     g y m n a s i u m was        cleared           in d o u b l e        quick          time          and    no

upset       and     deeply          shocked.           I sat        them       down        on a      bench          side          by s id e

and     threw my         coat        over       them.        Almost           immediately,                Police             Constable

number         of    the       Police       Officer          on th e       back          of    the      hand     of    the      bo d i e s .

I do      not       know       if a n y P o l i c e         Officer        brought             in m o r e       than    one         body    but

I also         said       that       if    this      did     happen        that          they     should write                 the    body

number         in b r a c k e t s         after      the     officer's              collar        nu mb er.




More      bodies          were       brought         in.      Some       had a p p a r e n t l y          been        pronounced

dead      by a d o c t o r ,          others         had     not.        We     checked           the     bodies        for         signs      of

life.          It w a s        fairly       obvious          t h at     they were              already          dead.          Some

doctors         came          in a n d     pronounced           all      the        bodies         dead.         The    situation

was      chaotic,             bodies       were      l aid     everywhere                covered with              clothing           or    the

pa per        table       cloths          which      only a short               tim e         before       had     been        on    the

tables.             Many       people,        both members               of     the       public a nd            some      Police

Officers            were       in g r e a t     distress           and were              cry in g.        People        were

shouting,            others          were     blaming          the      Police           and     saying         in t h e i r

distressed               state       that     we     h ad    caused        the       tragedy.             One     man      late r

t ha t    they were             a TV       film      crew.



Out      of    the       c h ao s    order      grew.         A supply              of    body         bags     arrived         a n d we

began         placing          bodies        in t h e s e     and       laying           them      out     in    lin e s       of    1S,

Body      labels          were       completed and attached                          to       each      body,      property

I was      then      engaged             with my          team      in the            identification              of    bodies          by

the     relatives             and    friends          u ntil        5 . 0 D a.m.            on S u n d a y     16 A p r i l       1989,

when     I went          off     d uty.         At    t ha t       t im e    I believe             23    bodies        were       left

unidentified              and       the    temporary mortuary                          (gymnasium)             was     closed       down




Inview        of w h a t       my    duties          were      p r io r      to a t t e n d i n g        the     football          ground

following           ’O p e r a t i o n S u p p o r t *         I cannot               give     information             as    to w h a t

t ime    turnstiles              were       opened         nor      on      the       situation           in L e p p i n g s      Lane

prior      to,      or    after          the    gates        were        opened -            indeed        I only       l a t er    became

aware      that      gates          ha d    been      opened.




However,          I would           add     tha t     having          Policed               many football            matches        at

Hillsborough              and       elsewhere,              including several                      FA Cup Semi              Finals,

going      b ac k    to       1975,        I have         never       s e e n so            much pre-match             drinking

outside          public         houses         as    I did         t ha t    day.           Although           I had    remarked

that     there       might          be     trouble         lat e r       ( page        2)     I h ad     not     foreseen and

never      would         have       dreamed          t hat     such a disaster                     would       occur        or    was    even

poss i b l e .



My    duties        and       contribution                t ha t    day were            largely           "aft er      the       event’

and     perhaps          my    thoughts             and    feelings              are    not      relevant.             However,          I c^ti

say     t h at    time        flew       from my arrival                    at    the       g r o u n d at 3 . 0 5      p.m.       to

going      off      duty       at    5 . 0 0 a.m.          the      following               day.        Th e   task     which my              '

officers          and     other          officers          engaged           on       receipt       of     bodies       an^, later

identification                 per f or me d was             highly          unpleasant,                but    was     performed

professionally and                       with       compassion.                  No    right       minded        person          would

relish        such       tasks       but       in a       curious           way       I believe          that     we    have       all

learned          something           about          ourselves            and each            other       w h i c h we       would       not

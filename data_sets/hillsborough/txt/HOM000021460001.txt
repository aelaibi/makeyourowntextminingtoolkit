SPEAKING NOTE


1.    I beg to move amendment number 2. I shall also speak to
Government amendments 3 and 4 and refer to the Opposition
amendments numbered (a), (b) and (c).


2.    Mr Speaker, the Government amendments are concerned with
the composition of the Football Membership Authority.          They
follow an undertaking which I gave in Committee to consider an
amendment to make provision on the face of the Bill concerning
the chairmanship and membership of the authority. I also said
that I would consider an amendment to involve the supporters'
organisations in the running of the FMA. That is the subject of
a later Government amendment but I will refer briefly to it in my
comments on these amendments.




                                                           «
3.    I promised to consider an amendment about the composition
of the authority in response to Opposition amendments on the
subject tabled in this House and another place. The Bill as
introduced said nothing on the subject because the FMA will be a
private company, not a quango, like the National Rivers
Authority, or the Football Licensing Authority for that matter.
We should not therefore be in the business of spelling out
detailed rules on how the FMA will operate - as we have to do for
the FLA. I recognise, however, that there was a strong desire to
see certain aspects of the chairmanship and membership spelled
out in the Bill.


4.    The Government amendments require that the authority shall
have a chairman independent of any financial interest or other
area of potential conflict with football and that it should have
six other members. Two of those six members will be nominated by
the Secretary of State; the remaining four will be approved by
him and will, we hope, be agreed with the football authorities;
if they take on the responsibility for the FMA. The Chairman
will also be approved by the Secretary of State, in agreement, we
expect, with the football authorities. The amendment does not
refer to the football authorities by name, because we must take
account of the possibility - a very small one I hope - that they
may decide not to take on the FMA. I cannot therefore accept the
Opposition amendment to this effect.     At the same time, the
working party set up by the FA and the Football League to prepare
for the FMA has been hard at work since the Bill's committee
stage and we envisage that they will together set up the company
which the Secretary of State will designate as the FMA.


5.     The Government amendments do not refer specifically to
members appointed to represent the interests of football
supporters. I do not rule out the possibility, though the public
comments of the Chairman of the Football Supporters Association
appear to suggest that his personal attitude to the FMA will be
an entirely negative one. It is hard to believe that he would
want to be associated with the FMA.
6,     I have always accepted, however, that there is a case for
football supporters to be more closely involved in running the
game. That is why we have tabled an amendment no. 8 to require
the FMA to give the representatives of football supporters an
opportunity to make representations about the content of the
football membership scheme.     I understand that the football
authorities working party on the scheme have already held one
meeting with both the National Federation of Football Supporters’
Clubs and the Football Supporters' Association. This Bill has
already begun to have a desirable effect and our amendment will
ensure that they keep the consultation process going.


7.     I commend the approach which the Government amendments
take on this subject, rather than that of the Opposition, in
enlarging the numbers of members and then seeking to spell out
who should appoint the members of the authority.        Of course,
football must be fully represented on the authority. It remains
our hope - and expectation - that the football authorities
■   •
    will form the company that will be designated as the FMA. But if
    something should go wrong with their appointment as the FMA, the
    legislation must allow for the possibility that someone else will
    have to be appointed.

    8.       The third amendment in this group is a drafting amendment.
    It relates to the possibility that a body established as the FMA
    might give up the job, or lose it.             In that event, the
    technically correct phrase is that its functions will be
     "divested", rather than "withdrawn", as the Bill says at present.
     The amendment will put the drafting right.

     9.       Hr Speaker, the effect of the Government amendments is to
     spell out that the Chairman of the FMA must be independent and
     that there will be six other members, two of them appointed by
     the Secretary of State and the other four approved by him and, if
        all goes well, agreed with the football authorities.          The
        amendments carry forward the undertaking which I gave in Committee
        and I commend them to the House.

        Football Membership Scheme applies shall phase the scheme so that it shall initially
        apply to the first and second division of the Football League, thence after a period of
        not less than 3 years the scheme shall apply to the third and fourth divisions of the
        Football League.’.
SPEAKING NOTE


1.     Mr Speaker, the Government has always accepted that the
technology to be used in the national membership scheme must be
                                                              ■**




properly tested before the scheme can begin. When we discussed
this subject in Committee, I said- if I may quote my own words -
that "testing the technology for the scheme would be part of the
preparations for implementation". I also repeated, as I have
done many times before, that "we shall not go ahead with
implementation until we are satisfied that the technology is
workable, efficient and safe". It is not in the Government's
interests, any more than it is in anyone else's, to see the
scheme start up in an unsafe condition.
2.     It will be for the Football Membership Authority to come
up with a realistic programme for testing the technology for the
scheme. I do not think that it is helpful now to try to reach
definite conclusions about what that timetable should be.      In
particular, I do not think that it will be helpful to write into
the Bill, as the amendments proposed by my Hon Friends would do,
a specific requirement about "thorough" testing, for certain
periods of time.    I would put it to my Hon Friends that a
provision of this kind could create a minefield of legal dispute.
Would "thorough" mean testing at every club and in all possible
weather conditions or something less? What are the "winter"
months? What if next winter is a very mild one?


3.    I would suggest that there is a real danger that an
amendment of this kind could give rise to endless, unhelpful and
expensive disputes involving the FMA, the Secretary of State and
individual clubs as well. That would be in no-one's interests. I
recognise that my Hon Friends, and other Hon Members, wish to be
certain that the technology will be tested properly. But I hope
that they would accept that the FMA and the Secretary of State
have the greatest possible incentive to ensure that the
technology will work properly before the scheme begins. It is
after all they who will have the responsibility if there are
serious problems after implementation.


[IF PRESSED 4.    I would not dispute the proposition that the
technology will need to be tested on dark and wet evenings, as
well as sunny Saturday afternoons.       That does not mean that
testing must continue throughout the whole of what may be
described as the winter, still less that it needs to be tested
throughout a whole season.      It does mean that the FMA should
devise a sensible programme.]


5.     I should also make the point that testing the technology
is not the sate thing as phasing the implementation of the
scheme. We and the FMA will "have regard to the desirability of
a phased application of the scheme" as we are required to do,
by Clause 6 of the Bill. But we very much hope that phasing will
not be necessary because of the serious risk that hooligans
banned from clubs inside the scheme would simply transfer their
attentions to clubs outside. A hooligan convicted of an offence
at one Football League club would be free to attend matches at
another. This could have particularly serious implications if
clubs outside the scheme could not be brought in for a period
such as three years [as the Opposition appears to want]. In
accepting the principle of a realistic testing programme, I am
not accepting that a long series of stages in different divisions
of the Football League is desirable.

6.     Mr Speaker, the Government wants the scheme to be tested
properly before it is introduced. The FMA will want it to be
tested. It is in both our interests that it should be. We do
not need to amend the Bill in a way that could give rise to any
 number of arguments about interpretation, to ensure that adequate
 testing will be carried out. I invite my Hon Friends to withdraw
 their amendment.

        SPEAKING NOTE


        1.    I beg to move amendment number 37.


        2.    All these amendments primarily concern provision for the
        expenses of the FLA.

        3.    Amendment 37 provides for the Football Licensing
        Authority's expenses to be paid by the Secretary of State.
        Amendment 38 provides that the licence fees charged by the
        Licensing Authority may be fixed so as to reimburse the expenses
        it incurs under Part I of the Bill. The Licensing Authority is
        then obliged under this amendment to pay the fees it receives to
        the Secretary of State so that at least some of the expenses paid
        by him to the Licensing Authority are recovered. As I have said
        before in Committee we have decided that it would be appropriate
        to meet the costs of the Licensing Authority by a mix of licence
        fees and grant aid. We would not therefore intend that all of
        these expenses should be recovered by licence fees.
4.     New   Clause 1 makes clear that any expenses of the
Secretary of State under the Bill are to come out of his Votes.
This will include any expenses paid by the Secretary of State to
the Licensing Authority or to the Enforcing Authority. In line
with normalGovernment accounting procedures the licence fees
paid by the Authorityto the Secretary of State areto be treated
as revenue    and thisNew Clause provides for the Secretary of
State to surrender them to the Consolidated Fund. Amendments 39
and 40 are consequential amendments.


5.     As I said last Friday, when replying to the debate on the
Ways and Means Resolution, we cannot be precise about the cost
of the Licensing Authority or the level of fees to be charged
until its functions have been finalised.       In particular a
commencement order is required before the Licensing Authority's
safety powers under Clause 13 can be exercised. This will be
debated, as Honourable Members know, following receipt of the
final report of Lord Justice Taylor into the Hillsborough
disaster.
6.     As I also said in last Friday's debate our provisional
estimate of the costs to be recovered from licence fees is
£250,000. I- indicated that I have sympathy with the idea of a
sliding scale of fees which would mean higher charges for the
big clubs, lower charges for the smaller clubs. But this is a
matter which we must discuss further with the football
authorities.


7.     I commend the amendments and New Clause 1 to the House.
Background Note (for information only)


Level of fees

The estimated annual cost of the FLA of £0.65m may need to be
revised once a decision on location has been taken.  In turn the
provisional figure of £0.25m from football in licence fees may
need to be increased.     We recommend that no announcement on
likely fees is made until we have firmed up on overall costs and
then consulted the football authorities on fee structure (before
the end of the y e a r ).

A sliding scale of £4,000 from a First Division club, £3,000 for
the Second, £2,000 for the Third and £1,000 for the Forth would
produce £224,000.   A blanket charge would be approximately £2,500
and raise £230,000.


Local Authority Licence fees

Local authorities are empowered to charge for ground safety
certificates.  The charge may not exceed the cost of the wor
they undertake in connection with issuing the certificate.   We
know that, in practice, some local authorities charge in fu
(where the cost can run to some £7,000) others in part and some
not at all.

The legislation governing the licensing of public entertainments,
including   indoor  sports  entertainments,   empowers  licensing
authorities to charge applicants for licences a reasonable fee,
to be determined by the licensing authority.  A similar situation
exists as far as licences for public performances of plays under
the Theatres Act 1968 are concerned.

The maximum fees a licencing authority may charge in connection
with cinema licences are prescribed by statute, section 3(7) o
the Cinemas Act 1985.  There is provision in the Act for the fees
to be amended by statutory instrument.        The maximum fee a
licensing authority may charge in the case of a grant or renewa
for one year of a cinema licence is £173.50.

Thus the position on local authorities charging for licences
varies widely, they have discretion and that leads to variation
in practice and charges.   Examples of annual licence fees are
attached as an annex.

    Notes      (a)   The distance from the nearest cylinder to a boundary, building etc should be not less than the distance given
                     in column 3 when measured around the fire wall.
               (b)   Minimum distance from nearest cylinder to fire wall should be 1.5m except as qualified in paragraphs 73 and
                     75 for quantities up to 400kg.
               (c)   No separation distance is required for these quantities where boundary walls and buildings are of suitable
                     construction (paragraphs 69 to 71).

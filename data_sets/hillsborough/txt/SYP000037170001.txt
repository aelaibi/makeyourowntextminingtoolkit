         For the at t e n t i o n of
         Chief Su pe ri n t e n d e n t Foster


         Dear Mr.       Jones,

         Further to my visit to Ne ch e l ls Green Pol ic e St ati on in the co mpa ny
         of Miss Eliza bet h Steel on Frid ay last (28th Jul y 1989).        I wou ld
         like to con vey my thanks to Mr. Foster and his c o ll ea gu es for the
         c o ur te sy ext end ed to us during what was a very inf or ma ti ve and
         useful visit.

         As I di s c u s s e d with Mr. Foster and Mr. Tope, the work of my team
         and oth er social se rvi ce s core groups with be r e a v e d families, and
         with su rv ivo rs of the tragedy, has in cr ea si ng ly made use of video
         mat eri al and a range of photpgjaphs.                Until now we have used video
         ma te ri al culled from B.B.C. transmissions, but will sh o r t l y be in
         a po s i t i o n to use the ma te r i a l p r e p a r e d by y o u r s e l v e s for Lord
         J us tic e Taylor' s Inquiry.       P h o t og ra ph ic mat eri al av ai la bl e to us
         is, again, largel y c o n f i n ed to what was a c t u a l l y p u b l i s h e d by the
         Press, alt ho ug h one or two new sp ap er s have pr o v i d e d us with a d d i t ­
         ional prints.

         It is rather di ff ic u lt to de sc ri be in detail just how useful such
         ma te ri al is; however, I hope that I co nv e y ed to Mr. Foster the
         essenc e of this, viz, that in taking survi vor s throug h their
         ex pe ri e n c e in close detail they are bet te r able to talk about and
         perha ps exo rci se the oft en hor rif ic m e mo ri es of that afternoon.
         (While si mil ar wo rk is ap pr o p r i a t e with b e r e a v e d families, it is
         with su rv iv or s that this a pp ro ac h comes into its own).

         To this end I w ou ld like to for mally reques t that the video and
         p h o t o g r a p h i c mat eri al that your team has a c c u m u l a t e d is made
         ava il ab le to us at an ear ly date.           I ap pr e c i a t e that this will requir e
         the agr ee me nt of the Coroner, and w ou ld t h e re fo re be gra tef ul if
         you wo ul d discus s this reques t with him.              In the meantime,
         Mr. Foster has k i nd ly of fe re d to a ll ow my staff to visit by a p p o i n t ­
         ment and view mat eri al rel ev an t to spe cif ic clients.                  In the course
         of the next few weeks I shall be glad to take up this offer.

       Once again, may I thank your col le ag ue s for their c o ns id er ab le
       a ss is t a n c e on Friday, and I look forward to c on tin ui ng a p r od uc ti ve
       w or kin g r e l a t i o n s h i p with them.

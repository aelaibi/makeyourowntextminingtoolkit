Mr Storr, on information revival from Mr Jfertin Brandon Bravo MP,
tells me that there is an event to be organised in the House of Commons
(date not taiown) at which a superintendent at the South Yorkshire
Police will present extracts of video tape footage from the
Hillsborough disaster.   It came to the Private Office here on the basis
of a tentative enquiry Aether the Home Secretary would like to be
present - wisely refused.


2.   But I thought you and other ropy recipients should know of it and
if it is possible, tactfullyfto discover how this event came to be
arranged it would be helpful to know.

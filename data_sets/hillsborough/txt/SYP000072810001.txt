time      I a r r i v e d there.           I h a d n ’t seen any fans             drinking        outside     or

inside          the    ground,       everyone was           just       high spirited.

            Once     the terraces         of    p e n s 3 a n d 4 fae ca i t s e f u 3.1 1 find    it hard to

             u n d e r s t a n d why the Police were             so slow to      react.,    ihere    seems      to have

             been a complete         breakdown           in commu n i c a t i o n between       p o 1 i c e and stewa rd s

            an d    they d i d n ’t realise what was                happening        in front     of them.      The

            Hillsborough          is a more         tl^n^ ^ ^ e ^ u a t e   ground   but the disaster           seems    to

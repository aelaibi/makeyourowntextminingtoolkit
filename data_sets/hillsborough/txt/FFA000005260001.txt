Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987

               Pact III of the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of
               Sport Aot 1987 and the safety of Places of sport
               Regulations 1988 come into effect on 1st January
               1989. They provide for a safety certification by
               local authorities for certain covered stands at
               sports grounds, known as “regulated" stands, and for
               subsequent inspections.

               Part III o£ the 1987 Act does not apply to sports
               grounds already designated under the Safety of
               Sports Grounds Act 1973 as requiring a safety
               certificate for the whole ground.   It does stipulate
               that a stand at a non-designated sports ground which
               could, in the estimation of the local authority,
               accommodate at least 500 spectators under aover
               whether standing or seated, must have a safety
               certificate.  Such a stand is termed a "regulated"
               stand.  Temporary stands are excluded.

           Application forms are obtainable from the local
           authority.  A safety certificate will contain terms
           and conditions which will deal with such things as
           exits, exit routed, stairways, gangways, barrier
           protection, fire precautions and stewarding.

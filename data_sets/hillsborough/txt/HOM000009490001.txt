        Thank you for your letter of 25 September to the Home Secretary.
1 am sorry that you were not satisfied with my letter of 18 September. You
say that it is simply not good enough to place the responsibility for safety
of spectators at football grounds on local authorities, but I have to point
out that that is how the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 is drafted.

        The statutory power under section 6(2) of the 1975 Act does not enable
the Secretary of State to make regulations which would add to the provisions
of the Act, for example authorising him to oversee safety certificates. That
is why, as I have explained, the Government is seeking appropriate powers for
the proposed Football Licensing Authority in its Football Spectators Bill.

        I should like to assure you again about the Home Secretary's concern
over safety at football grounds and the importance that he attaches to a
proper response by local authorities and clubs for the recommendations
contained in Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report. That response is being
carefully monitored and in the light of it and of the final report of the
Taylor inquiry, consideration will be given to the need for any further
action.

        When you spoke to me on the telephone you asked me about the status
of the proposed Football Licensing Authority. Present proposals are that the
FLA will be an independent non-departmenta 1 public body. Appointments to the
FLA will be made by the Secretary of State for Environment in consultation
with the Home Secretary in respect of those appointments which have a bearing
on the authority's safety role.

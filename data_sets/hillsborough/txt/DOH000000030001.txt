1. I have now seen your submission of 26 April which you copied to
Mrs Richards.

2. I don't see the change in the rules that you propose in your Option 3 as
being the sort of structural change that would breach our undertaking to local
authorities not to alter the Community Charge Benefit arrangements between
June 1989 and October 1990. The main purpose behind the undertaking was to
allow the authorities to develop their software without having to incorporate
last minute reprogrammings.^ I don't see extending the period of disregard for
compensation payments as having software consequences; presumably the way that
it will work will be that local authority staff, having satisfied themselves
that the compensation payments fall within the necessary criteria and
time-bands, will not feed them into the benefit calculations.

3. Do you agree this view? If so, the change would not have to wait until
1990 to be implemented, but I think we would need to consult the authorities
informally to check that they agree too. However if the eventual decision is
that it does represent a structural change, implementation would need to be
delay until October 1990 rather than Summer 1990 in order to comply with the
spirit of the undertaking.

               HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER APPEAL FUND

1.   Your minute of 30 November asked for an early response to
two options raised by SofS for treating payments made by the
Hillsborough Disaster Appeal Fund, namely, to extend the period
of the current disregard of compensation payments held on trust
and to disregard all payments made from the Fund.           For
completeness, we have also looked again at the option of
disregarding payments from all Disaster Funds.    An assessment
of these options is at Annex 1.

OPTION 1: EXTENDING THE DISREGARD FOR CAPITAL HELD ON TRUST

2.   Relaxing the current rule could not help bereaved families
as the disregard only relates to compensation to the injured
for injuries sustained. Nor, as far as we can ascertain, would
it apply to the 20 very seriously injured who have already
received final payments from the Appeal Fund in the form of
discretionary trusts.   Capital held in such trusts does not
belong to the injured person and therefore would not be taken
into account in any event.

3.   But   this  option   could  offer   some   help   to   those
Hillsborough victims who were less seriously injured and
therefore may receive lump sum payments.    There are about 700
of them and around 35 could be receiving Income Support, with
perhaps more on Housing Benefit.    Compensation payments will
vary according to their injuries but will average £7,000 and
are due to be made before or shortly after Christmas.    If these
payments were placed on trust, the current rule would enable
the capital to be ignored for at least 2 years.    Relaxing this
provision would help if there were more than £3,000 left in the
Trust fund after the 2 years       (capital up to £3,000 is
disregarded anyway). The amount of capital held on trust
t


    could, of course, be increased if the victims also received
    payments from the South Yorkshire Police Authority or as   a
    result of court action.

    4.   The concession would also assist other claimants, who have
    received or do receive, compensation because of a personal
    injury and put it into a trust fund.

    5.   If Ministers wished to introduce a full disregard of the
    capital value of all compensation payments held on trust, this
    could be introduced for all income-related benefits in October
    1990. The benefit costs would be in the order of £   pa.

        OPTION 2: FULL DISREGARD OF PAYMENTS FROM HILLSBOROUGH
                  DISASTER FUND

        OPTION 3: FULL DISREGARD OF PAYMENTS FROM ALL DISASTER
                  FUNDS

    6.   Both these options would help the bereaved and injured.
    However, in view of the time lapse of 8 months since the
    Hillsborough Disaster, any major change to the rules now could
    result in Ministers being criticised for not acting sooner.
    There have been 7 disasters during the past 12 months although
    as far as we are aware only 5 bereaved claimants - all
    Hillsborough victims - have lost benefit.

    7.   Moreover, both options have serious political and policy
    drawbacks. Option 2 in particular is likely to place Ministers
    under very strong pressure to make similar concessions for all
    disasters. And both options may attract demands for a complete
    disregard of all forms of compensation for death or personal
    injury, which may prove difficult to resist especially if they
    have not received support from any public appeal fund.    This
    may, in turn, lead to wider demands for relaxing the capital
    rules generally which would be very costly.    We are, unable
    therefore, to recommend either option.

    CONCLUSION

    8.   Targeting the disregards     on the    injured   seems  the
    appropriate response to compensation payments.     It recognises
    that these people may need to call upon their capital resources
    for specific and extra help throughout their lifetime.       All
    injured people, including those injured at Hillsborough, can
    take advantage of the rule. In contrast, the bereaved families
    who receive lump sum compensation payments do not normally
    incur the same extra expense as the injured.   It can be argued,
    therefore, that their capital should be treated no differently
    to that of other claimants, some of whom may also have been
    recompensed for the loss of a relative by, such as, the
    Criminal    Injuries   Compensation    Board    or    insurance.
    Consequently, they do not need additional support from public
    funds if their capital exceeds the appropriate limit (£6,000 or
    £8,000). When their capital reduces in the normal way they may
    requalify for benefit while still retaining a sizable amount of
    capital.
9.   It appears, therefore, both sensible and defensible to
treat payments from disaster funds in a manner consistent with
the way other claimants'     capital resources are treated.
Ministers will be only too aware that the more exceptions made
to the regulations the less simple and structured the scheme
becomes, and the more difficult it is for staff to operate.

10.   Ministers are invited to say whether they wish to:

     (1)   disregard the whole of any payments made in respect
of a personal injury that are held on trust - which officials
see as the appropriate response to the situation;

and whether they agree that there should be:

     (2)   no disregard of all payments from the Hillsborough
Disaster Appeal Fund, and

     (3)   no   disregard   of   all   payments   from   any    Disaster
Appeal Fund,

for the reasons given above.

11. Depending on what Ministers decide, we will                provide   a
draft for an inspired PQ/Press release if required.

HILLSBOROUGH and HOUSING BENEFIT (& CCB)

1. You wanted some best guesses at the cost of disregarding
Hillsborough payments, and you gave me   some guides as to
possible payments.

2.   Attached are sheets     setting out current costs, and
estimates  for 1990 with the introduction of the Community
Charge and Community charge Benefit.

3. For 1989/90 the full year cost would appear to be £68,000:
if you got the disregard in for 1 January, the cost would be
one quarter of this, £17,000.

4. For 1990/91 onwards the full year cost appears to be in the
order of  £70,000 - HB £47,000  and CCB £23,000.  I agree with
you that these full year costs shrink and then disappear as the
lump sum capital is reasonably used and brings the people back
into (more) benefit.   And I accept your three year period for
the average lump sum payment.

5.   I needn't empahsise how many health warnings should           be
attached to these budgenesses. But are they any help?

    HILLSBOROUGH

    HOUSING BENEFIT AND COMMUNITY CHARGE BENEFIT


    1.   Disregard THE WHOLE CAPITAL PAYMENT

             Example of payment already made to a widow with dependant son

                      Lump sum                     15,000

                      Sum in trust for son         25,000

             The lump sum would exclude, until reasonably reduced to
             below the capital limit.


             Future sums likely to go to up to 700 people, but
             will probably average £7,000.

             This sum would exclude if together with other capital savings
             go over the capital limit.   Or, it would be taken as tariff
             of £16 per week if there was no other capital.

         received          letter   from   my   constituent.    Dr
           of                                                   Wantage,
in which he says,

         (Would you) "make absolutely sure that the recipients of
         proceeds of the Lockerbie Disaster Dund do not lose their
         normal DHSS benefits.  Those who contributed to this fund
         did not do so for the government to take it and give it
         to the DHSS.  For that we pay our taxes".

I would welcome your comments.

1.   Secretary of State was grateful for the lines to take which you
provided on this, last week.            ,

2.   Ministers have been giving further thought to the substantive
issue, on the basis of the options outlined in your submission of
26 April.  Secretary of State and PS(C) regard option (3) as
attractive - extending the period of the disregard for compensation
payments held on trust - and would be grateful if you could do some
more detailed work on this. Secretary of State was impressed by the
advantages of this approach as outlined in para 9 of the anruex to
your submission. He also commented that there would be particular
advantage in linking this proposal with an improvement in the       j
disregard for charitable and voluntary payments in general (the     /
increase from £5 to £10 a week mentioned in your submission of
21 November).                                                 ^

3.   It would be helpful to have, also, an assessment of the
possibility, and a note on the likely costs, of drawing a special
provision (along Macfarlane Trust lines) very tightly, so as to
totally disregard all payments from the Hillsborough Disaster Fund.
(We understand that there are only five known cases in Hillsborough,
and the costs should therefore not be large).

4.   Could we have a note early next week, please?

FOR INF


HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER APPEAL FUND


L in e t o ta k e :


Most Social Security benefits are not affected by payments from the
Hillsborough Disaster Fund.       However, substantial payments made recently to a
small number of people in receipt of Income Support, Housing Benefit or Family
Credit may have taken their capital over the limit for receiving those
benefits.       We are making enquiries into the cases known to have been affected.

             The Hillsborough Family Support  Group have  asked
        me to work with them to promote their organisation and
        its objectives.  I enclose a copy of the six objectives
        of the Group.

            They also made contact because a large number of
        my constituents were killed in the Hillsborough disaster
        and they wanted help     in their campaign    for justice.
        You may remember that, after the disaster, I asked you
        at  Prime Minister's Question Time whether any money   paid
        out of the Disaster Fund would be ignored when the DSS
        was calculating   a   family's   entitlement to    benefit.

             Following this Question I had correspondence        from
        a large number of people who expressed horror at the
        thought of the contributions they were giving to the
        Fund possibly disqualifying families from benefit.        One
        unemployed person in Liverpool,     for example, had paid
        out £20.00 from his dole into the Fund.    He was distraught,
        to put it mildly, that his enormous sacrifice might lead
        to families losing entitlement to benefit.

             Recently, the Secretary of the Support Group, Barry
        Devonside, has been in touch with me.     What we feared
        is now happening.    Money is being paid from the Fund
        and families   are oeing   made  ineligible for benefit.

             I have   details    from   two families.     Both   come   from
        Merseyside.

             One mother lost her                  son as a result
        of the disaster.     You, in fact, met and spoke to her
        while she was by her son's side in the intensive care
        unit   at  the  Northern  General  Hospital  in Sheffield.
        This mother had been working part time, and after the
        disaster went to college and had to give up her part-
        time job.    The DSS told her that as she had given up
        a job of her own accord she would be suspended from benefit
        for six months.

             She appealed against this decision and was awarded
        a reduced rate of £24.00.   This was paid for four weeks.
        Her case was further reviewed and a full benefit of £34.94
        was then paid.

     Recently, she received a cheque from the Fund and
told the DSS of this fact.     She was immediately told
that she would lose benefit, and indeed her benefit has
been withdrawn.

     A second example is of a mother who, while divorced,
was in the process of rebuilding her marriage with her
ex-husband when the disaster occurred.      She lost her
husband and her son at I^illsborough.

      Two weeks after losing part of her      family the DSS
 told this mother on the      'phone that should she gain a
 sizeable capital sum from the Fund she would lose benefit.
 Since then the local office has telephoned her a number
_of times to ask what help she has received from the Disaster
Fund.

     She  received a cheque and told the DSS* but        she
has not yet heard back if or when they are stopping her
benefit.   As this mother told me:      'I don't really know
where I stand.     I don't know what to live on.     I don't
know whether I will be able to live       on the cheque from
the Disaster Fund and, if so, how long the DSS Vill expect
me to live off this sum' .       The mother obviously wants
to know, if she has to live off the compensation payment,
when she would fee eligible again for benefit.

     During our initial exchange I was anxious that monies
paid from the Hillsborough Disaster Fund should be treated
in the same way as payments from the Macfarlane Fund.
The Government established this Fund in order to make
payments to haemophiliacs infected from AIDS from blood
products supplied by the National Health Service.

     It appears that this    approach is not being followed
for families who lost someof their members at Hillsborough.
Taking away benefit once compensation payments are paid
strikes me as unfair.    That is certainly how the families
view it, and I guess you will too.    Is it possible, please,
to review the position as a matter of urgency and give
the Hillsborough families     the   same protection as was
extended to individual haemophiliacs and/ their families
affected by the HIV virus in blood products/

                                HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - DRAFT TRUST DOCS


                 1.   Thank, you for letting us, see the. draft, trust documents . I
                 have had the opportunity of; discussing them with a representative
                 of SOL B1 whose advice has been taken into account in this reply.

                 2.   The "disabled" and "inexperienced adult" trusts appear to be
                 entirely discretionary with! regard to the capital held;  at least
                 so far as the initial beneficiaries are concerned.   Consequently:
         ^       neither would represent a capital asset of the claimant.

         4       3.   Under the "disabled’'^ trust the trustees have discretion
                 whether or not to make payments from income but in the event that
             £
                 they do, atleast half of such income must go to the claimant.       I
     f           am not sure   just how this would work in practice but the AO would
                 treat any paymients made in the normal way as either income or
 c*              capital.

                 4.   The "inexperienced adult" trust provides for the beneficiary
                 an absolute   life interest in the income of the funds.
                 Consequently any payments from the fund would be taken into
                 account in full and attributed to a period equal to the period
                 over which it accrued.    However should the trustees not make any
                 payments from the income of the fund to a claimant the AO may not
                 treat the claimant as possessed of that income by virtue of the
                 excepting provision in regulation 42(2)(b) of the General
                 Regulations.

                 5.   The 2 trusts relating to minors have the same provisions as
                 each other.  Both are contingent trusts in relation to income and
                 capital, the contingency being the attainment of the age of 25
                 years, so neither represents a capital asset before the
                 beneficiary attains that age.  Neither confers any rights as to
\L               income prior to the contingency thus any payments made from the
                 income should be dealt with in the normal way, as and when made.

                 6.   I do not see the trusts affecting adversely any IS claim,
                 subject to the above observations as to income, providing they
                 are drawn up in accordance with these drafts.   Obviously an AO
                 faced with the question once the trusts are up and running would
                 have to have regard to the actual wording used.

                      HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - TRUST FUNDS


1.     We spoke on 8 11 89 about my minute to you of 16 10 89.
You w o n dered whet h e r it would be possible to treat the income
from the "inexperienced adult" trust as a charitable or voluntary
payment and afford any claimant the benefit of the disregard in
paragraph 15 of schedule 9 to the IS (Gen) Regs.        Your concern
was that the fund was derived from voluntary donations to a
national appeal and so could the income those donations generated
be similarly voluntary payments?

2.    I took this point back to Sol B 1 . Their advise to me is
that since paragraph 15 of schedule 9 relates to the actual
payments made it is necessary to look at the circumstances
surrounding their being made.   Those payments are made, or due to
be made, by virtue of the terms of the trust.    Undoubtedly the
trust funds were derived from donations made voluntarily.
However, the trustees are bound to distribute the income to the
beneficiaries under the terms of the trust.    That is what causes
them to be made.   There is no nexus between the donations and the
payments under consideration; consequently it is not a voluntary
payment.   Similar reasoning would lead to the conclusion that
neither are they charitable payments.

3.     In the light of this advise I can confirm that should that
p articular draft be used then our guidance would be as contained
in paragraph 4 of my minute of 16 11 89.    Please ring if I can be
of further assistance.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER FUND - PAYMENTS IN TRUST


1. Thank you for your minute of 8 June enclosing Mr Wheatley’s reply of
31 May which I found helpful.

2. I note your position though I still feel that it is risky to discount at
this stage the possibility of a wider interpretation: I think we would wish to
avoid the embarrassment of another                         RSB 2/89 [no slight
intended!]

3. We are, however, a long way from putting the treatment of such payments to
the test, given that there needs to be a significant payment from the Fund to
a person in circumstances where he or she does not satisfy your "presence”
test and for that money to be held on trust. Should such a case come to your
notice I ’m sure you will let us know. In the appropriate circumstances,
however, I hope that you will consider taking the case to the Commissioner.

1.    Thankyou for your reply of 2 May  1989 to Mrs |          | You
may wish to note the content of an enquiry from SS(DIC),      a copy
of which is attached.

2.   To take paragraph 4 of the minute, first of all it is true
we were interested in the effects of the Zeebrugge awards but
working only from the newspaper article - see 'A' on rhs - the
term "pathological grief" seems to have been used in connection
with the persons present at the scene of the disaster. I would
still regard presence as critical and the reason for payment as
irrelevant if presence was not established. Clearly the matter is
of great importance and I can see the view of D1C that, if it is
at all possible we should accept traumatic stress or grief as
constituting a personal injury.

3.   I have now been sent a copy of correspondence from the
National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux in which it is
strongly suggested that either concessionary legislation might be
considered or a 'sympathetic revision'      be made of present
guidance to adjudication officers - copy is marked 'B' on rhs.

4.    D1C have advised that no new regulations are envisaged. We
are happy with the advice you have provided but we do seem to be
moving into very difficult areas. I would therefore greatly
appreciate any further comments you can provide as soon as
possible.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER FUND - CAPITAL DISREGARD



1.  I refer to your minute of 17 May and to that of Mr Provan
(D1C) of 10 May.  It seems to me that the newspaper article in
relation to the Zebrugge disaster takes us little further.   In
my earlier minute I indicated that those claimants falling
within my first two specified groups would probably benefit from
the disregard afforded by the Income Support Regulations,
accordingly, it would appear, that we are now only concerned
with the third group ie those not actually at the football
ground.  If this is the case then I do not think that the
commentary on the Zebrugge awards assists us, indeed it is clear
that this very question of this group was left open, to be
tackled in relation to a later "disaster".

2. At present the law in relation to the concept in tort known
as nervous shock takes us little further than indicating, by
case law, that a good claim can be grounded in tort for personal
injury, consisting of nervous shock, where a person was present
at an accident and actually witnesses that accident, whether by
sight or sound, and the impact of that is such to cause him
mental suffering.  The current case law does not consider
whether a person can ground a claim for nervous shock on the
basis of having seen the disaster on television, knowing that a
near relative was present at the disaster.  It therefore remains
my opinion that the bereaved relative who is at home when the
disaster occurs and who later receives a payment in respect of
general mental pain and suffering due to a bereavement cannot be
said to have suffered a personal injury for the purposes of the
IS legislation; where the term "personal injury" is not
specifically defined in legislation^then one must interpret that
phrase in accordance with its general meaning within the law at
large.

3. However, it may be helpful in considering this question to
consider the terms of the trust fund and the basis upon which
payments can be made out of that fund.  It may be that the type
of injury for which payments can be made are defined in the
Deed, this could be of assistance to the Department in applying
the IS Regulations.

                           HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER FUND


Further to our telephone conversation yesterday afternoon,                    I am
sending this by way of an interim response.

Consideration is being given, in conjunction with our solicitors
(to whom further reference haB been made), as to whether any
additional or modified guidance is called for to assist AOs in
dealing with oases involving payments from the fund.

We would wish to stress that a blanket approach doeB not seem to
be appropriate in cases involving the deprivation question and
that it is likely we would be wishing to stress the need for an
individual approach.

As soon as we have received a response fromjSol Bl, we will write
in more detail.                          / /   *

         PQ 1718 1988/89:     TONY SPELLER (NORTH DEVON)


         1. Although down as an oral PQ I understand that PQ 1718 is listed number 30
         and is unlikely to be reached. S of S has asked for a definitive reply to be
         given so that any subsequent PQs can simply be referred to it. A suggested
         reply showing how particular payments would be treated under the
         income-related benefit schemes, is attached: the affect on Social Fund
         payments is not included. It is not possible to be more definite because the
         Hillsborough Disaster Fund have not yet started to make payments and there is
         an absence of information about payments from earlier disaster funds.
         Consequently, the reply may quickly outlive its usefulness when details of the
         Hillsborough payments are available.

         2. The effect of payments from the Hiljsborough Disaster Fund is being
         monitored throughout the Merseyside and neighbouring Social Security offices.
         The Fund's administrators advise that they have made one payment (£200) so far
         to assist a parent with car insurance and road tax to enable him to visit his
         daughter in hospital. Further, payments are expected to be made by the
         trustees this month. In the meantime, Social Services Departments are making
         payments on behalf of the Fund to meet immediate hardship. These payments are
         small and unlikely to affect the income-related benefits.

         3. PQ 1718 is framed wider than the two recent PQs about Hillsborough (copies
         attached) in that it relates to the effect of payments from any disaster fund
         on Social Security benefits. The MP appears interested in the current affects
         rather than what might have happened to benefits years ago: nevertheless
         enquiries have been made about some past disasters.

         4. As to the most recent disasters - Bradford (1985), Zeebrugge (1987),
         Kings Cross (1987), Clapham (1988), Lockerbie (1988) and Hillsborough
         (15 April 1989), the local offices most likely to be involved report no affect
         on any current or past benefit. Precise information is not available. Of
         course, prior to April 1988 neither Housing Benefit nor Family Income
         Supplement had a capital rule and, like most Social Security benefits, would
         not have been affected by lump sum payments.

         5. Going back further, Penzance local office recall that the Penlee lifeboat
         disaster (Dec 1981) may have resulted in the withdrawal of Supplementary
         Benefit from two or three widows following the receipt of lump sum payments
         from the disaster fund. At that time the rules were less generous than they
         are now. The capital limit for Supplementary Benefit in 1980-81 was £2,000
2




    rising to £2,500 from 1982 - now it is £6,000 in Income Support. In addition,
    concessions are available in some instances when the payments from the fund
    are placed on trust for the recipients.

    As the MP for N Devon, Tony Speller may be aware of the effects of the Penlee
    tragedy.

        Payments from disaster funds do not affect the majority of Social Security
        benefits.


        The income-related benefits - Income Support, Family Credit and Housing
        Benefit - may be affected by payments from disaster funds but this will depend
        on the size and nature of the payments.    The first £5 a week of any regular
        payment may be disregarded and a lump sum payment will not affect benefit
        unless it takes the claimant's capital over £3000.    An income of £1 a week is
        assumed for every £250, or part thereof, of capital between £3000 and £6000 in
        Income Support and Family Credit, and between £3000 and £8000 in Housing
        Benefit.    No Income Support or Family Credit is payable if the capital held is
        over £6000, and no Housing Benefit is available if it is over £8000.


        However, capital held on trust may be disregarded.    For example, any payment
        made from a disaster fund because of a personal injury, which is placed on
        trust, is fully disregarded for at least 2 years and, in the case of a child,
        for as long as the child is a dependant.    Any actual payments from   the trust
        will be taken into account as income or capital in the normal way.     In
        addition, any payment made to a third party will be completely disregarded if
        it is used to provide goods or services which are not already met by benefit.
        Officials continue to liaise with the administrators of the Hillsborough
        Disaster Fund and they have advised them of the Social Security rules.


        The 1989 Social Security Bill will not result in any Social Security benefit
        being recovered from payments made from any disaster fund.

 Payments from disaster funds do not affect the majority of Social Security
 benefits.     I have no knowledge of any such payment affecting the current
 income-related benefits - Income Support, Housing Benefit and Family Credit -
 although the majority of payments from the Hillsborough Disaster Fund have yet
 to be made.     Officials continue to liaise with the administrators of the
 Hillsborough Disaster Fund and they have advised them of the Social Security
 rules.

MR NICHOLAS SCOTT
Payments from disaster funds do not affect the majority of Social
Security benefits.


The income-related benefits - Income Support, Family Credit and
Housing Benefit - may be affected by payments from disaster funds
but this will depend on the size and nature of the payments.        The
first £5 a week of any regular payment may be disregarded and a lump
sum payment will not affect benefit unless it takes the claimant's
capital over £3000.     An income of £1 a week is assumed for every
£250, or part thereof, of capital between £3000 and £6000 in Income
Support and Family Credit, and between £3000 and £8000 in Housing
Benefit.     No Income Support or Family Credit is payable if the
capital held is over £6000, and no Housing Benefit is available if
it is over £8000.


However, capital held on trust may be disregarded.      For example, any
payment made from a disaster fund because of a personal injury,
which is placed on trust, is fully disregarded for at least 2 years
and, in the case of a child, for as long as the child is a
dependant.     Any actual payments from the trust will be taken into
account as income or capital in the normal way.     In addition, any
payment made to a third party will be completely disregarded if it
is used to provide goods or services which are not already met by
benefit.     Officials continue to liaise with the administrators of
the Hillsborough Disaster Fund and they have advised them of the
Social Security rules.


The 1989 Social Security Bill will not result in any Social Security
benefit being recovered from payments made from any disaster fund.

      No payments have yet been made by the Hillsborough Disaster Fund and therefore
      it is not possible to say whether and how they might affect benefits.
      Officials have been in touch with the Fund's administrators to advise their on
      the social security rules.      The majority of social security benefits would not
      in any case be affected by any payment from the Fxmd.

The majority of social security benefits will not be affected by payments from
the Hillsborough Disaster Fund.   Until details of the payments are known,       it
is not possible to say whether any of the income-related benefits will be
affected.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER FUND : UPDATE


The only change since my minute of 11 May is that the size of the Fund has
increased. The second point in the Background Note should now be as follows

   "At 16 May the Hillsborough Disaster Fund stands at about £4.3m -
   donations are still coming in".

    To   Mr                        17 May 1989

                   is on holiday until after Whitsun. The Fund stood at £4,338,728
    at 10 May (pm). Trustees are to meet Monday 22 May to consider the next of
    kin and probably authorise payments to them. These will be initial payments
    by cheque which they hope to send out by Whit. Trustees will also be told
    about the number of injury claims but probably no decision on these until
    claims assessed. Mr            will attend the meeting in place of
    Mr Reddington.

    Payments likely to be lump sum rather than regular payments but even these
    will need to be considered in the light of circumstances.

    To   Mr Winckle 23 May

    Trustees met 22 May and decision made to make immediate cash payments
    (cheques) to next of kin of the bereaved plus a handful of the most seriously
    injured. They hope to send these out this week. Amounts were not asked about
    or stated, nor would this information be given to the media although we agreed
    that the Press could readily contact the victims.

    However, Mr Winckle did say that, given our explanation of the social security
    rules, the payments were unlikely to affect benefit - bij this I assumed they
    would be less than £3000 each.

    The Fund stood at £4,949,834 at 22 May pm.  [NB If each victim were to
    receive £3000 there would need to be approx 1650 of them].

    Mr Winckle said that BBC TV had approached them today saying they understood
    payments had been made and asking f these would affect .social security
    benefits. He had referred them to the individuals and their Social Security
    office*and said each person's circumstances were different.

Thank you for your letter of 10 Kay and for setting out the steps taken                                                                          H   '.
in regard to providing benefit advice for those        affected by the
Hillsborough disaster. I have passed this on to our Merseyside office so
that they will be in a position to take up any further local queries in
the Banner you suggest.
Ve are in touch with welfare benefits advisers frore the various local
authorities involved in a co-ordinated response to the disaster- In the
light of your letter of 21 April to Tony Banks HP, the advisers have beers
considering the likely position of people in receipt of m ans -tested
benefits - especially Incor&e Support and Housing Benefit - should they
receive payments from the disaster fund. Assuming that the current
fza&etfork of regulations is applied, it would appear that any regular
weekly payment froffi the fund over £5 per week would have the effect of
reducing entitlement to       benefit on a pound-for-pound basis. If any
capital payuients ate ssade from the fund, benefit would be affected once
capital reached £3,000 and would cease altogether if capital reached
££v000(incorae support) or £§,000(housing benefit).
One course of action to alleviate this position would be to introduce a
regulation enabling payments from the Hillsborough Disaster fund to be
disregarded. A acre modest proposal which might ccraaend itself to you
would be to introduce a delay in the application of the normal rules on
capital for an appropriate perioc, say two years; this could be designed
to apply to the Hillsborough Fund and to any other such fund as the
Secretary of State jnay on occasion consider appropriate. The.motivation

their relatives by having to stop their social security because of
payments they jaay receive from the Trust Fund; and partly to avoid the
diversion o£ capital payments from the fund(intended for special needs)to
day-to-day living expenses in order to avoid the cut-off.

Fund stood at £3.8m on 10/5/89 and was around £4m today with payments still
coming in.

Letters have been set to next-of-kin and replies are being received. The
intention is still to make payments by end of May. Unless something very
urgent occurred no payments would be made w/c 15 May: the trustees next sit
w/c 22 May. There are 4 trustees comprising a solicitor^chairman, the
Chairman of Liverpool Stock Exchange, the Chairman of Sheffield Chamber of
Commerce and the Chief Executive of Nottingham City Council.

Fund have made one payment themselves - £200 - to the father of a girl in
hospital for his car tax and insurance to assist with visiting. Mr Winckle
reminded me that the SSD were authorised to make immediate hardship payments
on their behalf which would eventually be recovered from the fund - the fund
had not settled any so far. SSDs were making small payments within their
budgets and not running into hundreds of pounds.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER FUND

Thank you for copying     ~            advice on the treatment of payments from
the Hillsborough Disaster Fund.

There obviously has to be some limit on what can be construed as a personal
injury but I'm not convinced that Sol B1 have got it quite right yet.

Indeed, I wonder if it is too early to say that some of the payments will
definitely not come within para 12 of Sch 10 given that the Fund have not paid
anything yet. Might it not be the case that it will turn on the reason for
payment? What I have in mind, for example, is that a bereaved relative
sitting at home on 15 April who receives a payment because of their mental
pain and suffering could well be said to have sustained a personal injury and
therefore gain from this particular disregard. In contrast, a payment which
compensates them for the loss of support from the deceased person might not:
though this is probably more likely to be a matter for the Courts than the
Fund.

I understand that you were going to review the position in the light of the
Independent's article on 29 April about payments to Zeebrugge victims and the
comparison made with Hillsborough. Perhaps in doing so you could take account
of the above comments and any further legal advice that is obtained.

We have now received our third PQ about Hillsborough so any fresh guidance on
the subject will be very welcome.

     TREATMENT OF PAYMENTS IN RESPECT OF INJURIES


     1. My minute of 17 April and                  reply of 20 April refer. I
     attach two newspaper cuttings which are of interest. We wish to know whether
     or not payments in respect of grief o r in respect of psychiatric injury
     caused by trauma are covered by paragraph 12 of Schedule 10 of the Income
     Support (General) Regulations 1987.

     2. On another point, please could you advise if a payment in consequence of
     an injury which is paid directly into a discretionary trust, and not to the
     beneficiary, would continue to be disregarded after 2 years. I realise that
     after 2 years deprivation rules will apply where the beneficiary places the
     money in trust, but if he or his advisors have no control over the payment
     being placed in trust, normal rules for treating capital held on trust would
     appear to apply.

 HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER FUND

 1.   You referred letters from Gerry Bermingham MP and Tony Banks MP and asked
 for advice.

 2.   I enclose a suggested reply to Gerry Bermingham relying heavily on
 Minister's letter of 27 April to Tony Banks which you said was copied to him.

 3.   The letter from Tony Banks raises no new issue and therefore does not
 require a response : nor do I think one is expected.

 Gerry Bermingham Esq MP




 Thank you for your letter of 27 April about payments from the Hillsborough
 Disaster Fund which obviously crossed in the post with your copy of my letter
 to Tony Banks on the same issue.


 I presume that I have now made the position absolutely clear.       The question
 you asked me in the House was very different to that asked subsequently of
 officials and quite properly they received different responses.


 It is still too early to say whether payments from the Hillsborough Disaster
 Fund will affect any of the income-related benefits, buuauua mJUITiJliy lia a boon

 paid- so far.   However, I can confirm that all other Social Security benefits
 will be completely unaffected by such payments.     In the meantime, my officials              **4
 continue to be in close contact with the Fund's administrators and have
 explained the rules in considerable detail to them.      They are also on hand to
 offer any further advice that is needed.     In this way, we hope that, as with
 previous disasters, any difficulty can be avoided.

  Thank you for your letter.

  For the life of me I cannot understand why you should be surprised
  at my reaction. Gerry Bermingham asked you at Col.1038 if it
  was correct that there will be no claims for recovery of benefit
  against money paid from the Hillsborough trust.  You gave an
  unequivocal yes and at the time I thought the answer somewhat
  clashed with what you had said immediately before.  However,
  I was delighted and therefore, not a little annoyed when your
  officials started to qualify your assurance, as I understood
  it.

  If you re-read the Press Association extract I feel sure you
  will agree that at no time did I state, or imply that you misled
  the House.  On the contrary it was your officials who seemed
  to be suggesting that you had been misinformed.  I was backing
  you up and under no circumstances accusing you of anything improper.

        Mr Nicholas Scott, MP
        Minister for Social Security                                      April 27, 1989


        Dear Nicholas,
        You will recall that last night in the House when I asked
        you about payments from the Hillsborough Disaster Fund
        you assured me that any Social Security benefits paid to
        the victims of that disaster or their relatives would not
        be recouped from payments from the Fund.

        It was therefore with some considerable surprise that I
        listened to the radio this morning and heard a news item
        +Vi®+-        r'.rtm ifn ft'n tfi bv officials of your Department
        to the effect that, in the event ox payment Deing m&ae iroiu
        the Fund there were circumstances in which people’s Social
        Security benefits could be re-assessed. This would seem to
        fly in the face of your comments in the House last night,
        and I would therefore be grateful if as a matter of urgency
        you would confirm that any payments from the Disaster Fund
        will not be taken into account when assessing people’s past,
        present or future Social Security benefits.

        It seems to me morally wrong that the charitable donations
        given by private individuals and corporate bodies as a means
        of assisting those who have suffered could be clawed back by
        the State, and further, you will no doubt agree that the
        puroose of such Fund is to bring additional help to the
        families of those who suffered in this terrible disaster.

        I await hearing from you.

        Yours sincerely,

    1. It is understood that payments from the Disaster Fund are due to
    commence shortly. In view of the political interest there has been in the
    effect that such payments might have on Income Support entitlements ve
    would like to be aware of:

           (a) the number of IS claimants receiving payments from the Fund, and

           (b) the number and names of claimants whose IS entitlement is affected
               by Disaster Fund payments, with details of the amount of the Fund
               payment and the total capital held by the claimant. (Funeral
               payments are being made direct to funeral directors and should not
               be included).

    2. Only those offices in and around Liverpool are likely to be affected to
    any significant degree and it has been proposed that we monitor only those
    offices listed in the attached annex. If you feel that any additional
    ofices should be included please let me know.

    3. I would be grateful if you would make arrangements to collect the
    required information from the nominated offices and report it to me, copied
    to                  D1C, Room 345, New Court. Could the information be
    reported initially on 22 May please and weekly thereafter until further
    notice.

    4.    I also attach for your information recent correspondance between D1C
I
flI and   the Disaster Fund manager.

    5.    If you have any queries please let me know.

                             Baroness Jeger asked Her Majesty’s Government:
                               Whether they will ensure that recipients o f any
                             help from the Hillsborough Disaster Fund will not
                             suffer deductions from social security payments.

                           The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State,
                         Department of Social Security (Lord Skelmersdaie):
                         The majority o f social security benefits will not be
                         affected by payments from the Hillsborough Disaster
                         Fund. Until further details o f the payments are
                         known, it is not possible to say whether any o f the
                         income-related benefits will be affected. Officials
                         have been in touch with the fund’s administrators
                         to advise them on the social security rules.

  HILLSBOROUGH; EFFBGT OF PAYMENTS ON SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS.

  BACKGROUND UPDATE



  2* At 3 May the Hillsborough Disaster Fund stood at £3,188*000 - donations
  are still coming in (fche media have said that £4m has been promised),


  3. Social Services currently act as agents for the Fund to make urgent
  payments to relieve need for such aa funeral catering Mils, visits to
  hospital and overnight accomodation.


  4. The Fund's administrators hope to begin making payments within the next
  two weeks to the bereaved relatives and the seriously injured.They do not know
  how much will be paid nor are they likely to provide this information.



      The majority of Social Security benefits are not income-related - they
  will not be affected by payments from the Fund.

              PQ 1643 1988/89 : THE BARONESS JEGER

              1. This PQ seeks an assurance that payments from the Hillsborough Disaster
              Fund will not affect entitlement to any social security benefits.

              2. Although the question is more direct thara that recently asked by
Aj   A        David Alton MP and answered by MOS on 2 May (copy attached), we recommend
              that the reply is kept broadly similar. A suggested reply is attached.

              3. MOS has not yet responded to our submission of 26 April but we understand
              that no change to the regulations is likely.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER FUND: BENEFITS


 IV2?l David Alton: (SLD: Liverpool, Mossley Hill):


To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security, what effect    payments from
the Hillsborough disaster fund will have on the level of benefits for bereaved
families.

                                             ’




MR NICHOLAS SCOTT


No payments have yet been made by the Hillsborough Disaster Fund and therefore
it is not possible to say whether and how they might affect benefits.
Officials have been in touch with the Fund's administrators to advise them on
the social security rules.   The majority of social security benefits would not
in any case be affected by any payment from the Fund.

1. This PQ seeks clarification on the effect of payments from the
Hillsborough Disaster Fund following answers given by the Prime Minister and
MOS - I enclose copies of relevant extracts from Hansard.

2. At this stage it is not possible to say if the income-related benefits
will be affected, but we are continuing to monitor the situation.

3. A suggested reply is attached for MOS. Minister may wish to omit the
words in square brackets from the reply until he has had the opportunity to
consider the submission made on 26 April about the possibility of introducing
a small concession. However, MOS has already indicated on the radio 4
programme "World at One" that "exactly the same rules will apply" as for
previous disasters (a copy of the transcript is attached).

         somewhere in another place they will have a field day              way. The clause deals with compensation payments made
         because of the legal technicalities and bad drafting?              by, or on behalf of, a person who is liable for an injury. It

            M r. Bermingham: My hon. Friend reads my mind                   has seen the response of this country to the Hillsborough
         perfectly and he knows me well.                                    tragedy and others that, alas, we have seen recently, will

         costs awarded, even if the client will receive a notional sum      intervening in that way. Perhaps I should put the question
         in settlement of the claim—for the sake of argument let us         more bluntly. Of course, compensation payments
         say £20,000, with costs of £5,000—unfortunately, because           ultimately fall due to the families of those involved in the

         one is tempted to say that the Department is aptly named           assuring me that the Department will have no claim
         —will receive all the £25,000 in payment. Effectively the          against payments paid out of the Hillsborough disaster
         victims will be £5,000 out of pocket simply for pursuing the       fund, 1 will accept it. The Minister nods, but let us have it
         claim. That is ludicrous. The Government must                      straight for the record so that we know exactly where we
         reconsider.                                                        stand. Will the Minister intervene again and confirm that

         status and money may be paid out. Will the DSS try to                  Mr. Benmngham: I am grateful to the Minister for that
         claw back money paid to people who have suffered                   assurance. I am sure that it will bring some crumb of
         grievous loss through no fault of their own? Will the              comfort to those of my constituents who have been
         Government take their cut from the tragedy?                        grievously injured.

night.



yiCHOXAS SCOTT (Social Security Minister^

Technically I was being asked a question about

a         clause                    in    the      Social    Security                Bill        that

provides                     for benefits which have already been

paid to be clawed back from any compensation

that           an insurance company                          or an employer,                           or

anybody                        liable;             eventually             pays             to      the

individual.



And        I was asked whether that provision would

•PPly to payments from the' Hillsborough appeal
fund, or the Hill*borough Disaster fund, and I

wan Able to give an absolute, unequivocal 'yes'

to thst.



Tn     terras   of   future       benefits    that   axe   being

paid, exactly the same rules will apply to the

Hillsborough         fuad,   as    appii«<i at x±nge       Cross

and applied at Bradford,              when they seemed to

work very, very tmoothly.              As far as 1 know we

had not a single complaint.



•pRgggjfTEB*

And what would be the effect of those rules?



»ICPMAg_SCgTI»
Well    it would       dep ;nd on      the   advice    that   is

given by the trustees of the fund to those to

whoa    they give       their money.         For   example,   if

somebody suffered a personal injury and they're

being given a payment because of that, then I'm

eurc the right thing would            bet   to put that money

into a trust and then any payments made would

be disregarded for a period of some two years.
c
r

    If payments were aiade not to the individual but

    to         third              parties,                    either      for          help             that               they

    cf that would be disregarded.



    What              we      found              is           that   as     long               as       the            legal

    niceties                       are          tackled, then                         the          interaction

    between these payments and the benefit •yatera,

    can be tackled In such a way that really the

    needs               of        the           individuals               are                      jootin              a        very

    satisfactory manner.

    yesterday, there vas some confusion as a result

    of          something                       government                officials appear                                      to

    payments                   from             the            fund might well                          find               that

    their whole future regarding benefits changed

    for the worse.                               Now can you clear up that?

    If          that             payment                      was    made         directly                        to            an

        have, those would be totally unaffected.



        The      income related benefits would be affected

        if that were simply added to their capital.



        As I say there are legal ways in which that can

        be       avoided      and    recipient*      will    obviously     be

        guided by the trustees of the fund in the best

        way          that   they    can   organise       their   affairs   to

        avoid that.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER FUND: BENEFITS


      David Alton: (SLD: Liverpool, Mossley Hill):


To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security, what effect   payments from
the Hillsborough disaster fund will have on the level of benefits for bereaved
families.




MR NICHOLAS SCOTT


No payments have yet been made by the Hillsborough Disaster Fund and therefore
it is not possible to say whether and how they might affect benefits.
Officials have been in touch with the Fund's administrators to advise them on
the social security rules.   The majority of social security benefits would not
in any case be affected by any payment from the Fund.

                                  Xr Scott gave some reassurance in the Commons

                                  last       night         during       the    last       stages    of      the

                                  Government sources were being quoted as saying

                                  that it wasn't necessarily true that benefit

                                  payments wouldn't be affected if payments came

                                  from the fund.

                                  Technically I was being asked a question about

                                  a     clause,      in    the      Social      Security      Bill       that

                                  provides for benefits which have already been

                                  paid to be clawed back from any compensation

                                  that an insurance company or an employer,                                  or

                                  anybody         liable,           eventually            pays      to      the

                                  individual.



                                  And    I was asked whether that provision would

                                  apply to payments from the Hillsborough appeal

          was Able to give an absolute, unequivocal 'yes'

          to that.



          in     terms   of   future    benefits       that    are    being

          paid, exactly the same rules will apply to the

          Hillsborough fund,         as applied at Kings Cross

          And what would be the effect of those rules?

          Veil    it would     depend     on the advice             that is

          given by the trustees oi the fond to those to

          whoa    they give thoir money.              For example,        if

          somebody suffered a personal injury and they're

          being given a payment because of that, then I'm

          sure the right thing would be to put that money

          into a trust and then any payments made would

          be disregarded for a period of some two years*

to   third parties,        either       for help that they

might need in terms of ears or wheelchair* or

of that would be disregarded.



What, we     found    is that, as        long as the        legal

niceties      are     tackled,    then     the     interaction

between these payments and the benefit system,

can be tackled in such a way that really the

needs   of   the     individuals        are met     in a very

satisfactory manner.



PRESENTER!

After   y 9ur      brief    remarks       in     the    Commons

yesterday, there was some confusion as a result

of   something       government     officials       appear        to

have said outside the chamber i namely that in

the future people w h o .had benefited from big

payments     from the      fund might well          find that

their whole future regarding benefits changed

for the worse.        How can you clear up that?

             individual and it became p&rt of -their capital

             then the capital rules for income support and

             housing benefit and so on, the income related

             benefits, of course it doesn't affect all the

             other        benefits,        the      vast    majority           of

             contributory flat rate benefits which people

             havei those would be totally unaffected.



             The income related benefits would be affected

             if that were simply added to their capital.



             As I say there are legal ways in which that can

             be       avoided   and    recipients    will    obviously         be

             guided by the trustees of the fund in the best

             way that, they can organise                their     affairs to
             avoid that.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
T. Don Ferguson   Hillsborough Appeal Fund             (27/4/89)

Message left for Mr Reddington to ring me.


Mr Ferguson knew about the funeral arrangements saying that the Social
Services were collating the funeral expenses and either they or the Fund will
pay. I advised him that payments should be made direct to the funeral
directors in order to ensure no effect on benefits: he made a note and thanked
me for the advice.

At the previous night the fund stood at £1,600,000.




                                                      D1C



Mr Reddington, Trust Fund Manager telephoned 27.4.89. He had received benefit
advice from               NWRO (X 2427) about the £500 limit for Social Fund
payments [he called it death benefit] and tariff income on capital of
£3000-£6000. I said that we were happy to help with any benefit problem in
order to ensure that claimants could receive financial assistance in the most
favourable circumstances for benefit purposes. He readily accepted the offer
of a factsheet which explained the rules for voluntary payments. As for
distributing the fund, he said they were a long way off deciding payments and
there were many factors to be considered. For example, there were 95 dead,
around 200 who received hospital treatment - about 30 of whom were still in
hospital and some in a coma. In addition, there were many thousands with
bruises and others with psychological problems. All needed to be taken into
account.

Mr Reddington was unable to give specific details of awards as these would
remain strictly confidential and vary according to personal circumstances.
But he would take the information about the DSS capital rules fully into
account. Payments would be lump sums - no regular income. He saw the awards
process falling into 3 categories -

    1.   an initial distribution within 4 weeks of the fund being set up on
    21 April, and ideally as soon as possible directed at the bereaved
    relatives and the seriously injured (from what was said and implied I
    would guess payments would be between £500 and £3000);

    2.   a main distribution (perhaps even all the fund if all injuries were
    assessed but he doubted that would be the case);

    3.   a reserve distribution catering for long-term cases such as those
    still in a coma.
Funeral Accounts

He said that everyone would be offered a full payment but they would not
necessarily accept.

Liverpool Social Services were gathering all the accounts and passing these to
the Fund for payment. Payments would be made direct to the Funeral Directors.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER FUND

1.   Following yesterday's PM Question Time, Ministers will wish to have
details of the existing provisions for treating payments from the Hillsborough
Disaster Fund in the income-related benefits and some options for relaxing the
rules - see Appendix attached.  It is possible that the issue will be raised
again during tonight's second reading of the Social Security Bill - a line to
take was sent to you earlier today.

2.   A copy of an extract from Hansard dated 25 April is enclosed: Ministers
will note that the PM said       I do not think that we can change the rules
and regulations....". While this does not hold out any promise of a change,
clearly it does not shut the door to a concession being made.

3.   Somewhat surprisingly, previous disasters such as the Bradford fire and
Kings Cross have not given rise to any requests for special treatment of
payments made out of the Disaster Funds. This may be because the actual
payments were not large or very few claimants were affected. But whatever the
reason, it is assumed that the existing rules operated satisfactorily and no
specific policy for disaster funds has therefore evolved.

4.   The options for changing current regulations are discussed in the
attached Appendix. These are to:

      1.       increase the capital limit for all claimants;

      2.       disregard all lump sum payments from Disaster Funds;

      3.   extend the period of the disregard for compensation payments held on
      trust.

Options 1 and 2 would address the problem of Hillsborough immediately by
relaxing the capital rules. However, neither option is recommended. Option 1
would not answer the demand for a full disregard and it would be very costly
while option 2 would set a dangerous precedent and vm>ld introduce serious
operational complexity. Option 3 appears the most attractive although it
would do little immediately for the Hillsborough victims. The current
provision already provides a 2 year disregard for compensation payments
arising from a personal injury which are placed in trust,'extending the
disregard indefinitely merely gives peace of mind to those who will need extra
financial support over a longer period. There is, however, some doubt whether
the existing provision will apply to bereaved relatives who are compensated
because they have lost someone. If Ministers wish to ensure that their
payments could be disregarded this could be achieved in regulations.

5.   On the question of timing, because of the undertaking given to local
authorities over Community Charge Benefit the earliest an amendment could be
introduced in Housing and Community Charge Benefits would be Summer 1990. The
change could be made this July for Income Support. However, disalignment
could result in a few hard cases involving people whoseincome is just above the
Income Support level but whose capital, in the absence of a disregard, would
disentitle them to Housing Benefit. Given the existence of the current
disregard for compensation payments held on trust and the absence of any
problems over payment from earlier Disaster Funds, we think that a change
based on option 3 could be made in Income Support in April 1990.

6.   Ministers are asked to decide which option they prefer, if any, and to
say when they would wish to introduce the change. X-f               A

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER FUND

PRESENT SITUATION

1.   We have contacted Mr Michael Reddington, the Trust Fund Manager of the
Hillsborough Disaster Appeal, and he has provided the following information.

     1.   No payments have been made yet.

     Applications for immediate payments are to be made to the Social Services
     Department. Later claims to be made to the Trust Fund Manager.

     2.   It is anticipated that payments will be made as lump sum only.

     3.  The Trust Fund is not to be registered as a charity:             the funds   will
     be held on discretionary trust.

     4.   Payments will be made to the injured as well as bereaved.

     5.  No criteria for payment has been adopted. However, there are five
     categories of claimants who will be considered.

     These are:
                     S of
                        ^ p

             1 . , deceased                         )
                  v                                 ) High priority
             2.       Those hospitalised 21.4.89    )

             3.       Those whose have been in hospital but are now out

             4.       Outpatients

             5. Possible injured - those with no apparent physical         injury but
             who have suffered effects of disaster.

CURRENT PROVISIONS

2.   The likelihood is that the trustees will make a single or a series of
lump sum payments to the injured and bereaved relatives thoughthere is  also
the possibility of them making regular perodical payments. These payments
will be treated according to the normal rules that apply to charitable and
voluntary payments.

3.    Lump sum payments made direct to the victims will be treated as capital
under   Income Support.The first £3000 of a claimant's capital does not affect
entitlement, though capital inexcess of£500 is    taken intoaccount inany
application for a Social Fund payment     For capital between £3000 and £6000
<*n income is assumed at the rate of £1 a week for every £250, or part thereof,
but any actual income from the capital (eg interest) is ignored. No Income
Support is payable if a claimant has over £6000 although a claim may be made
as soon as the total capital falls to or below that figure. Similar rules
apply in Family Credit and Housing Benefit except the latter has an £8000
capital cut-off.
If, instead, the lump sum is paid to a child or young person, the claimant's
Income Support will not be affected if the child/young person's total capital
does not exceed £3000. Capital over £3000 will result in the claimant losing
the personal allowance and child's disability premium paid for that
child/young person: the family premium and any lone parent premium will,
however, continue.

4.   Regular payments made at, for example, weekly or monthly intervals will
normally attract a £5 a week disregard subject to the disregard not being
taken up already by a war pension or another charitable or voluntary payment.
There are also a number of other provisions available to the trustees, such as
making payments to third parties-shops, funeral directors etc, which can be
adopted without affecting benefit.

5.   Another provision enables capital, which is derived from a compensation
payment arising from a personal injury and is held in trust, to be disregarded
for 2 years or longer in certain circumstances (eg to complete a house
purchase or rennovations) for adults, and in the case of children for as long
as they remain dependent on the claimant. Such payments may have been made
for a number of reasons including a road accident, an illness or a disrster
such as at Hillsborough. Any actual payments made by the trustees are -created
as income or capital as explained above. This provision enables^people who
receive a lump sum payment from the Disaster Fund to place it on trust, and
having done so, to benefit from the concession.

OPTIONS FOR CHANGE

6.   Option 1 - Increase THE CAPITAL LIMIT ..for all claimants.Raising the
capital limits beyond £3,000 (for tariff income purposes) and £6000 (cut-off)
would necessarily have to apply to all claimants, not just those receiving
payments from Disaster Funds. It would, therefore, be very costly - for
example a cut-off level of £10,000 would cost around £45m in Income Support
alone , it would not target the extra help on victims, and would probably not
satisfy the critics given that there would still be a capital cut-off point.
For these reasons, we do not recommend this option.

7.   Option 2. Disregard all LUMP SUM PAYMENTS from Disaster Funds. A full
disregard could not be introduced for the Hillsborough Fund alone and would
certainly have to include all similar funds: as we have indicated no
difficulties have arisen over the treatment of payments from earlier Funds.
It would also be necessary to include all compensation payments resulting from
such as a court action or insurance claimsbecause their case for preferential
treatment would be equally valid. However, the singling out of compensation
payments in this way is bound to lead to pressure on Ministers to do more for
savers generally especially since some of them will be disabled and retired.
There would also be serious operational problems if the capital that fell to
be disregarded was allowed to mingle in the same accounts as capital which was
to be taken into account. Identifying the different forms of capital would be
practically impossible especially as some of it would be withdrawn from time
to time and interest added.

8.   The benefit cost of a disregard limited to compensation payments could be
in the "region of EKuToocp. However, the operational complexity and the
precedent that such a disregard would set, make us unable to recommend this
option to Ministers.
Option 3. Extend the period of the disregard for
capital held on trust

It will be relatively simple to extend the current 2
year disregard for adults and throughout dependency for
children to a disregard for an indefinite period.
Operationally, it would no longer be necessary to
consider the circumstances for extending the 2 year
disregard. There would be other advantages. The
concession would be targeted directly on those receiving
compensation payments and would enable capital to be set
aside for the most seriously injured so that adequate
provision could be made for them during their lifetime:
this would counter a not uncommon criticism made of the
current rule that it does not enable long-term provision
to be made for the mentally handicapped. Nor would
there be the operational or "knock-on" disadvantages
associated with option 2 although the adjudication
officer would need to consider the treatment of payments
made by the trustees over a longer period than the
current 2 years.

No information is available about the number of
claimants who take advantage of the current 2 year
concession or how many lose benefit after the disregard
expires. However, by applying broad estimates to the
number of payments made by the Criminal Injuries
Compensation Board we estimate that the cost of
extending the period of the disregard would be no more
than £100,000 in Income Support in a full year (£75,000
for 1989/90). Finance division have agreed that this
could be accommodated in the minor bids.

Hillsborough Football Disaster:Appeal Fund Payments

1. We would appreciate your views on how we see the treatment of
payments made from this fund z.$ our approach differs from that
proposed by Die.

2. Paragraph 12 of Schedule 10 of the IS(Gen)Regs provides that a
disregard shall apply

             "(l)Where the funds of t trust are derived from a payment
             made in consequence of any personal injury to the claimant
             the'value of the trust fund and the value of the right to
             receive any payment under that trust,for a period of two
             years or such longer period as is reasonable in the
             circumstances............ “

3. Where a payment is made to a person who suffered actual
physical injury at Hillsborough we agree that the disregard
provided for in schedule 10 para 12 will apply, We also agree
that the same disregard will apply to payments made to persons
who were actually at the match and who because of either what
they saw or what happened to them they ere affected
mentally. However, we are of the opinion that if payment is made
for example to a wife or mother because of the death or injury of
a partner or close relative,this cannot be said to be a payment
made in consequence of & personal injury to the claimant and
therefore the disregard will not apply.

4. We have attached the correspondence between D1C and Sol A2 on
this subject in the hope that this might be of assistance to
you.In view of the immediacy of this problem we would be very
grateful for an early response to this submission, w© thank you
as always for your assistance.

I explained the disregard when compensation payments were placed in a trust -
he welcomed the offer of a note. The trustees will in certain cases tell
people to approach a solicitor for advice on such as setting up a trust fund.
They consider this may be appropriate for children, and adults who are unable
to manage their affairs: but the Fund will not give legal advice nor will they
draw up separate trusts. The Fund have it in mind to inform people with
handicapped children that an award will be made once they have made
satisfactory arrangements (eg set up a trust fund) and supply the names of the
trustees.

    HILLSBOROUGH: TREATMENT OF PAYMENTS FROM DISASTER FUND FOR SOCIAL
    SECURITY PURPOSES.

    LINE TO TAKE

    As far as p©s4fe^am aware, no payment has yet been made from the
    Hillsborough Disaster Fund to any victim of this terrible
    tragedy.


    Any payment will however be dealt with sensitively and under the
    existing benefit rules.


    My honorable Friend the Minister of State for Social Security has
    made it perfectly clear that the Bill, which is currently going
    through the House, will not result in benefit being recovered
    from payments made from the Hillsborough Disaster Fund.


    Officials from the DSS have already been in touch with the Fund’s
    administrators to advise them on the social security rules

    HILLSBOROUGH:    EFFECT OF PAYMENTS ON SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS

     (V   f   Payments made from the Hillsborough Disaster Fund
              will have no retrospective effect on benefit already



                                               ffect on-going payment of
              Denents       ‘rne errect on income support depends on the
              nature of the payment received:


              -   the first £5 a week of any regular voluntary payment
                  is normally disregarded;


                  any lump sum payment will be treated as capital - the
                  first £3,000 of any capital is ignored completely and
                  an income of £1 a week is assumed for every £250, or
                  part thereof, of any capital between £3,000 and
                  £6,000.     Any   interest earned by the capital is
                  ignored.     No   IS is payable if a person hasmore than
                  £6,000 (for HB the limit is £8,000); ;


                  if capital sum is placed on trust for an injured
                  person, this can be ignored completely for at least
                  two years and, in the case of a child, for as long as
                  he/she is a dependant;


                  the fund has      guaranteed payment of funeralcosts of
                  those involved.     If the funeral   account is sent
                  direct to Liverpool Social Services Dept they will
                  send it on to the Disaster Fund and payment will be
                  made direct to the undertaker without benefit being
                  affected


              -   payments made by Liverpool Social Services to
                  alleviate immediate hardship (eg for clothing to
                  attend funerals) were made direct to individuals to
                  purchase essential items and the amounts involved
                  were not high enough to affect benefit entitlement;
If and when liability is established^ any compensation
  payments (as distinct from the charitable payments
  made from the disaster fund) made after the start of
  the new social security recoupment rules in the late
  summer of 1990 will be subject to recoupment. It
  will apply only to benefits and compensation paid to
  those survivors who were injured. Payments to
  relatives of those who died will be excluded from the
  new rules. Any such payments made before the new
  rules come into operation will remain subject to the
  current offsetting rules.

           The Social Security Minister, Nicholas Scott,

           this morning     triad to clear up the confusion

           over what happens when those           who are receiving

           social security benefits also receive payments

           front the Hillsborough disaster fund.

             Kr Scott gave some reassurance in the Commons
             last night         during the last stages of the
             Social       Security Bill.          But    later,       some
             Government sources ware being quoted as saying
             that it wasn't necessarily true that benefit
             payments wouldn't be affected if payments came
             from the fund.


             So 1 asked Hr Scott this morning                  first to
             remind me what he had told the Commons last
             night.


             NICHOLAS SCOTT ^Social Security Minister!i
             Technically I was being asked a question about
             a   clause    in   the     Social Security Bill that
             provides for benefits which have already been
             paid to      be clawed back from any compensation
             that an      insurance companyor an         employer, or

             anybody      liable,       eventually      pays     to    the
             individual*

                                 "f/          ^
             And I was asked whethes: that provision would
             apply to payments from the Hillsborough appeal

              fund, or the Hill*borough Disaster fund, and l
              was Able to give an absolute, unequivocal 'yes'
              to that.


              In terms of        future benefits that ore being
              paid, exactly the same rules will apply to the
              Hillsborough fund, as applied at Kings Croat
              and applied at Bradford, when they seemed to
              work vary, very smoothly.                  As far as 1 know we
              had not a single complaint.


              Esssjssm*
              And what would be the effect of those rules?



              K l C i m g -SCflXT*

              Well it would depend on the advice that ia
              given by the trustees of the fund to those to
              whoa they give their money.                   For example, if

              somebody suffered a personal injury and they're
              being given a payment because of that, then I'm
              sure the right thing would be to put that money
              into a trust and then any payments made would
              be disregarded for a period of some two years*

                                                                              K

               If paymente were made not to the individual but
               to third parties, either for help that they
               night need in terns of ears or wheelchairs or
               funeral payments; all that sort of thing, all
               of that would be disregarded*


               What we found is that as long as the legal
               niceties       are      tackled,   then the interaction
               between these payments and the benefit system,
               can be tackled in such a way that really the
               needs of the individuals are met in a very
               satisfactory manner*




               After     your       brief   remarks   in   the      Commons
               yesterday, there was some confusion as a result
               of   something government officials appear to
               have said outside the chamber i namely that in
               the future people who.had benefited from big
               payments from the fund might well find that
               their whole       future regarding benefits changed
               for the worse.          Now can you clear up that?

               If   that     payment was made         directly to         an

                  individual and it became part of their capital
                  then the capital rules for incoma support and
                  housing benefit and so on, the incoma related
                  benefits, of course it doesn't affect all ths
                  other       benefits,    the    vast      majority    of
                  contributory flat rate benefits which people
                  havei those would be totally unaffected.


                  The income related benefits would be affected
                  if that were simply added to their capital.


                  As I say there are legal ways in which that can
                  be avoided and recipients will obviously be
                  guided by the trustees of the fund in the beet
                  way that they can organise their affairs to
                  avoid that.

                  And your department has been in touch with the
                  trustees of the fund already and will continue
                  to be in touch?

                BRIEFING ON ARTICLE OP 19 NOVEMBER -
               COMPENSATION FOR HILLSBOROUGH FAMILIES




HSIA Contribution on Macfarlane Trust.
Some 1,200 people with haemophilia have become h i v positive as a

result of treatment with a blood product known as Factor VIII,

and approximately 600 are seeking compensation for that Hiv

infection. This is a matter for the Courts; the Department of

Health are co-defendants in the action, and are denying

liability.   The main aspects of the case are sub-judice and

further comment would be inappropriate.



The Government do not intend to introduce any scheme for no-fault

compensation    for   medical       accidents;   the   Pearson   Committee

investigated this in 1978 and recommended against such a scheme.



When the Government announced the setting up of the independent

Macfarlane Trust with a £10m ex-gratia award in November 1987, it

was made clear that this was not compensation, but was to provide

help to HIV positive haemophiliacs and their dependents who were

in financial need.



Additionally, as the Macfarlane Trust was funded from the public



                                1

       purse, there is not a direct comparison with the privately funded

       [Hillsborough Disaster Fund]. in considering the very special

       circumstances of people with haemophilia and Hiv infection, the

       Government wished the special payments to be in addition to the

       relevant Social Security benefits. Regulations were therefore

       laid to provide for this.



       At the time that the £10m financing to the Macfarlane Trust was

       announced, the Government also said it would be open to

       representations about further funding, and this remains the

       position.

HILLSBOROUGH: EFFECT OF PAYMENTS ON SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS

* Payments made from the Hillsborough Disaster Fund will have no
retrospective effect on benefit already paid nor will they be
affected by the provisions in the current Social Security Bill.

* At 22 May the Hillsborough Disaster Fund stood         at about ES’m -
donations are still coming in.

* The Hillsborough Disaster Fund have made one payment so far
[£200] to assist with visiting expenses to hospital. The ajnount
involved Is unlikely to affect benefit.

* The Trustees for the Fund expect to make further payments before
the end of the month (May) to bereaved relatives and the seriously
injured.

* Social Services currently act as agents for the Fund to make
urgent payments tc relieve need for such as funeral catering bills
visits to hospital and overnight accommodation.

* The m a j o r i t y of Social S e c urity benefits are not income-related
they will not be affected by payments from the Fund.

     HILLSBOROUGH:    TREATMENT OF PAYMENTS FROM DISASTER FUND
                     FOR SOCIAL SECURITY PURPOSES


Line to take


Local Authority Social Services Departments have been authorised
to act on behalf of the Hillsborough Disaster Fund to make
payments to meet urgent need.   I understand that the trustees for
the Fund hope to make further payments very shortly.


As far as I am aware, no Social Security benefits have been
affected by any payment.   Of course, any payment made by, or on
behalf of, the Fund will be dealt with sensitively and under the
existing rules.   My hon. Friend the Minister of State for Social
Security explained these rules in considerable detail to the House
yesterday [22 May - PQ 1718].


Officials from the Department of Social Security have also been in
touch with the Fund's administrators to advise them on the Social
Security rules.
If Pressed:


*    The current income-related benefit rules offer
     considerable flexibility to the Fund's trustees to make
     payments with affecting people's benefit.


*   The Fund's administrators are aware of the Social
     Security rules.


*   Until details of the payments made by the trustees are
     known it is not possible to say whether any income-
     related benefit will be affected.


*   The vast majority of Social Security benefits     (eg
     Invalidity Benefit) will be totally unaffected by any
     payment from the Disaster Fund.


*   We do not know if any person receiving a Social Security
     benefit was involved in this tragedy nor if they will
     receive a payment from the Fund.


*   There are no proposals to change the existing income-
     related benefit rules.


*   My hon Friend the Minister of State for Social Security
     has made it perfectly clear that the bill, which is
     currently in the other place, will not result in benefit
     being recovered from payments made from the Hillsborough
     Disaster Fund.




     Income-related benefits are Income Support, Housing Benefit
     and Family Credit.

                               BACKGROUND NOTE

HILLSBOROUGH: EFFECT OF PAYMENTS ON SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS

*   Payments made from the Hillsborough Disaster Fund will have no
    retrospective effect on benefit already paid nor will they be affected by
    the provisions in the current Social Security Bill.

*   At 22 May the Hillsborough Disaster Fund stood at about £5m - donations
    are still coming in.

*   The Hillsborough Disaster Fund have made one payment so far [£200] to
    assist with visiting expenses to hospital. The amount involved is
    unlikely to affect benefit.

*   The Trustees for the Fund expect to make further payments before the end
    of the month (May) to bereaved relatives and the seriously injured.

*   Social Services currently act as agents for the Fund to make urgent
    payments to relieve need for such as funeral catering bills, visits to
    hospital and overnight accommodation.

*   The majority of Social Security benefits are income-related - they will
    not be affected by payments from the Fund.

*   Payments may, however, affect on-going payment of income-related
    benefits. The effect on Income Support depends on the nature of the
    payment received;

         the first £5 a week of any regular voluntary payment is normally
         disregarded;

    -    any lump sum payment will be treated as capital - the first £3,000 of
         any capital is ignored completely and an income of £1 a week is
         assumed for every £250, or part thereof, of any capital between
         £3,000 and £6,000. Any interest earned by the capital is ignored.
         No Income Support is payable if a person has more than £6,000 (for
         Housing Benefit the limit is £8,000);

         if capital sum is placed on trust for an injured person, this can be
         ignored completely for at least two years and, in the case of a
         child, for as long as he/she is a dependent;

         the fund has guaranteed payment of funeral costs of those involved.
         If the funeral account is sent direct to Liverpool Social Services
         Dept they will send it on to the Disaster Fund and payment will be
         made direct to the undertaker without benefit being affected.

         payments made by Liverpool Social Services to alleviate immediate
         hardship (eg for clothing to attend funerals) were made direct to
         individuals to purchase essential items and the amounts involved were
         not high enough to affect benefit entitlement;



Effect of 1989 Social Security Bill

*   If and when liability is established, any compensation payments (as

    after the start of the new Social Security recoupment rules in the late
    summer of 1990 will be subject to recoupment.  It will apply only to
    benefits and compensation paid to those survivors who were injured.
    Payments to relatives of those who died will be excluded from the new
    rules. Any such payments made before the new rules come into operation
    will remain subject to the current offsetting rules.

    1.    Secretary of State was grateful for your submission of
          2 May, and for being reminded of your earlier
          submission of 20 December 1989, on which MOS commented
          in a minute from Mr Willis of 29 December.

    2.    Secretary of State has now concluded that we should
          seek to get agreement to option 1 - extending the
          disregard for capital held on trust.  He has also
          commented that we should "proceed without any fanfare".

    3.    Given changed conditions since December, Secretary of
          State has concluded that it would no longer be wise to
          make a tactical attempt to clear option 3 with HMT.

1.   The trustees for the Hillsborough Disaster Appeal have
recently produced an interim report covering their activities
during the first 11 months, and Ministers may like to have sight of
a copy.

2.   The DSS is one of a number who are thanked for the help they
provided and I have identified the relevant paragraphs.  A summary
of the main contents is at Annex A and details of the known effect
that payments have had on claimant's benefits is at Annex B.

3.   We have spoken frequently about the outstanding submission
made to S of S on 20 December 1989 concerning the future treatment
of payments to claimants following a disaster.  If Ministers wish
to make any change this year, we would need to know very soon if we
are to comply with the timetable for the October package of
regulations; instructions are due with lawyers now and a reference
to SSAC is to be made by 28 May.  As explained in the earlier
submission, Treasury would need to be consulted depending on the
nature of the change.

                1. It is understood that payments from the Disaster Fund are due to
                commence shortly. In view of the political interest there has been in the
                effect that such payments might have on Income Support entitlements we
                would like to be aware of:

                       (a) the number of IS claimants receiving payments from the Fund, and

                       (b) the number and names of claimants whose IS entitlement is affected
                           by Disaster Fund payments, with details of the amount of the Fund
                           payment and the total capital held by the claimant. (Funeral
                           payments are being made direct to funeral directors and should not
                           be included).

                2. Only those offices in and around Liverpool are likely to be affected to
                any significant degree and it has been proposed that we monitor only those
                offices listed in the attached annex. If you feel that any additional
                ofices should be included please let me know.

                3. I would be grateful if you would make arrangements to collect the
                required information from the nominated offices and report it to me, copied
                to                  D1C, Room 345, New Court. Could the information be
                reported initially on 22 May please and weekly thereafter until further
                notice.

        ^II     4. I also attach for your information recent correspondance between DIG
     /Qf /I     and the Disaster Fund manager.

                5.     if you have any queries please let me know.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER FUND

Thank you for copying Mr Wheatly's advice on the treatment of payments from
the Hillsborough Disaster Fund.

There obviously has to be some limit on what can be construed as a personal
injury but I ’m not convinced that Sol B1 have got it quite right yet.

Indeed, I wonder if it is too early to say that some of the payments will
definitely not come within para 12 of Sch 10 given that the Fund have not paid
anything yet. Might it not be the case that it will turn on the reason for
payment? What I have in mind, for example, is that a bereaved relative
sitting at home on 15 April who receives a payment because of their mental
pain and suffering could well be said to have sustained a personal injury and
therefore gain from this particular disregard. In contrast, a payment which
compensates them for the loss of support from the deceased person might not:
though this is probably more likely to be a matter for the Courts than the
Fund.

I understand that you were going to review the position in the light of the
Independent's article on 29 April about payments to Zeebrugge victims and the
comparison made with Hillsborough. Perhaps in doing so you could take account
of the above comments and any further legal advice that is obtained.

We have now received o u.r third PQ about Hillsborough so any fresh guidance on
the subject will be very welcome.

   HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER FUND - PAYMENTS IN TRUST


   1. Thank you for your minute of 8 June enclosing Mr Wheatley's reply of
   31 May which I found helpful.

   2. I note your position though I still feel that it is risky to discount at
   this stage the possibility of a wider interpretation: I think we would wish to
   avoid the embarrassment of another                         RSB 2/89 [no slight
   intended!]

   3. We are, however, a long way from putting the treatment of such payments to
   the test, given that there needs to be a significant payment from the Fund to
   a person in circumstances where he or she does not satisfy your "presence"
   test and for that money to be held on trust. Should such a case come to your
   notice I'm sure you will let us know. In the appropriate circumstances,
   however, I hope that you will consider taking the case to the Commissioner.

      correspondence, from this office to Sol Bl and the reply of
      31 M a y .

      2.   Mrs Wheatly's minute is self-explanatory and at this point
      in time our view remains as outlined in Mr Tempest's minute.  As
      shown in Mrs Wheatly's final paragraph however the specific terms
      of a trust fund may prove crucial when para 12 of Sch 10 is
      applied.

      3.   Sorry about the delay in writing,   no one was in post until I

    1.    Thankyou for your reply of 2 May  1989 to Mrs I
                                                        _______ I You
    may wish to note the content of an enquiry from SSCD1C), a copy
    of which is attached.

    2.   To take paragraph 4 of the minute, first of all it is true
    we were interested in the effects of the Zeebrugge awards but
    working only from the newspaper article - see 'A' on rhs - the
    term "pathological grief" seems to have been used in connection
    with the persons present at the scene of the disaster. I would
    still regard presence as critical and the reason for payment as
    irrelevant if presence was not established. Clearly the matter is
    of great importance and I can see the view of D1C that, if it is
    at all possible we should accept traumatic stress or grief as
    constituting a personal injury.

    3.   I have now been sent a copy of correspondence from the
    National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux in which it is
    strongly suggested that either concessionary legislation might be
    considered or   a  'sympathetic  revision'  be made of present
    guidance to adjudication officers - copy is marked 'B' on rhs.

    4.    D1C have advised that no new regulations are envisaged. We
    are happy with the advice you have provided but we do seem to be
    moving into very difficult areas.    I would therefore greatly
    appreciate any further comments you can provide as soon as
    possible.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER FUND - CAPITAL DISREGARD



1.  I refer to your minute of 17 May and to that of
(DlC) of 10 May.  It seems to me that the newspaper
relation to the Zebrugge disaster takes us little further.   In
my earlier minute I indicated that those claimants falling
within my first two specified groups would probably benefit from
the disregard afforded by the Income Support Regulations,
accordingly, it would appear, that we are now only concerned
with the third group ie those not actually at the football
ground.  If this is the case then I do not think that the
commentary on the Zebrugge awards assists us, indeed it is clear
that this very question of this group was left open, to be
tackled in relation to a later "disaster".

2. At present the law in relation to the concept in tort known
as nervous shock takes us little further than indicating, by
case law, that a good claim can be grounded in tort for personal
injury, consisting of nervous shock, where a person was present
at an accident and actually witnesses that accident, whether by
sight or sound, and the impact of that is such to cause him
mental suffering.  The current case law does not consider
whether a person can ground a claim for nervous shock on the
basis of having seen the disaster on television, knowing that a
near relative was present, at the disaster.  It therefore remains
my opinion that the bereaved relative who is at home when the
disaster occurs and who later receives a payment in respect of
general mental pain and suffering due to a bereavement cannot be
said to have suffered a personal injury for the purposes of the
IS legislation; where the term "personal injury" is not
specifically defined in legislation^then one must interpret that
phrase in accordance with its general meaning within the law at
large.

3. However, it may be helpful in considering this question to
consider the terms of the trust fund and the basis upon which
payments can be made out of that fund.  It may be that the type
of injury for which payments can be made are defined in the
Deed, this could be of assistance to the Department in applying
the IS Regulations.

1.   You referred letters from Gerry Bermingham MP and Tony Banks MP and asked
for advice.

2.   I enclose a suggested reply to Gerry Bermingham relying heavily on
Minister's letter of 27 April to Tony Banks which you said was copied to him.

3.   The letter from Tony Banks raises no new issue and therefore does not
require a response : nor do I think one is expected.

          Thank you for your letter of 27 April about payments from the Hillsborough
          Disaster Fund which obviously crossed in the post with your copy of my letter
          to Tony Banks on the same issue.


          I presume that I have now made the position absolutely clear.      The question
          you asked me in the House was very different to that asked subsequently of
          officials and quite properly they received different responses.


          It is still too early to say whether payments from the Hillsborough Disaster
          Fund will affect any of the income-related                  -■ r^TTTTTrj lirm hnran
          paid- eo far .   However, I can confirm that all other Social Security benefits
          will be completely unaffected by such payments.     In the meantime, my officials
          continue to be in close contact with the Fund's administrators and have
          explained the rules in considerable detail to them.     They are also on hand to
          offer any further advice that is needed.     In this way, we hope that, as with
          previous disasters, any difficulty can be avoided.

Gerry Bermingham Esq MP




Thank you for your letter of 27 April about payments from the Hillsborough
Disaster Fund which obviously crossed in the post with your copy of my letter
to Tony Banks on the same issue.


I presume that I have now made the position absolutely clear.      The question
you asked me in the House was very different to that asked subsequently of
officials and quite properly they received different responses.


It is still too early to say whether payments from the Hillsborough Disaster
Fund will affect any of the income-related benefits because nothing has been
paid so far.    However, I can confirm that all other Social Security benefits
will be completely unaffected by such payments.     In the meantime, my officials
continue to be in close contact with the Fund's administrators and have
explained the rules in considerable detail to them.     They are also on hand to
offer any further advice that is needed.    In this way, we hope that, as with
previous disasters, any difficulty can be avoided.

             Mr Nicholas Scott, MP
             Minister for Social Security                            April 27, 1989


             Dear Nicholas,

             You will recall that last night in the House when I asked
             you about payments from the Hillsborough. Disaster Fund
             you assured me that any Social Security benefits paid to
             the victims of that disaster or their relatives would not
             be recouped from payments from the Fund.

             It was therefore with some considerable surprise that I
             listened to the radio this morning and heard a news item
             tv’at T'end!TA'? r'ATnmp.ntfi ijspde bv officials of your Department
             xo the eiiect that, m the evenx ox payment; o e m g maae iroiu
             the Fund there were circumstances in which people’s Social
             Security benefits could be re-assessed. This would seem to
             fly in the face of youx- comments in the House last night,
             and I would therefore be grateful if as a matter of urgency
             you would confirm that any payments from the Disaster Fund
             will not be taken into account when assessing people's past,
             present or future Social Security benefits.

             It seems to me morally wrong that the charitable donations
             given by private individuals and corporate bodies as a means
             of assisting those who have suffered could be clawed back by
             the State, and further, you will nc doubt agree that the
             purpose of such Fund is to bring additional help to the
             families of those who suffered in this terrible disaster.

             I await hearing from you.

             Yours sincerely,

  'X'thw- Kjc4 l,
      Thank you for your letter.

      For the life of me I cannot understand why you should be surprised
      at my reaction.  Gerry Bermingham asked you at Col.1038 if it
      was correct that there will be no claims for recovery of benefit
      against money paid from the Hillsborough trust.  You gave an
      unequivocal yes and at the time I thought the answer somewhat
      clashed with what you had said immediately before.  However,
      I was delighted and therefore, not a little annoyed when your
      officials started to qualify your assurance, as I understood
      it.

      If you re-read the Press Association extract I feel sure you
      will agree that at no time did I state, or imply that you misled
      the House.  On the contrary it was your officials who seemed
      to be suggesting that you had been misinformed.  I was backing
      you up and under no circumstances accusing you of anything improper.

1.   Secretary of State was grateful for the lines to take which you
provided on this, last week.

2.   Ministers have been giving further thought to the substantive
issue, on the basis of the options outlined in your submission of
26 April.  Secretary of State and PS(C) regard option (3) as
attractive - extending the period of the disregard for compensation
payments held on trust - and would be grateful if you could do some
more detailed work on this.  Secretary of State was impressed by the
advantages of this approach as outlined in para 9 of the anruex to
your submission. He also commented that there would be particular
advantage in linking this proposal with an improvement in the
disregard for charitable and voluntary payments in general (the
increase from £5 to £10 a week mentioned in your submission of
21 November).

3.   It would be helpful to have, also, an assessment of the
possibility, and a note on the likely costs, of drawing a special
provision (along Macfarlane Trust lines) very tightly, so as to
totally disregard all payments from the Hillsborough Disaster Fund.
(We understand that there are only five known cases in Hillsborough,
and the costs should therefore not be large).

4.    Could we have a note early next week, please?

MoS has seen Mr Provan's submission of 20 December and has commented
that although we will probably have to settle for option 1 it would
be tactically worth attempting to clear option 3 with Treasury in
the first instance. MoS does not consider option 2 to be feasible.

                                            HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER APPEAL FUND
                   1.   Your minute of 30 November asked for an early response to
                   two options raised by SofS for treating payments made by the
                   Hillsborough Disaster Appeal Fund, namely, to extend the period
                   of the current disregard of compensation payments held on trust
                   and to disregard all payments made from the Fund.           For
                   completeness, we have also looked again at the option of
                   disregarding payments from all Disaster Funds. An assessment
                   of these options is at Annex 1.
                   2.   As a general point, to target any concession at the
                   Hillsborough victims is bound to encourage the argument for
                   helping victims of other recent disaster such as Clapham,
                   Lockerbie and the sinking of the Marchioness on the Thames, as
                   well as any future disasters. Ministers are urged, therefore,
                   to consider the issues on the presumption that it would be
                   virtually impossible politically to ring-fence Hillsborough.
                   In some quarters, there would also be the argument that to
                   disregard the payments, so as to award benefit, would defeat
                   the very purpose of the public support which was to save the
                   victims from the financial worry of day to day living expenses
                   and to spare them from having to claim benefits.
                   OPTION 1: EXTENDING THE DISREGARD FOR CAPITAL HELD ON TRUST
                   3.   Relaxing the current rule could not help bereaved families
                   as the disregard only relates to compensation to the injured
                   for injuries sustained. Nor, as far as we can ascertain, would
                   it apply to the 20 very seriously injured who have already
                   received final payments from the Appeal Fund in the form of
                   discretionary trusts.   Capital held in such trusts does not
                   belong to the injured person and therefore would not be taken
                   into account in any event.
    •
I   r




    4.   But   this  option   could  offer   some   help   to  those
    Hillsborough victims who were less seriously injured and
    therefore may receive lump sum payments.    There are about 700
    of them and around 35 could be receiving Income Support, with
    perhaps more on Housing Benefit.    Compensation payments will
    vary according to their injuries but will average £7,000 and
    are due to be made before or shortly after Christmas. If these
    payments were placed on trust, the current rule would enable
    the capital to be ignored for at least 2 years.    Relaxing this
    provision would help if there were more than £3,000 left in the
    Trust fund after the 2 years       (capital up to £3,000 is
    disregarded anyway).    The amount of capital held on trust
    could, of course, be increased if the victims also received
    payments from the South Yorkshire Police Authority or as a
    result of court action.

    5.   The concession would also assist other claimants, who have
    received or do receive, compensation because of a personal
    injury and put it into a trust fund.
    6.    If Ministers wished to introduce a full disregard of the
    capital value of all compensation payments held on trust, this
    could be introduced for all income-related benefits in October
    1990.   The benefit costs would be in the order of £18,000 pa
    for the 1990-91 financial year, rising to about £108,000 for
    1993-94. Treasury approval would be required.

           OPTION 2: FULL DISREGARD OF PAYMENTS FROM HILLSBOROUGH
                     DISASTER FUND

           OPTION 3: FULL DISREGARD OF PAYMENTS FROM ALL DISASTER
                     FUNDS

    7.   Both these options would help the bereaved and injured.
    However, in view of the time lapse of 8 months since the
    Hillsborough Disaster, any major change to the rules now could
    result in Ministers being criticised for not acting sooner.
    There have been about 7 major disasters during the past 12
    months although as far as we are aware only 5 bereaved
    claimants - all Hillsborough victims - have lost benefit.

        8.   Moreover, both options have serious political and policy
        drawbacks. Option 2 in particular is likely to place Ministers
        under very strong pressure to make similar concessions for all
        disasters. And both options may attract demands for a complete
        disregard of all forms of compensation for death or personal
        injury, which may prove difficult to resist especially if they
        have not received support from any public appeal fund.    This
        may, in turn, lead to wider demands for relaxing the capital
        rules generally which would be very costly.    We are, unable
        therefore, to recommend either option.

        CONCLUSION
        9.   In so far as there is a case for a disregard of payments
        made by the Hillsborough Fund, or indeed any Disaster Fund, it
        is to recognise the particular needs of the injured rather than
•
the bereaved ralatives.   Targeting the disregard in this way
recognises that these people may need to call upon their
capital resources for specific and extra help throughout their
lifetime.    All injured people, including those injured at
Hillsborough, can take advantage of the rule. In contrast, the
bereaved families who receive lump sum compensation payments do
not normally incur the same extra expense as the injured and
their payments are used for normal living expenses - the very
same purpose as the benefits.     It can be argued, therefore,
that their capital should be treated no differently to that of
other claimants, some of whom may also have been recompensed
for the loss of a relative by, such as, the Criminal Injuries
Compensation Board or insurance.     Consequently, they do not
need additional support from public funds if their capital
exceeds the appropriate limit (£6,000 or £8,000).    When their
capital reduces in the normal way they may requalify for
benefit while still retaining a sizable amount of capital.


10. It appears, therefore, both sensible and defensible to
treat payments from disaster funds in a manner consistent with
the way other claimants'     capital resources are treated.
Ministers will be only too aware that the more exceptions made
to the regulations the less simple and structured the scheme
becomes, and the more difficult it is for staff to operate.

11.   Ministers are invited to agree that there should be:

      (1)   no special arrangement for the Hillsborough Disaster
            Appeal Fund, and

      (2)   no special arrangements for Disaster Appeal Funds,

for the reasons given above;   and whether:

      (3)   in the light of pressures in relation to disasters
            such  as   Hillsborough   they wish  to  make  any
            arrangements to assist people who have received
            compensation for injuries.

If so, officials consider an indefinite disregard of the whole
of any payment made in respect of a personal injury which is
held on trust to be an appropriate response.

12. Depending on what Ministers decide, we will       provide    a
draft for an inspired PQ/Press release if required.

     I    EXTEND THE PERIOD OF THE DISREGARD FOR PAYMENTS HELD ON TRUST


     How the      current rule works


     1.   The   current rule applies   when an injured person    receives compensationin
     respectof the injury and places it on    trust: the compensation can comefrom
     any source, for example, public collections, insurance, vaccine damage
     payments or awards by courts or the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board.           The
     rule ensures that the trust fund is fully disregarded for 2 years or longer in
     certain circumstances, such as if the capital is committed to paying for
     essential alterations to the home, and throughout dependency if the
     beneficiary is a child.     Without the disregard the value of the trust fund
     would be taken into account because the individual is absolutely entitled to
     the capital and therefore can call upon all of it at any time.


     Effect of changing the rule on payments from the Hillsborough Disaster Appeal
     Fund


     2.     The Trustees for the Hillsborough Appeal Fund are making final payments to
     the victims in two distinct phases.     The first phase has been completed and
     involved making substantial payment to the families of the 95 people who died
     and to the 20 people who were most seriously injured.       For reasons of
     confidentiality, few details of the payments are known other than thefact
     that 5 claimants have lost Income Support (IS) and presumably Housing Benefit
     (HB) because they have capital in excess of the capital limit (£6000 in IS,
     £8000 in HB).     However, it would seem that bereaved relatives may have
     received a lump sum payment and possibly a payment made into a discretionary
     trust:     one claimant has declared lump sum payments totalling £18,000 plus a
     further £25,000 on trust for her son, and another claimant has declared a lump
     sum payment of £35,000.     Discretionary trusts have probably been set up for
     the seriously injured because they are unable to manage their own affairs.


     3.     It is the lump sum payments which dis-entitle the bereaved families to
     benefit and, because the payments do not arise from a personal injury, they
     cannot derive any advantage from the current disregard for capital held on
     trust.     As for the discretionary trusts set up for the bereaved and seriously
     injured, the capital held on trust does not belong to the beneficiary and
     cannot, therefore, affect benefit - though any actual payments from the trust
     are treated in the normal way.     In practice,   discretionary trusts have   the
     same effect as the proposal for extending the current disregard.
     The second phase is now underway and involves the Trustees in paying out
the £5m that is left to around 700 people who were less seriously injured - an
average of £7000 per person.    Because the awards will be lower and the victims
more able to manage their own affairs, payments are likely to be in the form
of lump sums rather than discretionary trusts.     It is estimated that 35-40
people could have their IS affected - perhaps more in HB.     It is this group,
therefore, which might gain from the current disregard for at least 2 years
provided that the awards are placed on trust.     Those people with the highest
awards and hence the most extensive injuries may well have over £3000 left at
the end of 2 years:     so a relaxation of the 2 year limit would help them.    The
relaxation would be even more beneficial if awards were also made by
S. Yorkshire Police or as a result of court action and were held on trust.


Effect of changing the rule for other claimants.


5.   The Hillsborough victims would not, however, be the only claimants to be
helped by a relaxation of the disregard.     It would help other claimants who
receive payments due to an injury whether through the courts, insurance, the
Criminal Injury Compensation Board (CICB) or vaccine damage payments by
enabling them to make better provision for themselves in later years.


Conclusion


6.     Extending the current disregard for capital held on trust would provide a
small but welcome easement for a few hard cases.


Timing


7.     This change could be introduced for all the income-related benefits from
October 1990 by which time the existing disregard for capital held on trust
would still have a year to run for Hillsborough victims.     An October
introduction would be later than the date suggested for the bulk of the
changes for charitable and voluntary payments.


Cost


8.     We estimate the total benefit cost to be £17,700 in the 1990-91 financial
year in IS, HB and CCB with a negligible cost in FC.     These would rise to
around £108,000 by 1993-94 and remain steady.     Treasury approval would be
required and the indications are that they might be rather sensitive to
concessions which seek to ignore substantial capital sums.     There would be
minimal operational costs.     The cost could be met under the minor bids.
 I   FULL DISREGARD OF ALL PAYMENTS FROM THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER APPEAL FUND


Amending regulations and timing


9.   Although it would be relatively straightforward to provide regulations to
disregard all payments from the Hillsborough Disaster Fund, there would be
considerable disadvantages in doing so and these are discussed below.
Amending regulations could be introduced for all the income-related benefits
from October 1990.


Extra-statutory payments pending regulations


10. Regulations could not be amended retrospectively and, therefore, there
would still be victims who lost beneift up to the date the change was made.
To avoid any losers it would be necessary to identify the cases and make
payments extra statutorily.    There would be a number of difficulties if this
course were adopted.     Legally, the SofS would be making extra-statutory
payments to the Hillsborough victims under his administrative powers.        In
exercising his discretion, the S of S must do so reasonably for all claimants
and therefore be able to show why he was favouring the Hillsborough victims in
preference to the victims of other disasters.


11. Ministers will also be aware that Treasury approval would be needed before
making these payments.     Our understanding is that Treasury would not be
sympathetic to such an approach and therefore their agreement is extremely
unlikely.


12. There would also be the matter of whether to make extra-statutory payments
in lieu of HB.   As LAs have no power to act extra-statutorily, the Department
would need to make special arrangements to identify, assess and make payments
until the law was changed.     This would make it increasingly difficult for
Ministers to reject demands for similar measures in HB in the future.


Costs


13. Benefit costs are difficult to gauge because of the absence of details
about the payments already made and due to be made.     Our best guess is £<fr3.ooo fa.
for all income-relate^ benefits in a full year with costs falling from April
1992.   Because of the potential that this change could fuel other demands for
concessions, Treasury approval would be required.     Operational costs would be
negligible.   The costs could be met under the minor bids.
^ ^ o l i c y objections


   14. A disregard of all Hillsborough Disaster payments would set a precedent
   and has a number of major policy disadvantages.    Ministers would be very hard
   pressed to resist introducing identical concessions for past and future
   disasters:     even if the victims were not claimants in the period immediately
   following a disaster they could become claimants and their benefit entitlement
   affected by the treatment of their compensation payments.     From a legal point
   of view, SofS would need to consider any future disaster and whether to
   introduce a similar concession, but he would not be legally obliged to do
   anything.


   15. It would be equally difficult to ignore payments arising from public
   donations while taking fully into account other payments made for similar
   reasons, such as insurance payments or awards for damages by the courts.     In
   such an emotive area, the media and the public would be unlikely to accept any
   valid distinction, particularly if the claimant, whose benefit is affected, is
   seriously infirm or his partner was killed.     Meeting these objections could
   fuel demands for relaxing the capital limits to help all claimants and this
   would be very expensive.     Copies of correspondence illustrating the strength
   of feeling are at Annex 2.


   Operational objections


   16. Operationally, there would be further difficulties.     Capital arising from
   compensation payments would inevitably be mixed with other capital, which
   attracted no disregard, making it impracticable to identify the amount to take
   into account for tariff income purposes or to allocate any interest earned.
   There is also the possibility of trust funds being set up with money from the
   Disaster Fund and damages awarded by the courts:     again making it
   impracticable to decide how much of any trust payments to take into account.


   Conclusion


   17. For all these reasons, we believe that the disadvantages considerably
   outweigh any advantages of disregarding all payments from the Hillsborough
   Disaster Fund.
Ill FULL DISREGARD OF PAYMENTS FROM ALL DISASTER APPEAL FUNDS


18. A full disregard of payments from any Disaster Appeal Fund would overcome
some, but not all, of the problems already mentioned.     It would remove the
pressure on Ministers concerning the treatment of any future disaster and it
could ensure that capital still held from previous disasters was also
ignored.   Lawyers advise that it would be possible to define Disaster Appeal
Funds in regulations.     But any definition would need to be very specific, and
therefore lengthy, in order to avoid disregarding payments for any domestic or
personal mishap.   For example, it might be necessary to refer to a minimum
amount of money collected from private donations, the existence of a trust
fund and, perhaps, lay down a minimum number of people involved (though we
think this would be undesirable).


S of S nominated disasters


19. We have considered, but rejected, the idea of S of S nominating particular
disasters for preferential treatment.     Lawyers advise against this course
which would require primary legislation and a very detailed criteria in
regulations to show how the discretion would be exercised.


Policy and Operational objections


20. A disregard would still leave the problem of treating compensation
payments differently depending on whether they originated from public
donations or elsewhere.     This would necessitate Ministers making some hard
decisions in often sad circumstances.     Further concessions elsewhere could
lead to demands for relaxing the capital rules for all claimants.
Operationally this option would present more of the same problems as for
Hillsborough for identifying the income and capital to take into account.       And
there could also be difficulties for adjudication officers if the definition
of Disaster Appeal Funds were not tightly drawn in regulations.


Timing


21. Amendments could be made to regulations to come into effect in all the
income-related benefits from October 1990, unless Ministers wished to
fast-track urgent amending regulations for IS and FC only (this could not be
^ ^ d o n e for HB and CCB because it would involve a structural change).   Ministers
   would also need to consider the question of extra-statutory payments as
   explained in paragraphs 10-12 above.


   Costs


   22. Benefit costs are speculative but we estimate these to be in the region of
   £43/000 in a full year across the income-related benefits.     Treasury approval
   would be required because of the potential knock-on effect.


   Conclusion


   23. A disregard of all payments made by Disaster Funds would help a relatively
   small number of claimants but, in doing so, create anomalies and demands that
   could only be overcome at a high benefit cost.

< £ te .c x jr-

Thank you for your letter of 28 April to the Prime Minister about
your recent claims for benefit made in very unfortunate
circumstances.  I have been asked to reply on the Prime Minister's
behalf and am sorry for the delay in doing so.

I was very sorry to hear about the death of your wife earlier this
year following her long illness.  I can therefore quite understand
your reaction to the appeal funds set up in response to recent
disasters.  However, the Government has no influence over how the
trustees for these funds, like the Hillsborough Appeal Fund,
distribute help. As you know, these are mainly funded by donations
from ordinary people, who want to help those who have been badly
injured or bereaved as a result of the disaster. There are, of
course, many more people who find themselves in similar
circumstances but who are not assisted in this way.

The Social Security scheme is intended to help people through a wide
range of benefits if they are in difficult circumstances or have a
low income.  Some benefits, like Income Support, are income-related
and entitlement to payment therefore depends on how much income you
already have coming in and the amount of benefit that you need
according to your particular circumstances.  I understand that when
you were off work you did not qualify for Income Support because
your Statutory Sick Pay and other benefits were more than you would
be able to receive as Income Support.

Although you are not entitled to Income Support, you may be entitled
to Housing Benefit which helps with rent and rates.  If you have not
already done so, I suggest that you contact your local Council to
see if you are entitled. Now that you are back at work, you may
also be entitled to Family Credit. This is paid to people with
children who work for at least 24 hours a week and have low
earnings.  I enclose leaflet FCI which gives further information and
includes a claim form and a prepaid reply envelope.

If you are entitled to either Housing Benefit or                    Family Credit you
will be able to apply for a Social Fund grant to                    help with funeral
expenses.  There is, however, a three month time                    limit for claiming
the grant.  I suggest, therefore, that you apply                    for Housing Benefit
and Family Credit straightaway and then, before these claims are
decided, apply for the grant at the Stroud Social Security office.
I have arranged for the adjudication officer at Stroud to keep your
claim until you know if you will be getting Housing Benefit or
Family Credit, and it would be helpful if you mentioned this to the
office.
Because you are bringing-up your son alone, you are entitled to
receive One Parent Benefit as well as Child Benefit. This is taken
fully into account when working out entitlement to Housing Benefit,
but it is ignored for Family Credit purposes. I enclose leaflet
CH11, a claim form and a prepaid reply envelope, in case you have
not already applied.
I understand that your late wife's Attendance Allowance claim was
reviewed and a decision that she was entitled to the lower rate of
the benefit from 6 March was sent to you with payment on 28 April.
Decisions on claims are made by the Attendance Allowance Board or
its delegated medical practitioners. The Board and its doctors are
independent adjudicating authorities and I am unable, therefore, to
intervene in or influence their decisions.
I do hope that the above information proves helpful to you.

         HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER FUND

         1.   Following yesterday's PM Question Time, Ministers will wish to have
         details of the existing provisions for treating payments from the Hillsborough
         Disaster Fund in the income-related benefits and some options for relaxing the
         rules - see Appendix attached.  It is possible that the issue will be raised
         again during tonight's second reading of the SocialSecurity Bill - a line to
         take was sent to you earlier today.

         2.   A copy of an extract from Hansard dated 25 April is enclosed: Ministers
         will note that the PM said       I do not think that we can change the rules
         and regulations....". While this does not hold out any promise of a change,
         clearly it does not shut the door to a concession being made.

         3.   Somewhat surprisingly, previous disasters such as the Bradford fire and
         Kings Cross have not given rise to any requests for special treatment of
         payments made out of the Disaster Funds. This may be because the actual
         payments wen not la?     or very few claimants were affected. But whatever the
         reason, it it. assumed that the existing rules operated satisfactorily and no
         specific policy for disaster funds has therefore evolved.

         4.   The options for changing current regulations are discussed in the
         attached Appendix. These are to:

              1.      increase the capital limit for all claimants;

              2.       disregard all lump sum payments from Disaster Funds;

             3.   extend the period of the disregard for compensation payments held on
             trust.

         Options 1 and 2 would address the problem of Hillsborough immediately by
         relaxing the capital rules. However, neither option is recommended. Option 1
         would not   answer the demand for a full disregard and it would bevery costly
         while option 2 would set a dangerous precedent and v~ould introduce serious




f-
operational complexity. Option 3 appears the most attractive although it
would do little immediately for the Hillsborough victims. The current
provision already provides a 2 year disregard for compensation payments
arising from a personal injury which are placed in trus^extending the
disregard indefinitely merely gives peace of mind to those who will need extra
financial support over a longer period. There is, however, some doubt whether
the existing provision will apply to bereaved relatives who are compensated
because they have lost someone.  If Ministers wish to ensure that their
payments could be disregarded this could be achieved in regulations.

5.   On the question of timing, because of the undertaking given to local
authorities over Community Charge Benefit the earliest an amendment could be
introduced in Housing and Community Charge Benefits would be Summer 1990. The
change could be made this July for Income Support. However, disalignment
could result in a few hard cases involving people whoseincome is just above the
Income Support level but whose capital, in the absence of a disregard, would
disentitle them to Housing Benefit. Given the existence of the current
disregard for compensation payments held on trust and the absence of any
problems over payment from earlier Disaster Funds, we think that a change
based on option 3 could be made in Income Support in April 1990.

6.   Ministers are asked to decide which option they prefer, if any, and to
say when they would wish to introduce the change. x-f               A

                                     APPENDIX


HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER FUND

PRESENT SITUATION

1.   We have contacted Mr Michael Reddington, the Trust Fund Manager of the
Hillsborough Disaster Appeal, and he has provided the following information.

     1.      No payments have been made yet.

     Applications for immediate payments are to be made to the Social Services
     Department. Later claims to be made to the Trust Fund Manager.

     2.   It is anticipated that payments will be made as lump sum only.

     3.  The Trust Fund is not to be registered as a charity:           the funds will
     be held on discretionary trust.

     4.      Payments will be made to the injured as well as bereaved.

     5.   No criteria for payment has been adopted. However, there are five
     categories of claimants who will be considered.

     These are

             1. , deceased                      )
               'V                               ) High priority
             2. Those hospitalised 21.4.89      )

             3. Those whose have been in hospital but     are now out

             4. Outpatients

             5. Possible injured - those with no apparent physical injury but
             who have suffered effects of disaster.

CURRENT PROVISIONS

2.   The likelihood is that the trustees will make a single or a series of
lump sum payments to the injured and bereaved relatives though there is also
the possibility of them making regular perodical payments. These payments
will be treated according to the normal rules that apply to charitable and
voluntary payments.

3.   Lump sum payments made direct to the victims will be treated as capital
under Income Support. The first £3000 of a claimant's capital does not affect
entitlement, though capital in excess of £500 is taken into account in any
application for a Social Fund payment    For capital between £3000 and £6000
qn income is assumed at the rate of £1 a week for every £250, or part thereof,
but any actual income from the capital (eg interest) is ignored. No Income
Support is payable if a claimant has over £6000 although a claim may be made
as soon as the total capital falls to or below that figure. Similar rules
apply in Family Credit and Housing Benefit except the latter has an £8000
capital cut-off.
If, instead, the lump sum is paid to a child or young person, the claimant's
Income Support will not be affected if the child/young person's total capital
does not exceed £3000. Capital over £3000 will result in the claimant losing
the personal allowance and child's disability premium paid for that
child/young person: the family premium and any lone parent premium will,
however, continue.

4.   Regular payments made at, for example, weekly or monthly intervals will
normally attract a £5 a week disregard subject to the disregard not being
taken up already by a war pension or another charitable or voluntary payment.
There are also a number of other provisions available to the trustees, such as
making payments to third parties-shops, funeral directors etc, which can be
adopted without affecting benefit.

5.   Another provision enables capital, which is derived from a compensation
payment arising from a personal injury and is held in trust, to be disregarded
for 2 years or longer in certain circumstances (eg to complete a house
purchase or rennovations) for adults, and in the case of children for as long
as they remain dependent on the claimant. Such payments may have been made
for p number of reasons including a road accident, an illness or a disrster
such as at Hillsborough. Any actual payments made by the trustees are created
as income or capital as explained above. This provision enables^people who
receive a lump sum payment from the Disaster Fund to place it on trust, and
having done so, to benefit from the concession.

OPTIONS FOR CHANGE

6.   Option 1 - Increase THE CAPITAL LIMIT for all claimants.Raising the
capital limits beyond £3,000 (for tariff income purposes) and £6000 (cut-off)
would necessarily have to apply to all claimants, not just those receiving
payments from Disaster Funds. It would, therefore, be very costly - for
example a cut-off level of £10,000 would cost around £45m in Income Support
alone , it would not target the extra help on victims, and would probably not
satisfy the critics given'that there would still be a capital cut-off point.
For these reasons, we do not recommend this option.

7.   Option 2. Disregard all LUMP SUM PAYMENTS from Disaster Funds. A full
disregard co.ui not be introduced for the Hillsborough Fund alone and wo-ild
certainly have to include all similar funds: as we have indicated no
difficulties have arisen over the treatment of payments from earlier Funds.
It would also be necessary to include all compensation payments resulting from
such as a court action or insurance claims because their case for preferential
treatment would be equally valid. However, the singling out of compensation
payments in this way is bound to lead to pressure on Ministers to do more for
savers generally especially since some of them will be disabled and retired.
There would also be serious operational problems if the capital that fell to
be disregarded was allowed to mingle in the same accounts as capital which was
to be taken into account. Identifying the different forms of capital would be
practically impossible especially as some of it would be withdrawn from time
to time and interest added.

8.   The benefit^ cost of a disregard limited to compensation payments could be
in the "region of Eioacccp. However, the operational complexity and the
precedent that such a disregard would set, make us unable to recommend this
option to Ministers.
(•       9.       Option 3. Extend the period of the disregard for
                  capital held on trust
     #
                  It will be relatively simple to extend the current 2
                  year disregard for adults and throughout dependency for
                  children to a disregard for an indefinite period.
                  Operationally, it would no longer be necessary to
                  consider the circumstances for extending the 2 year
                  disregard. There would be other advantages.    The
                  concession would be targeted directly on those receiving
                  compensation payments and would enable capital to be set
                  aside for the most seriously injured so that adequate
                  provision could be made for them during their lifetime:
                  this would counter a not uncommon criticism made of the
                  current rule that it does not enable long-term provision
                  to be made for the mentally handicapped. Nor would
                  there be the operational or "knock-on" disadvantages
                  associated with option 2 although the adjudication
                  officer would need to consider the treatment of payments
                  made by the trustees over a longer period than the
                  current 2 years.

         10   .   No information is available about the number of
                  claimants who take advantage of the current 2 year
                  concession or how many lose benefit after the disregard
                  expires.  However, by applying broad estimates to the
                  number of payments made by the Criminal Injuries
                  Compensation Board we estimate that the cost of
                  extending the period of the disregard would be no more
                  than £100,000 in Income Support in a full year (£75,000
                  for 1989/90).  Finance division have agreed that this
                  could be accommodated in the minor bids.

HILLSBOROUGH SUBMISSION:   COSTS



Option 1 - Extend 2 year disregard of payments placed in trusts

This provision would cover other injury payments, such as from insurance
companies or the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board (CICB).

CICB Costs

(a)   Awards over £6000 = 758

ASD6 advise 15% of units on IS

Assume 15% of CICB beneficiaries on IS =214

Assume 10% place payments on trust = 11

Average IS payable = £34.25

Annual cost of extending 2 year disregard = 11 x £34.25 x 52 = £19591

NB    This cost would roll-up in the subsequent 2 years then level out as
      capital on older trusts fell to or below £6000.

Cost Oct 1990-April 1991 = £9795

Cost April 1991-92 = £19951 x 2 =£39182

Cost April 1992-93 = £39182 + £19951   = £58773

(b)Awards £3000 - £6000 = 1805

ASD6 advise 15% of units on IS

Assume 15% of CICB beneficiaries on IS = 271

Assume 5% place payments on trust = 14

Assume that after 2 years capital on trust reduced to £3500

Tariff income on £3500 = £2 a week

Annual cost of extending 2 year disregard = 14 x £2 x 52 = £1456

Cost Oct 1990-April 1991 = £728

Costs roll-up for next year only

Cost April 1991-92 and subsequent years   = £1456 x 2 =   £2912

Assume that £3500 on trust would reduce to or below £3000 after 3rd year

Hillsborough Costs

700 other injured - assume 5%* on IS = 35

      5% was the percentage of the bereaved families who lost IS
Average Compensation payment (£5m ~ 700) = £7000

Assume 50% place payment on trust = 17

Assume that after 2 years (ie by Jan 1992) capital on trust reduced to £5000

Tariff income on £5000 = £8

Annual cost of extending 2 years disregard after Jan 1992 = 17 x 8 x 52 = £7072

Cost Jan 1992-April 1992 = £7072 x % = £1768

Cost April 1992-93 = £7072.

Thereafter assume costs reduce as capital on trust falls to or below £3000


Total cost of Option 1 :

Oct 1990-April 1991 (£9795 + £728) = £10523

April 1991-92 (£39182 + £2912-* fcn6,&) =:-fc.4-386.2.

April 1992-93 (£58773 + £2912 +i7oY2.) = £&S7S7



Then fall back to about £60,000 and remain steady (£58773 + £2912).




Option 2 - Full Disregardfor_Hillsborouqh Cases only

(a)   5   15   cases of bereaved families — just-ooer 100 ia tc+oX.

Individual cases checked for IS rates

Assume average award (4 x £35,000) + (1 x £18,000) = £31,000

Total of weekly IS rates = £340.19 a week

Annual cost of full disregard of capital = £340.19 x 52 wks = £17689.88

Cost Oct 1990-April 1991 = £8844.94

(b)   700 other injured cases

Assume 5% of 700 on IS = 35

Average payment in 1989/early 1990 (£5m         f 700) = £7000

At Oct 1990 assume £5000 left

Tariff income on £5000 = £8 a week

Cost for Oct 1990-April 1991 = £8 x 35 x 26 wks = £7280
Cost for April 1991-92, when tariff income has reduced to £2 a week on £3500
(capital reduced more quickly than if placed in a trust) = £2 x 35 x 52 weeks
= £3640

No cost assumed in subsequent years as capital below £3000

Total cost of Option 2

Oct 1990-April 1991 (£8844.94 + £7280) = £16125

April 1991-1992 (£17689.88 + £3640) = £21330

Cost would fall therew^te-f as capital reduced.




Option 3 - Full disregard of all payments from disaster funds

As above - no other known claimants.

                                HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER APPEAL FUND


1.   Your minute of 30 November asked for an early response to
two options raised by SofS for treating payments made by the
Hillsborough Disaster Appeal Fund, namely, to extend the period
of the current disregard of compensation payments held on trust
and to disregard      all payments made from the Fund.     For
completeness, we have also looked again at the options of
disregarding payments from all Disaster Funds.    An assessment
of these options is at Annex 1.

2.    OPTION 1: EXTENDING THE DISREGARD FOR CAPITAL HELD ON TRUST

        Relaxing the current rule would not help the 5 bereaved
 families or the 20 very seriously injured who have received
 final payments from the Appeal Fund.        It would offer limited
X e l p to those Hillsborough victims who were less seriously
 injured.     There are about 700 of them and around 35 could J&S
 receiving Income Support, with perhaps more on Housing Benefit.
 Compensation payments will vary according to their injuries but
 will average £7,000.        These will be made before or shortly
 after Christmas.        The current    rule enables capital to be
 ignored for at least 2 years if held on trust.        Relaxing this
 provision would help if there is more than £3,000 left in the
 Trust fund after        the 2 years     (capital up to £3,000 is
 disregarded anyway).     T h ^position could change if the victims
 also receive payments frorqSouth Yorkshire Police Authority or
 as a result of court action.       The concession would also assist
 other claimants, who have received compensation because of a
 personal injury, by enabling them to make better provision for
their future needs.     We recommend fully disregarding the
capital value of all such payments where these are held on
trust.    This could be introduced for all income-related
benefits in April 1990.   The benefit costs would be in the
order of £    pa.

3.   OPTION 2: FULL DISREGARD OF PAYMENTS FROM HILLSBOROUGH
               DISASTER FUND

     OPTION 3: FULL DISREGARD OF PAYMENTS FROM ALL DISASTER
               FUNDS

     In view of the time lapse of 8 months since the
Hillsborough Disaster, any major change to the rules now could
result in Ministers being criticised for not acting sooner.
There have been 7 disasters during the past 12 months although
as far as we are aware only 5 bereaved claimants - all
Hillsborough victims - have lost benefit.

Both these options are unattractive and have serious political
and policy drawbacks.    Option 1 in particular is likely to
place Ministers under very strong pressure to make similar
concessions for all disasters.   And both options may attract
demands for a complete disregard of all forms of compensation
for death or personal injury, which may prove difficult to
resist especially if they have not gained from any public
appeal fund.   This may, in turn, lead to wider demands for
relaxing the capital rules generally which would be very
costly.  We are, therefore, unable to recommend either option
but if Ministers wished to do something then option 2 is the
better option.

4.    CONCLUSION

     Targeting the disregards on the injured in thia w a y •seems
the  appropriate   response to compensation      payments.     It
recognises that these people may need to call upon their capital
resources   for  specific  and  extra   help throughout their
lifetime.    All injured people, including those injured at
Hillsborough, can take advantage of the rule. In contrast, the
bereaved families who receive lump sum compensation payments do
not normally incur the same extra expense as the injured.      It
can be argued, therefore, that their capital should be treated
no differently to that of other claimants, some of whom may
also have been recompensed for the loss of a relative by, such
as, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board.       Consequently,
they do not need additional support from public funds if their
capital exceeds the appropriate limit (£6,000 or £8,000). When
their capital reduces in the normal way they may requalify for
benefit while still retaining a sizable amount of capital.

5.   It appearf, therefore, both sensible and defensible to
treat payments from disaster funds in a manner consistent with
the way other claimants'     capital resources are treated.
Ministers will be only too aware that the more exceptions made
to the regulations the less simple and structured the scheme
becomes, and the more difficult it is for staff to operate.
6.   Ministers are invited to say whether they wish to:

     (1)    disregard the whole of any payments made in respect
of a personal injury which are held on trust;

     (2)disregard  all   payments      from   the   Hillsborough
Disaster Appeal Fund;

     (3)   disregard all payments from any Disaster Appeal Fund
and to decide when that change^) should be introduced in the
income-related benefits.

We will provide a draft PQ/Press release should Ministers wish
to make -gueh an announcement.

I      EXTEND THE PERIOD OF THE DISREGARD FOR PAYMENTS HELD ON TRUST


1.     Effect of Appeal Fund payments on benefit


The Trustees for the Appeal Fund are making final payments      to the Hillsborough
victims in two distinct phases.     The first phase involved making substantial
payment to the families of the 95 people who died and to the 20 people who
were most seriously injured.     For reasons of confidentiality, few details of
the payments are known other than the fact that 5 claimants have lost Income
Support (IS) and presumably Housing Benefit (HB) because they have capital in
excess of the capital limit (£6000 in IS, £8000 in HB).   One claimant has
                                                       *?
declared a lump sum payment of £15000 plus a further £2£,000 in trust for her
son.     It is the lump sum payments which disentitle them to benefit.    We
understand that the trust funds are discretionary which means that the capital
held on trust does not belong to the beneficiary and cannot affect benefit -
any actual payments from the trust are treated in the normal way.        In
practice, therefore,    discretionary trusts achieve the same   result as the
proposal for extending the current disregard.      These victims would not be
helped, therefore, by relaxing the disregard.


2.     The second phase is now underway and involves the Trustees in paying out
the £5m that is left to around 700 people who were less seriously injured - an
average of £7000 per person.     Because the awards will be lower and the victims
more able to manage their own affairs, payments are likely to be in the form
of lump sums rather than discretionary trusts.      We estimate that 35-40 people
could have their IS affected - perhaps more in HB.      It is this grove-,
therefore, which might gain from the current disregard for at least 2 years.
Those people with the highest awards and hence the most extensive injuries may
well have over £3000 left at the end of 2 yeaiy      so a relaxation of the 2 year
limit would help them.     Even more so if awards were also made by S Yorkshire
Police or as a result of court action.


3.     The Hillsborough victims would not, however, be the only claimants to be
helped by a relaxation of the disregard.     It would help claimants who receive
payments due to an injury whether through the courts, insurance or from the
Criminal Injury Compensation Board (CICB) by enabling them to make better
provision for themselves in later years.
4.    Extending the current disregard for capital held on trust would provide a
small but welcome easement for a few hard cases, and we recommend accordingly.


5.    Timing


The change could, as S of S suggests, be made along with any improvement to
the disregard for charitable and voluntary payments.     Although this could be
done for Income Support and Family Credit (FC) next April, Housing Benefit and
Community Charge Benefit would need to wait until October 1990 because a
structural change is involved.


6.    Cost


Adopting the same basis for costing the change as we estimate the total
benefit cost to be £200,000 pa in IS, HB and CCB with a negligible cost in
FC.    [There would be neutral operational costs].


II    FULL DISREGARD OF ALL PAYMENTS FROM THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER APPEAL FUNDS


7.    It would be relatively straightforward to provide regulations similar to
those for the MacFarlane Trust in order to disregard all payments from the
Hillsborough Disaster Fundi    Amending regulations could be introduced quite
quickly for IS and FC but not until October 1990 in HB and CCB because a
structural change is involved.     Consultation with SSAC and Local Authorities
would be necessary but should not pose a problem unless either chose to raise
questions about other disasters.     On this issue, legal advice is that S of S
                                                       vJq   S'
would need to consider whether a similar concession were necessary in the
event of any future disaster but he would not be legally obliged to do
anything.


8.    Any amendment could not, however, be introduced retrospectively so to
avoid any losers it would be necessary to identify the cases and make payments
extra statutorily.     If this exercise were to include HB, special arrangements
would be necessary to pick up the cases because LAs are not organised to
undertake this task.    Moreover, extra statutory payments made in lieu of HB
would make it increasingly difficult to reject demands for similar measures to
be taken in the future.
9.    Costs

Benefit costs are difficult to gauge because of the absence of details about
                           ^~a.ae
the already and due to be.          Our best guess is £    pa for all income-related
     A,       K            A-
benefits.     [Operational costs would be negligible].


10. However, a disregard of all Hillsborough Disaster payments would set a
precedent and has a number of major policy disadvantages.           Ministers would be
very hard pressed to resist introducing identical concessions for past and
future disasters:    even if the victims are not claimants in the period
immediately following a disaster they could become claimants and their benefit
entitlement affected by the treatment of their compensation payments.            It
would also be extremely difficult politically to defend giving a disregard to
some victims but not to others.          Equally difficult would be ignoring payments
arising from public donations while taking fully into account payments from
insurances or awards for damages made by courts.          In such an emotive    area, the
media and the public would be unlikely to accept the reason for the
distinction, particularly if the claimant, whose benefit is affected, is
seriously infirm or his partner was killed.          Copies of correspondence
illustrating the strength of feeling are at Annex 2.


11. We have considered, but rejected, the idea of S of S nominating particular
disasters for preferential' treatment.         Lawyers advise against this course
which would require primary legislation and a very detailed criteria in
regulations to show how the discretion would be exercised.


12. Operationally, there would be further difficulties.          Capital arising from
compensation payments would inevitably be mixed with other capital, which
attracted no disregard, making it impossible to identify the amount to take
into account for tariff income purposes or to allocate any interest earned.
There is also the possibility of trust funds being set up with money from the
Disaster Fund and damages awarded by the courts:          again making it impossible
to decide how much of any trust payments to take into account.


13. For all these reasons, we are unable to recommend a disregard of payments

from the Hillsborough Disaster Fund.
Ill FULL DISREGARD OF PAYMENTS FROM ALL DISASTER APPEAL FUNDS


14. A full disregard of payments from any Disaster Appeal Fund would overcome
some, but not all, of the problems already mentioned.         It would remove the
pressure on Ministers to make the same concession for any future disaster and
it could ensure that capital still held from previous disasters was also
ignored.   Lawyers advise that it would be possible to define Disaster Appeal
Funds in regulations.     But any definition would need to be very specific, and
therefore lengthy, in order to avoid disregarding payments for any domestic or
personal mishap.     For example, it might be necessary to refer to a minimum
amount of money collected from private donations, the existence of a trust
fund and, perhaps, lay down a minimum number of people involved (though we
think this would be undesirable).


15. However, such a disregard would still leave the problem of treating
compensation payments differently depending on whether they originated from
public donations or elsewhere.    This would necessitate Ministers making some
hard decisions in often sad circumstances.     Operationally,this option would
present more of the same problems for identifying the income and capital to
take into account.     And there could also be difficulties for adjudication
officers if the definition was not tightly drawn.


16. If Ministers considered it essential to do much more for disaster victims
we believe this option has more going for it than option II, but we are still
unable to recommend it.


17. Timing and Costs


Amendments could be made to regulations to come into effect in IS, HB and FC
by the end of this year, linking these to the changes due to the setting up of
a second MacFarlane Trust.    Alternatively, the amendments could all be
                                                        C O     i- e   d.

introduced in April 1990 and cpv^r the intervening period .extra-statutorily.
Amendments to CCB could be made in April 1990.


Benefit costs are speculative but we estimate these to be in the region of
£     in a full year (£       for 3 months January-March 1990).             [These could be

covered in minor bids].

MacFarlane Trust/Hillsborough Disaster Appeal Fund


Line to take:


There is wide agreement that the circumstances of haemophiliacs who have been
infected by the AIDS virus/ and of their families, are very exceptional.   It is
because their position is unique that any payments they receive from the
MacFarlane Trust are fully disregarded for Social Security purposes.


However, those same circumstances do not apply to the victims of the
Hillsborough Disaster, for whom the existing rules are appropriate.

                 HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - DRAFT TRUST DOCS


 1.   Thank you for letting us see the draft trust documents.   I
 have had the opportunity of discussing them with a representative
 of SOL Bl whose advice has been taken into account in this reply.

  2.   The "disabled" and "inexperienced adult" trusts appear to be
' entirely discretionary with regard to the capital held;  at least
  so far as the initial beneficiaries are concerned.  Consequently
  neither would represent a capital asset of the claimant.

 3.   Under the "disabled" trust the trustees have discretion
 whether or not to make payments from income but in the event that
 they do, atleast half of such income must go to the claimant.       I
 am not sure   just how this would work in practice but the AO would
 treat any payments made in the normal way as either income or
 capital.

 4.   The "inexperienced adult" trust provides for the beneficiary
 an absolute  life interest in the income of the funds.
 Consequently any payments from the fund would be taken into
 account in full and attributed to a period equal to the period
 over which it accrued.   However should the trustees not make any
 payments from the income of the fund to a claimant the AO may not
 treat the claimant as possessed of that income by virtue of the
 excepting provision in regulation 42(2)(b) of the General   ^
 Regulations.                                                 '
                                                                       r



 5.   The 2 trusts relating to minors have the same provisions as
 each other.  Both are contingent trusts in relation to income and
 capital, the contingency being the attainment of the age of 25
 years, so neither represents a capital asset before the
 beneficiary attains that age. Neither confers any rights as to
 income prior to the contingency thus any payments made from the
 income should be dealt with in the normal way, as and when made.

 6.   I do not see the trusts affecting adversely any IS claim,
 subject to the above observations as to income, providing they
 are drawn up in accordance with these drafts.   Obviously an AO
 faced with, the question once the trusts are up and running would
 have to have regard to the actual wording used.

     Dear

      Thank you for your letter of the 19th December concerning
      the trusts which we propose to set up.

     The advice you have given is most helpful indeed and will,
     I am sure, go a long way towards allaying concernsabout
     the impact of payments we are making. As you will
     appreciate, it may be that we shall get enquiries from
     the various Solicitors acting for the beneficiaries and I
     wonder if you would be agreeable to my letting them have
     copies of your letter or of relevant parts of it.

     Very best wishes for the New Year,


     Yours sincerely,

   Dear Mr Reddington

   Thank you for your letter of 2 January asking if you can circulate copies of
   my previous letter to various solicitors.

   I have no objection to this and hope they will find the guidance helpful.  It
   is important to stress, however, that my letter only offers guidance and that
   decisions on entitlement to benefit are made by the independent adjudication
   authorities.

   Best wishes for the New Year.

    Dear Mr Reddington

    Some weeks ago you sent to me copies of four draft trusts and invited comments
    about their effect, if any, on people's entitlement to income-related
    benefits, namely, Income Support, Housing Benefit and Family Credit.  I am
    sorry that other pressures have prevented me from writing to you sooner
    although we have discussed these and other issues by telephone.

    I can confirm that, as drafted, none of the capital held on any of the trur.tr.
    would be taken into account.   In the caur of thr minors th** capital would, ol
    course, be due to them on reaching ag* 2 b years but this ip iomn wny off.         A?>y

    As to the income from the trust funds, only thr trust foi the              lern-pf!
    adult provides a life interest to income.  This Income, whuo            woylft be­
    taken fully into account and reduce the benefit otherwise p u y t M f .   Jn ttlJ the
    other trusts, the trustees have discretion to pay the trust income - Although
    the trust for the "disabled" suggests that at least half of the income would
    be released.  Any ircome paid at the discretion of the trustees is payable on
    a voluntary basis and as such the first £5 a week is disregarded (except where
    the claimant has a War Pension or student covenant which already uses up this
    disregard).

    I am sure y o u will appreciate that thi; above advice is dependent upon the
    final w o rding of the trusts.  In any event, all decisions about entitlement to
    benefit are matters for independent adjudication officers and, in the case of
    Housing Benefit, local authorities.     That apart, I have no reason to think
    they would reach a different conclusion to what I have said above.

    We also discussed how the c u r r e n t r u l e s might help those less seriously
    injured people who are due, or have received, payments.            1 explained that
    everyone who received a p»y»•n,             te> * Personal injury could place the money
    on trust - while retaining *n                    interest in it, if they wished - and

    would be ignored for at l e M t * ***** for Adults and throughout dependency for
    children (which could be                        y**r«), The children would be entitled
to the further 2 years disregard if they claimed benefit in their own right.
Any payments made by the trustees for such trusts would be taken into account
as income or capital as I have set out above and depending on the terms of the
trust.

I hope that this is helpful but if you have any questions please give me or my
colleague,                 on extension 2672, a ring.

         (2)    Every such power or discretion shall be exercisable from time to
    time during the Trust Period or such longer period as aforesaid and at the

                                             6
       (3)          The Trustees shall have power by deed to release or restrict the
future exercise of any such power or discretion either wholly and so to bind
their successors or to any lesser extent as they think fit

8.      Notwithstanding any rule of equity to the contrary

       (1)    None of the 'IYustees (other than any of the Excluded Persons)

connected with the 'IYust Fund

        (2)   The Trustees may enter into any transaction (including a sale
purchase lease or loan) notwithstanding that one or more of their number
may have some other interest, therein whether in a personal or fiduciary
capacity PROVIDED that (a.) at, least one of their number has no such
other interest and (b) a duly qualified independent valuer or other adviser
has advised that the transaction is a fair and reasonable one for the Trustees

trust whatever whether by way of commission or omission unless it is proved
to have been made done or omitted in personal conscious bad faith of the
trustee sought, to be made liable
 * In my      experience the Court i* generally relncUnt to approve trunts which give an indemnity
     of this nort to paid professional iriihleea. Hence the word* iu square brackets.
      (2)        W ithout prejudice to the generality of the foregoing none of the
Trustees shall be liable for leaving the conduct of the business and affairs

                or an interest in possession in th a t part of the Trust Fund as

 BRIEFING FOR THE PRIME MINISTER


 HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER APPEAL FUND


 Line to take:


  [I understand that the Hillsborough Disaster Fund has paid out over
 half of the £10.9m collected by the Fund, to the families of those
 who so tragically lost their lives and to other victims of the
 disaster.    Several hundred payments have been made from the Fund.
 Some of the payments have been made as lump sum awards or placed in
 trust funds while others have been in respect of particular
 expenses.]


 Most payments from the Fund have no effect whatsoever on Social
 Security benefits.    However, a very small number of people, whose
 compensation payments were substantial and cannot be disregarded,
 may find that they are no longer entitled to income-related benefits
 because their capital is too high.


 While we greatly sympathise with the families who have suffered as a
 result of this terrible tragedy, we do not think it would be
 appropriate to introduce different rules for the treatment of
 capital according to the circumstances in which the capital was
 received.    To do so would lead to serious inequities between
 claimants which would be quite unacceptable.
0W95O1P/2




 HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER FUND:   QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS


 Whv is there no disregard of all compensation payments?


 It would be inequitable to pay money from public funds to someone
 who has a large amount of capital available for their everyday
 living expenses but, at the same time, to refuse benefit to other
 people who have struggled to save or have received insurance
 payments in respect of, say, an accident.


 The capital limits are too harsh


 The capital limits are right at the moment.Benefit       is paid from
 public money and is not intended for those people with substantial
 incomes or amounts of capital.


 Special disregards already exist for certain types of capital, so
 whv not for payments from a disaster fund?


 There is already a special disregard for payments in respect of a
 personal injury which are put in a trust.


 Payments from the Fund should be ignored#like payments     from the
 Macfarlane Trust to HIV positive haemophiliacs


 It has always been made clear that payments from the Macfarlane
 Trust are not compensation.   They are intended to provide additional
 help to HIV positive haemophiliacs, and their dependents, who are in
 financial need. The Macfarlane Trust is funded from the public
 purse and there is not a direct comparison with the privately funded
 Hillsborough Disaster Fund.
Can compensation payments be ignored?


Yes.   Payments which do not take a person's capital to over £3000
will be ignored.     In addition, compensation paid in respect of
injuries will be disregarded for at least 2 years if it is put into
a trust.   And compensation which is put into a discretionarytrust
by the Fund's trustees can also be ignored. However, actual
payments from the trusts will be taken into account in the normal
way.


Will people who have lost benefit as a result of a payment be able
to reclaim?


Yes; when their capital reduces to £6,000, or £8,000 for Housing
Benefit, through reasonable expenditure.


If the public had known of the rules many would not have given so
generously to the Fund


I don't think that this is true.     The people in this country, and
abroad, rallied round and I'm sure will always do so, to help in a
swift and generous manner.


The DSS should have responded more guicklv


We responded quickly and sympathetically to requests for help, as
did the Fund itself.    Many of our officials knew people who were
killed or injured.


Why are the payments from the Fund so low?


The level of payments is a matter for the trustees.


Were trustees advised of the effect that payments could have on
benefit?


Yes; officials have offered advice throughout.     But they have not
been involved in decisions made by the trustees in individual cases.

    Background

    There are no special rules in Income Support for the treatment of
    payments from disaster funds.    Nor have any enquiries been
    received about the treatment of payments from earlier disaster
    funds.     Special arrangements have been made to deal with any
    claims and enquiries resulting from the Hillsborough disaster.


    Some disaster funds do not become registered charities, because
    it would narrow the range of assistance they could give.    The
    Hillsborough Disaster Fund has decided not to register.


    Any payments from the fund will therefore be treated as voluntary
    payments which are subject to various disregards in Income
    Support.


    The first £5 a week of any regular payments is normally
    disregarded.

    Any lump sum payment will be treated as capital - the first
    £3,000 of any capital is ignored completely and an income of £1 a
    week is assumed for every £250, or part thereof, of any capital
    between £3,000 and £6,000.     Any interest earned by the capital is
    ignored.

    No Income Support is payable if a person has more than £6,000
    (for Housing Benefit the limit is £8,000).

HILLSBOROUGH HOUSING AND COMMUNITY CHARGE BENEFIT

I am perturbed by the proposal to disregard local payments, like
payments from local disaster funds like the Hillsborough fund, for
Housing Benefit and Community Charge Benefit. For a start there is
the fact that LAs will be heavily burdened implementing the Community
Charge - and Community Charge Benefit - next year.        We must be
involved fully in any decisions on this issue. I myself believe that
local disaster schemes such payments should not be disregarded by a
national benefit scheme - although this approach could lead to
differences between centrally and locally administered income related
benefits.

    COPING WITH THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF DISASTERS
Government help for follow-up and counselling Working Group

David Mellor, Minister for Health, today welcomed the formation
of a Joint Working Group on disaster follow-up and counselling.
It will be considering what recent tragedies can teach social
services departments and other local agencies involved in coping
with the social and psychological effects of major disasters on
victims and their relations.

The Department of Health has already provided £25,000 in 1988/89
for CRUSE Bereavement Care, the national voluntary organisation,
to administer the group, and hopes to provide up to a further
£61,000 over the next two years. The group is chaired by Mr Tony
Allen, chief executive of Berkshire County Council.

Mr Mellor said: "In the wake of so many recent and appalling
tragedies, we want to pool all the available expertise, so that
local agencies can learn from shared experiences how best to
provide social and psychological support for those affected.

"We hope that the work of the joint group will help local
agencies to be prepared for an immediate and effective response
to such events."

Social services departments have played a key part in supporting
and co-ordinating the roles of local authorities and voluntary
organisations. The group expects to report within the next
12 - 18 months, and its terms of reference are to consider the
following points, taking account of the resources likely to be
available:

what steps should be taken to prepare for the provision of
social and psychological support in the aftermath of such
disasters;

how best to achieve coordination among agencies in the
arrangement of the necessary support;

how the lessons learned from recent experiences might best be
disseminated;

Frank Field Esq MP




Thank you for your letter of 7 November on behalf of the Hillsborough Family
Support Group, concerning the effect of payments from the Hillsborough Disaster
Fund on entitlement to Social Security Benefits.


As you know, I was deeply shocked and saddened by the tragic events at
Hillsborough last April.    I am pleased to hear, therefore, that a Support
Group has been set up to help the many people who were injured or bereaved and
that substantial payments are now being made by the Hillsborough Disaster

Appeal Fund.


Although it is not known how many victims of the disaster are receiving Social
Security benefits, the vast majority of benefits are completely unaffected by
payments from the Fund.    Only the income-related benefits - Income Support
Housing Benefit and Family Credit - may be affected-


These benefit schemes are particularly flexible and provide a number of ways
to enable the Fund's Trustees to make payments without reducing people's
benefit.    One such concession ensures that payments made in consequence of an
injury and placed in trust is disregarded for at least 2 years, and much

the MacFarlane Trust to haemophiliacs who have been infected by the AIDS

from that of other claimants.            It is for this reason that the payments they
receive from the MacFarlane Trust are treated exceptionally, and completely

I do not think that it would be appropriate to extend this concession in the

way you suggest.


I am very sorry to hear that two mothers were upset by the way their claims
for Income Support had been handled, particularly as the local Social Security
offices close to the disaster have been making every effort to deal
sensitively with the many enquiries they have received about Hillsborough.               I

have made enquiries to identify these claims but, unfortunately the exact
circumstances which you described could not be matched with any particular
claim for benefit.            If you would like to provide me with further details I
shall certainly look into the mattf           again.


In the meantime, I would urge anyone who has lost Income Support because of

their capital to make a further claim as soon as this has racioced to £6000.
And if their Housing Benefit has also been affected, to reclaim when their

capital reaches £8000.


I am sorry this may seem a disappointing reply but I hope it clarifies the
position.

should remain in. This is the central issue raised by Frank Field and, after
such a delay in replying, we need to answer him in some way. Mr Provan's
submission of 20 December 1989 recommended that there should be no special
arrangement for the Hillsborough or any other disaster appeal fund; if S of S
decides to go along that road, we can distinguish it from the Macfarlane Trust

Frank Field Esq MP




Thank you for your letter of 7 November 1989 on behalf of the Hillsborough
Family Support Group, concerning the effect of payments from the Hillsborough
Disaster Fund on entitlement to Social Security benefits.     I apologise for the
delay in replying while officials at the Department of Social Security made
further enquiries.


As you know, I was deeply shocked and saddened by the tragic events at
Hillsborough last April.     I am pleased to hear, therefore, that a    Support
Group has been set up to    help the many people who were injured or    bereaved,
and that substantial payments are now being made by the Hillsborough Disaster
Appeal Fund.


Although it is not known how many victims of the disaster are receiving Social
Security benefits, the vast majority of benefits are completely unaffected by
payments from the Fund.    Only the income-related benefits - Income Support,
Housing Benefit and Family Credit - may be affected.


These benefit schemes are particularly flexible and already provide a number
of ways to enable the Fund’s Trustees to make payments without reducing
people's benefit.    One such concession   ensures that payments made   in
consequence of an injury    and placed in trust are disregarded for at least two
years, and much longer if the payment is for a child.     In addition, sums
placed in discretionary trusts do not normally affect benefit, although any
paument from the trusts would be taken into account in the normal way.


Officials of the Department of Social Security have explained these rules in
some detail to the Trustees, who have already indicated a willingness to place
significant amounts in Trust.    Clearly, however, it is a matter for the

Trustees to decide how best to help the many families involved,     to date the
Trustees have made several hundred payments to the victims of Hillsborough of
which only a very small minority have resulted in benefit being lost.   These
particular families have received many thousands of pounds and, while this
money cannot in any way compensate them for their loss, it does mean that they
no longer require the same degree of financial support from the public funds
as before.


You ask whether payments from the Hillsborough Disaster Fund could be fully
disregarded in the same way as payments made by the Macfarlane Trust to
heamophiliacs who have been infected by the AIDS virus.   Their situation is,
however, different to that of the Hillsborough families; therefore I do not
think that it would be appropriate to extend this concession in the way you
suggest.


I am sorry to hear that two mothers were upset by the way their claims for
Income Support had been handled, particularly as the local Social Security
offices close to the disaster have been making every effort to deal
sensitively with the enquiries they have been receiving about Hillsborough.
Enquiries were made to identify these claims but, unfortunately, the exact
circumstances which you described could not be matched with any particular
claim for benefit.   If you would like to provide further details the matter
will certainly be looked into again.


I hope this reply helps to clarify the position.

    Officials of the Department of Social Security are in regular
    contact with the Fund's administrators and have explained the rules
    in considerable detail.   They are also on hand to offer any further
    advice that is needed.    In this way we hope that, as with other
    disaster funds, any difficulty can be avoided.

 Some 1,200 people with haemophilia have become       hiv   positive as a
 result of treatment with a blood product known as Factor VIII,
 and approximately 600 are seeking compensation for that Hiv

 infection. This is a matter for the Courts; the Department of
 Health are co-defendants in the action, and are denying

 liability.   The main aspects of the case are sub-judice and
 further comment would be inappropriate.



The Government do not intend to introduce any scheme for no-fault
compensation    for medical      accidents;    the   Pearson   Committee

investigated this in 1978 and recommended against such a scheme.


When the Government announced the setting up of the independent

Macfarlane Trust with a £10m ex-gratia award in November 1987, it

was made clear that this was not compensation, but was to provide

help to HIV positive haemophiliacs and their dependents who were
in financial need.



Additionally, as the Macfarlane Trust was funded from the public

         purse i there is not a direct comparison with the privately funded

         [Hillsborough Disaster Fund]. In considering the very special
         circumstances of people with haemophilia and hiv infection, the

         Government wished the special payments to be in addition to the
         relevant Social Security benefits. Regulations were therefore

         laid to provide for this.



         At the time that the £!0m financing to the Macfarlane Trust was

         announced, the Government also said it would be open to

         representations about further funding, and this remains the

         position.

  ‘denied

  Families of the Hillsborough
  victims are being disqualified
' from benefit because they
  have received payments from
  the disaster fund, a Labour
  MP said last night.
     Frank Field, chairman of
  the Commons select commit­
  tee on social services and MP
  for Birkenhead, asked the
  Prime Minister to review the
  position urgently.
     Mr Field said: “Taking
  away benefit once compensa­
  tion payments are p a id .
  strikes me as unfair.”

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER APPEAL FUND


Line to take:


[I understand that the Hillsborough Disaster Fund has paid out over half of

the £10.9m collected by the Fund, to the families of those who so tragically
lost their lives and to other victims of the disaster.    Several hundred
payments have been made from the Fund.    Some of the payments have been made as
lump sum awards or placed in trust funds while others have been in respect of
particular expenses].


Most payments from the Fund have no effect whatsoever on Social Security
benefits.   However, a very small number of people, whose compensation payments
were substantial and cannot be disregarded, may find that they are no longer
entitled to income-related benefits because their capital is too high.


While we greatly sympathise with the families who have suffered as a resuTE &f~
this terrible tragedy, we do not think it would be appropriate to introduce
different rules for the treatment of capital according to the circumstances in
which the   capital was received.   To do so would lead to serious inequities
between claimants which would be quite unacceptable.
K9071/TF




HILLSBOROUGH D IS A S T E R FUN D ; Q U E ST IO N S AND ANSWERS



Why is there no disregard of all compensation payments?



It w o u l d be inequitable to pay m o n e y from public funds to someone who has a

large amount of capital available for their everyday living expenses but, at

the same time, to refuse benefit to other people who have struggled to save or

have received insurance payments in respect of, say, an accident.




The capital limits are too harsh



The capital limits are right at the moment.               Benefit is paid from public money

and is not intended for those people w it h substantial incomes or amounts of

capital.




Special disregards already exist for certain types of capital,              so w h y not for

payments from a disaster fund?



There is already a special disregard for payments in respect of a personal

injury w hi ch are put in a trust.




Payments from the Fund should be ignored,             like payments from the

Macfarlane Trust to HIV positive haemophiliacs



It has always been ma de clear that payments from the Macfarlane Trust are not

compensation.      They are intended to provide additional help to HIV positive

haemophiliacs,     and their dependents, who are in financial need.            The

Macfarlane Trust is funded from the public purse and there is not a direct

comparison w i t h the privately funded Hillsborough Disaster Fund.
Can compensation payments be ignored?


Yes.   Payments which do not take a person's capital to over £3000 will be
ignored.    In addition, compensation paid in respect of injuries will be
disregarded for at least 2 years if it is put into a trust.    And compensation
which is put into a discretionary trust by the Fund's trustees can ]v also fee
ignored.    However, actual payments from the trusts will be taken into account

in the normal way.




Will people who have lost benefit as a result of a payment be able to reclaim?


Yes; when their capital reduces to £6,000, or £8,000 for Housing Benefit,
through reasonable expenditure.




If the public had known of the rules many would not have given so generously
to the Fund


I don't think that this is true.    The people in this country, and abroad,
rallied round and I'm sure will always do so, to help in a swift and generous
manner.




The DSS should have responded more quickly


We responded quickly and sympathetically to requests for help, as did the Fund
itself.    Many of our officials knew people who were killed or injured.




Why are the payments from the Fund so low?


The level of payments is a matter for the trustees.
Were trustees advised of the effect that payments could have.on benefit?


Yes; officials have offered advice throughout.   But they have not been

involved in decisions made by the trustees in individual cases.

     The Trustees of the Hillsborough Appeal Fund have completed
     the first stage of the major distribution of the Fund.
     They have taken as their first priority the b e r e a v e d families,
     the seriously injured and those less seriously injured who
     have been experiencing financial difficulties.

     At 25th October the total contributions to the Fund amounted
     to £10.9 million, and well over half has no w been distributed.
     There are still several hundred injuries cases w h i c h are being
     considered by the Fund's Medical Advisers and it is the
     Trustees' aim to make payments in these cases before Christmas,

     Separate Trust Funds are being set up for the children of
     those who were so tragically killed at Hillsborough.

     The Trustees w ish to express their appreciation to the
     thousands of generous contributors to the Fund wh o have made
     the distribution possible.

     When I wrote to you on 3rd July, I told you that it was
the wish of the Trustees to make payments as quickly as
possible to the families of those who were so tragically killed
at Hillsborough*  t o that end you kindly helped us by giving
information about your family.

     Now that we can better judge the size of the Fund and
have had the opportunity to take into account all of that
information and the views expressed to us from a variety of
sources about the distribution, the Trustees are now able to
make a payment from the Fund to you.  As we see it at present,
this will be the final distribution to you, apart from any
remaining funeral or headstone expenses.

       The Trustees know full well that m oney cannot compensate
you for the loss of your   , but the enclosed cheque comes to
you and your family as a token of the sympathy expressed by
people throughout the world, who have in part shared your
griefi   We, and the hundreds of thousands who have contributed,
hope that it will in some small measure help and comfort you in
your loss.

     The Trustees did consider the question of distribution of
the payment among the various members of the family and on
balance it was thought more appropriate for you and the family
to decide on that than for the Trustees to do so.  If any
members of the family were themselves at Hillsborough, their
injury claims are being dealt with separately.

     am y o u K n o w , tne Trustees have decided that these payments
are entirely confidential and that details of amounts paid will
not be divulged to anyone.        We shall in due course announce
that a distribution has taken place but, again, this will be in
very general terms and the names of recipients and amounts will
remain confidential.        You may yourself need to disclose the
amount received (e4gi to D*S*S*) but this will not breach the
confidentiality we are trying to maintain to protect your
privacy*

  Dear Mr Reddington                                                5 JUN 19W
  Further to my letter of 2 May, I am writing to 'g‘J^~jrotl' §om^ d^dltioSal
  information which may be helpful.              --------- ^

  While the majority of Social Security benefits such as Invalidity Benefit and
  Unemployment Benefit, are not affected by the amount of capital a person has,
  the income-related benefits - Income Support, Housing Benefit and Family
  Credit - may be affected.  I sent you a fact sheet about Income Support and
  capital.  This also applies to Housing Benefit and Family Credit, although the
  capital limit for Housing Benefit is £8000.  I have enclosed another copy, for
  your information.

  You may also be interested to know that if the Fund's trustees were to create
  a discretionary trust for the benefit of one or more people, the capital held
  on trust will be wholly ignored when working out entitlement to benefit
  because none of the beneficiaries actually own the capital.  However, the
  actual payments made from such a trust will be treated as voluntary payments
  in the normal way as set out in the factsheet headed "Charitable and Voluntary
  Payments".

  I, or my colleague                     will be happy to discuss this or any other
  matter if it is giving concern.

                                   INCOME SUPPORT




                                      CAPITAL




WHAT IS CAPITAL?


*   Capital includes all savings, for example money held in a bank or building
    society account. Premium Bonds, National Savings Certificates, stocks and
    shares, insurance policies and property.


HOW DOES CAPITAL AFFECT INCOME SUPPORT?


*   You and your partner can have up to £6,000 capital and still get Income
    Support.   But you cannot receive benefit if your capital or your combined
    capital is more than £6,000.


*   Normally, all capital is counted.     But some of it may be ignored, for

    example the home you live in and certain other property, life insurance
    policies and personal possessions, such as a car.


*   Children's savings are not included as part of your capital.       Special
    rules apply to their capital and you may still get Income Support even if
    they have more than £6,000.


*   The first £3,000 capital that you and your partner have, will not affect
    the amount of Income Support you can receive.       But the amount will be
    reduced by £1 a week for every £250, or part of £250, held between £3,000
    and £6,000.


         Example 1   You have exactly £3,000.       Your Income Support will not be
         affected.


         Example 2   You have £2,600 and your partner has £1,000, making a
         total of £3,600.   Your Income Support will be reduced by £3 a week.



         Example 3   You and your partner have £6,000 between you.       Your Income
         Support will be reduced by £12 a week.
W H Y DOES CAPITAL AFFECT INCOME   S T T P P ftP T ?




*    Income Support is public money provided out of taxation.          It is intended
    to bring any resources you and your family have up to a certain level.

    Therefore,    it would be wrong to ignore relatively large amounts of

    capital.     The Government believe that the capital rules strike the right
    balance between encouraging people to save and the proper use of public
    money.



C A N I GIVE CAPITAL AWAY OR SPEND T??



*   If you give some of your capital away in order to get Income Support or to

    increase the amount payable, the capital you have given away may be taken
    into account as if you still had it.



         Example 1    You cannot get Income Support because you have £9,000 in

         the building society.     You give your son £4,000 to bri n g you below
         the Income Support limit of £6,000.           You may not get any Income
         Support.



         Example 2    You have £2,800 capital and give your daughter £500.          Your
         Income Support will not be affected because your original capital was
         not more than £3,000.



*   If you spend some of your capital in a reasonable way such as on normal

    day to day living expenses or on essential house repairs and your capital

    reduced to £6000 or less, you may be entitled to Income Support or to more
    Income Support if you are already getting it.



        Byample 1     You cannot get Income Support because you have £7,000.

        Essential work is carried out to repair a leaking roof costing you

        £1400.     As you now have £5,800 you may be entitled to Income Support.


        Example 2    You have £5100 and are getting Income Support.         You spend

        £100 to redecorate your living room and another £400 to replace a

        worn-out carpet.    As you now have £4,600 you may be entitled to more
        Income Support.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER FUND : UPDATE


 *   On 30 June 1989 the Fund stood at about £8.5m.


 *   Initial payments to bereaved relatives have been made, plus a few
      payments,   in cases of severe hardship.


      For example, to pay mortgage arrears for a self-employed person who is
      long-term sick.


      The Fund has kept payments well within the capital limits and are not
      aware of anyone losing benefit.


 *   Agents of the Fund are making personal visits to obtain more detailed
      information.    It will be at least 2 months before any final payments are
      made.


 *   22 Social Security Offices in the Liverpool area are monitoring the
      situation - they are unaware of anybody losing Income Support.




                                                                 /
HILLSBOROUGH:    EFFECT OF PAYMENTS ON SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS

*   Payments made from the Hillsborough Disaster Fund will have no
    retrospective effect on benefit already paid nor will they be Effected by
    the provisions in the current Social Security Bill.

*   At 22 May the Hillsborough Disaster Fund stood at about £5m - donations
    are still coining in.

*   The Hillsborough Disaster Fund have made one payment so far [ £ 2 0 0 ] to
    assist with visiting expenses to hospital.  The amount involved is
    unlikely to affect benefit.

*   The Trustees for the Fund expect to make further payments before the end
    of the month (May) to bereaved relatives and the seriously injured.

*   Social Services currently act as agents for the Fund to make urgent
    payments to relieve need for such as funeral catering bills, visits to
    hospital and overnight accommodation.
                                                           noP
*   The majority of Social Security benefits are^ income-related - they will
    not be affected by payments from the Fund.

*   Payments may, however, affect on-going payment of income-related
    benefits.  The effect on Income Support depends on the nature of the
    payment received:
                                              ■S N
          the first £5 a week of any regular voluntary payment is normally
          disregarded;

          any lump sum payment will be treated as capital - the first £3,000 of
          any capital is ignored completely and an income of £1 a week is
          assumed for every £ 2 5 0 , or part thereof, of any capital between
          £ 3 , 0 0 0 and £ 6 , 0 0 0 . Any interest earned by the capital is ignored.
          No Income Support is payable if a person has more than £ 6 , 0 0 0 (for
          Housing Benefit the limit is £ 8 , 0 0 0 ) ;

          if capital sum is placed on trust for an injured person, this can be

          child, for as long as he/she is a dependent;

          the fund has guaranteed payment of funeral costs of those involved.
          If the funeral account is sent direct to Liverpool Social Services
          Dept they will send it on to the Disaster Fund and payment will be
          made direct to the undertaker without benefit being affected.

          payments made by Liverpool Social Services to alleviate immediate
          hardship (eg for clothing to attend funerals) were made direct to
          individuals to purchase essential items and the amounts involved were
          not high enough to affect benefit entitlement;



Effect of 1989 Social Security Bill

*   If and when liability is established, any compensation payments (as
    distinct from the charitable payments made from the disaster fund) made
    after the start of the new Social Security recoupment rules in the late
    summer of 1990 will be subject to recoupment.                  It will apply only to
    benefits and compensation paid to those survivors who were injured.
    Payments to relatives of those who died will be excluded from the new
    rules.  Any s u c h payments m a d e b e f o r e t h e n e w r u l e s come into operation
    will remain subject to the current offsetting rules.

Local Authority Social Services Departments have been authorised
to act on behalf of the Hillsborough Disaster Fund to make
payments to meet urgent need.   I understand that the trustees for
the Fund hope to make further payments very shortly.


As far as I am aware, no Social Security benefits have been
affected by any payment.   Of course, any payment made by, or on
behalf of, the Fund will be dealt with sensitively and under the
existing rules.   My hon. Friend the Minister of State for Social

Suggested Reply


Payments from disaster funds do not affect the majority of Social Security
benefits.


The income-related benefits - Income Support, Family Credit and Housing
Benefit - may be affected by payments from disaster funds but this will depend
on the size and nature of the payments.           The first £5 a week of any regular
payment may be disregarded and a lump sum payment will not affect benefit
unless it takes the claimant's capital over £ 3 0 0 0 .          An income of £1 a week is
assumed for every £ 2 5 0 , or part thereof, of capital between £ 3 0 0 0 and £ 6 0 0 0 in
IncG7Tt£   Support ano Fsjiiily Credit, ano DBtvccii £ o G G G    arid £ 8 0 0 0   ii; Housii'iG

Benefit.       No Income Support or Family Credit is payable if the capital held is
over £ 6 0 0 0 ,   and no Housing Benefit is available if it is over £ 8 0 0 0 .


However,     capital held on trust may be disregarded.           For example, any payment
made from a disaster fund because of a personal injury, which is placed on
trust, is fully disregarded for at least 2 years and, in the case of a child,
for as long as the child is a dependant.           Any actual       payments from         the trust
will be taken into account as income or capital in the normal way.                        In
addition, any payment made to a third party will be completely disregarded if
it is used to provide goods or services which are not already met by benefit.
Officials continue to liaise with the administrators of the Hillsborough
Disaster Fund and they have advised them of the Social Security rules.


The 1989 Social Security Bill will not result in any                Social Security benefit
being recovered from payments made from any disaster                fund.

; sums from the Hillsborough Di­
  saster Fund could los? social se-
: curity benefits, the Social Secu­
   rity m inister, Mr Nicholas
  Scott, in a Commons written
  reply. With the appeal having1
  raised £45 million to help vic­
  tims of the tragedy, families on
  benefit could be penalised for
  any big cash handout they;
  receive from the fund. They:
  will lose Income Support and,
  Family Credit if a donation
  ffom the fund takes their capi-*—
  tal over £6,000. And they will no
  longer be able to claim Housing
  Benefit if a donation puts their
  capita! over £8,000, Mr Scott
  told Mr Tony Speller, (C.
  North Devon) that regular pay­
  ments of £5 a week or less from
  any disaster fund and lump
  sum payments which do not
  take a claimant’s capital over
  £3,000 would not affect income-
  related benefits.

                                           CAPITAL




WHAT IS CAPITAL?


*   Capital includes all savings, for example money held in a bank or building
    society account. Premium Bonds, National Savings Certificates, stocks and
    shares, insurance policies and property.


HOW DOES CAPITAL AFFECT H oosliiQ^-


*   You and your partner can have up to £8,000 capital and still get Ucsos;^
    Berte^iV" •   But you cannot receive benefit if your capital or your combined
    capital is more than £g,000.


*   Normally, all capital is counted.           But some of it may be ignored, for
    example the home you live in and certain other property, life insurance
    policies and personal possessions, such as a car.


*   Children's savings are not included as part of your capital.             Special
    rules apply to their capital and you may still get                            even if
    they have more than £^,000.


*   The first £3,000 capital that you and your partner have, will not affect
    the amount of                       you can receive.       But the amount will be
    reduced by £1 a week for every £250, or part of £250, held between £3,000
    and £ % 0 0 0 .

           Example 2     You have £2,600 and your partner has £1,000, making a

    W H Y DOES CAPITAL AFFECT



    *                         public money provided out of taxation.


        Therefore,     it would be wrong to ignore relatively large amounts of

        capital.     The Government believe that the capital rules strike the right
        balance between encouraging people to save and the proper use of public
        money.


    C A N I GIVE CAPITAL AWAY OR SPEND IT?


    *
        If you give some of your capital away in order to get                               V or to

        increase the amount payable,          the capital you have given away m a y be taken
        into account as if you still had it.



             Example,,,!    You cannot get                  Ee*ve^.llr because you have ftOjOOO in
             the building society.          You give your son £>',000 to bring you below
             the H o u S i i l i m i t         of £ ^ 0 0 0 .   You may not get any




             Example 2     You have £2,800 capital and give your daughter £500.                Your

                                 will not be. affected because your original capital was
             not more than £3,000.



    *   If you spend some of your capital in a reasonable way such as on normal

        day to day living expenses or on essential house r e p ai rs.and your capital

        reduced to £2*000 or less, you may be entitled to Hooslvvj                      or to more
         HcoSmg            if you are already getting it.



             Example 1     You cannot get                           because you have £^,000.

             Essential work is carried out to repair a leaking roof costing you

             £1>200.    As you now have      £ £ ,   800 you may be entitled to HoyS-i-^

                                       INJURY PAYMENTS PLACED IN A TRUST


1.  If a compensation payment is made to a person who was injured and it is
placed on trust for that person's benefit, the money held on trust will be
disregarded:

             in the case of an adult, for 2 years.  This period can be extended in
             certain circumstances; for example if alterations to a person's home
             are necessary and these are taking longer than expected

             in the case of a child or young person, for as long as the person is
             a child or young person and is under 19 years of age.   For example,
             if a payment is placed in trust for an 11 year old, his parents'
             Income Support will not be affected.   (A child is a person under the
             age of 16 and a young person is aged 16 or over but under 19, who is
             in full-time education and is not entitled to claim Income Support).

2. A young person whose trust fund was disregarded while they were dependent
on another adult, will have their trust fund disregarded again, for at least 2
years if they subsequently make a claim in their own right for Income Support,
Housing Benefit, Community Charge Rebates or Family Credit.

3.   SETTING UP A TRUST FUND

Legal advice should be obtained about setting up a trust.  The wording of the
trust deed is a matter for the beneficiary (or representative) and their
advisor, but it would normally allow the trustee to make payments of capital
or income for the benefit of the person concerned.

4.   PAYMENTS FROM THE TRUST

These will be treated as voluntary payments.  The Charitable and Voluntary
Payments Fact Sheet explains how payments to the beneficiary will be treated.

PQ 1718 1988/89:          TONY SPELLER (NORTH DEVON)


1. Although down as an oral PQ I understand that PQ 1718 is listed number 30
and is unlikely to be reached.  S of S has asked for a definitive reply to be
given so that any subsequent PQs can simply be referred to it.   A suggested
reply showing how particular payments would be treated under the
income-related benefit schemes, is attached:  the affect on Social Fund
payments is not included.  It is not possible to be more definite because the
Hillsborough Disaster Fund have not yet started to make payments and there is
an absence of information about payments from earlier disaster funds.
Consequently, the reply may quickly outlive its usefulness when details of the
Hillsborough payments are available.

2. The effect of payments from the Hillsborough Disaster Fund is being
monitored throughout the Merseyside and neighbouring Social Security offices.
The Fund's administrators advise that they have made one payment (£200) so far
to assist a parent with car insurance and road tax to enable him to visit his
daughter in hospital.  Further, payments are expected to be made by the
trustees this month.  In the meantime. Social Services Departments are making
payments on behalf of the Fund to meet immediate hardship.  These payments are
small and unlikely to affect the income-related benefits.

3. PQ 1718 is framed wider than the two recent PQs about Hillsborough (copies
attached) in that it relates to the effect of payments from any disaster fund
on Social Security benefits. The MP appears interested in the current affects
rather than what might have happened to benefits years ago:  nevertheless
enquiries have been made about some past disasters.

4. As to the most recent disasters - Bradford (1985), Zeebrugge (1987),
Kings Cross (1987), Clapham (1988), Lockerbie (1988) and Hillsborough
(15 April 1989), the local offices most likely to be involved report no affect
on any current or past benefit.  Precise information is not available.  Of
course, prior to April 1988 neither Housing Benefit nor Family Income
Supplement had a capital rule and, like most Social Security benefits, would
not have been affected by lump sum payments.

5. Going back further, Penzance local office recall that the Penlee lifeboat
disaster (Dec 1981) may have resulted in the withdrawal of Supplementary
Benefit from two or three widows following the receipt of lump sum payments
from the disaster fund. At that time the rules were less generous than they
are now. The capital limit for Supplementary Benefit in 1980-81 was £2,000
rising to £2,500 from 1982 - now it is £6,000 in Income Support.  In addition,
concessions are available in some instances when the payments from the fund
are placed on trust for the recipients.

As the MP for N Devon, Tony Speller may be aware of the effects of the Penlee
tragedy.

Suggested Reply


Payments from disaster funds do not affect the majority of Social Security
benefits.


The income-related benefits - Income Support, Family Credit and Housing
Benefit - may be affected by payments from disaster funds but this will depend
on the size and nature of the payments.    The first £5 a week of any regular
payment may be disregarded and a lump sum payment will not affect benefit
unless it takes the claimant's capital over £3000.     An income of £1 a week is
assumed for every £250, or part thereof, of capital between £3000 and £6000 in
Income Support and Family Credit, and between £3000 and £8000 in Housing
Benefit.    No Income Support or Family Credit is payable if the capital held is
over £6000, and no Housing Benefit is available if it is over £8000.


However, capital held on trust may be disregarded.     For example, any payment
made from a disaster fund because of a personal injury, which is placed on
trust, is fully disregarded for at least 2 years and, in the case of a child,
for as long as the child is a dependant.    Any actual payments from   the trust
will be taken into account as income or capital in the normal way.     In
addition, any payment made to a third party will be completely disregarded if
it is used to provide goods or services which are not already met by benefit.
Officials continue to liaise with the administrators of the Hillsborough
Disaster Fund and they have advised them of the Social Security rules.


The 1989 Social Security Bill will not result in any Social Security benefit
being recovered from payments made from any disaster    fund.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER FUND : UPDATE


The only change since my minute of 11 May is that the size of the Fund has
increased. The second point in the Background Note should now be as follows

    "At 16 May the Hillsborough Disaster Fund stands at about £4.3m -
    donations are still coming in".

To   Mr                        17 May 1989

Mr Reddington is on holiday until after Whitsun. The Fund stood at £4,338,728
at 10 May (pm). Trustees are to meet Monday 22 May to consider the next of
kin and probably authorise payments to them. These will be initial payments
by cheque which they hope to send out by Whit. Trustees will also be told
about the number of injury claims but probably no decision on these until
claims assessed. Mr           will attend the meeting in place of
Mr Reddington.

Payments likely to be lump sum rather than regular payments but even these
will need to be considered in the light of circumstances.

To   MrJ________ 23 May

Trustees met 22 May and decision made to make immediate cash payments
(cheques) to next of kin of the bereaved plus a handful of the most seriously
injured. They hope to send these out this week. Amounts were not asked about
or stated, nor would this information be given to the media although we agreed
that the Press could readily contact the victims.

However, Mr Winckle did say that, given our explanation of the social security
rules, the payments were unlikely to affect benefit - b^ this I assumed they
would be less than £3000 each.

The Fund stood at £4,949,834 at 22 May pm. [NB If each victim were to
receive £3000 there would need to be approx 1650 of them].

Mr         said that BBC TV had approached them today saying they understood
payments had been made and asking f these would affect .social security
benefits. He had referred them to the individuals and their Social Security
officejand said each person's circumstances were different.

    BRIEFING FOR THE LEADER OF THE HOUSE - THURSDAY XI MAY 1989



    HILLSBOROUGHI TREATMENT OF PAYMENTS FROM DISASTER FUND FOR SOCIAL

                                   SECURITY PURPOSES



    Line to take



    Local Authority Social Services Departments have been authorised to

    act on behalf of the Hillsborough Disaster Fund to make payments to

    meet urgent need.



    As far as I am aware, no Social Security benefits have been

    affected by afty^uasfoent .       Of course, any payment made by, or on

    behalf of, the Fund will be dealt with sensitively and under the

    existing rules.



    Officials from the Department of Social Security have been in touch

    with the Fund's administrators to advise them on the Social

    Security rules.



    My hon Friend the Minister of State for Social Security has made it

    perfectly clear that the Bill which is currently in the other place

    will not result in benefit being recovered from payments made from

    the Hillsborough Disaster Fund.
                           BACKGROUND NOTE

HILLSBOROUGHi EFFECT OF PAYMENTS ON SOClAi SECURITY BENEFITS

* Payments made from the Hillsborough Disaster Fund will have no
retrospective effect on benefit already paid nor will they be
affected by the provisions in the current Social Security Bill,

* At 11 May the Hillsborough Disaster Fund stands at about £4m -
donations are still coming in.

* The Hillsborough Disaster Fund have made one payment so far
[£200] to assist with visiting expenses to hospital. The amount
involvedis unlikely to affect benefit,

* The Trustees for the Fund expect to make further payments before
the end of the month (May) to bereaved relatives and the seriously
injured.

* Social Services currently act as agents for the Fund to make

TREATMENT OF PAYMENTS IN RESPECT OF INJURIES


1. My minute of 17 April and                s reply of 20 April refer. I
attach two newspaper cuttings which are of interest. We wish to know whether
or not payments in respect of grief     in respect of psychiatric injury
caused by trauma are covered by paragraph 12 of Schedule 10 of the Income
Support (General) Regulations 1987.

2. On another point, please could you advise if a payment in consequence of
an injury which is paid directly into a discretionary trust, and not to the
beneficiary, would continue to be disregarded after 2 years. I realise that
after 2 years deprivation rules will apply where the beneficiary places the
money in trust, but if he or his advisors have no control over the payment
being placed in trust, normal rules for treating capital held on trust would
appear to apply.

TREATMENT OF PAYMENTS IN RESPECT OF INJURIES


.1.   I refer to your minute to Mrs   Kerrigan dated    10 May which
 she has asked me to reply to.

2.   Subsequent to my reply to your previous.minute dated
17 April, it transpired during a conversation with Mr Provan that
my advice was based on a false premise, namely, that you were
seeking advice about payments made to i'--------— ^relatives as a
result of legal proceedings.   I advised            of this fact as
soon as it emerged in our conversation         Tina  impression was
given by the first paragraph of your minute wherein you stated,
"that some bereaved relatives are considering legal action", and
then immediately went on in paragraph 2 to refer to payments of
compensation.    Hence, I was not seeking to draw any analogy
between paragraph 12 of Schedule 10, and the Fatal Accidents Act,
as Mrs Wheatley suggests, but dealing directly with the question
which, mistakenly it would appear, I understood to require an
answer, namely, what was the position in respect of payments made
to bereaved relatives, pursuant to court proceedings, which were
subsequently   placed   on trust?    For  this   reason my minute
concentrated on the nature of a payment made under the Fatal
Accidents Act which, as I pointed out, is stated at section 3(1)
of that Act, to be for. "injury       to the dependant" himself or
herself.

3.   In addition, Mrs           states that the cases referred to
by you, and further considered in my previous minute, do not
relate to mental anguish or suffering, but the point was clearly
made in the final sentence of paragraph 3 of my minute, that
payments under the Fatal Accidents Act are not based on mental
suffering, accordingly, it was clear that the cases were not
being considered from that point of view.   They were, as I stated
at paragraph 4 of my minute, still useful however for their
consideration of the meaning of the word "injury" since damages
under the Fatal Accidents Act are such "as are apportioned to the
injury resulting from such death to the dependant....".

4.   It is now clear from my conversation with Mr Provan, and
would have been clear to Mrs                from the reference to
"Appeal Fund Payments" in the heading of Mrs                minute,
that your questions relate not to payments made By a court,
considering the provisions of the Fatal Accidents Act, but to
payments derived from    voluntary donations    to anappeal fund.
Here the force of the arguments relating to payments under      the
Fatal Accidents Act are considerably weakened when applied to
appeal fund payments.   Unlike a court making an award under the
FAA for "injury .... to the dependant" himself, a person who
makes a donation to an appeal fund is probably not doing so "in
consequence of any personal injury" to the bereaved relative.
Accordingly, I am inclined to think, like Mrs             that in
the context of voluntary donations,     it could be said to be
stretching the meaning of the term "personal injury" in a way not
intended by the regulations, to extend it to grief suffered by
bereaved relatives.   For these reasons, the safest course would
be to amend paragraph 12 to ensure that the desired policy was
achieved.

5.   With    regard   to the question of discretionary trusts,     I
confirm   the   view    expressed on  the  telephoAMr 'namely,  that
paragraph 12 does not enter into the question because there is no
capital   to   be   disregarded.   As  far  as the beneficiary    is
concerned, he has no "right" to anything, but only a hope.     It is
only on exercise of the discretion that there is any capital to
be considered.

HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL DISASTER:       COMPENSATION PAYMENTS



1.    Thank you for your minute dated 17 April addressed to

Mrs Kerrigan to which she has asked me to reply.



2.    The question raised in your minute is, if damages are paid

to those bereaved by the Hillsborough football disaster, to

compensate them for the mental suffering experienced as a

result of the loss of the relatives, can such payments be

treated as having been derived "in consequence of any personal

injury" to them (para 12, Schedulewof the Income Support

(General) Regs 1987)?



3.    You cite in your minute CSB/802/1987 which quotes

Lord Simon of Glaisdale in R.v.Nat.Ins.Comr; Exp,.Hudson 1972

A.C. 944 wherein he states that 'injury' extends to a hurt to




                                  1
' . o .




          the mind as well as to the body.    The first point which needs   1

          to be made in answer to your question is that mental distress

          is not by itself sufficient damage to ground an action in

          tort.   The general principle embedded in the common law is that

          mental suffering caused by grief, fear, anguish and the like is

          not assessable.   However, once liability ahs been established,

          then in certain torts injury to feelings may be included in the

          damages.   In the circumstances surrounding the Hillsborough

          disaster, what seems to me to be most likely is that bereaved

          relatives will seek to pursue action under the Fatal Accidents

          Act 1976 which, by section 1(1), as substituted by section 3(1)

          of the Administration of Justice Act 1982 provides that.    "If

          death is caused by any wrongful act, neglect or default which

          is such as would (if death had not ensued) have entitled the

          person injured to maintain an action and recover damages in

          respect thereof, the person who would have been liable if death

          had not ensued shall be liable to an action for damages,

          notwithstanding the death of the person".   Section 1(2) of the

          Act, again as substituted by section 3(1) of the Administration

          of Justice Act 1982, enacts that every such action shall be for

          the benefit of the dependants, as defined, of the person whose

          death has been so caused.   Apart from a limited right to

          recover for bereavement, a sum specified by the

          Lord Chancellor, the damages which may be recovered are for the

          loss of the pecuniary benefit arising from the relationship

          which would be derived from the continuance of the life, ie the

          amount of pecuniary benefit that the dependant could reasonably




                                          2
'.^r.




        expect to have received from the deceased in the future.      For

        the purposes of this minute, I do not think that it would

        assist to go further and set out how the value of the

        dependency is calculated.   Suffice it to say however, that you

        will see from the above that, assuming action is pursued under

        the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 any payments/compensation made to

        bereaved relatives will not be based on mental suffering.



        4.   Having said all the above, the cases to which you refer

        are nevertheless still useful for their consideration of the

        meaning of the word 'injury1.   You will have observed from

        considering CSB/802/1987 that, in the absence of a statutory

        definition, and unless the context suggests otherwise, words or

        terms are given their ordinary meaning.   However, you will also

        have noted that the tendency has been to give the word 'injury'

        a wider meaning than that most commonly attributed to it.     That

        being so, to answer the question posed at paragraph 4 of your

        minute, it seems to me that provided action by the bereaved

        relatives is under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 then it appears

        to be within the spirit of para 12 of Schedule 10 to the Income

        Support (General) Regulations 1987 to take the view that

        payments to bereaved relatives, which are held on trust, are

        derived from a payment made in consequence of a personal

        injury.   The action giving rise to the payment is for injury

        caused to the dependant himself by the death.   Indeed section

        3(1) of the Fatal Accidents Act 1976, again, as substituted by




                                        3
   section 3(1) of the A. J. Act 1982, lays down the measure of

   damages as "....such damages, .... may be awarded as are

   proportioned to the injury resulting from such death to the

   dependants respectively" (my underlining).       Put another way,

   since Commissioner Penny quoting from the Shorter Oxford

   Dictionary says that 'injury' includes "....loss .... sustained

   by a person ....", one could say that the payment is to

   compensate the dependant for the loss of the pecuniary benefit

   arising from the relationship which would be derived from the

   continuance of the life.

2. I don’t see the change in the rules that you propose in your Option 3 as
being the sort of structural change that would breach our undertaking to local
authorities not to alter the Community Charge Benefit arrangements between
June 1989 and October 1990. The main purpose behind the undertaking was to
allow the authorities to develop their software without having to incorporate
last minute reprogrammings, I don't see extending the period of disregard for
compensation payments as having software consequences; presumably the way that
it will work will be that local authority staff, having satisfied themselves
that the compensation payments fall within the necessary criteria and
time-bands, will not feed them into the benefit calculations.

3. Do you agree this view? If so, the change would not have to wait until
1990 to be implemented, but I think we would need to consult the authorities
informally to check that they agree too. However if the eventual decision is
that it does represent a structural change, implementation would need to be
delay until October 1990 rather than Summer 1990 in order to comply with the
spirit of the undertaking.

LETTER FROM NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CITIZENS ADVICE BUREAUX: PAYMENTS FROM
HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER FUND



1.   As requested/ I attach a draft reply.

2.  There has only been one £200 payment from the fund which did not affect
benefit entitlement.  The f u n d ’s administrators hope to make initial payments
to bereaved relatives by 26 May.

Mr Peter Hildrew
Assistant Director
National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux
115-123 Pentonville Road
London N1 9LZ




Thank you for your letter of 12 May about the treatment of payments made from
the Hillsborough Disaster Fund to people receiving an income-related benefit.


It is still too early to say whether payments from the Fund will have an
affect on the income-related benefits - Income Support, Housing Benefit and
Family Credit.   Much will depend on the size of the payments and how these are
paid.   So far, payments have mainly been made by Social Services Departments
to meet immediate hardship and, being relatively small amounts, are most
unlikely to have had any impact on benefit.   However, I understand that the
trustees hope to make further payments before the end of this month.   At the
moment, it seems likely that these will be lump-sum payments rather than
regular periodic payments.   In which ca%se, as you point out, benefit will only
be affected if a payment takes a person's capital above £3000: Income Support and
Family Credit     not payable if capital exceeds £6000, or £8000 for Housing
Benefit.


But there are other concessions available within the benefit schemes which
will enable the trustees to help people without affecting their benefits.      For
example, compensation payments made in respect of a.personal injury which are
placed on trust are disregarded for at least 2 years or, in the case of
children, for as long as they remain dependent on an adult.   Equally, money
held on a purely discretionary trust for the benefit of one or more
beneficiaries can be wholly disregarded.   However, the actual payments made
from any trust will be treated in the normal way, with the first £5 a week of
any regular payments being ignored and any lump sum payments treated as
capital.   In addition, payments to a third party, such as a shop or supplier,
will be disregarded unless they are used for items already met by benefit.
This rule is already proving helpful to the fund's trustees in connection with
the payment of funeral expenses.


In your letter, you invited me to consider introducing a complete disregard
for all of the payments made by the Hillsborough Disaster Fund or,
alternatively, a disregard for a limited period.        I do understand and
sympathise with your motives but there are, unfortunately, a number of very
good reasons why I am unable to accept either suggestion.        First of all, the
disregard would only help the relatively few who were so tragically bereaved
or injured at Hillsborough.        It could not help those people who suffered in
previous disasters or who are injured in, for example, a traffic accident and
are awarded compensation by the courts.        To the many elderly and disabled
people it might also seem unfair to disregard capital held by some people when
their savings are taken into account in the normal way.        Regulating for all
the deserving cases would be extremely difficult and, inevitably there would
be anomalies.        I am sure it would not generally be right to pay taxpayers*
money to people with very large sum of capital readily available to them.


Nevertheless, I do think that the existing rules present an acceptable way
forward.       The current disregard of certain capital held in trust, which I
referred to above, does seem to offer the sort of longer-term concession that
you are seeking, while still enabling the trustees to make lump sum payments
from time to time without affecting benefit.        We have, of course, already
brought this and the other rules to the^ notice of the fund's administrators.

      C-   "
You            ask whether the guidance to local adjudication officers about the
deprivation of capital might be sympathetically revised. I have consulted the
Chief Adjudication Officer about this matter and he will consider whether any
further advice might usefully be issued.        In the meantime, I can assure you
that all claims for benefit will be handled with the utmost sensitivity.           We
                                                                                       d.
will also be monitoring the effects of any payments to people on benefit.           Aijy
my officials have made it known to the Fund's administrators that they are on
hand to give any further^/ advice about the social security benefits that they
may require.


I am grateful to you for your suggestions even though I do not feel able to
take all of them on board.        In return, I hope that this reply explains how the
existing rules can work to the claimant's best advantage.        I shall, of course,
continue to take a very close interest in the Hillsborough tragedy and I will
find it very helpful if you can let me know about any difficulties that cannot
be resolved locally.

Thank you for your letter of 10 May and for setting oat the steps taken
in regard to providing benefit advice for those affected by the
Hillsborough disaster. I have passed this on to our Merseyside office so
that they will be in a position to take up any further local queries in
the manner you suggest.
                                                                               s
Ve are in touch with welfare benefits advisers frons the various local
authorities involved in sco-ordinated response to the disaster. In      the
light of your letter of 2? April to Tony Banks HP, the advisers have been
considering the likely position of people in receipt of means-tested
benefits - especially Ineons Support and Housing Benefit - should they
receive payments from the disaster fund. Assuming that the current
framework of regulations is applied, it would appear that any regular
weekly payaent fiocr. the fund over £5 per veek would hsve the effect of
reducing entitlement to benefit on a pound-for-pound basis. If any
capital payments are sade frois the fund,    benefit would be affected once
Capital reached £3,000 and would cease altogether if capital reached
tCjOOOdncorae support) or £8,000(hei;sing benefit).

One course of action to alleviate this position would be to introduce a
regulation enabling payments from the Hillsborough Disaster Fund to bt
disregarded. A acre aodest proposal vhlch might eonaaend itself to you
would be to introduce a delay in the appllest ion of the normal rules on
capital for sn appropriate period, say two years; this coyld be designed
to apply to the Hillsborough Fund arid to any other such fund as the
Secretary of State may on occasion consider appropriate.   The motivation
                                                        w      <ak-w^u             using e i s t r e s s               t o V ic t i m s               and
their relatives by having to stop their social security because of
payments they may receive from the Trust Fund; and partly to avoid the
diversion of capital payments from the fund{intended for special needs)to
day-to-day living expenses in order to avoid the cut-off.

         Advice Bureaux (NACAB).

         2. I received a telephone enquiry from NACAB on 28 April. My advice was that
         as people had not received any money from the Fund yet, if they were short of
         money they should claim benefit.

         3. Please could you advise if any action has been taken and if you require an
         input from D1C.

Dear Mr Brant

Many thanks for the prompt despatch to me of Nicholas Scott’s letter to

Tony Banks about the Hillsborough Fund.  This does clarify the position,
and I have no doubt that the Fund will be looking carefully at how money
is paid to people receiving income-related benefits.

However, our Merseyside area office continues to report concern about local
arrangements for handling benefit enquiries for those affected by the
Hillsborough tragedy.  Two suggestion.? they have asked me to put forward
are (a) that a freephone line to a senior DSS official be made available
to those affected for a limited period, in order that they can obtain a
reliable view of their position; (b) that local benefit offices make some
arrangements whereby those affected can by-pass the normal waiting room
queues and obtain speedy attention.

I would appreciate your considering whether either of these are feasible
as a matter of urgency, since the help is really needed now.

Yours sincerely

NACAB LETTER TO PS/MOS ABOUT HILLSBOROUGH

1. I attach a draft reply. N.W. Region have been consulted and have reviewed
their arrangments for dealing with "Hillsborough" claims. They are broadly
satisfied that satisfactory and practical measures have been taken and do not
think the two suggested additional measures are feasible:

  - the special Freeline number could do nothing more than the normal,
well-known, Social Security Freeline service already does;

  - automatic queue jumping for these callers is feasible, (e.g. by having
signs put up to divert them, but is cumbersome, and this late in the day
probably unwarranted), but making an appointment in advance is the better and
preferred way.

Dear


Thank you for your letter of 2 May concerning the local arrangements made for
handling benefit enquiries arising out of the Hillsborough tragedy. I was, of
course, concerned to hear that your Merseyside area office considers that not
enough is being done to ensure the prompt handling of enquiries and claims.
Having looked into this, I feel they may not be fully aware of the measures
introduced at regional and local level. I hope by setting out the action taken
by the Department I shall reassure you and your Merseyside colleagues.

The Department's initial response was to liaise with the hospital authorities
and Social Service Department in Sheffield to determine how best to help.
Similar liaison took place with Liverpool City Social Services, and later in the
week with Michael Reddington, the Disaster Fund manager. We were asked to
provide a short-notice visiting service at the hospital for taking claims and
offering advice, and did so, although this was never actually called on.
Sheffield Social Services Department had already decided to deal with all
requests for transport and accommodation from relatives and friends visiting
Sheffield.

A dedicated telephone line was set aside at the North West regional office to
handle enquiries and the number published in the Liverpool Daily Post. This
leads on to the first of your suggestions that the Department should set up a
special Freeline number to handle enquiries from those affected. This has been
tried in the past in similar circumstances but to little effect. The existing
Freeline Social Security number is widely known and the service was alerted to
the situation from the outset. Steps were taken to ensure that additional
Freeline staff would be available if call levels rose and it has been able to
cope with all demands.

Your second suggestion concerns the arrangements at local offices. All local
office managers in the North Western region were asked to ensure that staff were
aware of the need to deal promptly and sensitively with claims and enquiries
relating to the disaster. You will appreciate I'm sure the extent of staff
sympathies when in many offices members of staff, as well as their friends and
relatives, were themselves injured or in hospital. In addition local office
management were encouraged to make any special arrangements they thought
necessary. I know that in some offices this meant nominating a particular
officer to handle all work arising from the disaster, whilst in others it was a
general staff alert to the possibility of enquiries. The absolute priority
suggested for callers affected by the tragedy would be very difficult to
achieve. It will, of course, be accorded those who arrange to visit the local
office by appointment, but this would not work for unheralded callers. You an
be sure however that once callers are identified as people affected by the A-
tragedy a private interview will be arranged immediately.

I am pleased for the opportunity to go into some detail about what has been done
at local and regional level in response to this terrible tragedy. I am sure
that the service provided to those affected has, at all times, been prompt,
sympathetic and sensitive. If your Merseyside office is still concerned about
any aspect of local arrangements the regional liaison officer, Keith Price, is
ready to help. He can be contacted at our North Western Regional office on
Merseyside and on 051-922-4010, extension 2245.

HILLSBOROUGH:    EFFECT OF PAYMENTS OF SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS

[ADDITIONAL FACTS]

    *      At 3 May the Hillsborough Disaster Fund stood at £3,188,000 -
            donations are still coming in (the media have said that £4m has been
            promised).

    *      Social Services currently act as agents for the Fund to make urgent
            payments to relieve need for such as funeral catering bills, visits
            to hospital and overnight accommodation.

    *      The Fund’s administrators hope to begin making payments within the
            next 2 weeks to the bereaved relatives and the seriously injured.
            They do not know how much will be paid nor are they likely to provide
            this information.

    *      The majority of Social Security benefits are not income-related -
            they will not be affected by payments from the Fund.

HILLSBOROUGH: EFFECT OF PAYMENTS ON SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS

1. Payments made from the Hillsborough Disaster Fund will have no
retrospective effect on benefit already paid nor will they be affected by the
provisions in the current Social Security Bill.

2. At 3 May the Hillsborough Disaster Find stood at £3,188,000 - donations
are still coming in (the media have said that £4m has been promised).

3. Social Services currently act as agents for the Fund to make urgent
payments to relieve need for such as funeral catering bills, visits to
hospital and overnight accommodation.

4. The Fund’s administrators hope to begin making payments within the next
two weeks to the bereaved relatives and the seriously injured. They do not
know how much will be paid nor are they likely to provide this information.

5. Such payments may, however, affect on-going payment of benefit. The
effect on Income Support depends on the nature of the payment received:

          the first £5 a week of any regular voluntary payment is normally
          disregarded;

         any lump sum payment will be treated as capital - the first £3,000 of
         any capital is ignored completely and an income of £1 a week is
         assumed for every £250, or part thereof, of any capital between
         £3,000 and £6,000. Any interest earned by the capital is ignored.
         No IS is payable if a person has more than £6,000 (for HB the limit
         is £8,000);

         if capital sum is placed on trust for an injured person, this can be
         ignored completely for at least two years and, in the case of a
         child, for as long as he/she is a dependant;

         the fund has guaranteed payment of funeral costs of those involved.
         If the funeral account is sent direct to Liverpool Social Services
         Dept they will send it on to the Disaster Fund and payment will be
         made direct to the undertaker without benefit being affected;

         payments made by Liverpool Social Services to alleviate immediate
         hardship (eg for clothing to attend funerals) were made direct to
         individuals to purchase essential items and the amounts involved were
         not high enough to affect benefit entitlement.

6. If and when liability is established any compensation payments (as
distinct from the charitable payments made from the disaster fund) made after
the start of the new social security recoupment rules in the late summer of
1990 will be subject recoupment. It will apply only to benefits and
compensation paid to those survivors who were injured. Payments to relatives
of those who died will be excluded from the new rules. Any such payments made
before the new rules come into operation will remain subject to the current
offsetting rules.
7. The majority of Social Security benefits are not income-related - they
will not be affected by payments from the Fund.

STATUS

8. Following advice from the Charity Commissioners, the Hillsborough Disaster
Appeal Fund have decided not to register as a charity: this approach is
similar to that adopted by the Bradford Appeal Fund. As a discretionary
trust, it will be able to help a wider range of people, not just those
suffering financial hardship. The decision not to register as a charity has
no adverse effect on the treatment of the payments in the Income-related
benefits.

PREVIOUS DISASTERS

9. There are no special rules in Income Support for the treatment of payments
from disaster funds. Nor have any enquiries been received about the treatment
of payments from earlier disaster funds. It is presumed, therefore that the
rules existing at that time were both satisfactory and adequate.

The majority of social security benefits will not be affected by payments from

is not possible to say whether any of the income-related benefits will be

HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL DISASTER - APPEAL FUND PAYMENTS



1. I refer to your minute to Mr ______ |of 26 April 1989,              He has
asked me to reply.

2. It seems to me that the victims of the disaster can be
categorised into 3 groups:

      (a) Those football supporters who actually suffered
      physical injury at the Hillsborough ground.  Any payments
      made to this group via a trust fund clearly fall to be
      disregarded under the provisions of paragraph 12 of Schedule
      10 to the IS (General) Regulations.

      (b) Those supporters who were also actually at the
      Hillsborough ground, and as a result suffered mental
      injury.  Payments made through a trust to this group do not
      fall so clearly within the provisions of paragraph 12 but it
      seems to me possible to argue that such injury is a
      "personal injury" for the purposes of paragraph 12 of
      Schedule 10? support for this view can be found in Lord
      Simon of Glaisdale's judgment in Ex parte Hudson [1972] AC
      where he states that ""Injury" is hurt to body or mind".

      (c) Those bereaved relatives who were not at the football
      ground and therefore sustained no direct injury, whether
      physical or mental, through their presence there, As
      Mrs inkester states this concept is a matter of tort,    in my
      opinion the mental suffering of the bereaved relatives
      cannot be brought within the concept of personal injury for
      the purposes of paragraph 12, Schedule 10 to the IS
      (General) Regulations.  I do not think that, for the
      purposes of paragraph 12, one can make an analogy with the
      Fatal Accidents Act; that statute concerns itself with the
      pecuniary loss (injury) suffered by a victim's dependants.
      The term "personal injury" is not defined but I do not think
      that the cases which have been considered so far can be used
      to support the argument that in the present case the
      bereaved relatives have themselves suffered a personal
      injury? the cases considered by Mrs Inkester all related to
      a direct injury to the claimant and not mental anguish and
      shock suffered by a relative which, as I have said, is a
      concept in tort, but in this case is, to my mind,too remote
      to bring the bereaved relatives within paragraph 12.   I
      realise this divergence of opinion may cause problems.

             Hillsborough Football DisastertAppeal Fuad Payments
             1, We would appreciate your views on how we see the treatment of
             payments made from this fund as our approach differs from that
             proposed by DlC.

             2. Paragraph 12 of Schedule 10 of the XS(Gen)Regs provides that a
             disregard shall apply

                    "(1)Where the funds of a trust are derived from a payment
                    made in consequence of any personal injury to the claimant
                    the-value of the trust fund and the value of the right to
                    receive any payment under that trust#for a period of two
                    years or such longer period as is reasonable in the
                    circumstances............. "

             3, Where a payment is made to a person who suffered actual
             physical injury at Hillsborough we agree that the disregard
             provided for in schedule 10 para 12 will apply. We also agree
             that the same disregard will apply to payments made to persons
             who were actually at the match and who because of either what
             they saw or what happened to them they are affected
             mentally. However, we are of the opinion that if payment is made
             for example to a.wife or mother because of the death or injury of
             a partner or close relative,this cannot be said to be a payment
             made in consequence of a personal injury to the claimant and
             therefore the disregard will not apply.

             4. W© have attached the correspondence between DIG and Sol A2 on
             this subject in the hope that this might be of assistance to
             you.In view of the immediacy of this problem we would be very
             grateful for an early response to this submission, We thank you
             as always for your assistance.

3,  I think it must also be remembered*in the context of the
Hillsborough disaster *feert? the payments made to the victims will
probably be under two headss

     (a) paid under trust from a charity.   In this case it seems
     to me that providing the claimants fall within paragraph
     2(a) or Cb) above the payments are to be disregarded.

     {b) paid by the responsible authority in the normal way,
     not under trust, these of course will not fall to be
     disregarded.

4.   I hope this advice covers the questions raised.

Dear Mr Reddington

Following our recent telephone conversations, I am enclosing some
information sheets which explain the social security rules for
payments from the Fund.

     1.   Charitable and voluntary payment

     2.   Capital

     3.      Payments to injured people

     4.      The Social Fund.

If there is any further information we can provide, please do not
hesitate to contact me.

Yours sincerely
ID1428n/SP




                 INCOME SUPPORT/HOUSING BENEFIT/FAM ILY CREDIT


                      CHARITABLE AND VOLUNTARY PAYMENTS




1.   Regular Payments

Up to £5 a week (per family) of income which is paid or is due to be paid
regularly can be disregarded, provided that the £5 disregard has not
already been allowed on another income (eg on a war pension). Any excess
over £5 a week is taken fully into account as income.

*    Regular payments includepayments paid   or due to be paid at recurring
      intervals such as monthly, annually (eg every Christmas) and whenever
      a pattern can be established.

*    A payment is "due to bepaid"    when there is anagreement   to make a
      payment.


2.   Irregular Payments

These are "one-off" payments which are not made or due to be made
regularly. They are treated as capital and will not affect a claimant's
benefit unless the claimant already has capital of more than £3000 or the
payment increases any existing capital to over £3000.

An income of £1 a week will be assumed in Income Support and Family Credit
for every £250, or part of £250, held between £3000 and £6000: the same
amount will be assumed in Housing Benefit for capital between £3000 and
£6000. No Income Support or Family Credit is payable if the claimant has
over £6000, and no Housing Benefit is payable if the capital has over £8000.


3.   Third Party Payments

Payments made to a third party (such as a shop or supplier) for the
claimant or his family are disregarded provided that the payments are not
used for:

      food, ordinary clothing or footwear (see below), household fuel, or
      accommodation costs already covered by Income Support or Housing
      Benefit or, in Family Credit, any housing costs.

*    Payments made to a third party for any of the above items will:

             be treated as income under paragraph 1 above, if they are
             regular payments;

             be treated as capital under paragraph 2 above, if they are
             irregular payments.

*    Payments may be sent direct to the third party, or made by cheque
      payable to the third party and sent to the claimant.

*    "ordinary clothing or footwear" means clothing or footwear which is
      suitable for normal daily use. It does not include such items as
      school uniforms, or clothing or footwear used solely for sporting
      activities.
Example 1   A cheque to purchase a new bed is sent by a charity to the
supplier.   This payment will be disregarded.

Example 2 The claimant receives a cheque made payable to the gas board as
a one-off payment to cover a fuel debt. This payment will be treated as
capital.

Example 3 A claimant's television rental is paid by her daughter who sends
regular cheques to the rental company. These payments are disregarded.

Example 4 A claimant sends his electricity bills to a charity which pays
them for him. These payments are taken into account as income - the first
£5 a week is normally disregarded under paragraph 1 above.


4.   Payments in kind

All payments in kind from charities, such as gifts of groceries,
bedclothes or monthly bus passes, are disregarded.

Payments in kind which are not made by a charity (eg those made by a
relative) are treated as follows:

            regular payments in kind are disregarded;

            irregular payments in kind are treated as capital under
            paragraph 2 above.

*    Meal vouchers and gift vouchers are not treated as payments in kind,
      but as cash. They will be treated as either income or capital under
      paragraphs 1 and 2 above depending on whether the payments are made
      regularly or irregularly.


5.    Payments For Accommodation Costs Not Met By Benefit

Payments which are intended and used to meet accommodation costs that are
above the limit covered by Income Support or Housing Benefit are
disregarded in Income Support.

In Housing Benefit and Family Credit, these payments are treated as income
or capital under paragraph 1 or 2 above depending on whether the payments
are made regularly or irregularly.

Example 1 A claimant's nursing home fees are higher than the amount
allowed under Income Support. Payments to cover the shortfall are
disregarded.

Example 2 A claimant's rent is higher than the amount allowed in Housing
Benefit. Regular payments to cover the shortfall are disregarded under
Income Support but are taken into account as income in the assessment of
Housing Benefit and Family Credit - the first £5 a week is normally
disregarded under paragraph 1 above.

                                   INCOME SUPPORT




                                      CAPITAL




WHAT IS CAPITAL?


*   Capital includes all savings, for example money held in a bank or building
    society account, Premium Bonds, National Savings Certificates, stocks and
    shares, insurance policies and property.


HOW DOES CAPITAL AFFECT INCOME SUPPORT?


*   You and your partner can have up to £6,000 capital and still get Income
    Support.   But you cannot receive benefit if your capital or your combined
    capital is more than £6,000.


*   Normally, all capital is counted.     But some of it may be ignored, for
    example the home you live in and certain other property, life insurance
    policies and personal possessions, such as a car.


*   Children's savings are not included as part of your capital.       Special
    rules apply to their capital and you may still get Income Support even if
    they have more than £6,000.


*   The first £3,000 capital that you and your partner have, will not affect
    the amount of Income Support you can receive.        But the amount will be
    reduced by £1 a week for every £250, or part of £250, held between £3,000
    and £6,000.


         Example 1   You have exactly £3,000.       Your Income Support will not be
         affected.


         Example 2   You have £2,600 and your partner has £1,000, making a
         total of £3,600.   Your Income Support will be reduced by £3 a week.


         Example 3   You and your partner have £6,000 between you.      Your Income
         Support will be reduced by £12 a week.
WHY DOES CAPITAL AFFECT INCOME SUPPORT?


*   Income Support is public money provided out of taxation.     It is intended
    to bring any resources you and your family have up to a certain level.
    Therefore, it would be wrong to ignore relatively large amounts of
    capital.   The Government believe that the capital rules strike the right
    balance between encouraging people to save and the proper use of public
    money.


CAN I GIVE CAPITAL AWAY OR SPEND IT?


*   If you give some of your capital away in order to get Income Support or to
    increase the amount payable, the capital you have given away may be taken
    into account as if you still had it.


         Example 1     You cannot get Income Support because you have £9,000 in
         the building society.     You give your son £4,000 to bring you below
         the Income Support limit of £6,000.     You may not get any Income
         Support.


         Example 2     You have £2,800 capital and give your daughter £500.     Your
         Income Support will not be affected because your original capital was
         not more than £3,000.


*   If you spend some of your capital in a reasonable way such as on normal
    day to day living expenses or on essential house repairs and your capital
    reduced to £6000 or less, you may be entitled to Income Support or to more
    Income Support if you are already getting it.


         Example 1     You cannot get Income Support because you have £7,000.
         Essential work is carried out to repair a leaking roof costing you
         £1400.     As you now have £5,800 you may be entitled to Income Support.


         Example 2    You have £5100 and are getting Income Support.   You spend
         £100 to redecorate your living room and another £400 to replace a
         worn-out carpet.     As you now have £4,600 you may be entitled to more
         Income Support.

                            INJURY PAYMENTS PLACED IN A TRUST


    1. If a compensation payment is made to a person who was injured and it is
    placed on trust for that person's benefit, the money held on trust will be
    disregarded:

             in the case of an adult, for 2 years. This period can be extended in
             certain circumstances; for example if alterations to a person's home
             are necessary and these are taking longer than expected

             in the case of a child or young person, for as long as the person is
             a child or young person and is under 19 years of age. For example,
             if a payment is placed in trust for an 11 year old, his parents'
             Income Support will not be affected.   (A child is a person under the
             age of 16 and a young person is aged 16 or over but under 19, who is
             in full-time education and is not entitled to claim Income Support).

    2. A young person whose trust fund was disregarded while they were dependent
    on another adult, will have their trust fund disregarded again, for at least 2
    years if they subsequently make a claim in their own right for Income Support,
    Housing Benefit, Community Charge Rebates or Family Credit.

    3.   SETTING UP A TRUST FUND

    Legal advice should be obtained about setting up a trust. The wording of the
    trust deed is a matter for the beneficiary (or representative) and their
    advisor, but it would normally allow the trustee to make payments of capital
    or income for the benefit of the person concerned.

    4.   PAYMENTS FROM THE TRUST

    These will be treated as voluntary payments. The Charitable and Voluntary
    Payments Fact Sheet explains how payments to the beneficiary will be treated.

  partner, and who is receiving Income Support, Family Credit, Housing Benefit,

  Any money which is readily available to assist with the cost of the funeral eg
  money donated by a charity, is taken into account when deciding the amount to

   Available to people receiving Income Support or likely to be in receipt within
   six weeks of leaving institutional or residential care.

   for which  an application is made is taken fully intoaccount when deciding the
   amount to be paid from the Social Fund.

   Budgeting Loans

   Available  to people receiving Income Support to help them cope with
   intermittent expenses for which they have been unable to budget.

   Any money which the applicant or their partner have which is in excess of £500
   is taken fully into account when deciding the amount to be paid from the
   Social Fund. Budgeting loans are repayable.

   Crisis Loans

   Available to anyone aged 16 or over, whether on Income Support or not, in an
   emergency and payment is the only means of avoiding serious damage or risk to
   the health or safety of the applicant or a member of his family.

   Any money available to the applicant or his family is normally taken fully
   into account when deciding the amount to be paid from the Social Fund. Crisis
   loans are repayable.

          Xr Scott gave some reassurance in the Consume

          last      night         during       the   last       stages    of    the

          Social       S e c u ri ty       Bill.          But    later,        some

          Government sources were being quoted as saying

          that it wasn't necessarily true that benefit

          payments wouldn't be affected if payments came

          from the fund.



          So    I   asked        Hr    Scott     this     morning      first     to

          remind me what he had told the Commons                               last

          night.



          NICHOLAS SCOTT t Social Security Ministers

          Technically I was being asked a question about

          a    clause       in    the      Social     Security      Bill       that

          provides for benefits which have already been

          paid to be clawed back from any compensation

          that an insurance company or an employer,                              or

          anybody       liable,            eventually           pays      to    the

          individual.



          And Z was asked whether that provision would

          apply to payments from the Hillsborough appeal

           fund/ or the Hillsborough Disaster fund, and I

           was able to give an absolute, unequivocal 'yes'

           to that.



           In       terms   of     future    benefits    that      are    being

           paid, exactly the same rules will apply to the

           Hillsborough          fund,   as applied at Kings Cross

           and applied at Bradford, when they seemed to

           work very, very smoothly.               As far as I know we

           had not a single complaint.


           PRESENTER t

           And what would be the effeot of those rules?



           NICHOLAS BCQTTx

           Well         it would    depend    on the advice             that   is
           given by the trustees of the fund to those to

           whoa         they give their money.          For example,           if

           somebody suffered a personal injury and they're

           being given a payment because of that, then I'm

           sure the right thing would be to put that money

           into a trust and then any payments made would

           be disregarded for a period of some two years.

           If payment* were made not to the individual but

           to   third parties,         either    for help that they

           might need in terms of cars or wheelchair* or

           funeral payments; all that sort of thing, all

           of that would be disregarded.



           What, we     found    is that as         long as the         legal

           niceties      are    tackled,      then    the       interaction

           between these payments and the benefit system,

           can be tackled in such a way that really the

           needs   of    the    individuals      are met        in a very

           satisfactory manner.

           After   your        brief    remarks      in     the     Commons

           yesterday, there was some confusion ae a result

           of   something       government      officials        appear     to

           have said outside the chamber * namely that in

           the future people w h o .had benefited from big

           payments     from the       fund might well           find that

           their whole future regarding benefits changed

           for the worse.        Mow can you clear up that?



           BICffiMS SCOT*
           If   that    payment        was   made    directly         to   an

            individual and it became part of their capital

            then tha capital rules for income support and

            housing benefit and so on, the income ralatad

            benefits,      of course it doesn't affect all the

            other        benefits,        t he     vast     majority        of

            contributory        flat    rate benefits which            people

            have, those would be totally unaffected.



            The income related benefits would be affected

            if that were simply added to their capital.



            As I say there are legal ways in which that can

            be       avoided   and    recipients    will     obviously      be

            guided by the trustees of the fund in the best

            way      that they can organise          their affairs to

            avoid that.

LIAISON WITH OTHER GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS


Home Office


DSS officials have liaised with officials at the Home Office.       They have been
informed that the Charity Commissioners are advising the Hillsborough Disaster
Appeal Fund.     The Home Office has not been approached for further advice.


Charity Commissioners


Following advice from the Commissioners, the Hillsborough Disaster Appeal Fund
will not become a registered charity at this stage:     this was the approach
adopted by the Bradford Appeal Fund.     Because the fund is not a registered
charity, it will be able to help a wider range of people, not just those
suffering financial hardship.


The Inland Revenue


They have no special rules for disaster appeal funds.     A fund which is not a
registered charity will be treated as a discretionary trust.       There is
insufficient information available to say if individual beneficiaries will be
liable for tax.     Officials will look into the matter further.


Law Officers' Department


The Attourney General has issued guidelines for organisers of disaster
appeals.     These advise on the decisions organisers must make when launching an
appeal, such as who the beneficiaries will be, and how to prepare an appeal
statement.

        BACKGROUND

        FUNERAL COSTS

        Liverpool Social Services undertook to underwrite the funeral costs of those
        involved in the Hillsborough Disaster. The Disaster Fund has since guaranteed
        payment of these costs. Families who were bereaved are asked by the funeral
        directors whether they wish to participate in this scheme. If so, the funeral
        account is sent direct to Social Services Department who in turn forward to
        the Disaster Fund. Payment will then be made direct to the undertaker.

        CLOTHING AND FOOD

        Payments were also made by Social Services to alleviate immediate hardship.
        These, in the main took the form of the cost of clothing for families to
        attend funerals and paying for catering costs for after funeral. Payments are
        made direct to individuals who then purchase the required items.
PREVIOUS DISASTERS

There are no special rules in Income Support for the treatment of payments
from disaster funds. Nor have any enquiries been received about the treatment
of payments from earlier disaster funds. Special arrangements have been made
to deal with any claims and enquiries resulting from the Hillsborough disaster.

Some disaster funds do not become registered charities, because it would
narrow the range of assistance they could give. The Hillsborough Disaster
Fund has decided not to register.

Any payments from the fund will therefore be treated as voluntary payments
which are subject to various disregards in Income Support.
HOW WILL PAYMENTS FOR FUNERAL COSTS BE TREATED?

I understand that the Appeal Fund will be sending payments for funeral
expenses direct to the funeral directors.  Therefore, they will be disregarded
for benefit purposes.

Payments for other expenses were sent direct to the families and were treated
as capital until they were spent.  The amounts involved w ere not high enough
to affect benefit entitlement.

          1.  This PQ seeks clarification on the effect of payments from the
          Hillsborough Disaster Fund following answers given by the Prime Minister and
          MOS - I enclose copies of relevant extracts from Hansard.

          2.  At this stage it is not possible to say if the income-related benefits
          will be affected, but we are continuing to monitor the situation.

          3.  A suggested reply is attached for MOS.  Minister may wish to omit the
          words in square brackets from the reply until he has had the opportunity to
          consider the submission made on 26 April about the possibility of introducing
          a small concession.  However, MOS has already indicated on the radio 4
          programme "World at One" that "exactly the same rules will apply" as for
          previous disasters (a copy of the transcript is attached).

No payments have yet been made by the Hillsborough Disaster Fund and therefore

it is not possible to say whether they will affect the income-related

benefits.    Officials have been in touch wi th the Fund's administrators to

advise them on the social security rules.     [Any payment will be dealt with

sensitively under the existing provisions.]     The vast majority of social

security benefits are not income-related and will be totally unaffected by any
payment from the Fund.

last              night                 during      the    last           stages            of             the

that             it wasn't                  necessarily          true          that         benefit

payment* wouldn't be affected if payments came

fro>» the fund.



So         I        asked              Mr   Scott       thif      morning              first                     to

remind                me          what      he had      told       the         Commons               last

night.



NICHOLAS SCOTT fSoclal Security Minister)t

Technically I was being asked a <jue«tion about

a       clause                    in     the   Social       Security                 Bill           that

provides                    for benefits which have already been

paid            to          be clawed back              from       any          compensation

that            an          insurance company or an                           employer,                      or

anybody                       liable#          eventually                   pay*            to         th«

individual.



And         I was                 asked whether that provision would

apply to payments from the- Hillsborough appeal
fund, or the Hillsborough Dieaetsr fund, and I

va* Abie to give an absolute, unequivocal 'yes'

to thati



In     terms    of       future    benefits     that   axe   being

paid, exactly the same rules will apply to the

Hillsborough         fund,    as applied at Kings Cross

and applied at Bradford, when they seemed to

work very, very tmccthly.                As far as I know we

had not a single complaint.



m s m s s i*

And what would be the effect of those rules?



n Q t i Q u & s s m ''
Well    it     would      depend    on   the   advice    that   is

given by the trustees of the fund to those to

whoa    they give          their money.        For   example,   if

•oatebody suffered a personal injury and they're

being given a payment because of that, then I'm

cure the right thing would be to put that money

into a trust and then any payments made would

be disregarded for a period of some two years.

to     third          parties,               either                for   help        that       they

cf that would be disregarded.



What, we           found          is        that          as        long   as        the       legal

niceties               ares      tackled,                   then         the       interaction

between these payasents and the benefit system,

can be tackled in such & way that really the

needs        of       the       individuals                        are   met       in    a vary

satisfactory manner.




After            your        brief             remarks               in        the      commons

yesterday, there vas some confusion ae a result

of     something              government                      officials             appear        to

have     said outside the chamber» namely that in

tha    futura people w h o .had                                    benefited          from big

payments            frons the               fund          might          well        find       that

their whole                 future regarding                         benefits           changed

for the worse.                   Now can you clear up that?



KICBQIAS SCCTTt
If     that         payaent                was         made          directly              to    an

 individual and it becaae part of their capital

 then the capital                    rule?** fcr inccuve support and

 contributory                 flat    rate    benefits    which     people

have, those would be totally unaffected.



The income related benefits would be affected

if that were siaply added to their capital.



As I *ay there are legal ways in which that can

be       avoided          and    recipient*      will     obvioutly       be

guided by the trustee* of the fund in the best

way      that          they     can   organise       their   affair*      to

avoid that.

Can you guarantee Hr Scott that no on© is going

to suffer ae a result of any payment which that

individual might get froa the Hillsborough fund

by some bizarre quirk of the security system?

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER FUND

1    As requested, I am enclosing a 'line to take' for No 10
following Frank Field's question to-day about the treatment of
payments from the fund in Income Support.

"2    I am afraid that we have ben unable to gather any
 information about the fund or the payments that will be made.
When details are available I shall let you have another note.

HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL DISASTER

How will payments from the fund affect Income Support?


As far as I am aware, no payment has yet been made to any victim
of this terrible tragedy.


Until more details are available, therefore, it is not possible
to be specific about how these will be treated in Income Support.
For example, if a capital sum is placed on trust for an injured
person this can be ignored completely for at least two years and,
in the case of a child, for as long as he o: she is a dependant.
Any actual payments made by the trustees will, however, be taken
into account in the normal way.


Decisions on entitlement to Income Support are, of course, the
responsibility of the independent statutory authorities.




If pressed


The   first     £5   a   week   of   any   regular   payments   is   normally
disregarded.


Any   lump    sum payment will       be treated as capital      - the   first
£3,000 of any capital is ignored completely and an income of £1
a week is assumed for every £250, or part thereof, of any capital
between £3,000 and £6,000.           Any interest earned by the capital
is ignored.


No Income Support is payable if a person has more than £6,000
(for Housing Benefit the limit is £8,000).

HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL DISASTER:   COMPENSATION PAYMENTS

1.   W e understand that an appeal fund has been launched and that some
bereaved relatives are considering legal action.

2.   In case payments are made to compensate for the loss of relatives, rather
than any physical injury to the recipients, we w i s h to clarify whether or not
the recipients can be treated as receiving payments in consequence of a
personal injury to themselves (paragraph 12 of Schedule 10 of the Income
Support (General) Regulations 1987 refers).

3.   In CSB/802/1987 (now reported) at paragraph 12, Commissioner Penny refers
to Jones V Secretary of State for Social Services (1972 AC p944).  At page
1019 Lord Simon of G Laisdale held that "'Injury' is hurt to body or mi n d ... "

4.   Please could you confirm our view that payments to bereaved relatives in
respect of their mental suffering, which are put on      , could be covered by
paragraph 12 of Schedule 10.

S.       The Tribuna l r e a ch e d t he s a m e conclu&ion as th e ad ju dicati on o f f i c e r but by s d i f f e r e n t
route . They found in e f f e c t t h a t under the Tr ust Deed t h e r e was an expre ss di sc r e ti o n as
m en tion ed in r egula ti on 4(6) but did not go on to co ns ider w h e th e r r eg u la ti o n 4(7) applied.
Instead th e y c on sidered regulation 6(i)(kl and found in e f f e c t t h a t t h e r e could be no
disregard und er t h a t regulation because they did no t a c c e p t t h a t A, in suf feri ng an a t t a c k of
meningitis, s u f f e r e d a personal or crim in al injury. They cons idered t h a t he had s u f f e r e d

out as t r e a t m e n t for the disease and did not a m o u n t to pe rso na l injury t o him. Having found
t h a t t h e r e could be no disregard under r egula ti on 6 t h e y evidently w e n t on to c on sider
regulation 7, 8 and 11 in t h e same way as t h e ad ju dicati on o f f i c e r ha d done. In conclusion
the tribu na l said t h a t th ey r e j e c t e d Mr Drabbie's submission " t h a t the e x e m p t io n [u nder
regulation 6(l)(k)] must Include all p a y m e n ts which flow fro m injury done to the p e rs on as
well as t o r t i o u s liability".     1 t a k e then: to have m e a n t t h a t they con sid e red t h a t the
e x e m p t io n given by regulation 6(1 )(k) (and he nc e also r eg ul atio n 4(7)) r e l a t e d only to funds
derived f ro m p a y m e n t s m ade in c onseq ue nc e of crimina'i injury or of personal injury giving
rise to legal liability.

9.     The grounds of the present appeal a r e ; -

       " t h a t t h e Tribunal e r r e d in law in holding t h a t +he monies paid into the t r u s t fund wer e
       not funds derived from a personal injury j [ A a n d in p a rt icula r err e d in law in
       holding t h a t the phrase "personal injury’' was noi a p t to include a disease or injuries
       s u f f e r e d as a result of a disease."

10.       The Re source s Regul ations do not include s de fi niti on of the expression "p erson al
injury1’ and acco rdingly , unless it a p p e ar s from the c o n t e x t t h a t it is being used in a n unusual
sense, it m u s t be given its ordinary meaning. It seem s t o me t h a t in one r e s p e c t it is being
used in an unusual sense in regulations 4(7) and 6(1 )(k) be cau se a d i stin ctio n is drawn
b e tw e en pers on al injuries and c ri m in a l injuries, I am unable to think of any injury to a
person of such a n a tu r e t h a t it could be a crim in al injury w itho ut also being a pe rso na l injury
and I t h e r e f o r e conclude t h a t t h e distinction drawn by the above regula ti ons is not
s igni ficant in r e l a ti o n .t o t h e n a tu r e of the injury under c ons id e ration and, if it is s ig ni ficant
a t sli m u st be significant only in rel ati on to t h e c i r c u m s t a n c e s In which t h e injury o c c u rs .
T h e r e f o r e , when, considering the n a t u r e of the Injuries within th e scope of t h e ex pression
"persona' injuries" I think t h a t it is a p p ro p r iate to p r o c e e d as if the re were no m e n t i o n of
crim inal injuries. However, it will be ne c es s a ry to co ns ider l a t e r w h e th e r the r e f e r e n c e to
criminal injuries has the e f f e c t of limiting the personal injuries to which t h e reg u la ti o n s
appiy to injuries which oc cur in p a rtic u la r c ir c u m s t a n c e s .

11,       I t u r n now to consider t h e ordinary meaning of "injury" as p a r t of t h e expre s s io n
"personal injury". As most co mm on ly used the word "injury" re f e rs to such th ings as c u t s ,
bruises and broken legs w hether caus ed de li b e ra t e ly , by ne glig en ce or by pure a c c i d e n t and
such e x a m p l e s of i' . - '^s c om e im m e d ia t e l y to mind upon being told t h a t .somebocv has been
Injured. H o w e v e , ;         meaning of a word is n o t limited to its meaning as most com m only
used and in my vie a the meaning of "injury" is wide enough to include diseas es although I
a c c e p t t h a t a person describing th e condition of som eone su ffe rin g from a di sease would be
much m o re likely to na m e the spe cific disease then to say t h a t the person c o n c e r n e d was
suffe rin g f r o m an .njury.

12,   Some supp ort fc          /iew is to be found in the Sh orte r Oxford Dictio na ry w h e r e the
m eaning l is ted under "in(„: >" in clud e:-

       " H urt or loss caused to or su stain ed by a person or thing; harm , d e t r i m e n t , d a m a g e ."

F u r th e r s u p p o rt for a wide meaning is t o be found in th e speech of Lord Simon of Glaisdale
in Jones v S e c r e t a r y of S t a t e for Social Service? (1972 AC p. 944), At page 1019 he sa id : -
       "Without, as I say, a t t e m p t i n g any definition, my un de rs ta ndin g of t h e term inology Coi
       the Industrial Injuries Act 1965] Is as follows: 'Incident' is s om e thin g which happens in
       a way r e m a r k a b l e to sensory p e rc e ptio n in a m e n t a ll y s e p a r a b le period of t i m e .
       'Accide nt ' Is an u n t o w a rd incid ent, or a mishap. 'Injury' Is h u r t to body or m i n d        "

The Jones c a se was a e s s e unde r the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act 1946 s n d
 Mr Drabble c i t e d tw o o t h e r c a se s from that- field. Although r e p o r t e d c a s e s in t h a t field
have mostly be e n c o n c e r n e d wit h the question w h e t h e r t h e r e was a "personal injury by
a c cid e n t" for t h e purposes of t h e industrial injuries leg isla tio n in f o r c e at the t i m e and
in pa rt i c u l a r w ith the q u e s ti o n w hether t h e r e was an " a c c i d e n t " th ey do in my view a f f o r d
valuable a s s i s ta n c e in decidin g upon the meaning to be given t o " p e r s o n : : injury" in th e
regulations now under c o n s id e r a t i o n , notw ith stand in g t h e d i f f e r e n c e in c o n t e x t . The f i r s t
ca se cited by Mr Drab ble was C.I. 83/50(KL) which c o n c e r n e d a doctor who was a t t e n d i n g
persons suff e ri ng from tu berc ulo sis and was found t o hav e c o n t r a c t e d t h a t disease hi m s e lf .
It was held t h a t , in th e t h e n s t a t e of medical knowledge, it was impossible to hold t h a t his
i nc apa cit y r es ulte d fro m injury by a c c i d e n t, the Tribunal of Com m issione rs taking t h e view
t h a t it r es ulte d from a pr oc ess. The second c a s e was C.I. 159/50 and con c er ne d a t r a i n e e
nurse a t a da> nur se ry who c a u g h t poliomyelitis fro m an i n f e c t e d child.                          Her c la im

di fficulty in a c c e p t i n g t h a t t h e di sease c o nc erne d c o n s t i t u t e d an injury, Indeed, it a p p e a r s
to have been simply t a k e n for g r a n t e d t hat t h a t was so.

 13.      The s a m e is tru e of two cases decided by t h e House of Lords under the Workmen's
Co mpe ns ation Act, 1S97. The f ir s t was Brlnton's L i m i t e d v Turvey (1905 AC p. 230) and
con cer ned a wo rk m an who was employed sorting wool                  a f a c t o r y . While he was so working
a bacillus (according t o t h e m edical evidence or t h e o r y * passe d fro m the wool to his eye s n d
in fe c te d him with a n t h r a x of which he died.                The House de cided by a m a j o r it y ,
Lord Robe rtson dissenting, t h a t t h e appellant's d e a th was a t t r i b u t a b l e to personal injury by
ac cide nt. It does n ot a ppe ar to me t h a t Lord Robe rtson 's disser.-t was based on the view t h a t
the c o n t r a c t i o n of a di se ase could no: const' r.e an Injury, I think it was based on his view
t hat t h e r e had been no "accident'* and t h at        it were held t h a t t h e r e had been an a c c i d e n t
the res ult would be to open t h e door to claims which could not have be en c o n te m p la t e d by
P a r li a m e n t . The second ca se was Innes or Grant v G and G Kynoc'n (1919 AC p. 765) and
conc erne d a wo rk m an e m ploye d In handling a r t i fi c ia l m anur e , consisting mainly oi bone
dust, who died from blood poisoning caused by his be com ing i n f e c t s o th ro .; i, \ an sbr^siot: o::
his leg by c e r t a i n noxious bacilli, which were p r e s e n t in lar ge n um bers in bone dust, but w e r e ,
also found in t h e air and in ot he r s ubs tanc es, though in a much lesser de gre e . I mention t h e
case only b e c a u s e Lord B ir ke nh ead LC in his speech r e f e r r e d to t h e in fe c ti o n or c o n tr a c ti o n
of the di sease as "the injury", t h a t Lord Pa rm ou r said:-

       !!!n ail ca se s an a c c i d e n t is a ne ces sary f a c t o r , but, if an a c c i d e n t c ause s injury in t h e
       shape of disease it does no t a l t e r its essentia! c h a r a c t e r , and t h e r e s u l ta n t injury is
       s u b j e c t - m a t t e r for cor pensation."

And t h a t Lord Wrenbury sa id :-

       "The m an s u f f e r e d pers ona l injury, for he c o n t r a c t e d a di sease and it res ul ted in his
       de a th ."

14. Before I leave t h e q u e s ti o n of the ordinary mesninp, of "injury" I think I should add :.t
section 76(5) of th e Social Se curity Act 1975 itsejf ac k n o w led g e s t h a t injury inciu^ •:
disease. It r ea d s as fo llo ws:-

       "Nothing in this C h a p t e r a f f e c t s the right of any pe rson t o b e n e fi t in re s p e c t of a

       there        was    no    early       filtering            of     fans      outside         the     g round        this       year.

       As M i n i s t e r       for S p o r t , I m a d e           many       statements             regarding           fences          at

       football           grounds.           I prefer         m oa t s .          I addressed            this       problem          in

       the     1970s       due     to    the      threat      of       b o mb s    and     it wa s       t h en     realised

       that     you       coul d      not    evacuate         a     large         crowd        t h r o u g h a gate           in a

       One     of    my    observations             to    the       Football            Bil l ,    like       fences,

       produces           the a t m o s phe re uf           b e i ng      caged         in a n d      destroys           the

       atmosphere.               I also          believe      that        the F o o t b a l l         Bill     is    designed

       to    entrench           the     policy      of    segregation                w h e n we       should        be    trying

       to m o v e     back       to the          traditional             position when                riv a ls      can       stand

       n ext    to    each       otiter      in a f r i e n d l y         situation.

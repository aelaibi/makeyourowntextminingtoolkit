                  On Saturday             "15 A p r i l     1989,        I performed              duty     as    a    logistics        officer        at

                  Hillsborough             Football          Ground        for       the       occasion         of    the    semi-final         match

                  between Nottingham                   Forest       and Liverpool.




                  I commenced             d u t y at       6 . 0 0 a.m.        at    the       ground      and       had    res p o n s i b i 1ty   for

                  administration.




                  Additionally             I had       responsibility                    for    the     supervision            of    two    property

                  stores.          On e    location           in the       Owls          shop     under      the S p i o n        Kop and     the

                  second a mobile                cabin        situated          behind          turnstiles            1 - 1 6 at     Leppings

                  Lane.         I wa s     responsible             to a n y         Senior        Officer,           requiring        assistance

                  with administrative                      matters,        but       in    practical            terms       liaised        directly

with      Inspector               Sewell.



From      6 . 0 0 a.m.            events       proceeded without                  any     problems.




About         S . 15    p.m.       I went        to   the       perimeter         track      in f r o n t       of    the       Spion

Kop with Police                    Constable          308S Fletcher.                 At    that       time      I estimate              that

the S p i o n K o p was                 about     two      thirds       full,      but     looking         to     the      opposite

end      of    the      ground          there     were      far       fewer    Liverpool          supporters.                   The     two

c lubs        pens      on    the L a p p i n g s       Lane      terrace         appeared        to     be     about        two

thirds         full , t h e r e          seemed       to    be    few    supporters             in the        outer        pens a n d

a few         supporters               well    dotted around             the      West     Stand.          1 was        so

surprised              by    the       lack    of L i v e r p o o l     supporters           t h at    I made         specific

inference              to    it    to P o l i c e     Constable          Fletcher          and    noted         the     time       as

being         b e t w e e n E. 15 to S . 2 0            p.m.




We    then walked                 to    the    Property          Store    under         the S p i o n      Kop which             was

manned         by Pol ice              Constable        3063 Marshall              a n d Mrs.         Drabble,          Civilian

Administrator.                     It w a s      very      busy       under    the S p i o n Kop,             Nottingham

Forest         f a ns       were       still     arriving         in    lar ge     numbers.            The      mood       of    those

f an s    was       good      natured          which       I judged       from       their        routine         enquiries

about         the      location          of    toilets,          refreshments             and     entrances           to     the

terraces            and      their       general        behaviour.



After         checking            that    al l    was      in    order    at      the     property         s to r e ,      I walked

with Police                 Constable          Fletcher          towards       the      second        property          store         at

the L e p p i n g s          Lane       turnstiles.              We w a l k e d    along        the    1o w e r      passageway

beneath          the        North       Stand     w h i c h was        allocated          to L i v e r p o o l       fans.

Moving          towards           the L e p p i n g s      Lane       turnstiles          it b e c a m e      quite        busy with

supporters              entering          the     ground         to    gain    access        to    the     North        Stand.

                                                                                                                                        R-129


At     the    end       of    the     p a s s a g e w a y we         passed Sergeant                 738        Morgan          who     was       en

r oute       to    the       gymnasiun           with      an       off     duty      Police       Officer            who       had     had

his w a l l e t         stolen.            At    t h is    stage          I saw       nothing       abnormal               or    untoward

in the        behaviour             of     the    crowd.



T he    property             store       was     situated            inside        turnstiles              1— 16 a n d          on     the

ground        side       of     the      metal        fence         which       separated          supporters               using          the

North Stand              from       those        going         to    th e      West    Stand       and      terraces.                  There

was     a further             mobile        cabin         for       programme          sellers        alongside                 the P o l i c e

property           st o r e .       This        store      wa s      manned        by P o l i c e     Sergeant              1 1 53 B o o t h

and     Police          Constable           3233 Campbell.                      Whilst       walking            to    this       location,

when     passing             under       the     end      of    th e      North       Stand,       1 had         warned          Police

Constable              Fletcher          that     on      the       occasion          of    the    semi-final               the

previous           y e a r,     the      area     had      resembled             a waterfall               of    urine          from       peopl

using        the       stand.         At    that       time         the     ground was            dry.




At     the    property             store        matters         were        quiet      with       little         property              seised

from     fans.           After        discussing               meal       arrangements             with Sergeant                     Booth

and Police              Constable           Campbell            we       left    the       store     intending              to       return

to     the    gymnasium.                 H o w e ve r , immediately                   on    1e a v i n g    I was          approached

by a g a t e m a n           who    was     manning            Gate       A.     This       gate     is n o r m a l l y          used        to

allow Police                 Officers           and    other         authorised             people         to    enter          th e    ground

without           using       the     turnstile.                The       gateman was             in a n        agitated             st at e.

He     t o l d me       that       because        the      crowd          outside          the    gate      was       so    heavy          he

was     unable          to    open       the     gate      to a l l o w         authorised          access            and

accordingly              he     had      locked        the      gate.           X assured          him      he       had    taken          the

correct           course        of a c t i o n ,       but      during          the    course        of     our       discussion

         i started            to a p p e a r      on      top       of    the    gate       having         cl i m b e d     up       the

outside           to a h e i g h t         of a b o u t        15-20        feet.          I signalled               and    called           out

to     them       to    get     off      the     g at e    and       they       did    in f a ct       climb          down       to     the
                                                                                                                                     PAGE           4
                                                                                                                                     R IE9

outside.            Because          of    this      situation          the    g a t e m a n was              clearly          worried

and aksed           for      a Police          Officer        to a s s i s t       h i m at         this       gate .



My     only      view     of    the       c r o w d at     t h at    stage     wa s       through             t he    very       samll

windows          in G a t e     A,      but    I could        see      there       was     a       l arge      crowd        outside.

I then went             to     the      turnstiles          adjacent          to    the Gate              A but        found         only

one    Police        Officer            who    was     clearly         unable       to     l e a ve       his        post.        It was

my a s s u m p t i o n       that       all    other      officers           deployed              at    this        position            were

engaged with              prisoners            or    escorting          those       who        had       gained        unauthorised

access        from      the     ground.             There     were      no    supervisory                 officers             present.

A sm a l l       number        of    officers         were      deployed           at     the       n ex t     group        of

turnstiles           but       were       fully      engaged.




I next        went      to     turnstiles            A-G which          allowed           supporters                 into      the

ground        to    use      the     terraces.            Then       I saw     Inspector                 White.          He      had with

hi m a     number         of    officers            but   they were           also        fully          engaged.              It w as

clear      more      officers             were      required        to m a n       th e    turnstiles                 '1-16.         I

radioed a           request          to P o l i c e       control       to    send more                 men    to     t ha t

location.            Th e      request         was    acknowledged.                 That           was    th e       first       time        I

ha d    used my         r a d i o , my message              was      both     transmitted and                        acknowledged.




F or    s om e     time      p r io r     to   using      the       radio     there        had          been     interference

and     distortion             of m e s s a g e s     but     all      the    message              I had       heard        had      been

intelligible.



I returned           to t u r n s t i l e s         1 -1 6 a n d     would     estimate                 the    time      as

H.45     p.m.       perhaps          with an         accuracy          of 5 m i n u t e s .              On    this      occasion                many

officers           were      present.            I could        se e    through           the       turnstiles              that         a

la rge     crowd was            present          outside        and     there       was        a    considerable                 cr us h.

Supporters           were       entering            the    ground       only       very        slowly          through           the

turnstiles              and      there       were       a number             of     reasons         for     this.          O ne

turnstile              operator            was    elderly and                worked          slowly.           One    younger

operator           left        his     turnstile              to      remonstrate             with a        supporter.                 The       crush

was     so    great          outside         t ha t     people            were      having         difficulty             in d e t a t c h i n g

themselves              from      th e      crowd       to       enter       th e      turnstiles.              The       greatest

problem.,          however,            seemed          to     be      the    number          of    people       reaching           the

turnstiles              w ho     had       the    wrong          ticket,          who    tried        to    pay      to    gain        admission

or w ho       attempted               to    gain       unauthorised                 admission.



As     those       who       succeded            in    passing            through        the       turnstiles             entered              the

ground        they a p p r o a c h e d            Police           Officers            directly.            Some      were        abusive

and     offensive,               but       the    over-riding                impression             I gained          from        t h e m w as

of     p a ni c    and       f e ar    that       serious             injuries          or    death were             about        to       occur

in the        crush          outside.




T he    information               passed          to me          by t h o s e       supporters             complied          with          my

somewhat           restrictive               vision           of w h a t      was       happening           through          the

turnstiles,              c o n v i n c e d me          that        action         was    needed        to      relieve          the

pressure           on    the      crowd          outside.              I passed          a    r a di o m e s s a g e       to     this

effect        to P o l i c e          Control          with a view                to a c t i o n      being       taken         outside

the     ground.              I do      not       re c a l l      t h is     message          being     acknowledged.                       I

directed           officers,               including Police                   Constable             Fletcher,             to a s s i s t

supporters              in t h r o u g h         the    turnstiles                as    quickly        as      possible.               I

instructed              t ha t    everybody             should            be all o w e d          in w i t h    or    wi t h o u t         the

correct           ticket,         whether             authorised             or     not.

assist        at       the     turnstiles.                  at     t ha t    time       I became           aware      of     supporters

gaining           access         to    the       ground          by    climbing          u p o n a wa ll          and      shinning

their       way along             the      to p      of G a t e         B.       They        were       being           intercepted

within       the     ground          by P o l i c e            Officers,               but    the       people           gaining          access          i

t his    manner         appeared             to      be    in       considerable                  danger          from      electrical

cables       and     la m p s       on     the       top       of     Gate       B by        climbing             on a       s mall       b ri c k

structure          at    the        r ea r      of    the       turnstiles               and       then          climbing         to      the    roof

with     the    assistance                 of     a Liverpool                  supporter-                   It    had      been     my

intention          to    prevent             people            gaining           access           in t hi s         manner.




When     I climbed            to     the        roof       I became              firstly           aware          of     the     situation

outside        the      turnstiles.                   I could             s ee     the       areas          outside         turnstiles               A-G

and     1--16 w h e n        completely               filled           with        a    crush          of    people.             The      crowd

then     extended            beyond          the      perimeter                grass         taking          up th e        full       width         of

Lappings        L a n e,      extending               ov e r        the      river       bridge             to    the     left a n d         along

Leppings       Lane          to     t he     r ig h t a b o u t           50     yards.            Under          normal

circumstances                I would            have       estimated               there          to    be a        crowd        of a b o u t

2,0 0 0 ,    but     on t h a t          occasion              people          were      so       tightly           crushed         together              I

estimate        there         to     have         been         twice         the       number.              The     pressure           from      the

crush       seemed       at       its      greatest             at     the       turnstiles                 as    the     crowd        pushed         to

gain admission.                     I could           see S u p e r i n t e n d e n t              Marshall              s t a n d i ng

slightly above                the        ground           on    the       stonework               at    the       head      of    the      bridge

in L e p p i n g s      Lane.            There        were          numerous           Mounted              Officers           in the a r e a

and     I r ec a l l     a    r a di o       message            for       a man         to a t t e n d ,          I believe            from      the

Directors          entrance              in the S o u t h S t a n d                    car    park.              When     I first          climbed

to    the    roof       there        were         two M o u n t e d            Officers            trying           to    control          the

crowd       outside          th e    turnstiles                 A-G.           Eventually               they        left       that       area       and

joined       other       Mounted             Officers               a t t e m p t i ng       to h o l d          th e    crowd      back        in

Leppings       Lane          to w h i c h         the      pressure              on     those          people           between        the

Those       supporters              who      were         gaining            access          by    climbing              over     Gate       B were

from     turnstiles               1-16.           I saw a b o u t            30 young            men     sitting           outside            this

fence     waiting            their          turn       to    climb        on     to    the       w a ll .      Others            were

climbing        directly               to a       position             n e ar    me    from        the      turnstile

enclosure.              On my ar rival                    these        people         were       swarming           over         the     wal l .

I could        see      it w o u l d         not       h a ve     been       safe      to    try and           force          them       back

into     the    crowd.                In v i e w       of    the       desperate            crush        below          I. a l l o w e d      them

to    climb     on      to       the     roof        of     the    turnstile,               one     at      a time,           and      showed        to

them     the    s a fe       route          b a ck     to    ground          level      inside           the       turnstiles               by the

way    1 h ad     climbed              to    the       roof.           Some      of    these        men       had       difficulty

standing        and      had          been       drinking,             but      non was          disorderly.




A    substantial             proportion                of    these        people        were        in      possession              of      tickets

which     they were              waving           to      gain     access.             Others          made        no    effort          to

turnstile         roof           tried       to      pass       tickets          back       to    those        outside            the

turnstiles.              I prevented                   this       happening.                I became           so       engrossed             in

ensuring        the      safety             of    these         people          that    I took           no    great          account          of

what     was    happening               elsewhere.                 1 was         aware       of     snatches             of      r a d io

messages        about            opening          g a t e s , but         I was        not       aware        of    the       origin          of

those     messages.                   The    crowd          outside          turnstiles             A-G       reduced            suddenly

whi ch    could         only          have       happened          by     the     opening           of G a t e s         B & C.             I did

not    have     gate         C    in    v i e w but          1 saw        the     last       of     the       crowd, about                  40-30

entering        via      gate          B , which            I saw was            open.           Shortly           after         the     crowds

outside        turnstiles               A-G       reduced,             the      same    happened              outside            turnstiles

reduced         to      such an             extent          that       it, f i l l e d a b o u t         half       of     the      enclosure

within      the      permiter               gates, I managed                     to    signal          to     Inspector             Hand-

Davis,      Mounted              Department               and     he    directed            one     of      his     officers             into

the    enclosure             and       that       officer          prevented            any       more        supporters               climbing

into     the       gr o u n d .



I gauge         that       the       mood     of     the    supporters                that    I came        into         contact          with

w as    mixed.            Some       were     abusive        and       had       been    drinking.              Others           were

abusive         about          what     they       consider'd to             be       lack    of P o l i c e        action          to

prevent         crushing             outside         the    turnstiles.                 Many       were    simply           fearful

that     serious           injury would               occur       at    the       turnstiles.              The       majority

demanded Police                     action      to    reduce        the      crus h.          There       is    no       doubt       in my

mind     t ha t      the       most     appropriate           action             in th e      circumstances                 was      to

open     gates        A ,B      & C to p r e v e n t i n j u r i e s              in the       crush.           I did          not       see

the a c t i o n s         of    the     crowd when           the       gates          were    opened       because             it w as

necessary            to    ensure         the      safety     of       those          people       climbing          into        the

g r ou n d .




With matters               under        control        outside          th e      turnstiles,             1 returned                to    the

ground       and was            rejoined           by P o l i c e      Constable             Fletcher.              Within          a few

moments        a     clear          radio     message        was       transmitted             directing             officers             on

to     the     pitch       in f r o n t       of L e p p i n g s       Lane       terrace.           A    l a r ge       number          of

officers           ran     into        the    ground        and went             in    the    direction             of    th e      pitch.




I then went               with Police              Constable           Fletcher          towards          the S p i o n          Kop.          As

we     passed        the a r e a        where        I had w a r n e d           Police       Constable             Fletcher             of

the w a t e r f a l l          of    urine      I sa w      there       was       a    large       patch       of    ground

covered         in    liquid           whi ch      I took     to       be    urine.           We    then w alked               to    the

perimeter            track          in f r o n t     of the       S p i o n K op .           I could       see       large          numbers

of     people        including            Police       Officers             on    the    pitch       in f r o n t         of     the

Leppings           Lane        terraces.             I could        see      fans       climbing          from       th e      terrace

into     the       West        Stand.         After        what     seemed            like a       period       of       many

minutes,           Police           Officers         and    civilians             began       carrying          casualties

                     ambulance        drove         onto     the     pitch.        A    short    t im e      l a te r     I heard       a    radio

                     message       r e p e a t e d at       l east    o n ce     from Poli c e        Constable            2988    Burkinshaw

                     stating      there        was     a    need     to    set    up a t e m p o r a r y         mortuary.         I passed

                     t hi s   message         t,o a    senior        ambulance          officer,        using       the     ra d i o    in a n

                     1 then went          to     the       gymnasium        to    try and       organise           th e    reception

                     of   casualties.               Within     a short           space    of    time        it    became

                     apparent        t ha t    l a r ge     numbers        of    casualties          ha d    occurred.            Having

                     ascertained         that         casualties           were    being       taken        to    the     Northern          General

                     Hospital,        I travelled             with Police              Constables           Fletcher        and 538 Horn                   to

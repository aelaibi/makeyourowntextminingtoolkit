Mr Enzor


R v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

1.   Following our telephone conversation yesterday, I attach a copy of my letter to ACC
     Daines, with copies of that letter’s enclosures. I am also sending you with this copies of
      my earlier exchanges with David Seymour and Sue Ross, from which you should be
      able to see how things have progressed in your absence. If anything is unclear, please
     do not hesitate to let me know.

2.   These papers are copied to you for your information and then for George Croston’s file.
     I have not retained any copies.

T. W h a r t o n E s q . ,
Chairman,
The Football Grounds I mprovement Trust.

Dear Mr. Wharton,

As instructed, w e have, jointly w i t h George Corderoy & Co., prepared a
statistical report for 20 Clubs, 10 from D i v is ion 1 and 10 f r o m Divi sion 2.
The details for each of these s ampl e clubs is attached hereto, and w e have the
requisite in for m a t i o n available to prepare s i mi lar reports for all the Englis h
and Scottish League Clubs if the Trustees should w i s h us to prepare them.

The Trustees recognised at their last m e e t i n g that the con siderable
expenditure w h i c h the clubs could desire to incur on the pr ovi sio n of seating
would seriously outstrip the funds available to the Trustees.                    In this
connection the Trustees n oted p a r tic ula rly that the P P A are unable to
gu arantee a continuing supply of funds, and also that safety r e q u i r e m e n t s
other than seating had to take priority.             W i t h these factors in mind, the
Tr ustees recognised that a form of "rationing" m a y be necessary, and
a cc ord ing ly they w i s h e d to have as m u c h relevant inf orm a t i o n as possible in
order to consider the m a n n e r in w h i c h they w o u l d allocate their available
resources.

The i n f orm atio n contained in this report is being presented b ef ore the
product ion of the results of the survey c o m m i s s i o n e d jointly b y The Football
League and The Trust.        The further survey w i l l supply m o r e details of the
particular needs of the individual clubs, and this report should therefore be
recognised as a p r e l i m i n a r y e x a m i n a t i o n of the type of i n f o r m a t i o n w h i c h can
be m a d e available to the Trustees.

As wi ll be recognised f r o m the figures, w e have w o r k e d on the basis that the
"need" of the clubs is to c o m p l y precisely w i t h the red uct ion in standing
capacity suggested in the Taylor Report, and that the average c onv ersi on rate
is 2 standing spaces to 1 seat.       Quite clearl y s ome clubs w i l l w i s h to go
further than the m i n i m u m requirements, and equally the 2:1 ratio will n ot be
applicable in e v e r y case.

One approach to this r e port is to recognise that on this 20 - Club sample, the
"need" is for 170000 seats.        A p p l y i n g to this n u m b e r of seats the Trustees
current m a x i m u m grant o ffer of £17.50 per seat, the cost to the Trust of grant
aiding these 20 clubs w o u l d be a p p r o x i m a t e l y £3m. It seems to be a fair
assumption that double this amount, i.e. £6m, w o u l d deal w i t h the m i n i m u m
requirements of The F ootball League 1st and 2nd Divisions over the 5 year
period.

Yours    sincerely,




Colin Foster,
Rushtons.

           INCIDENT AT HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND ~ SHEFFIELD SATURDAY 15TH

           APRIL 1989

           Karen SHERBURN,      Police<Constable 3136. Cl Uniform.

           I am a Police Constable of the S Y o k s h i r eyf^o lice, presently stationed

           at Main St Police Station, RothejT^ain.

           At 8.30am    (0830) o n Saturday 15th April       1989 (150489)          I paraded on

           duty at Main St Police Station, Rotherham,              for the F. A. Cup semi­

           final match between Liverpool Football Club and Nottingham Forest

           Football Club,    to be held that afternoon at the/Hillsbo rough Football

           Ground, Sheffield.

           I joined together with my serial,        number 38/under supervision of

           Sergeant TISSINGTON and Inspector ELLIS. We were then conveyed to

           Hillsborough by coach. Once at the ground we congregated together                       in
                                                                    PAGE       2
                                                                    S3185

the N Stand where we were briefed by senior Officers.

At 11.30am (1130)   I went with my serial to £-------
                                              Hal i fax
                                                      yC-----
                                                             Sheffield where

we were in charge of parking of mini buses and searching of fans

alighting from mini   buses.   I noticed that a great number of fans

arriving had already consumed a large amount of alcohol,      the mini

buses were full of empty beer cans which had been consumed on the

journey down.

At 2.55pm   (1455) we joined up in our serial again and went down to

Clay Wheels Traffic Department, where we were to be on standby for

the match in case of trouble. On our way I could see that the streets

were littered with empty cans and fans were still making their way

towards the ground,   urinating in gardens as they went.

As we neared Clay Wheels Ln we were joined by a few other serials. At

this time I could hear the noises of the crowd inside the ground as

the match started. From messages    coming over the radio ~ of which only

our serial Sergeant had there seemed to be some trouble inside the

ground at this time. We made our way towards the ground in case our

assistance was needed. Outside the ground we were/formed up into our

serials awaiting furthe r instructions.   PI CHARLES who was the re at the

time   in charge of other serials asked ground control via radio if

our assistance was required inside the ground. The answer received was

yes.

I entered the ground via Leppings Ln and with the other Officers

expecting to fit>d people fighting inside. As I entered I saw ab^ut

15-20 male bodies spread about on the ground outside the entrance to

the tunnel.   I immediately went to a youth a/ed about 17 years who was

laid on the ground outside the tunnel. Together with PC 2^60 BALL we

began to render mffiith to mouth and hear/ massage. At this time a

female supporter/advised me that she was a registered nurse and would

I like her to Carry on.   I replied yes
                                                                           PAGE      3
                                                                           S3185

I stood up to move on somewhere else,         the fans around me began to

shout,      "Come on you black bastards,   do something you murderers."          I

just      ignored this and made my way through the tunnel towards the

perimeter fence.

As I did this there were fans staggering their way back up the tunnel

towards the exit gate many were being carried by fellow supporters, as

I came out into the opening of the tunnel         I could see bodies      laid

everywhere. Most of the bodies      I could see were purple and blue around

the face and chest and I knew then that there was no hope for them.

I assisted any fans that were injured and laying about on the floor,

giving a lot of them chair lifts out through the tunnel            into the open

yar d .

Each time I went back through the tunnel         into the stand,   the fans on

the balcony above were becoming more and more worked up. They were

becoming very abusive and began throwing         coins and spitting at us.

I helped some more injured through into the yard, and while I was out

there, there were more and more bodies outside the gate. I helped
                                                        ---- ---      f
other Officers and ambulance men to carry the bodiey^through the gate

and lay them at the side of the line of amb_ul_an7cz_.
                                      -----         e^ .

At this time some of the ground stewards around handing around cups of

water.     I went around the injured people I could see around me and made

sure that they were all comfortable and any people that were in the

recovery position make sure that they were still breathing.

All the time there were a lot of fans milling around being abusive and

causing obstructions. At about this time there was a message over the

loud speaker system announcing that the match was postponed and would

the fans      leave as orderly as possible.

We then formed a cordon in front of the gate to ensure that the fans

went straight out and did not wander around.

As we did this we were met with a torrent of abuse. A lot of the fans
                                                                                  PAGE     4
                                                                                  S3185

          were blaming us and getting quite hysterical. Eventually we cleared

          the ground and I then went back through into the pitch and up to the N

          Stand where      I met up with my serial a g a i n .

          We were then de-briefed by various senior Officers and then stood down.

          I then made my way to Clay Wheels with my serial where          I was conveyed

          back to Main St by coach, where I went off duty at 7.30pm          (1930).

           F o res 1 at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield,          in the semi-final of the

            F .A. Cup competition.     I had managed to get a /£6 terracing ticket for

            I had attended the same fixture at. Hi 1/isborough in 1988 and I had

            stood on the Leppings Ln terracing .\ I had found it very busy that

            afternoon and had tried my best to obtain a stand seat for this y e a r ’s

            game,! but could not get one.

            In 1988 at the semi-final match at Hillsborough,                           I had found it busy

            on the! Leppings Ln terrace.           People were being pushed about a bit.                              I

            saw pebple pul1ing people from the Leppings Ln terrace up into the W

            stand.        I had found it very warm and remembe r be i ng drenched in sweat

            as a result of being in such close contact with the crowd,                                 in a

            confined area.

            On Saturday 15th April         1989 (1504-89),            I got a bus from my house to the

            5Sho pp ing City*       in Runcorn,   this would be about 9.30am                       (0930).     I was

            I was booked on a bus from there to the Hillsborough Stadium Jrri

            Sheffield and back home again.               Travel was on an AmBkerlUrc coach which

            had been arranged by a workmate of mine

            When I ar ri ved at ’ShoDi?*"^ r '                       9.30am    (0930)     1 met

            between 9.30am (0930) and 9.45am               (0945)           I sat on the back seat of

                          and we arrived at these gates at about 2.35pm           (1435).     On the walk to

                          the ground I saw quite a few uniformed policemen standing on the main

                          roads and in the side streets,        I asked one policeman if I was on

                          Leppings Ln, as I wasn't too sure and he told me that I was.

                          I was by now only with                          md                      had left us

                          to go to their place in the stands.

                          Outside the ground it was very bu sy , with masses of peopie outside the

                          ground.     I looked but could see no recognisable queue to join,

                                    and I were being pushed about      in the crowd outside,         it was

                          warm.

                          X saw a steward and a couple of uniformed policemen outside.                  I was

                          holding my ticket in my hand.       We joined the mass of people outside

                          attempting to make their way to the turnstiles.

                          It became a crush outside,      people^,   including myself, were shouting

                          at the police to get the people organised into recognisable queues,

                 I        hoping that would relieve t/fe crowd pressure.          The crowd outside was

                          quite agitated at the police,      due to the lack of organisation a n d a U

           the pushi ng goi ng on.

            Aftar about     10 minutes in this crowd,   I saw blue concertina style

                    being opened,   I d o n ’t know who opened these gates.     I could see

           a steward and a couple of policemen standing inside these open gates,
1*1
           In a mass,     the crowd headed for these open gates,                    and I

           were being swept along with the body of the crowd.                 and I entered

           the ground through this open gate, without having to surrender our

           tickets or have them checked.

           Once beyond the turnstile the crowd headed for a tunnel,            I could see

           the crossbar of a goal, as I looked through this tunnel                and I were

           in the crowd heading for the tunnel,           was urging me to hang back

           but there was no way you could have done so in such a crowd.

           Inside the tunnel     leading to the terrace it was extremely busy.            The

Cat        tymnel     slopes slightly downwards which has the effect of making you
T O f M £ c _ /almost run at the approach to the terrace.      I worked my way along the

           tunn e1,        was a few yards ahead of me.      At one stage in the tunnel          I

           attempted to turn around and go back out the tunnel but such was the

           rate of people entering the tunnel       that this proved impossible,      so I

           continued towards the terracing.        I shouted ahead to          “are you

           alright"          called back that he was.

           At the terracing at the tunnel      exit just about 10 yards from the

           terrace,     I had been pushed against the wall of the tunnel,        this proved

           uncomfortable and 1 made my way off the wall to the centre of the

           tunnel.The terracing as I joined ij/^was full to capacity there was a

           metal    railing dividing the terrace,    I moved to the right of this

           railing
              ,IXVjS. into an area known^as/pen 3,    I had by now lost sight of

                      and did not see himHagai n that day.

           When I was still     in the tunnel near the terracing,     I heard a whistle

           blow and a loud roar, this was followed almost at once by a tremendous

           surge from behind as more and more people poured down the tunnel               into
                                                                         PAGE          5

the ground,     This surge of people,     sent me some £0 yards forward into

the terracing,       towards the right hand area of pen 3.     The shove caused

my feet to leave the ground, and I would estimate that it was fully 10

minutes before my feet touched the ground.          I was packed into the

crowd so tightly that I could hardly breath properly and was gasping

for air.     My arms were pinned across my chest and I could not release

them.     The heat was increasing in the crowd.       All around people were

shouting that there was a girl on the floor,         no-one could move to give

help.     If a person in the crowd moved, we all got moved as a result of

being packed so tightly together.         I had never felt as helpless before

in my life.     I saw one man who must be about 17 stone being hauled

back to his feet by a smaller man in the crowd,          I remember him as        it

surprised me,       that a smaller man   had managed to get this heavy   man

back to his feet,        I never   saw a girl on the ground,

A couple of lads about       10 or 11 years old who appeared to have passed

out, were passed over the heads of the crowd to the pitch area.             The

two boys were pink coloured and the second one was moaning to himself.

 The people in the crowd who had a hand free were passing them

forward,    if your arms were trapped in the crowd,      the men would nudge

the two lads forward using         their hands.   The crowd hadgone strangely

quite now, as people saved   their a'nergy to breath.

I saw people climbing out of thsr pen, over the perimeter fence on

 to the edge of the pitch,         I/nad not seen any of the play but I

believe    it had stopped by'nrow.

A young lad about       13 years old standi ng to my left turned to me and

said,    "Mister,   will you take your elbow out of my ribs" I said,      "I’m

sorry,    I can’t move"     I saw the lad becoming groggy and his head

rolling a bit,       but the pressure eased and I managed to move my arm out

of the boys side and I saw that he recovered back to normal.

I never saw a barrier break in pen 3.

Once the pressure was off I made my way up the terrace towards the

tunnel and although the tunnel appeared clear of people I decided that

I did not want to walk along the tunnel again.         I walked along

the rear of the Leppings Ln towards the N stand.         This was about 3.

30 pm <1530),      but I can't be too sure as I lost all track of time.

I saw a little gate in the terracing fence dividing        pen 5 from pen

6, there were only a couple of lads using this gate,        I obviously

panicked for some reason,        because I jostled my way through this

gate,   I must have panicked as I had been involved in the crowd crush.

I stood up at the back of the terracing,        between the W and N stand,

there was plenty of room,        I stood on my own there for at least one and

a half hours and left the ground alone, about 4.40 pm <1640).            I

didn't fancy getting into any more large crowds.         As I stood at

the back of the terracing        I could see fans and Police on the pitch and

people being carried on boards across the pitch.         1 saw ambulances

on the pitch.       I heard people say that people had died in the crowd.

I was in shock and waited alone at the back of the terrace.         I left

the ground at 4.40 pm (1640) and returned to the coach.         We waited as

other people began to arrive at the coach.         Tom HOWARD and his son did

not return to the coach.         One of the lads had phoned my wife to tell
-L ___________ _
her that I was a l r i g h t .

Our coach left Sheffield about 9.30 pm (2130)        I got home about

midnight    (0000).

    hates the most.
      As each rumour and counter-rumour has
    rocked her troubled 15-year marriage to Captain
    Mark Phillips she has jealously guarded her
    privacy.
      She is a Princess who expects her Royal duties to be
    given prominence b ut her home life and friendships to
    be scrupulously censored from the pages of newspapers
    and television screens.
      On some days she expects to be treated like a British
    Royal, on others as though she is no different from any
    other farmer’s wife in the Cotswolds.
      And her attitude to privacy has not changed since she
    married Captain Phillips on the rebound from her first
    love, commodity broker Sandy Harper — the man
    thought by many a t th e Palace a s th e one she would
    devote her life to.
      W hether taking her to candlelit dinners or escorting
    her to the musical Hair, Sandy Harper, the polo-playing
    son of a lieutenant-colonel, was frequently a t the young
    Princess’s side in 1969 — the year after she was first
    introduced to Mark Phillips — and she rapidly fell for
    him.




       But, perhaps frightened by the trappings of the Royal
    circus, Harper broke off the relationship suddenly and
    instead married model Peta Seccombe, from whom he is                                                                          msm
    now divorced.
       The rift from Harper deeply saddened Anne and
    prepared th e ground for her engagement to Captain
    Mark Phillips which, u ntil officially announced, created
    the m ost intense speculation across the world.
       Anne herself was partly to blame. She was insistent on
    keeping her friendship with the young Army officer a               COMMON LO VE:                                     , to d a y Anne a n a M a rh go s e p a ra te ways
    secret as long as possible and their friends
    went to extraordinary lengths to assist them.
       The penny eventually dropped when Anne
    was discovered out fox-hunting with Mark in
    December 1972.

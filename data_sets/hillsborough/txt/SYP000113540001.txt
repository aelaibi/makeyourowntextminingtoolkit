             On Saturday,          15 April.      1989,         I was    engaged on duties at H i l l s b o r o u g h

              charge     of our Serials.              He ensured that everyone was aware                           of their

              duties and        reminded us that                it was     likely that the Liverpool                     fans

              w o u l d be a f f e c t e d    by alcohol         and that we would have to be selective

 our strength.'             Our       brief was    to m a i n t a i n order     outside    the

turnstiles,           to assist            other Serials as        required,      and to search and

supervise         the u n loading             of vehicles    and    coaches a r r i v i n g at the ground

These       instructions              were duties w h i c h most       of the Serial          and myself          had

 carried out all               season.

After       the briefing we                immediately went        outside      the turnstiles            and

took up a position where Leppings                         Lane abuts an open area                leading to

the     iron-barred            perimeter        fence and gates which are              d i r ectly      in front

of the turnstiles.                     W hen we got outside        there were a number               of fans

a l r e a d y gathering              in this area and on the footpaths                 on both sides             of

the     road.        Some      of these       fans were     ob v i o u s l y without    tickets         because

they were asking                 fans for spare tickets as they were arriving.

At this stage              the fans were          in good spirits and            compa r a t i v e l y well

behaved,         a l t h o ug h there were a number             of them arriving           carrying         cans

of beer and           lager.

On several           occasions            Inspector Sykes and myself a sked the fans                       to

and assist            in relieving         the     pressure.       I asked some             of the officers

Although        I had a personal            radio,     w hich had wo r k e d alri g h t when                  I

first started duty,              it a p p eared      to deteriorate,              together with the

fact     that    I had d if f i c u l t y    in hearing          it due to being               surr o u n d e d by

noisy     fans    for most       of the time.

I walked        back towards       Gate      'A' and met           up with a few officers                    of my

Serial     and almost          immediately       I heard a radio message                       requesting

officers        to go ont'p. the      pitch 'because             the Liverpool            faris «e,re

of the L e p pings Lane           fence      pulling at the            fence.           I also     saw the gate

open to the         centre      north enclosure.              It was apparent              that a number of

people were         injured and that            it was       not a     'pitch i n v a s i o n * .

of them not         seriously.        They sat on the grass at the side                               of    the

track.       I requested         officers      to move        them further              onto    the    pitch       in

order     that officers          could work         on the more          seriously            injured,

had not been done already.                    The    reason        I did this was              because       our

F2 SUB-DIVISION - BCCLESFIELD




                  Incident at Hillsborough Football Ground

                    Sheffield on Saturday, 15 April 1989



On Saturday, 15 April 1989, I was engaged on duties at Hillsborough

Football Ground, Sheffield, for the FA Cup Semi-Final between Liverpool FC

and Nottingham Forest FC.



I commenced duty at Ecclesfield Police Station at 9.00 a.m. and attended

at the Hillsborough Ground at 10.00 a.m. for the main briefing which took

place in the North Stand.



I was the Sergeant in charge of Serial 19, which comprised 10 Constables

and myself.   Our duties were at the Leppings Lane end of the ground where

the Liverpool fans were to be accommodated.



At 11.00 a.m., together with my Serial I attended at the rear of the West

Stand, with other Serials, who were engaged on the Leppings Lane

turnstiles, where we were briefed by Inspector Sykes, the officer in

charge of our Serials.   He ensured that everyone was aware of their duties

and reminded us that it was likely that the Liverpool fans would be

affected by alcohol and that we would have to be selective as we would not

be able to cope with the numbers without depleting our strength.    Our

brief was to maintain order outside the turnstiles, to assist other

Serials as required, and to search and supervise the unloading of vehicles

and coaches arriving at the ground.



                                                             Continued       /2

These instructions were duties which most of the Serial and myself had

carried out all season.




After the briefing we irrmediately went outside the turnstiles and took up

a position where Leppings Lane abuts an open area leading to the iron-

barred perimeter fence and gates which are directly in front of the

turnstiles.   When we got outside there were a number of fans already

gathering in this area and on the footpaths on both sides of the road.

Some of these fans were obviously without tickets because they were asking

fans for spare tickets as they were arriving.



At this stage the fans were in good spirits and comparatively well

behaved, although there were a number of them arriving carrying cans of

beer and lager.



On several occasions Inspector Sykes and myself asked the fans to deposit

the alcohol in bins which were at the side of the turnstiles.



One of our main problems were fans without tickets gathering around us -

we were constantly moving them away.



The turnstiles were opened sometime around 12 noon but the fans were

reluctant to go into the ground and the numbers grew outside.   At one

stage, around this time, two of my Serial arrested a 'ticket tout1 who was

causing people to obstruct the footpath further.   Fans without tickets

were constantly returning to the area and the mounted police officers kept




                                                                     Continued

moving them from the area.



All through this period my Serial assisted with     the unloading of South

Yorkshire Transport buses, which were arriving at intervals on the

opposite side of the road from where we were standing.     As the fans

alighted we stopped traffic to allow them to cross the road to enter the

ground.   As they were getting off the buses fanswithout tickets    kept

asking them if they had spare tickets.   When the   fans crossedthe road it

was obvious that numbers of them were reluctant to enter the ground many

of them asking where the nearest pubs and eating places were.



Approximately five coaches arrived at the ground which we supervised in

unloading, after that all other coaches were advised to let their

passengers alight at the coach park.



Between 12.30 p.m. and 2.00 p.m. the numbers of fans without tickets grew

into many hundreds, blocking the footpaths leading to the ground to such

an extent that people were having to walk in the road to pass them.



On a number of occasions I asked members of the mounted section, who were

maintaining order in the queues and keeping non-ticket holders away, to

clear the footpaths.



Throughout I maintained more or less the same position in order that

members of my Serial could find me if they required my assistance.

It is difficult to recall times because we were kept extremely busy, but

around 2.00 p.m. I heard a message on my radio to the effect that fans

were on their way from the Wadsley Bridge railway station.     Sometime later

they arrived escorted by police officers.    After these had arrived fans

started arriving in large numbers from all directions and pressure built

up at the turnstiles and started backing-up.    I could see that mounted

officers in front of turnstiles A - G were being trapped.



Inspector Sykes instructed me to go towards the A - G turnstiles to try

and assist in relieving the pressure.    I asked some of the officers around

me to follow me.    I eventually got to the perimeter gates which are in

front of the turnstiles and the pressure was great.      I would guess the

time to be 2.30 p.m.



When I got to the double gates Police Constable 1834 Scholey from another

Serial was with me.    A short time after this, with the assistance of the

mounted section, we struggled to close the gates to alleviate pressure on

the turnstiles where fans were crying out.     We eventually got the gates

closed and Police Constable Scholey dropped the bolt on      the base onhis

side of the gate.     We remained on the turnstile side of   the gate and the

mounted section were on the road side of the gate preventing fans from

going through the gates.     The remarkable thing was that we had created

space by closing the gates but the fans were still pressing      towards the

 turnstiles and would not come back towards the gates.



After what appeared to be a few minutes, the crowd forced their way past

 the horses and pushed the gates with such force that I had to move with




                                                          Continued       /5

the gates to prevent injury to my ankles.   Police Constable Scholey later

pointed out that the bolt in the base of the gate had buckled with the

pressure.



I maintained my position at the gates but had been forced towards the

river fence.   At one stage there was a surge and during the surge I was

kicked by a Police horse on the rear of my left knee which left me in

considerable pain (my leg bruised badly in the following 24 hours).



In the last hour the mood of the fans had changed considerably, some

became very abusive and it was obvious that many had been drinking

heavily.    Some were that abusive that under normal circumstances they

would have been arrested.



During the period I was at the perimeter gates I saw people climbing over

the high wall into the ground at the side of Gate 'B'.



Shortly before 3.00 p.m. I saw that Gate 'C' was opened and fans started

to enter by the gate and a short time later gate 'B ' opened for a brief

period and then closed.



Pressure around the turnstiles started to be relieved to such an extent

that I started to make my way back towards the road, because in the second

phase my Serial was to remain outside the ground until halftime.     I still

had considerable pain in my leg from the horse kick which restricted

movement.

Although I had a personal radio, which had worked alright when I first

started duty, it appeared to deteriorate, together with the fact that I

had difficulty in hearing it due to being surrounded by noisy fans for

most of the time.




I walked back towards gate 'A' and met up with a few officers of my Serial

and almost imnediately I heard a radio message requesting officers to go

onto the pitch because the Liverpool fans were climbing onto it. I

followed the other officers through Gate 'A' to the north stand and

entered the ground through the first gangway.   When I got onto the pitch I

saw a large number of officers in front of the Leppings Lane fence pulling

at the fence.   I also saw the gate open to the centre north enclosure.       It

was apparent that a number of people were injured and that it was not a

'pitch invasion'.



Fans started coming onto the pitch, obviously injured although some of

them not seriously.   They sat on the grass at the side of the track.     I

requested officers to move them further onto the pitch in order that

officers could work on the more seriously injured.



It became clear that there were many casualties and when I saw a South

Yorkshire Ambulance in front of the kop I went to it and asked the crew to

ask them to contact their Control for more ambulances, if it had not been

done already.   The reason I did this was because our radio appeared

blocked.




                                                Continued...... /7

I then returned to the area to the right hand side of the goalmouth when

facing Leppings Lane.    At one stage a young doctor came up to me and asked

where he could help.     I took hold of his arm and led him through the fans

who had   cane onto the pitch to the rear of the goal net where Police and

fans were working on a number of casualties.     I shouted to them that I had

a doctor and who required help.    An officer shouted 'over here' and the

doctor went to him and assisted.    As I turned round I assisted in placing

a fan onto a make-shift stretcher who was obviously dead and he was taken

towards the gymnasium.



I remained on the pitch until it was cleared.

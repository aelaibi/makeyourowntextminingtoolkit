             m ini- b u s e s    carrying      Notts.       Forest       supporters.

             In company w i t h PC 66 0 Dexter,                    PC 2 4 0 Waldron,            PC 84 Hunt,            DC

             During     duty on R a w s o n Spring              Road,        it was      evident      that a large             number

             of Notts.          Forest   fans had been             consuming alcohol                 en    route    to

             S heffield.          Many   fans were          dis p o s i n g    consumed        cans       of alcohol         and of

             the    ones    I spoke      to     it was      evident          that    they were        under      the     i n f luence

             of alcohol.           Owing      to the d i s tance             from     the   ground,        the   number        of

             fans    involved,        and     the d e p l e t i o n    in m a n p o w e r    that w o u l d have            resulted

             if arrests          were made,        no such a c t i o n was             taken.

             1500 — To C l a y w h e e l s Lane           in company w i t h PS Taylor,                     Inspector          Newey

             and above          named,   in order         to take        refreshments.

             Just after          kick-off      whilst       crossing P e n i s t o n e         Road       towards      the     ground

             we were       stop p e d by a S u p e r i n t e n d e n t        (believed S u p e r i n t e n d e n t         Chapman)

who was      having      problems         identifying           the    content       of    radio

transmission.            Then     directed          into ground,          to what was            b e l i e v e d to be

a public      disorder        sit ua t i o n .

Arrived      into gr o u n d at          ’S p i o n Kop'      end.      There was          obvi o u s     disruption

at the Liv e r p o o l       supp o r t e r s     end -     'West S t a n d ’ .       On nearing             the

stand,     I noticed an officer a p p a r e n t l y                    strug g l i n g     w ith a middle a ged

gent.      Believing         that    the       officer was a t t e m p t i n g        to effect          an

arrest,       I went      to assist            him.      I took hold of the man's                      right arm

and the other         officer        (not known to me)                 told me       that    "It was           alright,

he'd just        had a    rough time            corning out         of there"        (refering          to     the

m i d d l e - a g e d man a n d the West Stand).                    I asked      if the offi c e r             was

alright and        I then       rejoin ed PC 660 Dexter.                      Still       thinking       that        it

was a     ’pitch    i n v a s i o n ”.     We a p p r o a c h e d     the West Stand.                 .1 saw

officers      climbing        onto       the    fence,      but     I could not make              out what           they

were    doing.      I was       instr u c t e d       by a S e r g e a n t    (not    known       to me)        to form

a    cordon across       the     pitch.           I saw a Liverpool             sup p o r t e r       run the        full

length of the         pitch and stand                 in the      goal m o u t h at        the    ’S p i o n K o p ’

•end, making       ’V ’ sign gesture               tx> the Notts.            Forest       supporters.

Myself     and PC Dexter and other                     officers       formed a passive                 cordon

a cross    the    pitch.       At this          time     I had not seen an y bodies,                     or other

persons     other     than      ’walk i n g w o u n d e d ’ .

It was only w hen            s tretchers          passed me,          carrying       corpses,          that     I

realised the        severity         of the        situation.

On    realising     this,      a n d after         having      sufferred         considerable            verbal

abuse     from   d i s t r e s s e d and       i n t o x i c a t e d L i verpool     supporters.             I decided

that    I was    serving        no useful          purpose        in my      p o s ition at       that       time.

Myself and PC Dexter m o v e d                  forward      towards         the West       Stand       to assist

the    injured.

We a s s i s t e d a m a n    lying       on the       floor,       having     spasms.           We    stayed with

away.

B y the time we          reached the             p e rimeter      fence,        people were f i l t e r i n g             out

of the gates.            Our      concern was           to the N o r t h        side of the West Stand.

I did not see any              corpses          carried from that               side of the stand.

I a t t e m p t e d to   clear       the ground           in order       to     give a c c e s s to       the

A m b u l a n c e Service,        who    had not a r r i v e d        until      that      time.

Many fans were           eager       to help but were              not      sure what        to do.        Man y were

wan d e r i n g a i mlessly,         and others          were     looking       for     lost      r e l atives and

friends.

A    large number        of the woo d e n a d v e r t i s i n g          boards       had been         c o l lected by

the    fans and they were                strewed a r o u n d       the goal         m o u t h area.

I directed a number                 of the fans          to    clear     them out          of the way,          to

place    them near         the      goals,       and then to stand to                 one    side      to await a

call    for a s s i s t a n c e     from us,          sh o u l d we need      it,     at    the    same    time,

thanking      them for         their          help,   already      given.

Ambulances        star t e d      to arrive.

I can remember a fight                   starting        in the       corner      of the S o u t h / W e s t

Stands,     apparently            b e t w e e n memJjers       of the Liv e r p o o l        s upporters.             I

ran towards        this,       but      before        I arrived       the     s i t u a t i o n had been

contr o l l e d by other            officers          present.

I was    instr u c t e d    by      Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t    Nesbit to form a cordon on

the    centre     line,     in      order       to    clear    the pitch and          restore       order.

At    no time,     did     I have        contact w i t h        corpses.

E ven at the       time     of being a s k e d           by Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Ne s b i t         to

form a cordon,           I had no             idea of the       extent        of the       injuries/

fatalities,        or the         reasons        behind       them,      I had seen a bout              si:-; corpses

being    carried,        I had not             seen m any      badly     injured        persons,        the     or.es I

had seen a p p e a r e d       to    be d i s t r e s s e d    rather       than p h y s i c a l l y    injured.

I felt     ill-informed,             unable       to get       involved because              of the mass             of
                                                                      PAGE 4

                                                                      R 103




potential for     a full scale riot was clearly evident.

After   it was    announced that the game had been called off,     andhaving

cleared most of the pitch,      we returned   to Rawson    Spring Road at the

junction with Penistone     Road.   Myself and other officers     assisted     in

clearing traffic.

Eyen at    this   stage a fight broke out between rival supporters and PS

Taylor calmed     the situation as I ran to assist him, (in     companywith DC

Hubbard) the van full of believed Liverpool supporters, were reluctant to

move on.    Yet again under normal circumstances, arrests would have been

made except for the impracticalities of the situation.        We went off duty

at 1930 hours.

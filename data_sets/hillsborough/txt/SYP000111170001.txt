             At 8.30 am on Saturday,           15th April             1989,   I commenced duty at

             Hackenthorpe Police Station.               I was then transported to Hillsborough

             P/dot ball Ground,      arriving at approximately 9.15 am.                          Following a

         /   briefing       in the North Stand at approximately 10.00 am and a short

             meal break,       I commenced duty in the West Stand.                       I was a member of

             Serial       13, of which PS 2001 Burman was                   in charge.     I took up my point

  !r f       at approximately 11.15 am in company with PC 3088 Coupland at the

             base of the stairway leading to the seated area in the West Stand.

             There are two such stairways and we were working at the one nearest

             to the North Stand.           Our duty was to assist the six stewards also                                   in

             this location.          Their function was to check the tickets of those

             entering the seated area via the stairway and tear the                                   corner off          i,he

             ticket to prevent         it being thrown down and re--used                       by those with

             standing tickets only.

             At 12 mid-day the turnstiles were opened and from that point onwards

             there was a steady influx of fans throughout the afternoon.                                          All

He ordered officers         in-to the pen to pull free the trapped and

injured.     Several      officers,    including P C ’s 28 Drewi t t , 1335

Fairclough 2980 Wright,           and 2818 Marshall    entered the pen and

immediately began to pass bodies through the gate.                Myself and others

formed a line on the opposite side of the fence and passed the bodies

onto the pitch.        During this process there was a pause in the flow of

bodies coming through the gate, at which point I walked onto the

pitch and began to render first aid to a man who had just been passed

through.     He was aged approximately 23 years with dark hair and dark

moustache.       He was purple       in the face and his eyes were open,

bloodshot and glazed.             1 listened to his   chest for a heartbeat and as

1 did so I was joined by a St. J o h n ’s ambulanceman who told me to

give mouth to mouth as he rendered cardiac massage.                 I opened the m a n ’s

mouth and blew into him.             I repeated this procedure several         times and

was then joined by another St. J o h n ’s ambulanceman who was carrying a

cylinder of oxygen.          He told me to place; a pipe from the cylinder

into the m a n ’s mouth,      which I did.      The other St. J o h n ’s man

continued to give massage for a short while              longer before he said;

" H e ’s dead,   forget    it.”

I closed the m a n ’s eyes and walked back toward the             chain of officers

passing bodies from the open gate.              I joined the end of the line and

was   passed the body of an elderly man, aged about 30 years.                   1

carried the body to the pitch and was about to render first aid when

X was joined by a man in civilian clothing who stated he was a D o c t o r .

He looked at the body and told me the man was dead and not to bother

with him.        I therefore went back towards the fence in order to assist

people over.       !
                   3 y this time the crowd at the front had depleted and

other officers were         in the process of removing the last of the bodies

from the g round.

Together with PC Coupland and other Officers               1 entered the pen and
                                                                              PAGE

  stood at the front of the crowd.        I could see that at the front of

  the terraces beneath the railings there was a large amount of

  clothing,    shoes and spectacles.     The atmosphere at this point was

  extremely tense with members of the crowd shouting obscenities

  towards us.     We remained in the pen for about       10 minutes and then

  returned to the track in an attempt to locate the remainder of my

  serial.     Whilst we were on the pitch there was a message over the

  tannoy from Kenny Dalglish advising the Liverpool          fans to assist the

  Police and remain calm.

  We remained on the track for a further HO minutes after which there

  was a further message given over the tannoy informing the spectators

  that the game was to be abandoned.         At which time the ground was

  cleared.

  Again we tried to    locate the rest of our serial      and we were      joined by

  PS 1288 Payne who    advised us to remain together with other

  Hackenthorpe Officers.     We were then told to gather the details of

  people who had been in the West Stand at the time of the            incident,

  however,    by this time the majority of the      crowd had left and I was

  unable to obtain any details.        I then joined PS 2001 B u r m a n   in the

  seated area of the West Stand.        After searching the stand for

  property we returned to the North Stand for a de -b r ie f .        We were

  stood down shortly afterwards.

  I have a total of    four years service,    during which time I have worked

  numerous football    matches at Hillsborough and I am familiar           with most

  duties in particular those connected with the West Stand and Kop.



REPORT
                   INCIDENT AT HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND,
                   SATURDAY 15th APRIL 1989 .



I am Police Constable 2-592 Richard Shimwell, currently serving at Hackenthorpe Police
Station, Sheffield.
At 8.30am on Saturday 15th April 1989, I commenced duty at Hackenthorpe Police Station.
I was then transported to Hillsborough football ground, arriving at approx 9»l5am.
Following a briefing in the North Stand at approx 10.00am, and a short meal break, I
commenced duty in the West Stand. I v/as a member of serial 13, of which P.S.2001 Burraan
was in charge. I took up my point at approx 11.15am, incompany with P.O. 3088 Coupland, at
the base of the stairway leading to the seated area in the West Stand. There are two such
stairways and we were working at the one nearest to the North Stand. Our duty v/as to assist
the six stewards also in this location. Their function was to check the tickets of those
entering the seated area via the stairway and tear the corner off the ticket to prevent it
being thrown down and reused by those with standing tickets only. At 12 midday the turnstiles
\fsre opened and from that point onwards there v^as a steady influx of fans throughout the
afternoon. All tickets were checked by the stewards a n d admission gained only by those in
possession of a ticket for the seated area. In addition to assisting the stewards v*/e were
also instructed to prevent anyone coming dovm the stairway prior to kick off. This v/e had
to do on a number of occassions, although all those advised were receptive and agreeable.
The volume of spectators entering the ground remained steady and controlled until about
2 .30pm when there was an apparent increase in the number of fans entering the seated area
via the stairway. At this point I noticed that many of the fans v/ere rowdy although none
were particularly troublesome. At about 2.50pm there was a surge of fans pushing their way.
onto the stairway, many of whonu had tickets for other areas of the ground or no tickets
at all. As the stewards attempted to direct these people to the correct area, or indeed
 refuse entry, the crowd behind grew rapidly and began to push forward. As a result, the
 stewards were forced against the stairway as the crowd pushed passed. Myself and P.O.
 Coupland went to their assistance and informed the crowd'to stop pushing so that the
 stewards could effectively check the tickets. However this was to no avail and the crowd
 continued to push passed and by the sheer weight and number we were unable to offer any
 resistance. At this point I advised the stewards to stand back and let the crowd enter.
As the surge began to diminish I received a radio message requesting ''All officers onto
 the perimeter track”.      . I immediately ran round to the rear of the west stand toward the
Police control box. As we entered the terraced area beneath the control box I saw a woman
 lying on the floor with a man crouched over her holding her head. Myself and P.C. Coupland
 v/ent over and I could see that the romo.n v/as gasping for air, vomitting and obviously
 having great difficulty in breathing, -e immediately rendered first aid, placing the woman
 in the recovery position and a St Johns ambulance member v/as requested by another officer
 who had also come to the womans assistance. This arrived a short time later and the woman
 v/as left in her care- '!e then entered the perimeter track via the south stand and I
 immediately saw that the players had left the pitch and a number of people were climbing
 over the fence behind the wets stand goal mouth. My initial thoughts were that the ’       pitch
 was being invaded by the Liverpool fans and hence the match had been interrupted for this
 reason. I therefore v/ent towards the goal mouth with the intention of assisting with
 crowd control. I climbed onto the small wall at the base of the railings and shouted to the
 crowd to stop pushing because I could now see that people at the front were being crushed
 a g a i n s t the fence. I stilld i d not realise that anyone was injured and continued to shout
 at the croitfd. A man at the front then shouted " Theyre dying in here.1    '', and he indicated
 tov/ardthe ground. I looked down and I imnediatley saw that beneath the crowd at the front
 of the nen, were bodies onwhich they were standing. I stood back onto the pitch in
 dismay and told P.C. Coupland what I had seen. I then got back onto the wall and began
 assisting members of the crowd over the fence. I could see more and more bodies at the base
 of the railings most of whom were motionless and appeared dead. On the opposite side of
 the fence from where I v/as standing there v/as a man who v/as facing tov/ards the crowd.' He
 a p p e a r e d to be uninjured and I could see that at his feet was a young girl who was purple
 in the face and laying on the floor. I prodded the man the man in order to attract his
 attention and shouted to him to pass the girl over to me. However, he appeared oblivious
 to my presence and was obviously in a state of shock. Again I climbed dovm fro.' the lence
 and walked towards the small emergency gate behind the goal mouth. This v/as open and as
.and as. I approached, I was met by Chief Superintendent Ilesbit. He ordered officers into
 the. pen to pull free the trapped and injured. Several officers, including P.C's 28
Drewitt, 1535 Fairclough 2980 Wright and W7;8l8 liarshall entered thepen and iiamediately
 began to pass bodies through the gate. Myself and others formed .a line on the opposite
 side of the fence and passed the bodies onto the pitch. During this process there was
 a pause in the flow of bodies coming through the gate, at which point I walked ohto the
■pitch and began to render first aid to a man who had just been passed through. He was
 aged approximately 25 years with -dark hair and dark moustache. He' was purple in the face
 and his eyes were open, bloodshot and glased. I listened to his chest for a heartbeat and
 as I did so I was 'joined by a St. Johns ambulanceman v/ho told me to give mouth to mouth
 as he rendered' cardiac massage. I opened the mans mouth and blew into'him. I repeated
 this proceedure several times and was then joined by another St.Johns ambulanceman who
 was carrying a cylinder of oxygen. He told me to place a pipe from the cylinder into
 the mans mouth, which.I did. The other St.Johns man continued to give massage for a short
 while longer before lie said,- -:’He’s dead, forget it." I ,closed the mans eyes and walked
 back toward the chain of officers passing bodies from the open -gate. I joined the end of
 the line and was passed the body of an elderly man ,aged about 50 years. I carried the
 body to the pitch and was about to render first aid when I was.pjoined by a man in
-civilian clothing who stated he was a Doctor. He looked' at the body and told me the man ..
 was dead and not to bother with .hira. I therefore went back towards the fence in order to ,
 assist people over. By this time the. crowd at the front had depleted and other officers
 were in the process of removing the last of the bodies from the ground. Together with       .
 P.C. Coupland and other officers I entered the pen and stood at the front of the crowd.
 I could see that at the front of the terraces beneath the railings there was a large
 amount of clothing, shoes and spectacles. The atmosphere at thin point was extremely
 tense with members of the ’crowd shouting obseenities towards us. -We--remained in the pen
 for about 10 minutes and then returned to the track in an attempt to locate the remainder
 of my serial..Whilst we were on thepitch-there was a message over.the tanrioy from Kenny
 Dalguish advising the Liverpool fans to assist the Police and remain calm. ,?e remained on

 were then told to gather the details of people who had been in the irest stand at the time
 of the incident .however,.: by this time the majority of the crowd had left and I sms Unable..
 to obtain any details. I then joined PS 2001 Burman in the seated area of the West stand.
 After searching the stand for property we -returned to the north stand for a de-brief. We
 were stood down shortly afterwards. -

I have a total of four years service, during which.‘time I have worked numerous football
matches at/-ffi..llsborough and I am familiar with most duties in particular those connected

I attach a draft letter an d V'covering
                              covering submission, following on from
Tuesday's meeting with South Yorkshire. South Yorkshire would not
accept the proposed special payment outright, nor reject it, but
asked if we could offer improved terms.
2.   Lord Ferrers asked after the meeting whether an improved offer
could be made.    We doubted that it could, particularly without
giving South Yorkshire the opportunity to consider the existing
offer a leisure and with the full Police Authority.
3.   Mr Nagler made the point that it would not be a good time to
go back to the Treasury in the context of our PES discussions. You
may want to put something in the draft submission about this point.
4.   I have drafted the submission for Mr Addison to send but Mr
Nagler may prefer to send it, as a follow-on from his submission on
the special payment. Both divisions have a fairly close interest.
5. It would be helpful to get something to Lord Ferrers by Friday
pm. The longer we leave it, the more risk that West Midlands will
issue a writ. Could I have comments/contributions a.s.a.p.?
6. I hope Fin Div 2 can supply figures on block grant etc and
also say whether they agree with my assertion that South Yorkshire
could not do better under any previous special payments formula, if
the costs reach at least £4 million as expected.    (That is if you
think it is worth putting in. None of the precedents is entirely
apt, since there has not been a special payment to a single service
police authority before - at least the miners' strike payments were
devised when the Metropolitan counties were still in existence
although some of the new authorities have subsequently received
payments under that formula.)

HILLSBOROUGH : COSTS OF INVESTIGATION BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE
At the meeting with South Yorkshire Police Authority Lord Ferrers
undertook to write to them setting out the details of the proposed
special payment. A draft letter to the Chairman of the Authority
is attached for Lord Ferrers' consideration.

2.   Lord Ferrers asked whether a case might be made out to the
Treasury for further limiting South Yorkshire's maximum
contribution (for example from £975,000 to £500,000).

3.   The formulas used for previous special payments have varied
according to circumstances, but none of them, when applied to
anticipated costs of at least £4 million, would limit South
Yorkshire's contribution by any more than the proposed formula.
Some would have been less generous. We would thus be asking the
Treasury for a payment effectively more generous than all previous
ones (including the one for the miners' strike).

4.   When we discussed this with the Treasury, they pointed out
that it would be the first special payment to a police authority
since police grant was increased from 50% to 519- T~ lnoo-on *—
example, South Yorkshire would have received
than under the old rate of grant.
5.   The Treasury could also have pointed to changes in the block
grant position which effectively treat police authorities, in
particular the metropolitan authorities, more favourably than was
the case at the time of the miners' strike. Under the new system,
South Yorkshire received a year on year increase of block grant in
1989-90 of (£i(ob^(6«o]. The contribution by central government to
South Yorkshire's budget in 1989-90 will be a r o u n d % (and single
service authorities, unlike county police forces, are certain of
receiving all the block grant assigned for policing).

6.   The Treasury also pointed out that assistance provided to
local authorities as a result of the 1987 hurricane was at 75%
above a penny rate threshold. We pressed in South Yorkshire's case
for a more generous payment on the grounds that police authorities
face more uncertainties over possible large-scale demands and that
the single service authorities have fewer resources with which to
cushion themselves than do local authorities.

7.   The Treasury accepted the case but would be very unwilling    to
concede any further ground. They would say that with a budget      of
£85 million and a contingency fund of £1 million plus reserves     of
nearly £1 million South Yorkshire should be able to absorb costs   of
up to £975,000.

8.   There is also a claim for a special payment from Kent Police
Authority under consideration.   They expect to incur £5.1 million
additional costs on policing the P and O ferries dispute and their
lp rate produce is £2.034 million.    So far Kent have not pursued
their claim vociferously (in part because they probably anticipate
a favourable outcome) but they are unlikely to take it quietly if
they are refused a special payment once South Yorkshire are known
to have received one. Our chances of doing something for Kent are
likely to be reduced if we squeeze the Treasury for more for South
Yorkshire.

9.   As I said after the meeting with South Yorkshire, I believe
that a number of the representatives at the meeting were favourably
impressed by the offer and there is a reasonable hope that, on the
full Police Authority, their views will carry the day.
10. When we made the offer we were aware of the main points which
South Yorkshire put to us at the meeting. I believe that a payment
which will effectively apportion the costs some 23 to 20% to South
Yorkshire and some 77% to 80% to Central Government (with Central
Government paying an even higher percentage if costs were to go
above £5 million) does take account of South Yorkshire's position
and that there is a good case for putting it as it stands to the
full Police Authority for consideration.

                       HILLSBOROUGH     COST OF INVESTIGATION BY WEST MIDLANDS
                       POLICE

                       I promised to write to you following our recent meeting
                       on this subject.   I would like to say that I very much
                       enjoyed meeting you and the other members of your Police
                       Authority.   I am only sorry that it should have been
                       occasioned by the distressing events at Hillsborough.
                       May I again express my sympathy for all of you at this
                       difficult time.

                       2.   I was very grateful for the clear and courteous way
                       in which you explained your Authority's position to me.

                       3.   As I understand the position, you accept that the
                       Chief Constable of South Yorkshire initially decided that
                       another force should be called in to investigate the
                       events at Hillsborough because it was desirable that the
                       investigation should be seen to be independent of South
                       Yorkshire police.


       H.O. EST. 112
SB3C                                                                        35688 9.85 XNW
4.   You also take the view, as I understand it, that
when it was subsequently decided to establish the enquiry
under Lord Justice Taylor and to place the results of the
investigation at the service of that enquiry, this so
changed the character of the investigation, and its
scope, that as a matter of principle the South Yorkshire
Police Authority should no longer be expected to bear the
costs.

5.   You also made the point that the expected scale of
costs could be such as seriously to threaten the
efficiency of the South Yorkshire police force and could
not have been absorbed within the Authority's own
resources.

6. As I explained at the meeting, the Home Secretary
accepts that, because of the scale of the investigation
and its unexpected nature, the likely costs could not be
absorbed by South Yorkshire within the usual police
funding arrangements without serious detriment to the
efficiency of the force.

7.   He also recognises that, as a result of the decision
to make the results of the investigation directly
available to Lord Justice Taylor, it has been widened to
cover aspects which are specifically serving the purpose
of the enquiry.

8. Nevertheless it remains the case that much of the
investigation will be concerned with the policing of
events on the day, a matter which is inescapably the
concern of the South Yorkshire police.

9.   Taking all these consideratons into account, the
Government is prepared to offer South Yorkshire Police
Authority a special payment towards the costs of the
investigation.  This would apply to costs incurred by
South Yorkshire Police Authority in reimbursing
additional costs incurred by West Midlands Police as a
result of the investigation.     (By additional costs we
mean costs such as overtime, travel, subsistence and
accommodation of personnel directly involved in the
investigation, together with consequential overtime costs
incurred as a result of the need to provide cover for the
officers assigned to the investigation.)

10. The level of assistance which we are prepared to
offer in this case would be for the Government to meet
90% of all costs once these reached the product of a lp
rate (which we understand would be around £1.3 million).
Moreover a limit would be placed on the total amount
which South Yorkshire Police Authority would have to
contribute.      Whatever the total costs of the
investigations, South Yorkshire would have to contribute
no more than the product of a 3/4p rate, which we
calculate would be about £975,000.

11. Special payments have previously been made in only a
small number of cases.    Government already contributes
substantially to police expenditure through police grant
and block grant.       In South Yorkshire's case the
contribution amounts to some [ "Vs*/*    ] of the Police
Authority's budget.

12. This would be the first special payment provided
since the increase in police grant from 50% to 51% which
was intended in part to allow police authorities greater
scope to cushion unexpected expenditure.

13. There is no pre-determined formula for special
payments.   In deciding to adopt the formula used in the
miners' strike we were taking account of the particular
circumstances of this case.

14. I have fully considered the points you made to me at
the meeting.   I believe that the terms of the offer
recognise South Yorkshire's position and the fact that
the investigation is contributing to the enquiry by Lord
Justice Taylor as well as being of relevance to South
Yorkshire Police. No more than £975,000 would need to be
contributed by the Authority whatever the costs.      On
current estimates, the costs may reach £4 to £5 million.
At that level of costs the authority would be
contributing between 23% and 20% of the total costs, and
the Government between 77% to 80%.

15. If you agree to proceed on these terms, we would
quickly put in hand arrangements to cover payments.
Also, my officials would be happy to discuss with yours
any queries they may have about the details of what would
qualify for payment.

available for LA's (especially if process continues to
entail arbitrary top-down total set in advance of
assessment of service needs).


Because they will now be in the same PES basket,
Treasury may press for trade-offs between specific
grant bids and direct Home Office spending (eg
prisons).


We still do not know whether the figures to be included
for years 2 and 3 will have to be realistic: at
present, the service figures for those years published
in the PEWP simply uprate the first year’s totals by a
standard inflation factor, irrespective of even
announced volume plans.


Where grants are not already cash limited, Treasury may
seek conditions which have a similar effect to a cash
limit (that any overspending on grant has to be met by
offsetting savings from other HO Votes/PES provisions).

Where grants are cash limited but we do not control
underlying spending, problem could arise if spending
exceeds amount assumed in grant total: could be an
increasing gap, which results in real rate of grant
falling below the desired percentage - may put pressure
on us to take other strategic controls over the
services (pay and manpower).

calculation will not be necessary. The baseline
will be in terms of credit approvals and that will
be the currency of PES bids.

Credit approvals will be net of specific grant
which from 1990 will be paid as lump sums towards
the cost of capital spending and not as a
continuing contribution towards annual loan
charges.

Local authorities will be free to use revenue
contributions to finance additional capital
expenditure. This is not as generous as it may
seem. The accountability inherent in the community
charge is expected to be an effective brake on
capital spending financed from this source.
Revenue contributions may be used immediately or
carried forward to future years.


Local authorities will also be able to use part of
the cash proceeds from the disposal of assets for
capital investment. The Government consider that
initially up to 25 per cent of the proceeds from
the sale of council houses and flats and up to 50
per cent of other capital receipts could, at the
authorities' discretion, be available for new
capital investment. The remainder would be applied
to debt redemption or set aside to meet future
credit liabilities. This is more restrictive than
at present where, over time, all receipts could be
used for capital spending.


In distributing credit approvals the Government
will be able to take account of the level of cash
backed useable receipts held by each authority.
This cannot be done at present. This will enable
resources to be targeted more efficiently than at
present. The mechanism for doing so will be known
as Annual Capital Guidelines or ACGs for short

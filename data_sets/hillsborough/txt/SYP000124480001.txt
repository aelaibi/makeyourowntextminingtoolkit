 YES. WHEN I FIRST ENTERED AND SAW PEOPLE GETTING OUT I SAW POLICEMEN PUSHING
                                                                                  /           .
 THEM BACK INTO THE CROWD. I COULDN'T IDENTIFY ANY OF THE POLICEMEhK IF THE

 GATES HAD HAVE BEEN OPENED QUICKER IT MAY HAVE STOPPED IT.

 G5G

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 3.35PM (1535).

 Q51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER,

 A STEWARD, A LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 NO. I WAS SICKENED BY IT AND JUST WANTED TO GET AWAY FROM IT.




 Q52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO, NOT REALLY.

Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE POLICE SEEMED MORE INTERESTED IN CROWD CONTROL RATHER THAN ASSISTING WITH
                                           e v v r    A~t> \T t i C 5 ^ / C o M   iM
 THE PROBLEM. THERE SEEMED TO BE A LACK OF LEADERSHIP THROUGHOUT-                      '

I ^ N N O T UNDERSTAND WHY SO MANY POLICEMEN WALKED ACROSS THE BITCH AND JUST
I *
STOOD THERE. IT WAS OBVIOUS THERE WASN'T GOING TO BE TROUBLE/.

 Q53A

 DID YOU GO TO THE SAME MATCH LAST YEAR? IF SO,

 COMPARISON RE POLICING.

 YES. LAST YEAR I EXPERIENCED NO TROUBLE GETTING IN. I WAS ABOUT 10 MINUTES

 EARLIER.

 VITAL> TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?
        «
 1) THERE SEEMED TO BE A LOT OF POLICEMEN STANDING AROUND ON PAVEMENTS ABOUT A

 MILE FROM THE GROUND. NOT ENOUGH NEAR TO THE GROUND TO ASSIST WITH QUEUES AND

 SHOWING PEOPLE WHERE TO GO.

 2) I THINK TICKET ALLOCATION WAS WRONG. LIVERPOOL HAVE CONSIDERABLY MORE

 SUPPORTERS & SHOULD HAVE HAD THE LARGER END. THE POLICE COULD HAVE CORDONED

 THE AREAS OFF EASILY ENOUGH.

 I THOUGHT THAT WAS OUT OF ORDER, PERHAPS THEY DIDN'T REALISE HOW BAD THE

 DIFFICULTY FINDING A QUICK WAY FROM OUR PEN TO THE INJURED PEOPLE         IN PENS

 3 & 4 AND ON THE PITCH.        A STEWARD UNLOCKED A GATE WHICH I PRESUME LET

 THEM ON TO THE PITCH.        I DIDN’T SEE THEM GET ON TO THE PITCH.

 A LINE* OF POLICE (ABOUT SO) FORMED UP BEHIND HIM IN CASE PEOPLE IGNORED HIM.

 INJURED WOMAN BEHIND THE WEST STAND.      THIS WAS SHORTLY AFTER THE MATCH HAD

 BEEN STOPPED.      THIS WOMAN WAS BEING GIVEN FIRST AID BY A WOMAN POLICE

 SOME SORT OF PITCH INVASION OR RIOT, SOME HAD DOGS AS WELL. / F      THEY HAD GONE

 DOWN TO THE TERRACES AND HELPED GET PEOPLE OUT     AND HELPED/WITH THE FIRST AID

          WOULD HAVE BEEN DOING SOMETHING USEFUL INSTEAD OF REAVING IT TO THE

 FANS. THERE WERE SOME POLICE HELPING BUT THE FANS OUTNUMBERED THEM.


Q2Q

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 AT THE RAILWAY STATION, THE ORGANISATION WAS VERY GOOD.      THE POLICE GOT

 EVERYOBDY ONTO THE BUSES WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS.        IF THE ORGANISATION HAD BEEN

 THE SAME OUTSIDE THE GROUND, CHECKING TICKETS AND FILTERING PEOPLE THROUGH

 T ^ U d S THE TURNSTILES IT WOULDN5T HAVE HAPPENED.

 THE DESIGN OF THE GROUND WAS ALSO BAD.     ONCE PEOPLE WERE IN THE TERRACES

 THEY COULDN’T GET OUT BECAUSE THE FENCES COMPLETLY SURROUNDED THEM.

 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF THEY HAD HAD MORE LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENTS.

 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER LETTING FANS KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING.       IT ALSO

 TOOK A LONG TIME FOR THE AMBULANCES TO GET THROUGH.

    OUT, POLICE OFFICERS WERE STANDING AROUND BUT IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO

    I^MUCH.        I THINK THE LINE OF OFFICERS ACROSS THE PITCH WAS REQUIRED BECAUSE

    I SAW LIVERPOOL FANS RUN DOWN TO THE FOREST FANS iN RESPONSE TO             THE ABUSE

    HURLED AT THEM.        THE LINE PREVENTED A SITUATION DEVELOPING ANY WORSE THAN

    THE ONE ALREADY GIVEN,

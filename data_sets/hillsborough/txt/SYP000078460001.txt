Dated                 100589                                                                  Si gned


           At 8.30am    (0830)    on Saturday,   15 April    1989 (150489)     I reported on

           duty at Main St Police Station for transportation to Hillsborough

           FootbalJ: Ground.      I was allocated to Serial 36 and was responsible to
                     A
           PS £ # 2 .9 FRANCE.

           Briefing at the ground was attended and upon its conclusion we made

           our way to Wadsley Bridge Ra/lway Station to await the supporters

           train which was due to ar/ive at 2pm (1400), we were therefore                      in situ

           at this location for approximately 11.15am             (1115)   until the t r a i n ’s

           arrival.     While at this location I noticed numerous people who were

           obviously football       supporters heading up the hill         passed us in search

           of public houses, which were opening and serving.                The pubs we had

           passed on our way to our point were all shuttered and appeared closed.

           As the day progressed more and more fans were seen to be walking with
                                                                           PAGE    2
                                                                           S2272

cans of lager and beer and just up the road from the railway station

on a forecourt to industrial        premises a large grouffof    people,

probably around 1000, were sat on the grass/^erge with cans oY

al cohol. The train arrived around 1/u m>mites early, and when the fans

alighted a number were searched by our serial.            These fans were well

behaved and posed no problems.        They appeared sober and acted in an

orderly manner.      We escorted the fans down to the football ground and

upon reaching the ground,       the fans made their way to the turnstiles.

Our arrival at the gates of the ground on Leppings Ln wjxuld^have been

no later than. 2. 15pm ( 14 15) .

At this time there was a number of people milling around but no real

problem.    The majority were drinking from I j / q e r   or beer cans and a

number were sat on surrounding walls dr i/fki n g .       Attempts by officers

were made to move these prople from tWe walls but it was a no win

situation as fast as one group was/fnoved another          came along to take

their place.

At ar ou nd 2. 3 5 pm (1435)   I noV&d that from a steady stream of people of

which    wa were able to easily control into keeping them into a limited

area of tr^e pavement ^n d road,     things were getting very c rowded.        I

recall   looking fpaln the grounds entrance on Leppings Ln further up the

lane from the direction we hajL-escorted the fans and seeing a solid

block of people heading/towards us.

I remember an Inspe<^£or SYKES coming over towards myself a n d PC >#183
 11 M O
TRECK who I was s'Cood next to and telling us the road was bef'hg closed

off to trfaffi^C     It was inevitable this was going to have to be done

as people were walking about all over the road in swarms,           everyone

appeared to be drinking,        in my opinion it was only a small miniority

who were not.

We should have gone for meal to Cl ay wh ee 1s Ln for 3pm (1500) but due

to the large amount of people arriving at this late time and the chaos
                                                                             PAGE        3
                                                                             S2272

we stayed in situ.

At 2.50pm people were panicking outside the gate.         They were asking

for directions to their stand.    It had become obvious to them they had

left it too late and were not not going to see kick off.

A Superintendent who I now believe to be M r . MARSHALL instructed

m yself and PC TRCEK to stand between the horses and to not allow

fans to go between the horses.    It was obviously an attempt at keeping

the fans in order and stop them pushing      in their panic to get in to

the ground, whilst trying to achieve this and trying to stop the fans

getting through,   the surge of people became so strong that          I was

lifted from my feet and moved along with he crowd, amazingly enough

this also seemed to happen to the Police horse I was next to.                Fans

were totally ignoring   requests to stop pushing forward and to move

orderly around the cordon we had made,      they were scrambling through

horses legs and generally taking every advantage        in a situation when

the Police were outnumbered and little could be done by way of

correction.

Inspector Ei^LIS I/femember was sat on top of a Land Rover and shouting

through a ioud^ailer for fans to stop pushing forward.           This appeared

to have   livtle effect on the fans. On turning towards the tupifstiles

on Leppings Ln I saw one mass of people,      it was at tjrfis'* j^tTage I

realised things were going very quickly downhill.         kjp^ I n s p e c t o r whose

identity I do not know was sat astride a wall by the turnstiles and

was pulling   people over the wall who were     obviously in danager of

being crushed outside the ground.    I recall making      comment

to PC TRCEK   at this time that there was going to be a tragedy.                It

was chaos but still fans continued pushing forwards it was as if they

were   ignorant as to what was occurring.     I was stood looking on

helplessly trying to hold the rear end of the fans back and shouting

at people standing around the entrance gates to move if they h a d n ’t

                                                                                                     S2272

                    got a ticket.    The fans appeared beligerant     to requests made of             them

                    and just sauntered around.

                    It was at this time I heard a radio message requesting all available

                    Police personnel onto the pitch.          Ihave no recollection of how            I got

                    into the ground through the crowd but I remember waiting a few seconds

                    once in the ground to be let onto the pitch I assume by a steward.

                    Once on the pitch I remember thinking       it was a pitch invasion we were

                    dealing with as I had heard no further Police radio message.                 I

                    approached one youth and in my ignorance told him to return to the

                    stand,   he told me " It’s hell    in there."   I moved/fbrther towards the

           ^        fence and saw piles of people thrown up against the fence.                 They all

                    appeared mangled together.        Officers were oetting up onto the top to

                    the fence and hauling people over.        I thpTi began recovering these

                    bodies once over the    fence and pulling/them onto the pitch and

                    assisting wherever necessary, \giVing/heart massage and mouth to m o u t h .

                    I worked on several bodies a n d \sumjnoned the makeshift advertising

                    boards fans were using as stretchers.

                    The majority of the casualties I had dealings with were already dead,

                    this has been thought with hindsight of the tragedy but at the time

                    anyone who appeared to have any life in them,           I worked on.       I remember

                    feeling helpless when more oxygen bottles were needed and a St. Johns

                    Ambulance woman told me there was no more.

                  •t The only body I spent most time/*jfith was a male a pproximately 22 years

^                   with sandy/gingery hair and >pale eyelashes and freckles.              I

                  , administered oxygen to hj^i whilst an off duty fireman did heart

                    massage.    We thounht Jmere was a flicker of life in him but when put

    v"r>            on a stretcher and carried away we thought differently.            When things

                    finally calmed a little from the initial bustle of getting fans out

                    from behind the fence onto the pitched area I recall fans crying and

                    hysterical and fighting amongst themselves.         I     intervened in no end

            of squabbling between the fans.

            The smell of alcohol was unbelievable     it seemed to hang in the air.

            When all the casualties who were believed to be alive were      removed and

            taken to ambulances,   the atmosphere was electric and looking back this

            was the most fightening.    Both sets of fans seemed to be brewing

            trouble and a line of Police Officers was formed across the pitch.          I

            d o n ’t know whether this is because the Notts.   Forest fans were unaware

            of the tragedy and were of the impression the casualties were victims

            of fans fighting each other or whether it was sheer evilness.

            The difficulties were made doubly worse by not only having to deal

            with the injured but also the fighting and the fear of a pitch

            invasion by Notts. Forest fans.

            In my opinion the tragedy occurred due to the en mass arrival      of fans

            at such a late time.   On their arrival   it was apparent the majority

            had been drinking and in fact had the gall to still be drinking.

            There was no rush until the final moment to get into the ground and

            their priority was to drink as much and as long as possible. My main

            concern is that the people I was trying to help had been the innocent

            victims as they were obviously the early arrivals to be positioned

            where they were.

             At 8.3 0 am           (0830)       on S a t u r d a y   15 April     1989       ( 1 5 0 4 8 9 ),    I com me nc e d a

             provide          tea and         coffee as           required.

4.           Ensure          that all         radios and de-brief                  sheets were      handed    in by

             officers             going off        duty.

At about 2 .00               pm     ( 1 4 0 0 ),   I used my        personal        radio to        inform ground

control        that C la yw h ee l s Ln was full                      of   parked        coaches and there was                    no

room for any more.                       1 received an a c k n o w l e d g e m e n t and             I heard the

control!er           then pass             that    in fo rm at io n to POL           INS S YK ES a dv is i ng any

further        coaches            from Live rpool            to    park on H al i fa x Rd.           That    is the

only     time      I used my             personal      radio        that     day.        At that    time    I can say

c o m m u n i c a t i o ns    were       good.

As the kick-off                   time a p p r o a c h e d    I remember           the volume       of m es sages

being      passed over               the    radio i n c r e a s e d .        I recall        an urgent      request

being      passed to              ’open     t h y gate*      and      I recog ni se d        the voice      to be that

of PO L SUPT MARSHALL,

F ro m   then on Vjiere                    re c ontinuous           t ra n sm i ss i on s    over   the    radio

netwo rk from maSQ^/o f f i c e r s , all w ith a sens e of urge nc y                                  in the i r

voices.          At that           time     I formed an o pi n io n that                  there must       have     been

some     fighting            in the        crowd which            is not unusual            at a football          match.

I then thought                there        had been a pitch                invasion and         it was     not until              I

heard a voice                say, ’There are            people         dyin^g,’ that          I realised that             a

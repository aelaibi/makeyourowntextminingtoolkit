Dated                  180589                                                                         Signed


            On Saturday,           15th.April   1989,    I commenced duty at 0800 am at

            Mexborough Police Station and reported to Doncaster Headquarters for

            0845 am from where we were transported to Hillsborough Football

            Ground arriving at 0945 am.                 We were there briefed by senior officers

            on the forthcoming days proceedings,                and I was assigned to^EhjHjj^^^3cU

            my Sergeant being P ^ i t k e n         and overall     in charge was         Inspector

            Millett.            I was   positioned in company with PC HjUgtfton at the bottom

            of Penistone Road outside the T ra v el 1ers              iblic H o u s e .    My duties

            were to supervise Liverpool Supporters safely down towards the ground

            and make sure they behaved in an orderly manner.                    Whilst at my post

            outside the Travellers Public House,                the Liverpool Supporters were

            behaving      in an orderly manner and seemed to be in good humour,

            although as they past a larger number of them were drinking from cans

            of beer and lager and the occasional                one still had S or 3 unopened

            cans in their hands.              The occasional    supporters walked past me

            smelling strongly of intoxicants and were staggering as they walked.

            At about S.45 pm <1445)             I was called to the Oakes public house which

            is situated next to the Travellers                 public house, as there was some

            kind of a disturbance there.                On this occasion I did not enter the
                                                                        PAGE
                                                                        R450

public house as ths/disturbance had already been sorted out.

At about 2»35 par <1455)     I heard some shouting and banging from down

th® side Of Jshe           public house and I subsequently went to

                        As I looked down this al leyway I con id see a group

of a bout 8~ youth s s hotting :%nd t humping at the exit door of the pub,

@bro*i*of the people approached me claiming that some of the! r friends

we.ri getting             inside the pub.    Other officers also attended

at the scene and eventually we gained access        into .these premises,

where on entering the lounge area inside        I could see broken glass

scattered oyer the floor and a couple of pool        cues snapped in half.

There was no disturbance at this time and from making enquiries with

customers within the public house they stated that it was only a

minor scuffle    in the far corner of the pub.      There were no complaints

made to the police and we subsequently left the premises,          although it

was apparent that Liverpool        supporters were involved.

Immediately after     leaving these premises PS Aitken informed me that

our serial was     required at the Leppings Lane end of the ground and

together with my serial      I attended outside the gates at the Leppings

Lane e n d .

As we arrived at this area there were a large number of supporters

standing around    in the streets waving tickets and saying they had

tickets and wanted to get into the ground.         We were informed by the

Supervisory officer at the scene not to allow anyone else          into the

ground at the present time and to form a cordon across the gates,

which we subsequently did.

About 5 to 10 minutes      later   supporters were walking outof the

ground,   saying that    people were dying   in the ground.    PS Aitken was

then ordered to go into the ground with his serial and we entered the

ground to the area at the rear of the Leppings Lane Stand.           As we

entered into this area I could see supporters running around in a
                                                                               PAGE         3
                                                                      •   ■ '■ FH30.   .•



     confused state and there were about a dozen or so people laid on the

     ground,   some of which were obviously dead.    I then entered the tunnel

vf q in the c e n t r e o f the stand where people and other officers were

     riishi^pi^up and down carrying people oiit of the stand.    I remained i n ,

      (os tunt^&l; area assisting in c 1 earing this area for other emergency           v

     services and assist in g in removing people from the stands     into

     area behind the stands where they could be treated for §ny injuries

     they may have.    By this time this area had become frantic with people

     rushing around not knowing what to do or what was really happening.

     There were a lot of people severely shocked from this incident and I

     found it necessary to comfort some of these people and reassure them.

     After about half an hour most of the injured- bodies were removed

     through this tunnel area and we subsequently formed a cordon at the

     end of the tunnel   to stop supporters from entering back into the

     stand and therefore   leaving more room for emergecny work within the

     stand.

     When all the bodies had been removed from the terraces we again

     formed a cordon in the rear of the stand and assisted in safe

     evacuation of supporters from the ground.      When the ground had been

     cleared we returned to Claywheels Lane where we were stood down and

     obtained transport back to Doncaster Headquarters where I booked off

     duty at 8 pm.    <2000)

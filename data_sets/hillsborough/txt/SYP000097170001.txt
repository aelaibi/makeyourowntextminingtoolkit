EN D OF R E P O R T
At 12-30 pm, Sunday 16 April 1989, together with the PS 454 Chapman, DC      |
            Iand Police Constable I      Iwho was totally unconnected with
Saturday's events but who has a good knowledge of the events and surrounding
areas and who was present to assist in identifying locations as they took
place, I viewed the video tapes. Mrs|        was also present to take notes.

The purpose of the review is effectively to scan fairly quickly and to
identify incidents of apparent significance with reference to the event in
question.

On the first tape to be viewed (which is indexed 14) - which records in some
detail the build up and problems which occurred at the Leppings Lane end of
the ground as well as shots of other parts of the ground - starts at 11.59am.

This video is taken from a static camera mounted on the south/west corner of
the west stand. It gives views to the Leppings Lane turnstiles a. to g. and
one to 16 and a view inside and beyond gates 'A', 'B' and 'C' and into the
roadway of Leppings Lane.

There is nothing significant until circa 1420 when the .review commences and
shots of Leppings Lane end terrace area shows spectator concentration to be
sparse. It shows the continual build up of Liverpool supporters on Leppings
Lane around the turnstiles and their subsequent entry into the ground.

At 14.35*22 a densely packed crowd of at least 3,000 spectators is clearly
seen back from the turnstile area into the main road and officers including
mounted officers are having apparent difficulty in exercising effective
control because of an overspill away from the turnstiles into the south stand
access road of 1,000 or more spectators. A significance of this is that as
pressure mounted on the turnstiles there was no opportunity to relieve that
pressure by overspilling into the service road. The frame at 14.40.51
illustrates this very clearly.

At 14.42.43 spectators seen climbing over turnstiles wall.

At 14.46.42 spectators in significant numbers start climbing over turnstiles
a. to g.

At.. 14.48.12 gate 'C' is opened and spectators move from the service road area
through the gateway into the area on the ground side of the turnstile.

At 14.48.29 two mounted officers are clearly seen by the gate attempting to
control the spectator influx.

By 14.48.59 following the relax of.pressure in the service area it is now seen
that mounted officers have managed to force the crowd back towards the proper
side of the turnstiles. Barriers across the service road on the wrong (south
stand) side of the gate are firmly under police control.

At 14.49.40 a panning shot shows large numbers of spectators still converging
on these turnstiles along Leppings Lane from Middlewood Road (Sheffield end).

At 14.50.05 a second panning shot shows large numbers of spectators arriving
on Leppings Lane from the Penistone Road end and the total number of
spectators amassed outside the turnstiles at this point is estimated in the
region of 3,000/4,000.

At 14.50.29 a fairly large section of the crowd have now come down the service
road up to the barriers, that is across and up against gate ' C ' .
                                        - 2 -


  At 14.52.19 this shows the outer boundary gates adjacent to Leppings Lane
  closed, separating the spectators between those gates at the turnstiles and
  the larger number beyond the gate in Leppings Lane.

  At 14.52.23 gate 'C' is again opened and spectators moving through in large
  numbers.

  At 14.52.39 a mounted officer is visible in the service road outside this gate
  trying to control spectator movement. The service road is now practically
  empty. Huge numbers of spectators are seen in Leppings Lane outside the
  boundary gate. Again we are talking of several thousands of people.

  At 14.52.46 at least four mounted officers are in the service road and the
  pressure again has been removed in the service road area.

   At 14.52.50 there appears to be a breach at the service gates and spectators
   in very large numbers move down the service road and again through gate 'C'
   which is"clearly seen to be open. Mounted officers attempt to maintain
   control but., are soon overwhelmed by the numbers who wallc not run through the
^pgates.

  At 14.53.24 the whole process accelerates. It appears possible that many
  spectators in Leppings Lane at this point became aware of the open gate and
  the opportunity to enter the ground this way. The crowd movement now shifts
  from walking to running towards the gate but in the main on moving through the
  gate reduces to a walk. Many hundreds are now seen entering the ground in
  this way. Once through the gate the crowd is quite orderly almost leisurely
  in terms of its further movement to spectator areas.

  At 14.54.16 a thousand plus spectators are seen densely packed outside the
  turnstiles one to 16, the crowd is surging and the whole situation from their
  point of view must have been one of personal danger. A police officer
  (possibly an inspector or chief inspector) on the turnstile roof is seen using
  a radio and ignoring spectators climbing on to the roof possibly because he
  considers that sensible.

   At 14.55.01 looking out to the barrier gates this shot shows a residual crowd
   of'“2,000 plus, possibly 3,000, still on the outside of the turnstiles
^[extending into Leppings Lane with large numbers still approaching from the
^^Penistone Road end.

  At 14.55.05 the crowd is now solid from gate 'C' along the service road out
  into Leppings Lane and towards Middlewooa Road (Sheffield) and it is estimated
  2,000 people are seen." People are now seen entering through gate 'C' and
  through the turnstiles, possibly at this point unrestricted, in their
  thousands. This is shown continuously up to 14.56.02 when the camera shot
  changes.

  At 14.56.33 this shows the police again achieving more effective control. The
  crowd in the service road is much smaller, mounted officers are across the
  service road and the boundary gate appears to be closed and again under
  control holding clearly several hundreds and possibly a thousand plus
  spectators out in Leppings Lane.

  At 14.57.50 spectators in very large numbers are still entering this same area
  through the service gate, through the turnstiles and by climbing over the top
  of the turnstiles so the area behind the stand on the turnstiles is densely
  packed with a crowd still moving towards the tunnel entrance. It should be
noted that all the shots referred to so far show as the crowd entering through
gate 'C' and turnstiles a. to g., the spectators almost universally are moving
towards the tunnel entrance to the terraces and there is virtually no movement
nor any activity by anyone to direct these same spectators to the south side
of the west stand.

At 14.57.54 this shows the gate separating spectators entering through
turnstiles one to 16 and those through turnstiles a. to g. which is normally
closed and manned by police officers and stewards as open, as far as could be
seen unmanned and large numbers of spectators are moving from the one to 16
area to the rear of the west stand and possibly to the tunnel entrance.

At 15.00.14 this shows that the barrier in the service road has now been
advanced towards Leppings Lane past gate 'C' and entrance through that gate is
now stopped but spectators in large numbers are still moving through the
turnstiles and climbing the surrounding wall. The crowd overall is now
greatly reduced but nevertheless large numbers of spectators still appear to
be approaching the turnstiles from the Midalewood Road (Sheffield) direction.

At 15.02.50 whilst the pressure spectators entering the turnstiles is now much
reduced once through spectators appear to be running towards the tunnel
entrance.

At 15.02.54 the camera changes location to a static camera situated on the
south side inside the ground adjacent to the police control centre focusing on
the Leppings Lane end terrace over pen two. The crowd at this southern end of
the terraces is loosely packed and there is no problem whatsoever.

At i5 .O3 .ll the section of the crowd in pen four is now seen climbing over
the safety barrier onto the pitch (an earlier shot at 15-03.04 shows the
safety gate open).

At 15.03.23 again shows fans climbing over the safety barrier and the safety
gate to be open.

The shots immediately following show fans panicking and large numbers scaling
the safety fence and spilling onto the pitch. Increasing numbers of police
officers are seen on the track assisting to rescue people and an ambulance
also arrives (15-16.00) at this end of the ground.

At 15.21.05‘this shows a 'single spectator climbing the fence after which this
ceases indicating that the pressure of the crowd on the spectator side by this
time was greatly reduced.

At 15.26.08 the camera position moves and we now see the Leppings Lane terrace
from approximately mid south stand position. There are hundreds of spectators
on the pitch, an ambulance is stationary by the safety fence and what is
significant is the relative freedom of movement now on the terraces in pen
three. Pen four is relatively tightly packed.

At 15.27.30 members of the fire service are seen arriving .on the scene.

The review then moves to video tapes taken at ground level by the Underwater
Search Unit using portable video equipment. Four tapes were taken, three o
which were recorded on to one 60 minute working copy, the remaining one re­
recorded onto another working copy.
   The tape VRM 2 shows the crowd overspil from the Leppings Lane terraces and'
   views of the temporary mortuary in the gymnasium at Hillsborough.

   The tape VRM 3, shows views of the Leppings Lane terrace after the ground had
   been cleared.   It clearly shows that the wired safety fence has been
   effectively cut and peeled back, probably to facilitate the release from the
   terraces of members of the crowd. It is not known who achieved this, it may
   have been the fire brigade.

   The same tape later shows a crowd barrier distorted and snapoea.

   The same tape also focuses on a gents wristlet watch on the Leppings Lane
   terrace which is broken and stopped at eight minutes  past three. This is a
   calendar watch which also indicates 15 April.

   On tape VRM 4 this shows clearly views of the Leppings Lane terrace, gates
    A , B and ’C 1, access tunnel and turnstiles. It also shows very clearly
   gate ' C r'as a corrugated concertina type gate. It tends to show the gate is
^^unaamaged and there is no evidence of it having been forced.

  The remaining tape (VRM 1), the last five viewing minutes are shotfrom hand­
  held equipment at the Spion Kop end towards Leppings   Lane terraces. This is
  done at ground level. Section commences with officer stating time as 3 .03 pm
  exactly and views the crowd climbing over the perimeter fence onto the track.
  It pans from right to left clearly showing that emergency gates three, four
  and five are open with police officers in attendance. It also shows that some
  of the crowd are obviously injured and receiving medical attention. Further
  time check of 3-06 pm with comment that game is stopped.

  VHS tape marked 13 - with commentary shown as 1159 to 1435-   This is wrong as
  the commentary runs from 1159 to 1504.

  At 14.33-01 this shows a close-up of the main gate at Leppings Lane end with a
  very large number of densely packed spectators. The scene is calm.

  At 14.59-10 this shows a scene of the Leppings Lane terrace at its northern
  end. There is ample space for spectators with gaps visible on the terraces.

^^At 14.59.54 this shows fans being let in through gate one on to the southern
  end of the Leppings Lane terrace where again there is ample room and gaps on
  the terraces are clearly visible.

  At 15-00.15 a line of spectators can be seen unhurriedly walking along the
  track in front of the Leppings Lane terrace having presumably been let out of
  the terrace at some point and being admitted at gate one.

  At 15-00.41 the crowd in the area of the division line between pens two/three
  are at the back of the terrace and are seen to be apparently surging and some
  fans appear to be climbing over this barrier post but the whole situation is
  very minor.

  At 15-02.21 this shows police officers hurrying from the track in front of the
  south stand towards the middle of Leppings Lane terrace and at 15.02.35 this
  shows many spectators climbing out of the terrace'area onto the pitch.

  At 15.03.34 this shows fans who have left the terrace onto the pitch sitting
  down calmly and the appearance is of a minor pitch invasion. Police officers
  in the area appear fairly unconcerned.

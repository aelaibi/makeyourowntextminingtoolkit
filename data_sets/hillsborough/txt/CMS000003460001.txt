TH E H ILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

You have received a copy o f a letter from the H om e Secretary to the A ttorney General concerning
pressure for a new public enquiry into the Hillsborough disaster. This pressure has com e from
groups associated w ith the families o f the Hillsborough victims - w ho allege there is new evidence
about the time o f death o f their relatives, previously unreleased video footage that casts doubt over
the actions o f the police com m ander at the game etc. - and not from w ithin G overnm ent. T here
is n o criticism o f the safety recom m endations made in the Taylor R eport.

2.        H om e Office officials have concluded that there is insufficient new evidence for another
enquiry, but have recom mended an independent exam ination o f w hat alleged new evidence there
is by a senior legal figure as a way o f allaying public concern. T he H om e Secretary's letter suggests
term s o f reference for such an exam ination.

3.       Y ou have been asked for com m ents on the proposed term s o f reference. As these do not
relate to D N H ’s areas o f responsibility, and as they do not seek to challenge the recom m endations
or findings o f the Taylor R eport, a simple acknow ledgem ent will suffice. A draft reply is attached.

THE HILLSBOROUGH S TA D IU M DISASTER

As you kn o w , I have been considering th e representations w hich have been
made about th e H illsborough Stadium disaster on 15 A pril 1 9 8 9 . The disaster
w as o f course fu lly investigated by th e late Rt Hon Lord Ju stice Taylor, b u t
concern has been raised ab ou t a num ber o f features o f th e case and m aterial
considered by som e to represent new evidence has been brought to our
a tte n tio n . These and related m atters w ere raised in th e Granada Television
docum entary dram a "H illsb o ro u g h " last December.

 M y o fficia ls have th o ro u g h ly examined the alleged ne w evidence and the
 allegations made in th e Granada television program m e and have concluded th a t
there are no grounds fo r establishing a new public enquiry. The m aterial has
also been considered by th e A tto rn e y General's O ffice and th e DPP's O ffice .
 None o f those w h o have examined th e m aterial consider th a t there is evidence
to ju s tify a new public enquiry, a re-opening o f th e inquest, or th e prosecution o f
individuals. But I am certain th a t continuing public concern w ill n o t be allayed
w ith a reassurance fro m th e Home O ffice th a t there is no new evidence. I
therefore propose th a t th e re should be an independent exam ination o f the
alleged new evidence by a senior legal figure - a respected judge (serving or
recently retired), or perhaps a senior Counsel. It w ill be im p o rta n t to ensure th a t
w ho e ve r undertakes th e ta sk is s u ffic ie n tly senior and respected to com m and
public confidence. M y personal preference w o u ld be fo r a judge. The proposed
term s o f reference are:
"To carry o u t an independent exam ination and advise w h e th e r there is new
evidence relating to th e disaster at th e H illsborough Stadium on 15 A pril 1 9 8 9
w h ich provides s u ffic ie n t grounds fo r:

        i.     th e S ecretary o f State fo r th e Home D epartm ent to establish a
                fu rth e r public inquiry;

        ii.    th e Attorney-G eneral to consider applying to the High C ou rt under
                Section 13 o f the Coroners A c t 1 9 8 8 fo r another inquest;

        iii.   The D irector o f Public Prosecutions to consider bringing crim inal
               charges a g a in s t^ n y person;

        iv.    The relevant Chief Police O ffic e r to consider taking disciplinary
               a ction against any police o ffic e r.

Or w he the r there is any other action w h ic h should be taken in th e public
in te re st."

There w ill need to be a public announcem ent o f th e e stablishm ent o f the
independent exam ination. This w ill require careful handling. I am sure th a t th e
announcem ent w ill have to be made in th e House. But I shall w a n t to make sure
th a t th e ground is properly prepared before th e announcem ent is m ade w ith
those outside G overnm ent w ith a close interest in th e H illsborough disaster
including th e H illsborough Family S upport Group.

I should be g ra te fu l fo r th e Lord C hancellor's advice on a suitable fig u re to lead
th e independent exam ination, and fo r y o u r com m ents and those o f copy
recipients on th e proposed term s o f reference by 12 June.

Copies o f th is le tte r go to th e Prime M inister, th e D eputy Prime M inister, th e
Lord C hancellor, th e President o f th e C ouncil, th e M iniste r W ith o u t P ortfolio, the
Secretary o f S ta te fo r National Heritage, th e D irector o f Public Prosecutions and
Sir Robin Butler.

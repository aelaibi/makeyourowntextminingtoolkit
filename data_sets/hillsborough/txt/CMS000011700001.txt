        Dear David

        HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL DISASTER

        Apologies for writing to you on this topic, but having been at the match
        with my 13 year old son I wanted to pass on one or two comments to someone
        and I thought of you!

        First of all, I confirm the press reports about the overcrowding and the
        inadequacies of the police and emergency facilities; the police on the
        pitch from 3.06 pm onwards appeared not to know what they were supposed to
        be doing and the lack of stretchers, etc, and the time it took the two
        ambulances (only two came onto the pitch!) to reach the injured was
        unbelievable.  I also confirm the press reports about the total
        inadequacies of a 'modern' sports stadium - to me the only solution is an
        immediate total ban on standing in existing stadia and an urgent plan to
        build a series of new 'American' style multi-sports stadia on the fringes
        of towns and cities with controlled access, identity cards, ticket checks,
        e t c.

        However, the main point that I can add relates to something which has not
        been mentioned in the press. This is the fact that between 3.06 pm and
        approximately 4.10 pm when we left there was no announcement to the
        spectators about what was happening.  During this period there was a
        continual risk of major violence and confrontation which made me decide to
        leave, not the fact that the match was abandoned, because we were not given
        this information.

        The majority of spectators believed, until at least the time we left (and
        we were amongst the first to leave) that the problem was Liverpool
        suporters trying to climb onto the pitch and disrupt the match; this caused
        continual frustration amongst the Nottingham Forest supporters and a major

riot nearly broke out at approximately 3.30 pm when the Liverpool
supporters charged across the pitch to try to fight the Nottingham Forest
supporters.  The suspicion of Liverpool hooligan problems appeared to be
confirmed to the spectators when the police brought approximately 10 police
dogs onto the pitch to control and contain the Nottingham Forest
supporters, when all that was required was a simple announcement over the
public address system about what was happening.  Total chaos was avoided due
the self-control of the Nottingham Forest supporters, not the actions of
the police or ground authorities.

If the above observations are of any assistance, I would be grateful if you
could pass this letter on to the appropriate person.

Kind regards.

Yours sincerely




Dr D TORDOFF

                LETTER FROM MR                    DATED 22 MAY 1989

                I refer to the above letter dated 22 May 1989 a copy of which I
                received today in Birmingham and have had faxed here.

                The questionnaire to which         refers is the "supporter
                questionnaire" which we have used throughout this inquiry without
                serious complaint. A copy of the questionnaire, which incidentally
                Treasury Solicitors saw at the beginning of the investigation, is
                enclosed.

                On examination of the questionnaire you will see the following as they
                relate to points raised by        |.

                (a)     Of the 54 questions asked only three (numbers 11, 15 and 35) refer
                        to alcohol, fighting or drunkenness.

                (b)     The questionnaire was used to obtain as much information as
                        possible as quickly as possible.  If the witness had a material
                        imput a witness statement using the individual's own words and
                        language would be used.

                (c)     Question 54 was the final catch all questions deliberately
                        designed not to inhibit any person from giving information.

                (d)     I am at a loss to understand how |      |can know that "others
                        were not afforded this opportunity" when referring to a
                        requirement for particular statements to be included.




   PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT
                                   -   2   -




(e)   The final point he refers to is not about intelligence, but about
      the quality of the witness and whether he is likely to be
      "impressive", "average" or "poor".  This was included as a guide
      for Counsel in deciding which witnesses would likely give the best
      accounts.  (NB: Even though many of my officers are very well
      qualified graduate teachers, I would not wish them to make any
      value judgement on any of the witnesses' intelligence levels!)

      Whether there is any intention to re-visit         is currently
      being investigated by Detective Chief Superintendent Foster and I
      will advise you accordingly.

I trust this if of some assistance,    Do you intend to reply, shall I,
or both?

Unless you have any views to the contrary I propose to arrange for one
of my senior officers to make telephone contact with        J initially,
with a view to perhaps seeing him personally to explain the exact
position. This may appear to be a little bit heavy, but we have had so
few criticisms to date that I feel it is appropriate to make sure that
        fully appreciates the integrity of the investigation.

Mr Taylor

Dear Mr Taylor

H IL L SB O R O U G H IN Q U IRY

As a witness to the events at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989,1 was interviewed by officers from
the West Midlands Police Force during the course of their initial investigations into the
circumstances surrounding the tragedy. I would however, wish to respectfully draw to your
attention to certain factors which may serve to skew the complexion of the inquiry - either by
design or oiherw ise - and possibly influence the ultimate outcome.

The supporters' questionnaire, which had been constructed by the West Midlands Police Force
(according to the officers who interviewed, me) wâ€™as obviously defensive in its approach, and also
in the language w hich w as used. For instance, regular reference was made to drunkenness (or
excessive drinking) and also to crowd misbehaviour. Although obviously influencing factors, the
degree and weighting was quite disproportionate. The emphasis, continually placed on these
factors, could "iead" witnesses. Also, the police officers completed the questionnaire using their
English. In my own case I had to ask for particular statements to be included - others were not
afforded this opportunity. Finally, with regards to the questionnaire, the officers were asked to
make a value judgement at the end, which asked whether the witness was, in their opinion, above
average intelligence, average, or below average. I would question whether police constables (tw'o
constables interviewed me), with little or no training in this very delicate and sensitive area of
interviewing, have either the experience or competence to make such a value-laden judgement.

 At the end of this two hour discussion, the officers suggested that other, more senior officers,
 w'ould be returning to take a further statement. To date this has not happened, yet I note that, as
 the inquiry progresses, the opportunities for supporters to present evidence are diminishing.

 Youi's sincerely




 (I have sent a copy of this letter to the West Midlands Police)

                After        the     briefing          I toured               the    area         of        the       ground       with        DC     BLAKE,

                 prior       to     standing          by      within          the     gymnasium.

                Took       report         of    theft         from    a       young        Liverpool                  supporter           who        had    ten

pound       stolen          Prom       him       by    a    supposed             ticket       tout.

Shortly          after       kick          off    and       whilst          in     the    gymnasium            I saw             that    about

uniformed             officers             hurriedly             left       that       building.              This          was       shortly

after       3pm       (1500).

With    DC       HALL       I went          to    the       ground          floor        tunnel         at    the          end    of    the    Nor

stand       (farthest             from       Leppings             Ln)       -- I    could       see      the       playing             area    fro

this     point         at    the       end       of    the       tunnel          and     most      of    the       area          occupied          by

s u p p o r t ers.

I    could       see       that       play       was       not    in    progress             and     numerous               supporters             we

congregated                around          the    Leppings             Ln    goal        area.

DC    BLAKE       came       to       this       point       shortly             after       this       and                 he    had   aradio          as

recall,          but       I could          not       hear       transmissions                due       to l o u d          jeering          from

all    around.

Most    of       the       fans       in    the       North       stand          were     standing            up       out       of    their

seats.           As    far       as    I was          concerned,             simply          another          pitch          invasion          had

stand.           First       a    young          man,       then       an    elderly          man,       both          of    whom       were

arrested          on       the    pitch.              These       two       people        seemed         to    cause             more    shouti

and. a b u s e ,       from       both       where          I was       stood          and    the       new                stand.

An    ambulance             drove          onto       the    pitch          and     drove       to      the                L e p p i n g s L n end.

Police          reinforcements                   went       onto       the       pitch       and     formed            a    cordon       down       t

centre.

I started             to    walk       down       the       pitch       with        DC    HALL and            passed             DS    L.INDLEY

walking          down       the       other       way.

I heard          him       say    that       about          20    people           had    died.          I    lost          DC    HALL       among

the    crowd          at    Leppings             Ln    end.        I    could          see    at     least         5       fans       lying    on

the    pitch          being       attended             to    by    Police/Ambulance                      crew          and       members       of

the    public.              These          were       apparently             dead.

I was    not       aware         that       many          more       people       were          dead       just       a    few    yards

farther       on M a n y              supporters                were       milling          around/             crying          and    shouting

abuse.        I started               to    assist          with          one    apparently                dead       young       man       by

helping       with         cardiac          massage.                 This       was     taken            over    by       persons          already

around       him,       including               a    uniformed             male       officer.              I    rendered             assistance

in m o v i n g     this      person             away       from       the       pitch       but          again    this          was^di^en

over    by    people         who       were          already          with       him.           I    returned             to    the    gymnasium

to    ascertain            what       further             action          was    to    be       taken       re    this          incident          and

speak    with         DS    LINDLEY.

I was    not       aware         of    the          scale       of    casualties                at       that    t im e        before

returning          to      the    gym.              At    the    gym       bodies          were          being    brought             in    one

after    another.                I assisted                in    r/em a v i n g        all f u r n i t u r e          from       the floor

space    then         started          laying             o u / bodies.                The atmosphere                  at      that     time

dreadful         and       chaotic.

Chief    Supt.          ADDIS         attended             at    the       gym    within             a    short       time       and

instructed            myself          and       other       officers             there.              This       was       mainly       that       the

officer       who       brought            the       body       in    to    remain          there          until          further          notice

and    CID    officers            to       assist          with       establishing                   identities.                 With

DS    LINDLEY         and    other          officers             I assisted                in       this    process            and     placed

bodies       into       body      bags.

There    were         not    sufficient                   bags       at    that       time.              About    70       bodies          were    in

the    gym    at      that       time,          although             I did       not       physically             count          them.

Throughout            all    this          DS       LINDLEY          was    carrying                out    the    same          duties       and

rendering          help      and       support             all       around.           I    personally                benefited             from

this    as    I found            this       situation                distressing                and       upsetting,             however,          I

found    that         I was       able          to       perform          these       n e c e s s a r y functions                 and       for    the

time    being         suppress             my       own    feelings

At    about      7pm       (1900)          I attended                at    Hammer tp»/Rd                  Police          Station          and

assisted         DS     LINDLEY            in       the    compilation                 of   a       witness           list.

Det.    Supt.         M cK A Y    gave          a    briefing             there        and explained                  that       ID

procedures             with       relatives                were      to    follow.

Between          9.30pm          (2130)          and       11pm      (2300)             I took      missing            person          reports

from       relatives             at    Hamrnerton             Rd.         Shortly             after        11pm      (2300),           I attended

back       in    the       gymnasium             with       DS      LINDLEY,             DC    HALL        and     DC's     BLAKE          and

LINDSAY.

There          I teamed          up    with       DC       O ’B R I E N    and          began      the      identification                   process

I carried             on    with       this       until          shortly            after        Sam       (0500),         when        I   returned

    to    Ecclesfieid             with       DS       LINDLEY          and      other          colleagues.

This       is    the       first       time       I have            worked          a    semi      final         match      at

H i 1 1 sbo ro ugh         w h i 1st        in    CID.           I have             w o r k ed    atthat          ground         many       t imes

since          July    1980       (000780).                 Policing                there        has a l w a y s          been    of       a very-

high       standard          and       the       safety          record         was       excellent.

I    recall       a Sunday             Newspaper              some        years          ago     doing       a     large         spread       with

pictures          showing             the    high          standard            of       Policing           carried         out     at      this

s t a d iurn„

1 have          attended          many       briefings              at     this          stadium           and     all     the     semi

finals.           Nothing             seemed          to    have       been         done       differently                this     year       and

yet       all    the       other       previous             matches            passed          without           incident.

The       last    semi       final          I worked             prior         to       this     was       last     year.          I worked           in

the       South       stand       seating             area.          The       only       thing        I    recall         was     that       some

Liverpool             fans    invaded             the       pitch         at    some          point.         I did         not     witness           any

of       the    incident          or     its      build          up.

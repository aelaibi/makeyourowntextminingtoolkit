The duties of ser ial 6 was to man barriers to be erecUfl at the rear

of S Stand adjacent to the car park, a nd barriersj/4Vom turnstiles A-G

at Leppings Ln e n d . The area between the two Jsarriers was to remain

sterile.      Liverpool   supporters were not to/be           permitted entry.       The only

persons allowed entry were to be authorised                  persons and persons with

tickets for S Stand i.e. Nottingham Forest supporters.

At   1100am    (1100 > my serial t o ok up their         po s i t i o n s . Manning the

barriers at rear of S S t a y f were 2S1S M A R S H A L L , 1159 L O N G , 169

There were no^problems        experienced at either barrier unt i1 2 . 3 0 pro

(1430),    when     the crowd at the Leppings Ln end began to build up.                    I   had

checked my personal        radio and found it to be in good working order.                     I

began to hear radio messages to the effect that the crowd at Leppings

Ln end were becoming agitated.             Additional men were        requested and

Police horses arrived.        The barriers were opened twice to permit the

horses access.       The crowd was making more and more noise and it was

difficult to hear radio traffic.              I saw a beer can thrown from the rear

of the crowd towards the turnstiles.               The   can was o p e n e d and fluid was

falling from         it. Youths    began climbing over the,^al 1 at turnstiles                 A--G.

At this time        the crowd pushed towards the adncertina door adjacent                      to

our barrier. Suddenly the concertina ^ o r opened,                   I believed .it had

been forced open. About 20Q fans entered unchecked before Police

horses    cut off fans and the qztZe was closed.

The crowd pushed forward and once agaip-^pressed against the concertina

doors. There was no pressure agalifst the barrier.                   I heard a m e s s a ge

over the public address           tel Li'fig the   crowd at the Leppings Ln end to

stop pushing as there was room inside. The                 crowd pushed forward

                of the crowd to Inspector<FURDY.

                I heard a radio message         concerning the kick off.         I did not hear the

                message    cl early be cause of the noise. The message            related to the kick

                off.    It was either a request to postpone the kick off for                 15 minutes

                or a message stating the kick off^+tad been put b a c k .

                I heard an instruction ov e r^Cne          radio stating that the gates at the

                L eppings Ln end shoul dyt>e opened. As jrtfcTn as I heard the message the

o * s i ^ ,rv   gate adjacent to p tfr      barrier op^rfted. The crowd surged through

                unchecked like water froiva tap. The forecourt                 cleared in minutes as

                the outer gates wer^/closed the concertina gates were closed and our

                barrier was moved forward.          The outer gates were opened and the crowd

                once again filled the forecourt to turnstiles A-G.

                The    concertina gates we re opened s 1 ight J / a n d       persons were allowed in

                after    checking of tic ke ts . I n s p e c t W H I T E   was supervising this

                procedure.

                I walked to the barrier behi nd the rear of the S Stand. As                   I was

                walking towards       it I heard a radio message           requesting every available

                Officer to go into the ground.             I got to the barrier and no Officers

                were    present.   I went to the BBC vans nearby and saw a technician

                looking at a TV monitor.          I enquired what had happened and was told

                that there had been a pitch invasion.

                I walked back to the top barrier at the Leppings Ln end in order to

                check what men if any had remained at the barrier. As                  I approached the

                concertina gates they were opened obviously from the inside.                     I saw a

                man being carried by three others. The man appeared to be dead.                       I said

                to these men,      "W ha t’s happening?" One answered,          " T h e r e ’s people dying

                in there get inside." I entered through the concertina doors and saw

                another man being carried.          He was unconscious and appeared dead.                 I

        a female who stated she was a nurs^'l

        She felt the m a n ’s pulse and confirmed that he had a pulse.                I later

        identified this patient on tty? television as a man giving the name

                          No sooner h^fi the nurse          confirmed a pulse than a man

        who stated he was a doctoyr arrived.             I later establ ished that this was
                      \°S>o
        Dr. John ASHTON of the Liverpool University.              He examined

                  confirmed his /pulse and the fact that he was breathing but not

        conscious.   I stayed With the patient until            he was    conveyed by,
                                 I!
        ambulance from the s&ene at 4.00pm          (1600). He regained consciousness

        about 3 .'40pm (1540)   and complained of pain in his chest and in his

         right leg which he was unable to move.             I comforted him and assured

        him.   I saw Dr ASHTON certifying dead bo di es about             10 and after my

         patient had been carried assisted in security of the b o d i e s . Dr.

        ASHTON was also giving advice as to which patients should be carried

        by the ambulance service.         Whilst with the patient

        heard repeated radio messages          for ambulances     to be directed to the

        Leppings L n .

        I later formed a cordon against the crush barrier                 preventing the fans

        leaving the ground,     getting to the dead and injured. Many Liverpool
                                      /
        fans were abusive as th^y left. They were              calling the Officers      in the

        cordon murdering bastards,        and fucking murdering          bastards.   When the

        crowds had left and th e      bodies    had been removed to the temporary

        mortuary by Police vftns I went to the N Stand and collected my serial

        with the exception df PC 3162 PEARS who was on mortuary duties.                   I

        later enquired from member s       of my serial what part they took in the

        incident and wrote      down a resume on the de-brief sheet,

        I retired from duty at 7.30pm          (1930).

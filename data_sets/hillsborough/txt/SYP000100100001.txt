KEVIN LAURENCE RICH




POLICE CONSTABLE 1685




On Saturday         15 April       1989 > I commenced          duty    at 9-00       am at Wombwell Police

Station.        Together        with     other     officers       I    travelled       to    the    Hillsborough

Football      Ground    in    respect       of    the    Nottingham      Forest       v    Liverpool      football

match.

I was      to join part of Serial 15 which was commanded by Police Sergeant 1757

Burns.

On arrival      at the ground I attended a general briefing,                               in the North Stand,

from the various            commanders.         On completion of the briefing I went with the

serial,      and     also    serial       14,    Police       Sergeant        Crawford's      serial,       to   the

Leppings     Lane Terraces.              There we       had a specific briefing               from the Section

Inspector, Mr White.

Whilst      standing    on    the    terracing,         Mr    White    pointed       out    the    layout   of   the

terracing.         He made reference to the fact that for normal matches the access

gates between the enclosures north/centre north and centre south/south were

kept locked and were manned by Police Officers.                               However, in anticipation of

the size of the crowd,              the gates were locked in the OPEN position.

Mr   White    briefed        the    serial      and     instructed     that     we    should       be   positioned

inside     the ground,        alongside         turnstiles     9-16.     The duties were to supervise

entry,      search     people      for    alcohol       and    other    contraband          (flags      etc).     On

completion of entry the                serial were then to enter the Leppings Lane terrace

at   the    rear,    and supervise         crowd behaviour.              On    completion         of the game we

went to assist in the clearing of the ground.                            Mr White in closing said that

in an ideal situation he would have used our two serials in the terracing to
                                                        -    2    -




help locate and distribute the crowds within the enclosures.

The serial took up position in front of the Gate                                'B' and turnstiles        9-16 at

around 11.00 am.            The    turnstiles          at this stage were not open and the time

was    used    to     familiarise       ourselves            with        the   club    officials,       and    other

facilities         that   were    present     in       the       area,   snack bars,      programme      sellers,

etc.

The    turnstiles opened at about noon and from this time onward there was a

steady trickle of fans entering the ground.                               The great majority at this time

had already been searched prior to entry into the ground.                                       However,       there

was no animosity and the second search afforded a certain amount of rapport

with the fans.            It was noticeable that all the people entering the ground at

this time were honest, decent people, well dressed and well behaved.                                          One or

two came through with cans of 'pop' but they quickly diop&gacd of this in a

proper manner when challenged.                  On two occasions I took possession of items

that I considered unsuitable for use in the terracing, one a pair of sticks

from    a   banner,       and    the   second      a    stone         bottle,    but    once    again    the    fans

accepted      my    decision      in   good   part,          and      agreed    to    collect   their    property

after the game.

From the opening of the turnstiles at 12 noon until sometime after 2.00 pm,

the entry flow to the ground gradually increased, without problem, like any

other football match.

At some stage, turnstiles 9 and 10 tiad feen barriered off to the Leppings

Lane end and used for the entry to the North Stand.                                    This reduced, by two,

the number of turnstiles available.

As the time progressed, I became gradually aware of a build-up of supporters

outside the ground,             though my view of the proceedings was limited to what I

could see through the turnstile.                       As the crowds built up I became conscious
                                                   -    3   -




of people     having difficulty in entering through the turnstile.                                     The    crush

outside was such that the turnstiles, on occasions, were unable to function

properly and people were being injured in the turnstile passage.                                        More than

one man emerged from the turnstile bent double and I saw one man physically

sick.

From these people entering the ground, I began to understand that there were

difficulties       outside      the ground,       and it was about this                 time that I became

aware of people banging and shouting outside and many appeared to be kicking

and banging on the concertina gate.                     Given all this information I formed the

opinion that there were great masses of people outside,                                 although I was not

aware of any specific difficulty.

It was about       this time that a youth appeared on top of the wall above the

turnstiles.        He was told to get down, but he was shouting that people were

in    difficulties       outside    the     gates.          He    attempted       to    gain     entry       to    the

ground, but I took hold of him and ejected him through Gate                                    'C'.     I did not

use Gate 'B' because I was aware of a vast number of people outside.                                          On my

return to position,            I saw that the roof and surrounding wall were literally

covered     with     supporters      who     had       climbed      into    the        ground.        Some        were

endeavouring       to    enter     the     ground,       some      were    complaining           of    the    crush

outside, and others were brandishing valid entry tickets.                                 It was about this

time that we were joined by an Inspector and other officers.                                     I do not know

his name,     he was not our section Inspector.                       He climbed on to the roof of

the   turnstile      and      beckoned    other    officers        to do so,       but        none    did.        This

Inspector     began      helping     people       into      the    ground,    and        at     one    stage       the

turnstile     roof      was    literally    covered         with    spectators.           At     this    stage       I

received an instruction from whom I know not, that provided these spectators
had   tickets,      then we       should     admit      them.     The   persons   on the roof began to

enter the ground.               The majority of people had tickets but many did not.                    The

persons who had gained access then began to pass the unchecked tickets back

over the roof and over the wall.

At    one   stage,       one    person who was          attempting      to gain access       came   into my

grasp,      he began saying,             "I've got a ticket,            I've   got a ticket".       He also

showed      me   a Merseyside            Police   Warrant       Card,    the   name   on   it,   I believe,

            or similar.           I made comment to him about having more sense, and he

became quite angry complaining about the things that were going on outside,

and the lack of professionalism on the part of South Yorkshire Police.                                   As

he passed into the ground,                 I made comment to Police Sergeant Burns that he

was a Police Officer.

I became aware of a general upsurge in activity both inside and outside the

ground,     and that       people were        still climbing in and passing unused tickets

backwards.        The banging on the metal gate increased, when I saw one of the

club stewards on the gate go to the opening mechanism.                                I looked at him and

he said,     "I'm opening this gate, I'll take responsibility", and proceeded to

open the concertina gate.                   I did not see who assisted in the opening.                    As

the crowds entered the ground I had to take refuge alongside turnstile 16.

Several     hundred       people     entered      the    ground and I was         amazed    that    the rush

stopped and there was only a few people outside.                               As the gates were being

closed,      I looked          outside    and saw that          the Mounted Section were holding a

large crowd back in Leppings Lane.

A large number of those admitted through Gate                             'B' were hanging around the

turnstile        area.     I saw people           attempting to throw unused tickets                over the

gates, pass them under the gates or through the gap in between the gates.
It became      obvious     to me at this stage that ticket control had got out of

hand, and this seemed to be reflected by the turnstile operators who seemed

to be allowing anybody in, with or without tickets.                              I had no idea of the

time but some time after the gates had been opened, several minutes, I heard

a   cheer    within     the      ground,    and    I    assumed     this   to   be   the    kick-off.       I

continued to watch people enter through the turnstiles when I saw the gate

open again and a number of Police Officers rushed into the ground,                                   saying

that there was trouble on the terracing.

A few moments later Police Sergeant Burns ordered us as a serial to enter

the terraced area at the Leppings Lane end.                          I entered through the centre

tunnel    under      the West      Stand.     As       I passed     down the     tunnel     I was met      by

various     groups of people rushing up the tunnel carrying injured persons to

the rear of        the stand.        Some of the spectators were very angry and began

screaming     at     Police   Officers      saying       there's     people     dead down       there,   it's

your    fault.       As I was making my way               forward     to assist      in the rescue        and

removal of the injured,             I was confronted by angry fans waving tickets,                        and

saying,     "We've never been checked,                 these tickets are unused, you've let too

many in here, you're responsible".                     I assisted to the best of my ability in

the removing of some dead and numerous slightly injured persons to the rear

of the main stand.            I then went         through the        crowd and on to the pitch in

order to find other members of my serial.

Whilst      making    my   way    through    the       crowd,   I was      confronted      by   a range    of

emotions     from,    "Your responsible           - it's all your fault"             to "It's not your

fault    personally".         Many    spectators         remained    in position and were           asking,

"What time will kick-off be".

Whilst at the entrance to the tunnel, I saw fans in the West Stand begin to

rip hoardings from above the terraced area.                         The fans on the terrace below
complained        that    they were being showered with debris,                   but I heard someone

say, "Tell the press we're not all hooligans, these are for stretchers".

From this point I coaxed people to leave the ground, but many were refusing

to leave without refunds for unused tickets.

I later reformed with my serial and attended a debrief in the North Stand.

It was at this point I made my point to a Senior Officer that Gate                                 'B' had

been    opened,         apparently    without      Police        instruction.      I    then   accompanied

Inspectors White and Calvert to the area of the turnstiles.

Whilst walking through the North Stand I was sickened by the number of empty

beer    cans      and    spirit   bottles     that    had    been     apparently       smuggled   into    the

ground.

In the period that I was engaged on searching persons I found no alcohol at

all    but   as    the    time    approached    3-00       pm,    then   cans   and    bottles    began   to

appear on the floor of the turnstile.                      When I returned to the scene later I

was    confronted with quite           a quantity          of empty and part empty cans in and

around the turnstile.

Prior to attending the debrief we were standing as a serial alongside                                     the

turnstile when I saw a small group of people,                            very upset,     walking towards

the exit.          A woman said,       "Get rid of him,             please,     I'm trying to find my

husband".         I saw a youngish person carrying a notebook.                     I said to him, "Who

are you?".         He said,       "I'm from the Star,             I'm only after a story".          I told

him    to    leave      the   woman   alone   as     she    was    obviously    distressed.        He    went

towards Police Sergeant Burns, who also told him to go away.

                coach.          After        b ri ef i ng at H i l l s b o r o u g h took     up duty on C laywhee 1 s

               Lane     s u p e rvising          the arrival          by coach of Liverpool              S up po rt er s,          The

               a t m o s p h e r e at this           time was        g o o d , most    coaches a p p e ar e d     to    cont ai n an

               assortment            of spectators,               m e n , w o m e n an d   children who wer e well

                behaved and            in good        humour.

               When     parking            spaces     on C l a y w h e e 1s Lane were          full,     I went w i t h other

                officers         to the end of C l ay w h e e l s Lane                 to its j un ction w i t h P en is to ne /

               Hali f a x Road.

               By     now the time w o u l d               have been a pp r ox 2 . 5 0 p m .

               There were            large       numbers       of Liv er po ol        suppo rt er s w a lk in g    from

               H a l i f a x Road towa r d s              the ground.         The     pavements        on both sides          of

                the    road were '3 or 6 deep w i t h fans a large                             propo rt io n of w h o m 25-

                3 0% were        d r inking         beer    from cans as          they walked.

               We stopped as m a n y                 of these fans as we               could and they ei th er               left

                their     drink at            the    side    of the       road,     or stop pe d and drank             it.      ■ „
                                                                                                               PAGE
                                                                                                               R353

There were           some who m a n a g e d to get             past us still w it h their

drink.         The a t m o sp h er e at        this    time was         not as good as before,                 the

fans were           less will in g       to be d ir ec te d and they were                 bo i s t r o u s .

A l t h o u g h not e s p ec i al l y a g re ss iv e         they seemed         intent     on gett in g        to

the ground and did not want                       to be directed.

W h i l s t at this          location three           coaches       stop pe d at       the side     of the

road,        and the     p assengers who were Liver poo 1 fans a tt e mp t ed to get

off.         Some m a n a ge d    to get       off but       the    others were         p re vented and

d i r ected to the           coach      parking are a on H a li fa x R o a d .             These      fans

did not want            to   listen to a dv i ce and were abusive.

A bout       this    time we were            d ir ec te d by fans who were              still    str ea mi ng

down Halifax Road,                to The Gate Public House,                     The     pub was     closed

and at the back              e nt rance were 5-6 Liv er po ol                  fans kicking at          the

door     to get       in.     T he y were m ov ed awa y and e v en t ua l ly we gained

access        to the     pub.       Inside      it was       packed w i t h local S h e f f i e l d

people who were              drinking.          A c c o r di n g   to these      people,       a small

group of Liv e r p oo l           s up po rt er s     had m a n a g e d to gain access and

f ig hting       had started.            There wer e         br ok en    pool    cues and broken

glasses        littering         the    floor.

1 recall         remarking        to other        officers at           this    time    that    there was

no way that           the    fans      still    str ea mi ng       down Hali fa x Road w o u ld get

to the game           in time.          By    now the      time w o ul d have been a bout 3pm.

The volume          of s up po rt er s        lessened       c o ns i de r ab l y and we were a bout

to go for our meal                w he n we were         d ir ec te d    to the L ep pi ng s Lane

end of the ground w here                     there was       trouble      of some       sort.

W hi l s t    on H a l i f a x / P e n i s t o n e Road,     I saw groups         of fans walk in g

back     from the d i r e c t io n of the ground,                    they were Liv er po ol           fans

•and were        stopping        other       fans ask i ng for          spare    tickets,       it was

o bvious       they did not have               tickets       for the match.

O n reaching          the L a p p in g s Lane         end of the ground,               we were f or m ed        up
                                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                                    R335

into our serials            outside     the ground.         At this time there were

still    large     numbers       of L iv erpool     fans outside         the ground some were

starting     to make        their way awa y from the ground.

We entered the gr ou nd t h ro ug h a conce rt in a                 steel     gate whi ch was

opened for        us by     police     officers     (possibly the gates were                s li ghtly

ajar with offic er s            on duty at      the g a t e s )

Inside    the gr ou nd there were a number                  of people        (not great)

mill in g ar ou nd       in a y ard are a behind          the     stand.      In line w it h the

steel    gates was a tunnel             under    the stand        leading     to the     terraces.

At the outside           end of the tunnel          there were        several      bodies     lying

on the ground.            T he re were     injured      people also         lying on the

ground.      These       people were       being    tended to by police              officers,

spectators        and    I think St J ohn a mb u la n ce          p e r s o n © 1 or similar.       X

made my way t h ro ug h the            tunnel    onto    the    terraces.         There were       injured

people    lying on the gr ou nd w it h fans m i ll in g a ro u nd them.                       X a s s i st e d

some    injured      people      thro ug h the     tunnel      to the y ard at the          rear.

There were many           bodies and       injured      people on the         terraces      close to

the    perimeter        fence.     These    people were         being    tended      to by police

officers and spectators.                 There was a large            number      of s pe ct a to r s    on

the    pitch just on the other              side of the fence.               I could see       injured

people and bodies             being    p assed over      the    fence and t h ro ug h a gap             in

it.     There were        police      officers a nd spec ta to rs           trying    to break      down

the fence        to gain access         to the     terraces.

I a ss is t ed    in removing         several    injured       people    from the       terraces        to

the tunnel        and    into    the yard.       This was       ext re me ly d i ff ic ul t we had to

force our way t hr o ug h the            crowd to       reach     injured     people and then

force our way b a c k .           Whilst    on the      terraces      the    crowd on the        stand

above    us were        s ho ut in g and jeer in g      insults at the         police.        M an y of

them were        s pi tting     down onto    the    people      below.      The    noise was

deafening,        it was almost         i mpossible      to hear what a person              next    to you

                                                                                                               R3S5

    was      saying.        The    st en ch of stale         beer and faeces was               strong.       It was

    obvious         that the       police were being               bla me d for what       had happened,          at

    times       1 was      con ce rn ed    for my own and other               peoples      safety,       I thought

   we w ou ld be o v er r u n by the              crowd.           People were       climbing      both up and

    down from the             s tand above       us.      Whilst      this was       h appening we had to

    prevent         people     coming      onto the terraces              from the tunnel          they we re

    trying         to force       their way      past us.           T hese   people were        d is pl ay in g

   anger        towards       police      officers       a ga in    blaming us for what- had

   happened.            Some      of these      people were          o bv i ou s ly g en u in e ly d i st r e s s e d

   and were          trying       to find friends and               relatives       they had      lost    contact

   with.

   At     some      point     during      this time       I was      handed a w ri st watch,           I dont     know

   who       by.     I took       p os se s si o n of    it and      later    noted that        the watch,

   w h i c h was still            fastened,     had s t op pe d at S.53pm.

   E v en t u a l l y the      terraces were            cleared      of the     injured and dead,            I was

   then directed              to the yar d at the            rear     of the stand to direct

   supporters           leaving       the ground.

   I then s up er v is e d Liv er po ol             fans m ak in g       their way back           to C l a y w h e e 1s

   Lane       to their        coaches.

   I do       recall     hear in g     before we made              our way to the gr ou nd           several

   radio m es sages            on other      o f f i c e r ’s radios.         Two    of these      I can

   remember          clearly

   1.                For    christs       sake open the gates,               yes open the gates

   2.                There     are     people    dying      in here

   1 can't         remember        in what order          1 h eard      these messages,           1 don't      know

   who       said t h e m .                                                  -------

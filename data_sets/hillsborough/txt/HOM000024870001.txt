    Dear Mr. Sweet,

    I send the draft of the Working Party's final recommendations for 'Stairways and
    Ramps' - Chapter 7 of the 'Green Guide' - as requested.   If this is not

•   satisfactory, or causes any problems, I am in the office up to mid-day Friday,
    22nd instant.

    British Standard titles I promised you are

    B.S. 5810 : 1979 - Code of Practice for Access for the Disabled to Buildings.

    B.S. 5588 : Part 8 : 1988 - Code of Practice for Means of Escape for Disabled
                                People.

    B.S. 5266 : Part 1 : 1988 - Code of Practice for the Emergency Lighting of
                                Premises other than Cinemas and Certain Other
                                Specified Premises Used for Entertainment.

    Yours sincerely,

         STAIRWAYS AND RAMPS

         (Note : It is to be stated in the general introductory paragraphs of the
         Working Party's report, that all new work at sports grounds, should
         conform to the standards set by Building Regulations.  The wider options
         provided by the 'Green Guide' are to be applied to the appraisal of the
         suitability of existing structures, with a view to the need for
         improvements or alternatively for limiting the use of low standard
         provisions).

         1.   There is a wide appreciation of the dangers presented by stairways,
              particularly those used by the public in large numbers.  It is
              necessary to emphasise that some similar hazards exist in the use of
              ramps, and that these increase in degree, at an accelerating rate, as
              the gradient becomes greater. The Technical Working Party recommends
              that this be done in an extended redrafting of this chapter of the
              'Green Guide', which should also present the hazards of stairways and
              ramps more sharply, with some reasoning given for the standards
              suggested.

              There is a possibility of confusion between the standards of safety
              required for stairways and ramps, which form part of the access
              between spectator enclosures and an exit (or some other facility) and
              those which exist as (generally radial) gangways, which are provided
              between blocks of seats or standing, within a viewing enclosure.   The
              different patterns of movement on the latter, excuse them from such
              provisions as handrails, the minimum dimension for risers, the maximum
              dimension for goings, and for intermediate landings, especially where
              mass movement in an evacuation is upwards. This important difference
              requires to be explained, either in this chapter or those chapters
              dealing with terraces and seated enclosures.

         3.   The channelling of flows, to provide immediate or close support to
               persons using stairways, by the provision of handrails, is equally
               necessary on heavily packed ramps which exceed a gradient of about 1
               in 20. It is agreed that the recommended width of channels for both,
               should not exceed three persons (unit widths) in line abreast, so as
               to leave the centre user only without a handrail, but able to hold
               onto a person on both sides, who does have a handrail adjacent.
               Therefore, the width of up to 1.8m permitted by paragraph 76 needs to
               be reduced. Additionally, an extension of handrails, by at least
               300mm, beyond the top and bottom of a stairway, or ramp, ought to be
               recommended.

         4.   Avoiding in line pressure, from a flow of persons at the bottom of a
               stairway or ramp, being imposed upon persons standing on terraces, is
               equally important to avoiding that same pressure on persons about to
               descend a stairway or ramp. This hazard needs to be emphasised in
               this chapter. However, because speed of flow down a ramp is not
               reduced in the way that happens on a stairway, a reduction of the
               aggregate width of flow, approaching the top, is not required.  The
               introduction of intermediate landings and changes of direction, to
               avoid mounting pressure, or speeds, on long unbroken ramps should be
               recommended.




NBDABH
         5.   The difference between handrails, protection to sides (balustrades
              without large openings) and barriers on, or near the top and bottom of
              stairways and ramps, and their appropriate strength requirements for
              these different safeguards, requires to be clarified in the rewriting
              of this chapter.

         6.   The Technical Working Party recommends that more sketches, of a
              variety of potentially hazardous situations, in relation to stairways
              and ramps, illustrating the principles of the provisions recommended
              in the 'Green Guide', should be included in the redrafting.

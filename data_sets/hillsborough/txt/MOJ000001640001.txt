         Dear Sir

         CO/582/99

         I am grateful for your considerate letter. The families would have preferred another, and
         earlier date, to 13* April by reason o f the anniversary, but we do not wish for the hearing to
         be postponed if it is not reasonable to hold it earlier.

         Yesterday we heard a suggestion from the Crown Office for three days from 22ndMarch, a
         date suitable to us. I know that both the South Yorkshire Police Authority and the Chief
         Constable were very keen on the earliest possible hearing, so, given the choice, the first dates
         are much better for all parties.

         If, however, the March date is inappropriate, we ask that the hearing takes place in the week
         o f 13* April, as previously arranged.

         Yours faithfully

             Strand
             London WC2A 2LL


             Dear Sirs

             I am the prosecutor in the case of David Duckenfield and Bernard Murray, formerly of the
             South Yorkshire police, who are charged before the Leeds District Magistrates Court with
             manslaughter and other offences. I have spoken this afternoon on the telephone to Simon
             Slidders about the listing of an application for judicial review by both defendants.

             1 understand that they are seeking leave to challenge the decision of the Crown Prosecution
             Service of 18'1' December 1998 not to take over and discontinue proceedings under the
             Prosecution of Offences Act 1985.

             When the decision was made last December, I wrote to the defendants saying that I would
             wish to be represented at the application for leave, if one was made. In particular I wish to
             object through counsel to the application for a stay on the committal proceedings. These were
             fixed for 19lh April 1999 on 7,h December last, at the request of the defendants, who said their
             counsel were unavailable before then.

            Out of concern that the committal proceedings might be delayed, I indicated to the defendants
            in writing that I would object on the grounds that the application had not been made promptly,
            if it was not lodged by 8lh January. In my view this was reasonable because the challenge was
            to be on the grounds o f irrationality alone, as was made clear to the magistrate in Leeds on
            2 P' December 1998. I was concerned that the committal proceedings should not be
            prejudiced. On that same day leading counsel for Mr Murray told the magistrate he was not
            going to apply for the committal date to be adjourned because the date of 19th April might act
            as a “lever” to ensure that the judicial review was heard promptly,

            Yesterday, Is1 March, the defendants both applied for the committal proceedings to be
            adjourned at Leeds, but the magistrate declined to do so. He was told by counsel for
            Duckenfield that an application was being made yesterday, or had been made on Friday
            evening, for judicial review. I had not been told beforehand that the application was being
            made at this stajje. I have not been served with papers.

                                                           -   1

              In these circumstances, \ contend that it is fair that counsel who knows about these things
              should be present. Alun Jones QC has advised the prosecution throughout the case, and it is
              the delay of the defence that has caused this problem. Next week he is in the Court o f Appeal
              before Rose LJ for five days. His junior, James Lewis, is working abroad. Both of them are
              free for several half days of the week of 15th March or on Thursday or Friday of this week.

              The proposal for a stay is of great importance, and the magistrate has expressed the
              understandable and firm hope that he can have an answer by 22nd March as to whether a stay
              has been granted, Four weeks have been set aside for committal proceedings in his busy
              court. It is the decision of the defence to make the application at this late stage, All I ask for
              is some flexibility in the next two weeks.

              1 understand that Philip Havers QC is instructed for the Crown Prosecution Service.

              This application for judicial review is not, o f course, to be confused with the judicial review of
              the decision o f the South Yorkshire Police Authority, also arising out of the Hillsborough
              disaster, to which 1 am also a Respondent. (CO/SS2/99)

              The importance of a stay is emphasised in the White Book at 53/14/48

              Yours sincerely

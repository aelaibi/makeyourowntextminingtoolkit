Whilst        X. w a s     in f r o n t     of       the       Hop       a number           of L i v e r p o o l    fans          came          over

and    were        shouting          and    swearing                as    a    result        of    th e    taunts        from          the

Nottingham              Forest       fans.

We w e r e     then        told      to    clear          half       of       the    pitch,        moving        all     fans          to       the

Leppings           Lane       end,    and       to    form a             line a c r o s s         the     pitch     to       prevent             them

and    upset        by    the     taunts         of       the       opposing            fans      and     the    actions           of       the

pol j.c e .

After     twenty minutes                   I was          told       to       return        to    the     transit        to       be

                 That this House notes the statement on 17th April by the Police Federation of England
               and Wales welcoming the police inquiry into the events which occurred at Hillsborough;
               supports the action of the Oiief Constable of South Yorkshire in requesting his officers not
               to comment to the media; and believes that any criticism of either spectators or police
               officers is a matter for consideration by the inquiry being undertaken by Lord Justice Taylor.

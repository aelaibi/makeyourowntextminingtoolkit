they       just sat on the                 edge    of the        pitch.             Then    the game was           stop p e d

and the            players       left      the    pitch.         I realised               then that        there was

                 something        really terrible                         happening and that                   it wasn't         just a     pitch

                 invasion.           I saw a P o l i c e m a n with a supporter walk i n g                                     towards      the

                 S pi o n Kop end of          the       ground avid the                       supp o r t e r s    arm was all           twisted,

                 it looked        like      it was         broken,                    1 cannot       describe         this     supporter.

            believe what        had happened.

            I think    that what        h a p p e n e d was    not helped     by the   fact   that      somany

            I have    no    criticism of         the    people who     helped       out when       it happened,

            the Police       did e v e r y t h i n g   they    could to     revive the      injured

            suppoi rters      they     c o u l d n ’t have     done any     more.    As    1 was    leaving    t

            saw that       they were      very upset.

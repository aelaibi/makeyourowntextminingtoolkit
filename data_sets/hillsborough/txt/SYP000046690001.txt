        Dear Sir

        On 1st April 1990 I was appointed to take over the Hillsborough Disaster
        Inquiry following the appointment of Mr G Dear to the post of Her Majesty’s
        Inspector of Constabulary. Mr Mervyn Jones, Assistant Chief Constable, is
        overseeing the Coronal aspects on behalf of the Coroner Dr Stefan Popper
        and I shall take charge of the Criminal Investigation and matters relating
        to complaints against the Police.

        I now enclose for your information copies of the video and photographic
        material you requested when you met Detective Chief Superintendent Foster
        at Furnival House.

       We are now in a position to commence the interviews of your client at your
       earliest convenience.  To assist this if you contact Detective Chief
       Superintendent Foster direct on               he necessary arrangements can
       be made.

        V ( W s faithfully




        L SHARP

                 HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
   POTENTIAL JUDICIAL REVIEW OF REFUSAL TO GRANT FIAT

Issue
You are asked to approve the draft letter in response to a letter by A S
Law Solicitors indicating th a t they are considering judicially reviewing
your decision not to grant a fiat and asking you to reconsider your
decision.


Timing
Immediate.


Summary
You received a subm ission regarding the m erits of a further inquest
u nder Section 13 (B) of the Coroners Act 1988 in February 2006, at
yellow flag A.


Your conclusions are attached a t yellow flag B. In summ ary, you
indicate th a t w hilst you have sym pathy for the position of Mrs.
Williams, the interests of justice would not be served by requiring
another inquest.


A formal response was made on 13 February 2006 and is attached at
yellow flag C.


The solicitors have now written (at yellow flag D) to indicate th a t they
are instructed to consider judicially reviewing your decision and
requesting th a t you reconsider prior to them commencing proceedings.
Their letter is dated 10 April 2006. I have already com m unicated with
them to indicate th a t there will be a delay responding to their letter.


I have consulted with Treasury Solicitors with regard to the issue of
justiciability of your decision u nder the Coroners Act 1988. Their
response is a t yellow flag E.


Action Required and Observations
I attach my draft response for your approval a t yellow flag F. I would
suggest th a t there is no m aterial upon which it would be appropriate to
reconsider the issue of your consent.


If you were minded to do so, I would request th a t you approve the
response as drafted.

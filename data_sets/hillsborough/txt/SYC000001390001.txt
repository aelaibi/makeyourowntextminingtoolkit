          Thank y ou for your helpf ul                      and clear letter of the 12th of S e ptember 1990 the
          contents of w h i c h I have noted.

          W i t h reg ard to the ques ti on of the release of documents and statements, you
          are of course quite right that apart from those w h i c h we re already in the
          public domain, it h a d been my v i e w that these should remain c on fi dential
          un til aft er the c on cl us io n of the D.P.P. inquiry (which has n o w happened)
          and the Inquests.

          The p o s i t i o n w i t h regard to the release of copy statements was ex plored in
          R - v - Hemsworth, C o ro ne r ex parte Peach 1980 (2WLR496 et sec).                The
          st atements in the H i l l s b o r o u g h Dis as te r we re of course obta in ed by West
          M i d l an ds Police w h o acted for va rious parties at different stages of the
          investigation.

          On the as su mp ti on that the restr ictions ou t li ne d in the case of Blair Peach
          apply to these statements, I w o u l d have no au th ority to order the disclosure
          of the state ments               to third parties.

          However, it is my v i e w that in respect of at least those statements which^
          hav e b ee n d i s c lo s ed to one of the intere st e d parties, fairness w o u l d require
          that the same infor ma ti on is mad e available to other intere st ed parties by
          the people or o rg an i s a t i o n w h o have control and custody of the statements.

           It has b e e n su gg ested to me that the stat ements have been ma d e a va ilable to
           S outh Yo rk sh ir e Police solely for the use in d i sc ip li na ry proceedings, but
           eve n if this is in fact so, it does present the recipients w i t h a ve ry ma jo r
           p r o b l e m of ensu ri n g that infor ma ti on supp lied for one purpose is not used for
           others. Even if they w e r e able to achieve this, there is still a p r o b l e m of
           p e r s u a d i n g other parties that this has taken place.

           The statements w h i c h are cur re nt l y h e l d by Wes t M i d l an ds Police             fall I think
           into three categories:-




R8606

LES AAF
1.     Those w h i c h are contained in the D.P.P.      file and w h i c h have been
       f ur nished to South Yo rkshire Police.

2.     The a dditional statements in the body files w h i c h have been
       f u rnished to me but have not, as I u n d e r s t a n d it, be en released to
       South Yorkshire.

3.     T he -large n um be r of statements w h i c h ha ve not bee n released to
       anybody.    The reason for this cate go ry b e i n g that it is c on si de re d
       that the conte nts of these stat ements add n o t h i n g m a t e ri al to
       the in formation w h i c h is already available.

On the a ss u mp ti on that C ategory 3 statements referred to above are as
described, I think it w o u l d be di ff ic u lt to argue that they should be
kept conf id en ti al if the relevant statements in the D.P.P. file are in
fact released.

This only then leaves the statement s in the body file and it seems to me
that there really is not very m u c h point in trying to keep just these
statements co nf idential until after the co nc lu s i o n of the Inquest if
e v er y t h i n g else is going to be ava ilable for release.

In the circumst ances, w h a t e v e r my a ut ho ri ty m i g h t be w i t h regard to ord er in g
release, I feel that it w o u l d be imp ro p er for me to m a i n t a i n my request that
the copy statemen ts should not be released to in te re st e d parties and in the
cir cu ms ta n ce s as far as I am concerned, I have no further o b j e c ti on to their
release.

W h e t h e r or not y ou or indeed anybody else have the cap ac it y to make copy
st atements available, bearing in m i n d the vast numbers, and w h e t h e r or
not these have to be supplied on a free of charge or charge ab le basis is
not a p r o b l e m I can help you w i t h but obv io us ly one that w i l l ha ve to be
addressed.

The di ff ic u l t y of supplying copies of course is c om po u n d e d     if one
applies this to photographic an d/or the vi d eo evidence.

W h i l s t I entirely agree w i t h you that it is sensible that you should act
as a link b e t w e e n me and Mr. R i c h a r d Wells, for the sake of conve ni en ce
I am copy in g this letter to h i m and to Mr. Leslie Sharp.

HILLSBOROUGH CORONAL ENQUIRY - PROGRESS REPORT

As you know, as was always intended, I have now formally resumed m y role as
your Coroner’s Officer following the announcement of the the Director of Public
Prosecutions not to take any further action in the criminal courts arising out of
the events at the Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989.

I have had a telephone discussion with Mr Richard Wells, the Chief Constable of
South Yorkshire Police, and in addition to him agreeing m y continuing role as
defined by his predecessor, he has made it quite clear that I will act as the link
between you and him and vice versa. Mr Wells also stated that it is proper for
the West Midlands Police to continue to support your Inquests until their
completion.

I have had discussions with Mr L Sharp, the Chief Constable of Cumbria, and
have agreed a smooth transition between criminal/ disciplinary investigations and
the coronal enquiry. Mr Sharp maintains his responsibilities for these aspects
until such a time that he and Mr Wells have agreed that there is nothing further
to be considered. I do not intrude into that process or into Mr Sharp’s
responsibilities. I have also re-taken charge of the evidence gathered by the
West Midlands Police team, the bulk of which was initially gathered jointly for
yourself and Lord Justice Taylor.

Strictly speaking the product of the investigation is the property of the Chief
Constable of South Yorkshire Police who, about the same time as did the Home
Secretary, requested the Chief Constable of West Midlands Police to carry out
the investigation. After the publication of Lord Justice Taylor’s Interim Report,
the then Chief Constable of South Yorkshire asked the Chief Constable of West
Midlands Police to investigate possible criminal and police disciplinary aspects, a
process which I started and which was ultimately completed b y Mr Sharp.

                                                                     I Continued . .



  PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT            C h e s te r
                                            2

Mr Sharp has now passed the Director of Public Prosecutions file and related
disciplinary papers to the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police who, I
suspect, through his Deputy is considering the disciplinary aspects, if any.
Ultimately a decision will be made and later announced as to whether any police
officer should face any disciplinary charges. I am not aware of the timing of
that decision, the related announcement, or the likely outcome.

A n important point which now needs to be addressed is the policy on the release
of documents and photographs to interested parties. It will come as no surprise
that throughout the investigations we have been inundated with requests for
information from a wide variety of people including the families, Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club, Sheffield City Council, Eastwoods Engineers, and their
respective legal representatives. In addition, South Yorkshire Police have also
been desirous for some of the information we have obtained. The policy on
disclosure, which has been subject to constant review, has been as follows.

Lord Justice Taylor agreed that anything that had been "heard” was in the
public domain and could be released. However, that material which had not been
heard would not be released. At the conclusion of the public enquiry hearings
and the announcement by the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police that
there would be a criminal/disciplinary investigation mounted by West Midlands
Police, Lord Justice Taylor stated that he had no further interest in the unheard
material and that should become the property of the criminal/coronal/disciplinary
investigations. Thereafter we continued the policy of non-release given that we
continued with those criminal and coronal investigations. Clearly it would have
been inappropriate to release anything during that process to any party,
including at that time the South Yorkshire Police, some members of which were
also being investigated. This policy of non-release was continued by Mr Sharp
on taking over the criminal/disciplinary investigations from me early in April of
this year.

The criminal and disciplinary investigations have now been completed and, as I
indicated earlier, the files passed to the South Yorkshire Police. The
protection of non-disclosure afforded by the existence of the Director of Public
Prosecutions investigation has now disappeared and it is appropriate at this
stage to consider what the future policy will be on release of documents. I
might add at this point that we are still receiving a considerable number of
requests for the disclosure of information. Consequently, the interim policy is
to sustain non-disclosure.

It occurs to me, and Mr Sharp agrees, that the policy on disclosure is initially a
matter for yourself and secondly for the Chief Constable of the South Yorkshire
Police, if you do not intend to sustain the current policy.

Normally, as I know you appreciate,     we would not release any material until such
a time that your Inquests have been     completed. Consequently before I raise this
matter, if I have to, with the South    Yorkshire Police, I would like you to
indicate whether you would wish the     West Midlands Police Coronal team to sustain
a policy of non-disclosure until your   Inquests have been concluded and verdicts
returned.

1 have taken the liberty of copying this letter to Mr Wells and also Mr Sharp so
that they are aware of the issue.

             RE-OPENING OF HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER INQUESTS



Mr J Mervyn     Jones,   the Deputy Chief Constable of Cheshire and former
Assistant Chief Constable of West Midlands Police in charge of the coronal
inquiry into the Hillsborough Disaster, made an announcement today.


Mr Jones said, "I have been advised by Dr S L Popper, H M Coroner for South
Yorkshire (West), that, following on the recent decision of the Director of
Public Prosecutions, he intends to re-open the Inquests at Sheffield on Monday,
19th November 1990".


He said, "The earlier Inquests in April/May of this year had determined when
and where the ninety five deceased had individually met with their deaths.
The   Coroner   now   intends   that   the   re-opened   Inquests   will consider   the
generality of how those deaths occurred.          The Inquests will continue apart
from, if necessary, an adjournment for Christmas and New Year, until their
conclusion with verdicts returned by the Coroner's Jury.


A n announcement as to the precise venue in Sheffield will be made in due
course".


Any further enquiries to West Midlands Police Press Office.

  HILLSBOR OU GH INQUIRY

  As you know, I have now taken up residence in Cheshire. Bearing in mind
  the possibility of my involvement in Hillsborough bein g re-aw akened, I detail
  below the various contact numbers which you may find u se fu l:-



         Cheshire Police Headquarters                0244 350000 Ext 2091




                                         Chester
  PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT
   POLAROID PHOTOGRAPHS - HILLSBROUGH
                                 C./"-



   Telephone call from Mr. Fraser, civil cases are starting next Tuesday,
   they are wanting to try and recover damages for the pain and suffering
  people were caused by having to look at the polaroids.           Mr. Fraser
   confirmed specifically to me that there was no criticism either of
  me, the Officers or the fact the polaroids were used for identification,
  on the contary he agreed that it was the best method available, but
  nevertheless it did cause distress to have to look at them and make
   identifications and they felt that some payment should be made for this.


   I said that       whilst I didn't want to be unhelpful I was somewhat
  concerned about the position with Hammonds Suddards, bearing in mind
  ,that the photographs, although taken at my specific instruction and
  direction were taken by South Yorkshire Police Officers, using South
  Yorkshire material, I said I would think about it.



  TELEPHONE CALL TO £HXEFCINSPECTOR TOPE

  He said that on balance he prefe'ted not to release the originals
  but he thought they    had a set down there which could be copied, in
  fact they were enlargements.           His view was that we should not release
  the originals but he could not really see any reason why one shouldn't
  let them have copies as it wasn't going to effect our inquests in any
        «                    LLSSCl
  way, it was purely to be/as evidence before the judge.           I said I
^pjwould come back to him.




  I spoke to Mr. Fraser again.           I explained to him that I was minded to
  let him have copies of the copies, subject to Hammond Suddards not
  raising any major objection.           I wanted him to take it up with Hammond
  Suddard and if there was no major objection he could get in touch with
  Kevin Tope who would organise the copies.           I said he would have to pay
  them their costs-.    He said "No problem".        The only thing which
  concerned Mr. Fraser was the fact that they were enlargements, he said
  he thought Hammond Suddards would object to that because they/¥ia¥e made
  the situation even more horrific, but he thought that it should be
  possible to reduce them down to original size..           I gave him phone
  numbers so that he could get in touch with me if need be at Barnsley
  or at home.    I theft had another word with Chief Inspector Tope, he
  said he thought they could reduce them but if need be he would pick up
  the originals from us and copy those for Mr. Fraser.
FILE NOTE DATED 12.6.90.


TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH MERTEN JONES


Things are moving on his front and he is hoping to move
to Cheshire and start at the beginning of July.   We discussed
Hillsborough briefly.   I suggested to him that I thought that
it might be an idea for me to get in touch with the D.P.P.
to get an idea of a time table, not so much as that I wanted
to pressurise him but that it was necessary for planning purposes.
Mervyn thought that this might well be a good idea, but thought
if it were possible to delay it until after the final documents
had been submitted to him that might be wiser.

He also thought that it would be difficult to prepare at this
stage if there was going to be a long delay.

We agreed that^Lt probably would be a good idea if we met at
some point and had a proper session to try and decide what should
be done at the Inquests, on the assumption that they were resuming.

We agreed that we would meet at some convenient time.     Mervyn
made an interesting point with regard to aggregation in Manslaughter.
I had always taken the.view that you could not aggregate the
activities of different individuals i.e.,in several minor bits
of negligence to make one major act of gross negligence.     Mervyn also
thought that it would not be possible to aggregate minor acts
of negligence committed by one individual, so as to make the sum
total of these,one act of gross negligence.    This is a very
interesting thought which I am pretty sure is correct.

        As you know the Inquests have now concluded and we await the conclusion of
        Mr Sharp's criminal/discipline investigation into the Hillsborough
        disaster.    Sometime following that there will be an announcement as to
        whether    any action is intended in the criminal courts against any of the
        parties involved.     When that will be is not known.

        In due course you will probably wish to have sight of the evidence that
        was put before the Director of Public Prosecutions, together with our
        reports in order to assist you in determining the parameters of the
        subsequent Inquests if they have to be re-convened after a decision by the
        Director of Public Prosecutions to take no further action.    This is quite
        rightly   the domain of Mr Sharp and, therefore, can I suggest that any
        requests you want to make for material should be addressed to him.     If you
        wish to discuss any matters from a coronal point of view, please do not
        hesitate to contact me.

        In closing, can I thank you for your many kindnesses over recent weeks,
        indeed the past year, which was much appreciated by me and all my staff.

       Best wishes.

       Following your request in relation to a possible breakdown of the times
       where the deceased entered the Stadium, research has established the
       following details:-



           Twenty deceased entered the Stadium before 1430 hours.

           Fifty-nine deceased entered after 1430 hours.

           Three deceased entered at 1430 hours.



       It has not been possible to establish any times the remaining thirteen
       deceased entered the Stadium.

PILE NOTE DATED 12.A.90.


EE HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST - CORONERS T?TIT,Ti!S 93.


Coroners Rule 23 provides that a representative of the enforcing authority
if any has to be present at the inquest.      The term enforcement authority
is defined as having the same meaning as it has in Section 18 7
of the Health & Safety at Work etc., Act 1974*

That Act provides that it is the duty of the Executive to make
adequate arrangements for the enforcement of the relevant statutory
provisions except to the extent that some other authority or class of
authorities is by any of those provisions or by regulations under
Sub-Section 2           made responsible for the enforcement.   Sub-Section
2 provides that the Secretary of State then make regulations for
inter alia Local Authorities to be responsible for enforcement.

I spfi>ke to Mr. Nattress, Area Director of the Health & Safety Executive
at about 9*30 a.m. on the 12th of April about this (i had discussed
this with him a long time previously, but I wanted to be quite sure of
my grounds and the facts.

Mr. Nattress confirmed that at the time of Hillsborough the only enforcing
authority under the Health & Safety at Work Act was the Health &
Safety Executive.
2.   That they had taken the view administratively and had also been
advised legally that the matter was not reportable to them as they
took the view that where a more specific Act such as the Safety at
Sports Ground Act applied, then they were not under a duty or
obligation to enforce the Health & Safety at Work Act 1974*
Mr. Nattress went on to say that Lord Justice Taylor had accepted
this point of view as well.

Ifemade it clear that to take a different view would create considerable
problems, as it seems that as far as I was unable to understand it
that this is a general policy decision that the Health & Safety at Work
Act applies when there is no more specific legislation covering the
same point.

We als<b discussed the reasons for their attendance which was really
to ensure that they knew what was going on which of course they and
everybody else already do.     Strictly speaking the Buies do not of course
give the reasons, they merely state the bold facts.

It seems to me in the light of what Mr. Nattress is saying that this
incident is not reportable to an enforcing authority within the meaning
of the Coroners Rules, as the only enforcing authority, if any, would V
have been the Health and Safety Executive and they have taken the view
that it is not reportable to them.
                               -   2   -



Furthermore, it is perfectly plain that they are fully aware of
the position including the resumption of the Inquest (in fact
Hr. Nattress said that if somebody were to raise this issue he
would come down if necessary in order to avoid any difficulty, though
he would very much prefer not to have to do so, or indeed to have to
allocate anybody else to be present, bearing in mind that he did not
think that it was appropriate, necessary or indeed useful.




I spoke to Joan Taylor and asked her to check whether solicitors
for Sheffield City Council were attending.     They had not replied.
I asked her to phone and to let me know what their response was.
It seems to me that if they are there ^presenting the City Council
at least on Day 1, this should cover the situation.     If they choose
not to attend on other days, that is a matter for them as I
do not think the Rules say that they have to be present     continuously
but merely to be there at the Inquest.     It is up' to them to chose
how much attention they wish to pay to the proceedings.




                                                                        *
FILE NOTE DATED 12.4.90    -



TO BE ADDED TO FILE NOTE OF MR. NATTRERSS.



I asked Joan Taylor to ring Keeble Hawsom, solicitors for

the Sheffield City Council, to check whether they would be

attending on the 18th.    She rang me back to say that a

letter was in the post confirming that they would be there.

In the circumstances I think this would fully meet any

suggestion that a representative of the forces authority

was not present, assuming that one could establish that

the local authority was enforcing authority within the

Health and Safety at Works Act 1974, which does not appear

to be the case.

          INIAAI
   FILE NOTE     2.4.90

   Meeting with D e t . Sup. Beechey, Inspector Mat Sayers, Sgt Treadgold
   Sgt Weigold.


   We discussed various matters in particular a, Inspector Sayers
   was going to look to see what Liversage, Wallis and other P.C's
   have done about identifying people by name to the pathologists
   when they had had them identified at the Medico-Legal Centre,
   b, Mat Sayers was going to obtain a correcting witness statement
   from Weigold confirming the position with regard to identification
   as it actually happened, this is in spite/?^e fact that I indeed
   thought that he had identified during the day as well as just in
   the morning.


   We then spoke about the listings.    I repeated that I wanted cases,
   them to assume    that we will call the pathologists but that when trhey
 _ have done their listings it may be we would have to relent in certain
peases.    Those cases whicfe specifically require the pathologist we
   would have to call them.    We took Stephen   Jones as an example, he
   isn't available in the first week of May, I said in that case it
  was essential that all his cases were listed in April.      We agreed
   that the first set of listing would go out this weekend and that I
  would prepare suitable letters to the Solicitors, the Social Workers,
  the Steering Committee (Mr . Frazer) as well as a letter to the
   family giving the listing dates.    I will also do a further letter to
  the family regarding the Rutland Hotel and twin bedded rooms.      This
  letter would only be used in those cases where accomodation would be
  provided.


^ ^Inspector Sayers would prepare a 'Fact Pack' which would include maps
  and background information to help people who will be comming.      He will
  contain one number at Furnival House for them to ring in case of need.


  At the moment about eleven people have indicated that they do not wish
  to attend, about seventy have said that they do.      I said that I wanted
  the first few days listed in such a way that the last two were always
  non attenders i.e. 6 attenders plus 2 non attenders.      This was in order
  to give a little bit of scope in case we overrun.    We agreed that if we
  then found that things were getting too tight we might lyave to relist
  subsequent weeks.


  We agreed that if for instance I wasn't calling the pathologist and
  the matter arose which needed him, we would probably adjourn to the last
  week in May.     If matters were raised which didn't need adjournment and
  which could be dealt with at a full hearing, assuming that one took
  place, then it could be adjourned until then.
  4
      2.



      We agreed that we would start at 9.30 a.m.except on day one and we
      would have a coffee break and an   hour for lunch 1p.m. to 2.p.m., a
      coffee break in the afternoon and carry on until we have finished.
      It has been arranged so that five people are warned for the morning
      and three for the afternoon. If need be we could tell people if we
   are going to overrun on the day.


   We also need to draft a witness summons for those few witnesses who
  we were calling.


  We discussed the selection of the Jury, I outlined my ideas i.e.
   select eleven by lot and then select the rest again by lot in numerical
   sequence if we needed to bring anybody in because they weren't acceptable
   or bias or otherwise.     I indicated that I would ask the Jury whether
  they were related to the bereaved family, police etc. I will give the
^ ^ l egal representatives an opportunity to add anything to the list that
^^might be appropriate.      I thought the swearing in would take about
  half an hour.     I felt that it might be possible to swear in all the
  Officers at the same time, consecutively but all at once so that we
  would not have to repeat the oath throughout the proceedings. Assuming
  that we could devise a suitable form of wording.


  Apparently not many requests for supplementary information has been
  received, solicitors were saying that they wanted more time, but have
  been told that there wasn't any more available as we were starting.        I
  explained that if they didn't give me any points it didn't really matter
  it would just make life easier for them and for us if we knew beforehand
  if it could not be dealt with on the day it would have to be dealt with
^ ^ i n May or on subsequent adjournments if there were further hearings.
  We discussed relistingand on the whole felt that we would probably
  relist for May unless it was obvious that we would have to carry on in
  the second week of May.     Hopefully however we would manage to get the
  cases done in the time allocated.

       It was very kind of you to write in the way that you did and I will pass
       your letter on to Mervyn Jones.  I know that he will be as pleased to
       read your letter as I was.

       We have learned a great deal from the Inquiry, not least how well the
       Force can respond when asked to face up to a large and unique challenge.
       I know that Mervyn and his colleagues have been greatly encouraged by
       your warm interest and understanding approach and I am sure that will
       bear fruit in the inquests which are due to commence shortly.  I shall
       continue to watch points from my new post which retains a responsibility
       for the West Midlands Force.  I know that it will continue to go from
       strength to strength and its handling of the Hillsborough Disaster
       Inquiry will do much to reinforce confidence in its officers.

       With my very best wishes and regards.     Good luck in the future.

Mr. G. Dear,
Chief Constable,
West Midlands Police,
Headquarters,

Colmore Circus Queensway,
Birmingham. B4 6NQ..

Dear Mr. Dear,

I understand that you will shortly be leaving the West Midlands
Police to take on your new appointment. I would like to take
this opportunity of wishing you all the very best in that
position and tremendous success. I also would like to take
the opportunity of thanking you personally for your interest
and support in the coronal inquiries relating to the Hillsborough
Stadium Disaster.

I am aware that Mr. Mervyn Jones has made recommendations
regarding officers involved with the Hillsborough Stadium
Inquiry, but I want to take this opportunity before you
leave your appointment of saying how very much I have appreciated
the support, energy, professionalism and excellence of Mervyn
Jones. I have been most impressed with the way he has tackled
an exceedingly difficult and large assignment and I feel that
a large part of the credit for the quality of the police work
which has been achieved in this endeavour by the West Midlands
Police is due to his leadership. He was obviously an excellent
choice by you for this difficult task, and I for one appreciate
your wisdom in making it.

TTgTJIPHONK CONVERSATION WITH MERVYN JOHES.


He told me that he had spoken to Chief Supt Tobe who had just received
the Chief Constable's commendation.   He was quite satisfied that
everything was O.K. In fact he told me that quite a lot of other people
had been commended and he would send me the list.   I said that he
had forestalled me as I wanted to discuss with him what we should do about this.
He said that obviously what I decided to do in court or what announcements I
would care to make was a matter for me, though clearly if I felt that
any <£ the staff should be commended he would be pleased.
We agreed that we would probably meet on Tuesday, to discuss any other
matters.   He would be away for a few days but he could be contacted
if necessary.
   FILE NOTE BATED ^0.3.90.


   I have had numerous conversations with Chief Inspector To^eabout the
   continuity relating to the identification to the pathologists.
   I made it clear that my recollection of events was that Sgt. Wiegold
   knew that the pathologists were going to come in batches, and that
   he had agreed to return two or three times during the day in order to
   carry out the identifications.    I have to admit that although that was
   my feeling of the situation, bearing in mind the passage of time, it
   was just possible that I was mistaken.        On the other hand, I had also
   spoken to Graham Marsden and his recollection was similar to mine.


   Nevertheless I maie it clear to Inspector Tope that if this had not
^^^happened then we would just have to accept the circumstances as they
   were and see whether we could prove the identity/continuity by some
   other means.


   Inspector Tope contacted me and told me that Inspector Timms said that
   as far as his recollection was concerned Sgt Wiegold had not come back.
   He had also spoken to Simon who said that he didn't think he had returned
   but that he would check his pocketbook just to make sure and would then
   get in touch with him.


   We agreed that Inspector Tope would arrange for the pathologists to be
   conta ded with a view to sorting out what was what.


^ ^ I n any event a supplemental statement from Wiegold was necessary to sort out
   those cases where identification had been made to him but by number only
   rather than by name and number.

DICTATED 22.3.90. MEETING WITH CHIEF INSPECTOR TOEE AND A COLLEAGUE
at :                _________


C/l Tobe brought another stack of files to be read.    We
discussed two problems.    In particular 1.   The blood alcohol
samples and in particular the bottles.     I told him that
as far as I could tell, blood had gone into fluid dated bottles
1.e., those little yellow ones.   He had formed the impression
that they had been decanted.    In the end we agreed that he would
re-interview all the continuity, that he was re-interviewing
the continuity officers to see what actually happened.
2.   We discussed the continuity evidence of Mr. Wiegold and
Mr. Timms.   I explained to him that all the pathologists were
not present furst thing on Sunday morning.    Some came in the
late morning, afternoon and early evening.    As far as I was concerned
I had understood that Mr. Weigold had identified the people to
each batch so to speak of pathologists and that he had returned
appropriately to the Medico-Legal Centre.     C/l Tobe and his
colleague were a bit doubtful about this but they said that
they would re-interview or inquire as to what actually happened.
I made it absolutely clear to them that whilst I wanted to
get statements correct and accurate, obvihusly I only wanted
truthful accounts recorded and if things were not done in
the way in which I thought they were, then clearly I would have
to be told and that I would have to live with the situation or
find some other way of establishing the continuity.
We thought that what might have happened was that Mr. Timms
was/W1$r. Weigold and certainly Timms was present at the
Medico-Legal Centre on Sunday and might in fact have done the
identifications.   We left it that they inquired and found out
what was what.
I also agreed that I would find out the timing for the pathologists.
I got Pauline to ring out and it would appear that Professor
Underwood turned up about 10.15 in the morning, Professor Henry
at 2. Dr. Shortland at 2, Dr. Seva and Denmark in the evening.
As far as I can recollect the remainder i.e.,Usher,Slater,
Jones and Clarke were all present in the morning.
C/l Tobe explained to me that the Wiegold statement, there was
a master statement and then there were subsiduary statements
which were based upon it and which were numbered as Master
Statement number plus numeric codes.     The Master Statements    dated
as said that the identification was made to Professor Usher
and his team.    As far as I could tell it didn't seem to refer
to Inspector Timms.
My impression is that the statements taken from Wiegold ^fafjlfactoryj
                               -   2   -



and we will probably have to re-do a good number.
FILE NOTE.   DATED 22.5.90.


I had a telephone conversation with Mervyn 21.3*90.     I told him
that I was a little bit worried about O/lnspector Tope.     He
had brought one of the files and there was an error on it and
he looked exceedingly crestfallen that this had happened.
I said I realised that he was being pushed very hard, and
I felt that I ought to mention it to him.
Mervyn than said that he would bear this in mind.     He wanted to know
if I was satisfied with what I was getting and I said yes,
but it was quite hard work reading it all.
FILE NOTE DATED 20.5.90.


I spoke to Inspector Tobe.   I told him what Professor Jones had
said regarding blood alcohol.   He said that the arrangements were
in hand to talk to the appropriate officers (incidentally Professor
Jones said that all the           labels had been counter-signed by
the pathologists as weli), well at least he had counter-signed them,
but presumably they are no longer available.   The bottles are
now in the fridge at the Hallamshire.
FILE NOTE.   19.5.90.

Had a telephone conversation with Inspector Tobe.     He said that he
was hoping to send summaries out or begin to send them out this week.
The first letter Hills/Sol/l had gone.     He was working on the comments
and amendments which I had made.     He has already got a statement
from Inspector Timms.     He had noticed that Dr. Seva referred to Mr.
G. Timms where it should have been Inspector Timms.     I said that
provided we got the continuity right I wasn't too concerned about
an initial in the p.m. report.     He said that he was sitting preparing
a comprehensive statement for Dr. Seva to deal with all the outstanding
points.
I explained that I thought it was very important to have the
continuity to the pathologists in apple pie order.
I said that I was sorry that I was picking up      i relatively lots of
trivial points but I felt that I ought to draw them to their attention.
I repeated that the important thing was to get on sending out the
summaries and therefore dealing with thd matters raised in the letters
Reference H/COMMENTS.     The points raised in the other letter H/FILES
we needed a little bit more time for.     Chief Inspector Tobe mentioned
ikwbmalikapahad raised that one of the p.m's of Dr. Jones, namely
Stxxy^SBvonside's name had been incorrectly spelt.     He thought a
letter from Professor Jones would be quite sufficient and I agreed.



Sgt. Tredgold rang.     He confirmed that the only person who didn't have
representation was Tracey Cox (he had previously told me that it
was Paula Smith according to his records) but I think that must
have been a misunderstanding.    He mentioned that he had heard
that I wanted to start with case No. 95, Nicholls, but I said I
didn't think that that was wise.    He said in aay event, he didn't
agree that it would be a good idea because it was the anniversary of
t|ie child's death.   I passed on to him the information regarding
the Bells and their holiday.    We agreed that we would fax any letters
listing consldaations to him at Furnival House.    I requested Joan to
organise that.

He said he had heard about the Inquests but wondered whether it was necessary
for him to be present at this particular junction.     I explained that it
wasn't for me to advise him on that, but also told him what I had
already discussed with the other solicitors «namely that the Inquest
that the Inquest would be limited to establish who the deceased was,
when and where he died.    That the contents would be non-contraversial.
That we would not be dealing with the how or who to blame insofar as one did.
That I would not allow any criticism of anybody or person and that no
South Yorkshire Police Officers would give evidence, though some of their
statements might possibly be read.
I told him that we were intending to have the opening day when we would
be taking certain            evidence and perhaps one or two inquests
and it might be that he should consider coming along then and then
forming a judgement.
I said that I didn*t know about him otherwise I would have contacted
him.     He said that he would be writing to me.   I confirmed that I
entirely accepted that Mr. Duckenfield would be a properly interested
party.
Mervyn Jones rang.

1. " He didn’t particularly like the letter Hills/Sol/2.    He thought that
     having read the summaries some of the people might be upset because
     of their rather cool tone and very factual presentation.    He thought
     that it might be a good idea to re-write the letter to explain this
     to the solicitors.    He was very apologetic about mentioning it.            c
     I re-assured him and said that I would do it.

2.   He talked about the Memorial Hall and we agreed that provided it
     was available, we would use it Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.
     He thought that this might be more convenient particularly with
     moving video equipment and so on.    I raised the question of whether
     it was licensed premises and he said that he would look into it.
3. I asked him whether he was concerned about all the amendments which I
     was making but he felt that they were perfectly satisfactory.


4. He wanted to be sure that I was content and happy with what I was
     getting.


5.   He was a bit concerned that amendments had to be made.     This was probably
     due to the speed at which we were proceeding.    ( I think he didn't realise
     at the time when we fixed the date how much work had to be done at Nechells).
     The main point of his call was that he was making arrangements for next
     Tuesday to bring up his seven reporting officers.     He wanted to run
     a 'mock Inquest' with them in order to see how it would be done.      In
     addition he was meeting with Social Workers to show them around the
     court etc.   He wanted to know if I wanted to be associated and take
     part in any of this.    I first of all wondered whether it would be
     a good use of time but upon reflection I think it will be very useful
     because we actually be able to do some trial runs.     I confirmed that
     the court would be available.




     Later on the 19th I phoned him back.    He told me that,he was unavailable
     but then rang me.     I read him the text of the drafted of letter with
     which he was happy.    He then told me that the premises had a licence,
     He had ascertained that it wasn't available on Friday but Thursday
      afternoon there was a dance and he was a bit worried about that.     We
agreed that Sue Harper who was coining up on Friday would meet up with
    I would go round and we would take a final decision on what to do.
PILE NOTE DATED 14.3.90. MEETING ON THE 13th OF MARCH 1990 AT 146 MELTON
ROAD. PRESENT S.L.P. D.S. BEECHEY, C.I. TOBE, INSP. LEIGHTON, INSPC.
SAWYERS AND SGT TREDGOLD.______________________________ *____________


The meeting was convened at the request of Supt. Beechey who had various
things which he wanted to raise with me,    in particular, the contacting
of solicitors.     I prepared a draft letter which I read to the group
and this was agreed with one modification namely that we should add a
paragraph making it clear that summaries did not necessarily summarise
every single statement which was available,           in fact
covered a good number of the points which Supt. Beechey wanted to discuss
with me.
We spent some time discussing various other matters, in particular we
talked about the plans.     It was agreed that Inspector Leighton would
let me have a composite plan showing the various locations at which people
were being seen.     These would be based on the visual evidence which
he had looked at rather than verbal statements from people.     Some
doubt was expressed as to the validity of location of evidence by
deponents, as of course it was very difficult to remember precisely
where anybody was at any point in time.     It was agreed that a folder
with the plans would be provided for me.     I thought that this would
probably be satisfactory as I did feel that I needed to have something
as files were otherwise imcomplete or in some respect incomprehensible,
and also because it would mean that we would inevitably have to use
photographic and video evidence.     I did not rule out using this if
it was necessary but I preferred to start with the plan (Irealise
that some statements refer to plans which are not in the folders)
but in the light of what is said about them I think we will have
sufficient to be able to deal with the matter satisfactorily.     In any
event all the plans are in fact available and will be at the Inquest
if I need them and of course are in the police master files.
We discussed the video evidence.     It was agreed that we would need
the equipment in Sheffield and that we would have the videos ready so that
if need be, sequences could be shown, similarly with photographs.
We discussed the video recorders and the police would look to see
what they had available at Furnival House.     We thought that we would
probably need to have this equipment on the first day as well though
it was unlikely that we would have to show anything.
It was agreed that the letter to solicitors would be sent out by Nechells*
I would sign one copy and they would send out photocopies out to everybody.
I also agreed that I would do another letter which would accompany
the summaries. We agreed that despite reservations from Mr. Frazer,
we would send out the summaries as they became available and explain^
the position to the solicitors in the first letter.      I said that I hoped
that summaries could start going out towards the end of this week
or certainly at the beginning of next, but obviously the first letter
would have to go, so that the people would know what was happening.
We discussed the presence of Inspector Leighton at the Inquest.      I said
I felt that he really had to be there throughout.
We talked about the pathologists.    I said I had not yet decided
which cases that we would have to call a pathologist.
We talked about the listing.   This would be dealt with by Sgt. Tredgold.
They wanted to know what my requirements or criteria were.      I said
that we should start off by listing in pathologist's order, but subject
to modification.    We should take people who were connected together,
even if that produced a conflict with consideration one.      We should take
^simple cases first and more difficult cases later, both throughout the
days and during the days.    We should list cases where we expected non-
attenders towards the end of the day and not at the beginning.
We would obviously have to take into account availability but that
was not an overiding    consideration, and people might have to bend a bit.
It was agreed that I would get in touch with the pathologists and ask
them about their availabilities.
During the course of the meeting Mr. Frazer rang.       He had received the
summary of Mr. Thomas Howard No.81.       He said that it seemed satisfactory.
He only had two comments.    One was the alcohol levels.     He wondered
whether it would be possible to add something to the summary to indicate
how many pints of beer equivalents that particular level was.       I said
 I didn't think that that would be possible though I hoped that maybe
 one could discuss this sort of question at the opening of the Inquest.
                                      7
The other point he made was the piecemeal disclosure.       He said that he
 thought that this might create some problems with families unless we carefully
 explained it beforehand.    I said this was already in hand.
 He told me that there had been some developements with regard to the
         damages.   It had now been agreed that the Insurers pay one
 thousand pounts                                  subject to anybody in
 particular who had suffered excessive distress receiving more but in
 that case it would have to be proved.

Supt. Beechey rang to say that the Town Hall was not available but
that they are offering us the Memorial Hall.   Was it in order for him
to go and inspect it and could he if he thought it was suitable,
agree to it.   I said certainly.
PILE NOTE DATED 14.5.90.


After the meeting on the 13th I had a short conversation with
Inspector Tobe about the amendments to the five files
which I have already read.   He agreed to amend the             sheet
for Inger Shah and to correct the typeographical error in Case
No.4*   the certificate of death.   We discussed the discrepancy
and findings which I have noticed and he said that in fact
there was reference to support the figures they have put in and
that he would let me have this.      .4      ,,

We discussed the identification o£ Sgt Wei/ particularly in relation
to Dr. Siva's statements                  to Inspector Timms.   Apparently
 Ct (              was (?u^ e distressed but he felt that this
ws& something which could be sorted out and in fact in some cases
had been.   }lr   was just the form of the wording of the statement
rather than anything else.
PILE NOTE DATED 14.5.90.


Sgt Tredgold and ?Sgt/lnspector              one of Inspector Leighton's
team came to see me.They brought me another 10 files. Th^rconfirmed
the fact that the Memorial Hall seemed satisfactory (in fact Stan
Beechey had phoned and had said that he had lookedat it and he thought
it was very satisfactory). I said I washappy    with that.   The only query
I had was loud speaking equipment.    They were a bit concerned about
this telephone equipment for the Press.    This is something we will
have to think about bearing in mind that we are only there for a day.
They wanted to know whether it was a fact that I wanted to do 4 Inquests
on day 1. I said No,    definitely not more than 2.   These should be simple
ones.    Furthermore it would be advantageous that we have two which
were, where the solicitor was Mr. Frazer as he would be there anyway.
        showed me a schedule showing the number of cases which were
related either by blood or by association.     Surprisingly there are
32 people in those categories.    The related cases are 1 and 81.
23 and 34. 25 and 70.    27 and 84. 9 and 43. 19 and 63. 8 and 87.
57, 60 and90.     64 and 89. 66 and 67. 14, 17,52. 2 and 20.    3 and Jl.
26 and 45* 44 and 55*
They also informed me that they had started work on the plans and
they hoped to let me have these by Friday.
FILE NOTE.


After we had a brief meeting in the office to discuss the Inquest
review which on the whole had gone quite well, it was pointed out
to me that I had referred to the solicitor for Hammond Suddard
as Mr. Kennedy and it should have been Mr. Metcalf.     It was also
pointed out to me that Inspector Leighton would deal with the videos
rather than explaining                though he no doubt could do that
as well.   Mr. Jones told me that the solicitors for the Club had
indicated that they would like a copy of the summary.     I thought
on balance that whilst I didn't mind letting Hammond Suddard have
it, I wasn't too keen on handing them out to all.     Initially Mr.
Jones was of the opinion that it would be a good idea to let
everybody have it who wanted it but Inspector Tobe pointed out
that one could argue that these summaries were really related to the
relatives but there was a danger of breach of confidence and that in a
sense it would perhaps be better if we only allowed solicitors for the
relatives to have the summaries and let everybody else hear them at
the Inquests.     I think on balance that that is the sensible thing
and will have to just be fairly firm on this point.
We discussed sending out summaries.    It was agreed that a copy
would go to the Hillsborough Steering Committee (Mr. Frazer)
as well as to the respective solicitors.    They thought that it would
perhaps be sensible that once I had approved the summaries t&ey e©»M
be sant out by West Midlands as opposed to my office, as this would
save time.   We agreed that the documentation would come to me via
Inspector Tobe.    I would return it dither approved or amended to Supt.
Beechey who will then make the necessary corrections and when that had
been done would arrange to send them out Street from Nechells with
a standard covering letter from me which obviously needs preparing.
We felt that it might be a good idea if circulation of notification
of dates^w^r^. t^one by telex we would have confirmation of receipt
by the solicitors,/ We would expect solicitors to notify their clients
we would write to them direct as well, probably recorded delivery, and
also no doubt the Social Workers would let them know.     We thought that
that should be sufficient.
We discussed the extent to which the evidence would go (this is aaother
point raised by Mr. Devonside and his solleagues).     They wanted to-
know   at what point the evidence would stop.   Would it be merely up
to the mortuary or beyond.     I said that probably up to the temporary
mortuary but obviously if there were any particular difficulties we
would do our best to try and answer the questions as far as we could.
Inspector Tobe said that on the whole the evidence went beyond that-
and would take a body right up to identification and the Medico Legal Centre.
It obviously depends upon the evidence in any particular case.        We
agreed that they would let me have summaries, the first batch to-morrow.
We spent some time discussing a Jury, and problems in relation to this
as obviously people who were related should be excluded but it is
difficult to know where t’
                         a draw the line         other matters and in
particular we wanted to avoid any possible suggestion that we were
handpicking a Jury which of course was not the intention.    I
decided that I would have a word with Mr. Sturt to see how they
tackled this particular problem.
Mr. Jones had brought a Press   Officer with him who prepared a press
release.   A meeting wasbeing   convened at Fumival House for 5p.m.
It was agreed that I would not be present at that.    Mr. Jones was
concerned about the length of the Inquests and was worried about starting
at 9*50 as he could seethat the Inquests might go on to very late in the
evening.   I said that   it might well be that some of   themwould take
rather less time than    we had estimated and in particular it seemed that
there would be anumber of families who would not be      attending.   Presumably
these would be ratherquicker.   We thought it would be a good idea
if we tried to ascertain from the Social Workers whether they were
aware of the familes who had indicated that they did not wish to attend,
and providing that we had stifficient numbers, they could try and schedule
2 a day say of non-attenders. We initially thought that it might be
a good idea to put these on in the morning.    This would give extra
time for people to arrive in Sheffield but on reflection we felt that
it might be better to have them in the evening-,’ partly because people
would be getting tired at that point and partly because it would enable us
to slot the non-attenders in whenever it was convenient to do so.
Mr. Jones is going to try and have a word with the Social Workers on the
7th of March.   Inspector Tobe thought that he should be able to let me have
a final report round about the 21st or 22nd of March.     Obviously the rate
would depend upon the number of alterations that I would want to make
to the documentation.
We spent some time discussing the listing as it is very important
to find out who is not going to attend, as this will affect the
way in which we would call people.
We also agreed that we would send out summaries on a piecemeal basis
and not send them out in large batches.    In other words as soon as
we approve them they could go Jo the solicitors to give them a little
bit of extra time.
FILE NOTE DATED 5.3.90. TELEPHONE CALL FROM MERVYN JONES.
IN THE M O R N I N G . ______________________________


He said that they were coming over on Tuesday and then the young
lady dealing with the matter would stay for Wednesday to meet
with the Council.   She hoped to have hard figures available for
the Local Authority.
I told him that I had already spoken to Mr. Michie and I had arranged
a meeting for 11.30 on Wednesday and that I anticipated your particular
problems but they quite understood the reasons they felt they wanted
to get thd lines completely clear.
FILE NOTE.


Mervyn Jones rang again in the afternoon, of the 27.2.90.
He confirmed that the Press Conference had gone quite well.
He confirmed that he was coming up to Sheffield and that he
would see me around 12-o-clock, that is when I told him that
I would be free with the Inquests.   We would have a jolly
good look at the Medico Legal Centre.   Sue Harper had done a
great deal of work and there were lots of things to consider,
e.g., toilets and curtains and so on.   In particular I had thought
of making sure that the fire risks could be covered Ind would I
object if he had a word with the Fire Prevention Officer.
They were thinking of as many things as they could because he was
very anxious that nothing should be forgotton,   Imt he was
very conscious that I might feel that I would lose control of the
situation.   I thanked him for the thought and confirmed that I
had no objection to hia speaking to t he Fire Officer and said
that although it would be nice to think that I could think of
everything myself, the truth of the matter was that I couldn't.
The other thing that worried him was that John Batley would be
upset if they started messing around with the Medico-Legal Centre
and Portacabins etc., and did not want him to feel that he was
being excluded.   I said that I didn't think that was likely as
John Batley was now very very busy, having taken on additional
responsibilities, but that it would be sensible to mention it
to him.

Mervyn Jones when he rang me in fact mentioned the possibility of
me staying in Sheffield during the Inquest,   which I have been thinking
about, and we agreed that he would make a tentative booking for me
when they made arrangements for their accommodation.   He thought it would be
useful and also of course safer particularly if I was very busy.
  FILE NOTE DATED 27..2.90.


  I spoke to one of the Hillsborough Support Team members at about 5-o-clock.
  I explained that we were having a meeting on Tuesday (he already knew
  this from Mervyn who had rung     on the morning).   We had a brief
  conversation.   I explained that they were welcome to come
  and subject of course to space.
  She was tinder the impression that we were only going to take the medical
  evidence, but I explained that we were going to do rather more than that,
^^but we were not going to deal with co rtraversial matters.     What we were
  trying to do was to establish the medical cause of death and where the
  deceased were, and if possible when they died.       She wanted to know what
  would happen later on.   I said that this would be something I had been
  discussing at the meeting or the Inquest review but it depended upon
  what happened with the D.P.P.

Spoke to Chief Inspector Tope.    I said that on reflection I thought that
even in those cases where the blood alcohols were negative, we ought
to mention this in the summary.   After some discussion, Inspector To^e
thought that perhaps it might be more convenient to let the parties
see the summary sheet which of course gives blood alcohols, because
they would then have a further opportunity of verifying the data.
I was satisfied with that.   The point really being that I thought
that negative alcohols were of course very important to the parties
and it was better to have the complete accounts so to speak.   He confirmed
that they were working very hard on the documentation.
FIIE NOTE. dated 27.2.90.


I met John Batley by chance after this conversation with Mervyn,
and I explained what they had in mind including wanting his ;office.
I told him Mervyn's fears and what I had said.     John Batley said that
he was exceedingly, that he was more than happy they were involved,
though it would be nice if he was kept informed.     In addition of
course, he would do everything he could to help and in particular,
if we wanted to deal with Portacabins, he knew all about services
and electricitj.es ,supplies and what have you and either he or
Linda could supply us with information and help.


He confirmed that temporary planning permission might be required
for Portacabins but he did not think that this would be a problem.


He also confirmed that there was a Fire Certificate available and
that he would let me have a copy.
FILE NOTE DATED 27.2.90. MERVYN JOKES PHONED IN THE MORNING.
He and the Press Officers had recast the Press Notice.   He read
it to me.   I made a few minor suggestions, subject to that it seemed
perfectly alright.   They had also decided that it would be more sensible
to have a Press Conference and try and deal with any issues which
might arise at that Conference.   I was timed for 11-o-clock in the
morning.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - RESUMED INQUESTS

You will no doubt have heard by now that Dr S L Popper, H M Coroner, has
decided to re-convene the Inquests in Sheffield on Monday, 19 November
1990. The purpose of the Inquests will now be to deal with the generality of
what occurred on 15 April last year.      It is unlikely that the individual
Inquests will be opened as far as the deceased are concerned unless the
Coroner is convinced that there are good grounds to do so. However, if he
does accede to such requests he will do so on an individual basis.

The purpose of m y writing to you is to ask you if you intend to resume a
role in supporting those families who intend to visit the Inquests. I have no
idea at this stage how many of those families do intend to come to Sheffield or
know who they are.

For your information, I have now reduced m y team to a total of eight people
and these will be fully engaged in supporting the Coroner and I do not
intend to recall any police officers to undertake any supporting roles for the
families. The Coroner has asked me therefore to write to you to see what
you would propose to do, if anything, in conjunction or otherwise with Social
Services agencies in other parts of the country, particularly Merseyside.

I look forward to hearing from you in due course.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - INQUESTS

I thought I would take this opportunity to write to you and advise you that the
Coroner has decided to re-convene the Inquests in Sheffield on Monday,
19 November 1990.

The purpose of these Inquests will be to consider the generality of what
occurred at Hillsborough but not to go into details of the individual deaths as
this evidence was taken in April/May of this year.

I have had a number of long discussions with Dr Popper, the Coroner, and we
both agree that it is likely that we will have to call yourself and/or members of
your staff to give evidence to his Inquests. Consequently I will be in touch in
the not too distant future to arrange a meeting with your goodself and the
Coroner to discuss the evidence that you can give and what would be
appropriate to be given. Dr Popper has had sight of your report and believes
that there are many very relevant and interesting issues which will have to be
aired.

I look forward to seeing you in due course.

With best wishes,

FILE NOTE DATED 24.10.90.

Meeting with Mervyn Jones, Stan Beechey, Caroline Perkins

and Sue Harper for part of the time and myself at Nechells

Police Station, 2 4 . 1 0 . 9 0 . ___________________________________

A long meeting to discuss progress on preparation for the

Inquest. Caroline made a few notes which she will

circulate.    We discussed various matters including the

accommodation.     Sue Harper reported progress.       Apparently

it was not possible to make accommodation available for the

Jury in the canteen.     Whilst they were prepared to provide

light meals in the jury room, I felt that on balance,

taking everything into account, we ought to give the Jury

their entitlement and let them go and fend for themselves,

subject to appropriate warnings.

We discussed the location of the T.V. screens and Videos,

Overhead Projectors, Audio equipment for the audio tapes.

Sue Harper would be liaising and sorting things out and

making sure that it was all dealt with properly.           It would

appear that we were getting a lot of co-operation from the

local authority.     Council meetings were scheduled for

November the 28th and January the 9th.         In addition to that

there was a meeting on the 6th of December and the Mandela

and Committee Room would not be available.

Jackie Harrison, the West Midlands Police Press Officer had

               the Press in hand.

We discussed attendance at the Pre Inquest Review and

agreed that we would restrict this to legal representatives




BACAAY
                             -      2   -




and interested parties only so as to deal with procedural

m att e r s .

We discussed warning police officers of their likely

attendance and I said that on balance I felt that it would

be best if we alerted everybody who was on the list that

they were potential witnesses, we could then be more

selective.

 We discussed the final list of witnesses.       I said I would
                                            ojt.
rl 1-fee this as soon as possible, probably £© the end of next

week.     We agreed that we would allow witnesses to have a

look at their recollections or statements.               These would be

provided on the day.      We discussed the financing, travel

arrangements.     Apparently vouchers can be issued.            We

thought this should be dealt with by Sgt. Tredgold possibly

using Social Services as liaison.

We discussed t h e ^m b u r s e m e n t of expenses of witnesses.        I

said I thought on the whole this should be dealt with by

the local authority, though Sgt. Tredgold might have to do

a little bit with the collecting of forms and so on.                 A

suitable pro-forma will have to be drafted.

We discussed documents and exhibits.               We agreed that as far

as possible we should try and restrict these.               Mr. Jones is

very much against h a v i n g <2^       bundles.     He found that these

had been very confusing at the Public Inquiry.               The matter

would be compounded of course because of the Jury.               I said

I favoured using the minimum of documentary evidence,

preferring witnesses to read out relevant sections.               We




BACAAY
agreed that we would continue with consequtive numbering.

It looked as if we would probably need 20 copies of each

exhibit or document.   One for each of the solicitors 4 for

the Jury, 1 for me, 1 for Mr. Jones, 1 for the shorthand

writer and a couple of spares or so.    We agreed that if the

solicitors wanted to introduce any documents, they would

have to produce the copies that were required.      We could

not provide the service.   We discussed the transcripts.       I

explained that these would be charged for for the benefit

of Sheffield.   That meant of course that Sheffield should

have to deal with the photocopying etc.    I said that we

would see how many we would need after our meeting on the

30th.

We discussed letter from Mr.Glover.    I said I would reply

to it.   They would deal with any police matters.    We again

discussed the scope of the Inquest and decided that a

convenient point at which we ought to draw the line would

be the arrival of the first ambulance on the pitch.     This

was really intended as a marker.   We agreed that we would

have to be fairly firm to avoid too much straying into post

incident.

I explained that the only problem I could see was that if

somebody had alleged that the medical treatment had caused

the death.   I felt that if that was put forward as a

serious suggestion, one might have to take that inquest

out, making it plain that no-one deal with it on that basis

and not as part of the Hillsborough Disaster.    We thought




BACAAY
that it might be a good idea to make this point at the

procedural meeting.

I suggested that we try and find out how many people had

filled in questionnaires/given statements or who claimed to

be in Pen 3.    I thought this might possibly   be a back-up

check on the calculations of Mr. Burns and the H.S.E.

We discussed the experts.    We felt that we would have

Mr. Philips, Mr. Stalker, Mr. Burns, H.S.E. numbers to be

decided.   On the whole, we thought we wouldn't pursue the

Cranfield Disaster as it looked as if this would not be

helpful in sorting out the issue before us.

We discussed the PACE statements and in the end felt that

it was right to use these.    It was agreed that I would

write to find out whether videos would be available. We

noted that there were two or three who had refused videos.

I would have to check who they were before I sent the

letter.    The people who refused the videos were Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Greenwood,

everybody else agreed.

FILE NOTE BATED 25.2.90. (Dictated 27.2.90.’)
I phoned Mervyn Jones at his home and discussed the proposed
Inquest and in particular the need for a Jury.   I explained to
him that I had been thinking about this and that I had come
to the conclusion that in view of the fact that if the D.P.P.
were to bring a prosecution and I were to adjourn and not resume,
it might be argued that the Inquest, which if I did it without
a Jury would have been dealt with entirely without one was
annulity and I thought that on balance it was safer to have one.
I said I was sorry about this in many ways, but I thought that
from a legal point of view it would be safer.
Mervyn agreed.
                        MEETING TO DISCUSS INQUESTS

                         Thursday 22 February 1990
                               at 1130 hours

               Held in the office of ACC(HI) at Lloyd House


Present:   ACC(HI) Mr Jones
           HM Coroner, Dr Popper
           Detective Chief Inspector Tope
           Detective Sergeant McCombie
           Woman Detective Sergeant Appleton



Mr Jones introduced all persons present, outlining their roles
during the Inquests.  He explained that Superintendent Smith, Police
Personnel, would be joining the meeting in order to monitor welfare
aspects, he would be liaising with Dr Rowan the Force Psychologist.

1•    IS AN INQUEST NECESSARY?

     Dr Popper opened the meeting by explaining that he hoped to hold
      'limited' inquests sometime in April, he wished to exclude
     from the inquests anything which could impede the Director of
     Public Prosecutions' decision, or criticisms by any person
     against any organisation or individual.   The proposal to hold
     such inquests has come from the solicitors to the bereaved and we
     would like to say 'okay we can meet you up to a certain point'.
     Hammond Suddards, acting for South Yorkshire Police, are also
     requesting similar information in order for them to settle the
     legal claims.

     WDS Appleton expressed the importance of laying down the initial
     ground rules and the need to 'sell' the idea to the solicitors of
     the relatives.

     Dr Popper said he intended to inform the solicitors by:-

     (a)   A letter backed up by verbal explanation.
     (b)   Pre-Inquest Review (see item number 16)

     It will be of great importance to get the wording of the letter
     correct, it will be the information contained in that which will
     make up the minds of the solicitors whether or not to agree to
     going ahead with early inquests.

     Depending on the feedback from these two means of information a
     decision will have to be made whether to go ahead with the early
     inquests.  We a l r e a d y have the support of the Hillsborough
     Steering Committee, but we must have total commitment from all
     relatives of the 95 deceased.

     The information the families want to know is:-
                               - 2 -


(a)    Was it my lad/lass who died?

(b)    Where were they in the stadium?

(c)   What did they die of,   themedical cause?

(d)   Did they suffer?

(e)   Where were they seen,were they     dead or alive,where   were
       they on the pitch?

(f)   Can we blame somebody for this, criminally (which  we will
      not deal with) and civilly (which is outside the Coroner's
      jurisdiction, but which can be dealt with to a large extent
      by the questions outlined (a) to (e)).

We need to make it plain from the outset that we will not deal
with the responsibility aspect.  Once thesolicitors have grasped
this Dr Popper believed that they will take what we areoffering
rather than nothing.

WDS Appleton felt that conflict would arise when families wish to
question police officers about the treatment given to their loved
one.

Dr Popper replied that if any questions arise with regard to
liability then it must be stated at the time "sorry, but we are
not dealing with that aspect at this time we are only dealing
with the factual medical evidence".

A number of points were raised with regard to possible
complaints raised at the inquests against any police officer who
is willing to give evidence.

It was concluded that the best way to attempt to avoid this
aspect is to put the evidence to the solicitors in the form of a
precis.

Mr Jones stated that in the letter to the solicitors we must
state that - in the inquests you may well hear matters which your
clients may define as complaints, we must ask that these
complaints be put in writing - and say that we do not intend to
call these officers to give evidence at this stage.

Dr Popper said that his view is to send the letter and serve the
precis on the solicitors saying "this is what is going to be
given to the Court, are you content with this?"  If they are
content then we serve nothing else.  If they are not content then
Dr Popper felt that they should be allowed to see the relevant
statements pre-inquest.  Ideally we need everything agreed before
we go ahead with the inquests.
     Mr Jones asked "Do we need an inquest".

     Dr Popper stated that early inquests were necessary in order to
     obtain the medical evidence so that the death certificates can be
     released.  There may be no other opportunity to do this
     depending on the DPP's decision.

     DCI Tope felt that not all the families will want to criticise
     the actions of the police officers and they have already been
     shown a lot of visual evidence and, therefore, know the answers
     to a lot of the questions.

     After some discussion it was decided that the ideal option would
     be to conduct the inquests without any South Yorkshire Police
     officer being called.

     Dr Popper said that we have to sell the idea to Hammond
     Suddards, Solicitors acting for South Yorkshire Police, as it is
     important that they are happy with the go ahead of early
     inquests. He did not envisage any problem from this aspect as
     Hammond Suddards need the inquests in order to settle the civil
     claims.

     DS McCombie felt that a lot of South Yorkshire Police officers
     may feel let down if they are not allowed to 'say their bit
     and put the record straight' at the inquests.

     Dr Popper stated that it will be impossible to please everybody,
     but we do not want to displease everybody.  If this is the likely
     outcome then we should forget the idea of early inquests, but if
     we present this firmly and fairly to the solicitors, Dr Popper
     felt they will feel it would be better to have this limited
     information rather no information.

     Mr Jones said that from the feedback after submitting the precis
     to the solicitors we could determine the simple and straight­
     forward inquests and conduct those first of all, followed by any
     which we feel may be awkward, ie the 'Crusaders' who may want to
     call police officers to give evidence and which could lead to
     further complaints.

     Dr Popper stated that we need a 'model' precis to work on and
     decide, bearing in mind the content of the precis, whether we
     can run the inquests.

1224 hours - Chief Constable, Mr G J Dear, joined the meeting and was
             introduced to HM Coroner, Dr Popper.

A short discussion took place to inform Mr Dear of the progress of the
meeting with regard to whether the inquests should go ahead early.
Explaining the possibility of further complaints against police if care
is not taken in the planning stage of the inquests.
1240 hours - Superintendent Smith joined the meeting and was introduced
              to Dr Popper.

1243 hours - Mr Dear left the meeting.

1245 hours - Meeting adjourned for lunch.

During lunch discussions took place debating the need for the early
inquests, the feelings of the families and also the commendable actions
of South Yorkshire Police officers.

1338 hours - Meeting resumed.

     Dr Popper reopened the meeting by saying that it might be an idea
     to prepare a model precis and test it on Miss E Steel,
     Hillsborough Steeting Committee, after which we could discuss the
     outcome.

2.    FORMAT OF THE INQUEST

     The Inquests would follow the below format

      (a)   The opening statement

      (b)   Pathologist

      (c)   Precising Officer's evidence

      (d)   Visual evidence (Inspector Layton)

      (e)   Another witness.

     Dr Popper stated that an obvious issue which will be raised will
     be the alcohol level in the blood, Dr Forest, a Pathologist from
     Glasgow, will be called to give evidence at this stage.   There
     is no evidence to prove that alcohol caused the mis-behaviour of
     a particular person, alcohol did not increase the risk of
     asphixia.

     Mr Jones stated that certain factors interact, for example we
     believe 25 people came through gate 'C ' on its opening, he then
     asked if the proportions of people with alcohol in the
     bloodstream were comparable to the number who entered through
     gate 'C '- (DCI Tope to investigate and reply to Mr Jones).

3.   TYPE OF PRECIS NEEDED

     Anacapa will be used in conjunction with the precis to give a
     fuller picture of what happened on 15 April 1989.  The actual
     precis is not to be too short and not too long, but a succinct
     and factual series of events from the time the person awoke that
morning to being placed in the gymnasium, detailing pertinent
points, noting as you go along that a certain witness would be a
good witness to call to give evidence.  The precis would be
consistent with that of a 'sudden death report'.

A team of approximately 10 officers will be assigned to write the
precis's in order to spread the stress of the Inquests and
writing of the 95 precis.  DCI Tope to detail manpower to act as
Precising Officers and commence work immediately.  Will also need
a Listing Clerk to sort out the order and timings of Inquests,
ie which bodies to run consecutively, which should be done first
with the more difficult cases at the end.

Typist - need a typist to be committed to typing the body files.
Agreed to use Sue Arkinstall and another typist.

Explore - whether to serve Anacapa on continuous sheet or to
photocopy each one and number the pages for easy reference.

Copies of precis and Anacapa needed would be - one for Dr Popper,
one for Mr Jones and one to serve on the legal representative to
the bereaved.

DATES FOR INQUESTS

Need to put this to the Hillsborough Steering Committee for them
to agree.  Agreed to suggest 17 April 1990 to commence the
Inquests (although Dr Popper believed they will prefer 19 April
as 17 April is close to Easter holiday).  Dr Forest, the
Pathologist, could be called to give evidence on day one so that
after that will only need to call the relatives as witnesses.
It may be possible to use one Pathologist to give evidence on
behalf of all the others.

Agreed to work at five working days per week - ie a total of 12
days (if commenced on 19 April) and run until A May 1990.  Need
to undertake eight Inquests per day to fit the 95 into 12 working
days.

If we can keep to eight Inquests per day, then each Precising
Officer need only have to undertake one Inquest per day giving
them time to offer support to the families.

Superintendent Smith agreed with this with regard to welfare.

LOCATION OF INQUESTS

The Town Hall and the University at Sheffield were suggested, but
the Medico-Legal Centre would be the most convenient and be more
advantageous.
It was agreed to look into whether the Medico-Legal Centre is
large enough to undertake the Inquests.  Rooms needed would be:-

Members of the Press              1   room
Police                            2   rooms
Families (meet Solicitors)        2   rooms
Support/Counselling Workers       2   rooms
Refreshments                      1   room
Court Room                        1   room

Mrs Harper to explore the costs of hiring a portakabin and also
minimum hiring time, for possible use by members of the press
and to serve refreshments, to be positioned on the car park at
the Medico-Legal Centre.

Agreed to approach the WVS at Sheffield to request that they
provide refreshments, if this is not possible other facilities
will have to be found.  WMP to provide an officer to assist
Mrs Harper with logistics (PS N Craig suggested).

A recording/transcript facility can be provided by the
Medico-Legal Centre, a fee will be charged to legal
representatives who request copies (free copies to West Midlands
Police, DPP (2 copies), PCA).  South Yorkshire Police to be charged.

Photographs and video material to be on hand at the Inquests only
to be used when vital to the case, not as a matter of course.

FINANCING OF THE INQUESTS

South Yorkshire Police and Sheffield City Council have an
obligation to provide support.  A financial meeting needs to be
arranged with financial representatives of both parties in order
to decide how funds are to be met.

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR FAMILIES TO ATTEND

Financial assistance will not be provided as families should make
their own arrangements for travelling to Sheffield and claim
reimbursement later from South Yorkshire Police.

Anybody invited as a witness will be paid expenses which will be
down to the Coroner to provide.

PEOPLE TO BE NOTIFIED/CONTACTED

(a)   Legal representatives of deceased (to be notified).

(b)   Families of people not represented (to be contacted as to
      their intentions to attend).

(c)   Nine parties who were afforded representation at Lord
      Justice Taylor's Inquiry.
                                     - 7 -

       (d)    South Yorkshire Police including Police Federation and
              Superintendent's Association (to be informed of events).

       (e)    Hillsborough Support Group - Liverpool and Sheffield (to be
              informed).

9.    WITNESS WARNING

      It was agreed that this would be discussed at the Pre-Inquest
      Review, also whether to produce a witness summons form.

      When warning witnesses a letter will be sent to the family, their
      representing solicitor and the Social Services, saying this is
      taking place and is for your information, it is not necessary
      for you to attend.   Another letter will have to be sent out to
      material witnesses saying you are required to attend and
      reasonable expenses will be paid.   Both letters backed up by
      verbal confirmation.   Dr Popper produced a draft letter for
      consideration.

10.   USHERS

      Mr Jones to speak to Chief Constable, Mr Wright, to discuss
      whether West Midlands officers or South Yorkshire officers
      should be used as ushers and should they be in uniform or plain
      clothes.

11.   VIDEO EQUIPMENT

      DCI Tope to discuss with Inspector Layton what is needed at the
      Coroner's Court to service the Inquests.

12.   PROVING OF VIDEO/PHOTOGRAPHS

      It was agreed that Inspector Layton would be called to the Court
      on Wednesday 18 April 1990 in order to prove all video/photographs,
      which may be produced at any of the following Inquests.

13.   ACCOMMODATION

      The provision of accommodation for officers and witnesses who may
      be required to stay overnight to be looked in to, bearing in mind
      the snooker will be playing at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield
      and accommodation may be scarce.  (Mrs Harper to deal).

14.   PRESS

      A West Midlands Press Officer will be appointed to look after
      West Midlands Police and the Coroner's interests from the
      beginning.

      Dr Popper produced a draft press release for consideration,   this
      was amended and agreed for release.
Mrs Harper to look into the feasibility of providing facilities
for the press in a portakabin on the car park of the
Medico-Legal Centre, with piped television of the court
proceedings, telephones available and refreshments on hand.

Need to brief the press and lay down some ground rules,    give them
a facility to take photographs of the court room before
proceedings commence, possibly the day before.

Could be useful at the Inquests.     Need to retrieve from the
Health and Safety Executive.

MEETING TO BE ARRANGED

Meeting with Miss Steel/Mr Frazer, Hillsborough Steering
Committee and Mr Metcalf, Hammond Suddards, to be arranged for
Monday 26 February 1990 to take place at the Medico-Legal
Centre, Sheffield.

PRE-INQUEST REVIEW

Preliminary date agreed as 6 March 1990, but must be discussed
with Miss Steel of the Hillsborough Steering Committee and
Mr P Metcalf of Hammond Suddards before the date can be
confirmed.

Objectives:-

(a)   To make sure that representatives understand the scope and
      limitations of the resumptions.

(b)   To deal with options for further resumptions on the basis
      of :-

        (i)    DPP brings manslaughter charges against anyone.   Deal
               with subsection 16.1 (a) and (b).

       (ii)    Consider mentioning possibility of private
               prosecution if no action taken by DPP, ie Section 16
               would be brought into play again.

      (iii)    If no action taken and no private prosecution started
               Inquest will have to be resumed, but scope and extent
               will be determined by me.

       (iv)    Another possibility is minor charges, but not likely
               to influence date of inquest.

(c)   To sort out any questions from representations.
                                   - 9 -


      (d)   To deal with the question of Jury (not intended to have jury
            for the interim resumption as they will not be asked to make
            any decision and if one were to resume with a jury one would
            probably have to repeat the evidence again anyway to refresh
            jury's memory).

      (e)   To explain principle of order of hearings.

      (f)   Format of inquest.

      (g)   Oral evidence from pathologist.



Meeting closed at 1745 hours.
FILE NOTE   19.2.90

Telephone call from Mervyn at home ,

He said it looked as if the DDP was happy for us to do whatever
we wished provided that the inquests didn't imperil the criminal
prosecution and that they were going to reley on Mervyn for this.

We agreed that we would meet on Thursday to discuss timing and
the details.  He would arrange to collect me and I was to go to
Nechells.

FILE NOTE DATED 1/1.2.90.   TELEPHONE CALL WITH MERVYN.


Mervyn was very keen that we should get on and write to the D.F.F.
and in fact give him dates of the proposed meeting.       He said that
the more he thought about it the more he felt that this was a good way
etc.etc.   He said that they already had 35 case files and he
couldn't see any reason why we shouldn't be in a position to deal
with the limited Inquest by the end of April/May.
I said that I had faxed the letter down to him and deal with it.         That
was done later on that day.
FILE NOTE DATED 15.2.90.   TELEPHONE CALL TO ME. NEWELL AT THE D.P.P.


I told him that I was sending a letter to him regarding   some
     thinking relating to the time of the Inquest.   That we
were suggesting some meeting dates, and that I would be most
grateful if he   would let    us know as soon as possibleif hefelt
that’s what hewanted to do.   I pointed out to him that we didn't
have a Pax machine and would he therefore please phone the reply.
I said that itwas being faxed by West Midlands too.He acknowledged
what I said and would deal with it in due course.
FILE NOTE DATED 13.2.90. TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH MERVYN JONES
RE VARIOUS LETTERS FROM HAMMOND SUDDARD AND MISS STEELE.__________

He had not received our letters but he had seen copies from the two
so the only thing that he had not seen was my draft reply.
His inclination was to reply to Hammond Suddards more or less
on the lines that I had drafted.    We agreed that lo would wait
until he received my draft and that he would then get in touch
with me.   We then discussed the letter from Miss. Steele.   I said
that when I was at the meeting in Nechells a short while ago we had
taken the view that on balance, we did not want to deal with the
medical matters and the non-contraversial locational bits at this
stage mainly because it raised the possibility that people might think
that the D.P.P. had already taken a decision and that I knew about it
even though I didn't and we thought it would be better not to raise
any hairs of that nature.    On the other hand, Miss. Steele's suggestion
a letter fit to the D.P.P. was very close to what Counsel had advised
and this might give us an opportunity to re-think whether perhaps
it wouldn't be wise after all to take non-contraversial evidence,
get it out into the open, enable people to sort out their grief
reactions.    If the D.P.P. then were to decide to prosecute, it
would be a matter of resuming the Inquests formally for the purposes
of adjourning again under Section 16,alternatively if he didn't
one could then decide how to proceed.
Mervyn felt that although initially he had thought like me, he was
now having second thoughts, not least because of the comments of *
Peter Wright which had rather raised the tempo in Liverpool.
Prior to that apparently they were thinking of having a rather low key
Inquest.     I explained to Mervyn that if we were to think along these lines
then clearly nothing could be done until the personal files had been
prepared and this obviously might put a different impetus on tb the
needs for that.    Mervyn said that he felt that if anything could be done
which would assist then that was a point which he would look into.        He
suggested that it would be a good idea if we met with the D.P.P.       (a
thought which I already had)and with which I agreed.     He also suggested
 that it might be an idea if I wrote to the D.P.P. suggesting a meeting,
referring to our conversation and outlining what we had in mind.      I said
 that I would arrange to do so.    He would phone Joan with the name of
 the man at the D.P.P's Office.    Mervyn also wanted to know what would
 happen if the D.P.P. were to prosecute.    They would presumably only select
 one or two cases, and what would happen with regard to the rest.     I
 explained that in that case one would have to be sure that the D.P.P.
 complied with requirements of Section 16 (l) (b) in order to cover all
 the deaths.     We agreed to keep in touch.

    I told him about Peter Wright's resignation.   Mervyn said that

    he had just found out.   I also mentioned that I had heard from

    Hammond Suddard.   Mervyn said that they were still on target with

    their paperwork and that he would be in touch, then line then went faulty.

      I refer to your letter of 17 January 1990 when you very kindly informed
      me that you were going to request a change of policy from the Home Office
      in respect of the release of individual statements made by your clients.
      It was very kind of you to afford the courtesy to me of informing me of
      your intention.

       I also noted that you had a similar concern with the Coroner with regard
       to the release of details about individual fatalities.

      My criminal investigation continues, but hopefully will be concluded in
      the Spring and depending upon the decision reached by the Director of
      Public Prosecutions we can then review the policy on release.  I know
      that all the parties concerned in this investigation wish to be as
      helpful as possible, but quite rightly they feel it is important to
      ensure that the integrity of the investigation is maintained.

       I have copied this letter to the offices of the Director of Public
       Prosecutions, HM Coroner at Sheffield and the Secretary to the Public
       Inquiry headed by Lord Justice Taylor.

       I am sure you will write in due course or telephone me if you feel that I
       can help in any other way.

Dear Mr Jones,

At a r e c e n t m e et i ng o f the S te e r i n g C o mm ittee we again d i s c u ss e d the pro b l em s
of individual members o f the Group are havi ng due to the r e s t r i c t i o n on the release
of individual clients s t at e m en t s to their Solici t or s impo s e d w h i l s t the c r i m i na l
investi ga t io n is continuing.

As this r e s t r i c t i o n is c e r t a i n l y n o t of your m a k in g I hav e been asked by the
Co mmittee to wr i t e di r e ct l y to the Home Office to ask w h e th e r the Policy, c o u l d
be r e c o n s i d e r e d in the light of the p roblems for indiv id u al clients - as I m e n t i o n e d
before the n e e d to reliv e events o f that day by m a k i n g a further s t a t e me n t do
cause c o n s i d e r a b l e distress to some people.

I did not w a n t in anyway to be se en to be g o i n g "over y o u r head" and th e refore
as a ma tter o f co u rt e sy I felt I s h o u ld w rite to y o u f irst to say that I w o u l d
be w r i t i n g wi t h that r e q u e s t towards the en d o f this week.

There is a s ec o nd m a tter w h i c h in a sense e f fe c ts the C o r o n er but ma y also at
the m o m e n t be subj e ct to the DPP's d i re ction w h i ch is the r e l e a s e to Solici t o rs
dealing wit h individual fatals o f the file r el a t i n g to the w h er e a b o u t s o f eac h
individual deceased.

This may become an issue dep e n de n t up on our n e g o t i a t i o n s w i t h the Insurers.

We have been seek i ng to agree wi t h the Insurers a s um as the a p p r op r ia t e m e a s ur e
of damages in the m a j o r i t y o f c ases for p r e - d e a t h p a i n and s u f f e r i n g but o f course
on the basis that if in any individ u al case there were p a r t i c u l a r c i r c u m s t a n c e s
which m ea n t that the p e r i o d was lo nger or the p a i n a nd s u f f e r i n g mor e intense
then it was o p e n to the Solic it o rs to n e g o t ia t e a sep a ra t e and h ig h er figure.

The c u r r e n t p o s i t i o n is that the Insurers ha v e ind i c at e d that they w o u l d w a n t
the e l e m e n t o f pain a nd s u f fe r i n g p r o v i n g in ev e ry case.  In  order to do that
the S o l ic i to r s w ou l d h a v e to be in a p o s i t io n to show wh e r e the d e c e a s e d was,
at a p p r o x i m a t e l y wh a t time they e n t e r e d the Pen, for h o w long they were i nvolved
in the c r u s h i n g and h o w bad etc.

I am h o p e fu l that we wil l be able to p ersuade the Insurance Company to take a
C/tnd




different line but if they p e r s is t a nd that i nf ormation is n o t a v ai l ab l e to the
Solicitors then that w o u l d mean h o l d i n g up final s et t le m e nt of the cases until
after the c o n c l u s i o n o f yo ur i n ve stigations for the DPP and p r e s u m a b l y the Inquest

The Coroner was able to let us ha ve the pos t m o r te m rep o rts on a p ro v is i o n a l
basis bec a u se o f the u n a v oi d ab l e delays and we w o ul d be s e ek i n g his Aut h o ri t y
for the a d di t i on a l p a pers on the same basis.

It may be that it is n o t n e c e s s a r y for me to p u r s ue that s e c on d r e q u e s t at this
stage but I t h o u gh t I w o u l d write fairly fully to y o u to let y o u k n o w our p o s i ti o n

All go od wishes.

HILLSBOROUGH INVESTIGATION

Following recent discussions on the progress of the police investigation
into the Hillsborough disaster I can now confirm a timetable for the
submission of the Final Report to the Police Complaints Authority and the
Director of Public Prosecutions.  The timetable I propose is as follows

Friday 30 March 1 990            Submission of the report, together with
                                 the supporting library of material
                                 statements and relevant documents.

Thursday 12 April 1990           Conference proposed between Director of
                                 Public Prosecutions, Police Complaints
                                 Authority and ourselves to discuss the
                                 proposed interview plan.

Tuesday 17 April 1990            Commence interviews in Sheffield.  We
                                 would propose to video and audio record
                                 these interviews and would have on hand a
                                 transcription service so that records of
                                 the interview, together with accompanying
                                 tapes can be supplied to the interested
                                 parties as they are completed.

Friday 4 May 1990                We would hope to have completed the
                                 interviews by this time.

Friday 18 May 1990               We would hope that all the transcripts
                                 will have been supplied by this stage, if
                                 not earlier.




                                Lloyd House, Birmingham
The above timetable is our best assessment at this time.   We hope to
achieve the target dates set, however, they cannot be guaranteed.   If
there is any slippage in the process of the investigation and reporting,
then we will give the earliest indication that we can.   However, we are
confident that the report will be ready by the end of March.   The first
two weeks of April would be a appropriate for interested parties to
reserve time in their diaries for reading the report and supporting
ma t erial.

I would be pleased to receive your reaction to the proposed timetable and
also an indication as to whether a conference would be appropriate on
Thursday 12 April 1990.  If it is acceptable I would suggest that we
could meet in London at a venue to be determined at say 1100 hours.

NOTES OF MEETING WITH DR POPPER. DETECTIVE SUPERINTENDENT TAYLOR AND
DETECTIVE CHIEF INSPECTOR TOPE AT NECHELLS GREEN POLICE STATION. 10.30 AM.
23 JANUARY 1990



1.      Meeting opened with a discussion on the current situation regarding
         the preparation of sections of the master report. Explained to Dr
         Popper that the section of the ground including details of previous
        Cup semi-finals, crushing/problems, Safety Certificate, Green Guide,
        would be the next section that he would receive and that the one
         immediately following that would be concerning supporters. The
         separate section on video and photographic material was also being
         prepared as a representative sample of all of the material and it was
         expected that a copy of that would be available for him to peruse
        within the next month or so.

2.      Dr Popper then discussed advice that he had received from Counsel with
         regard to the supply of statements to persons involved in the
         Inquiry. Counsel confirmed that he should fall in line with advice
         from the Director of Public Prosecutions up until a decision is
         reached regarding criminal proceedings. Obviously if there are
         proceedings then the same advice would prevail but if no further
        action Counsel felt that he, Dr Popper, should pursue the same
         stance. (This could be subject to negotiations in individual cases
         involving difficulty.)


3.      Counsel advising the Coroner also suggsted that it may be possible to
         open the Inquest in regard to the Hillsborough disaster BEFORE advice
         from the Director of Public Prosecutions has been received in relation
         to the identification and medical evidence only. There was some
        discussion on this and eventually it was agreed that it would be
        difficult for him to control an Inquest in these circumstances and to
         avoid straying into the domain of the criminal evidence. Also this
         course of action could give rise to the suggestion of collusion
         between the Coroner and Director of Public Prosecutions, i.e. that he
        was seeking to circumvent hearing the full Inquest into the disaster.

4.      The specimen file, Deceased Reference 13, was discussed and certain
        minor queries were explained.

         The Coroner agreed that:-


           (i)     Where the blood sample was negative then no statements
                    proving continuity were to be included but where positive
                    all such statements would be included.

          (ii)     Not all visual evidence should be included, i.e. where we
                    have 10 similar photographs showing the deceased being
                    carried across the pitch only one photograph needs to be
                    included. The visual evidence schedule would be completed
                    as it is now in full and will be marked to indicate which
                    evidence is included in the file.

         (iii)     A master copy of the visual evidence to be retained and be
                    available at the Inquest. Three copies of the visual
                    evidence selected to be made, copies for Coroner, Senior
                    Police Officer, spare copy.
                                  -   2 -




          (iv)      On receipt of individual files the Coroner will put in
                    writing to us:-

                           (a) any queries he has re that file

                           (b) the witnesses he will call, those he will have
                           read and those to be the subject of a precis.

         Periodic meetings will then be held to   answer queries and deal with
         any resulting matters.

    5.   A number ofprocedural matters were discussed regardingthe Inquest,
         including warning of witnesses, transportation, payment of expenses,
          security etc. The Coroner will consider these matters which will be
          the subject of further discussion in due course.

    6.   Theconversation    then moved to the master file and the
         video/photographic evidence and how that might be presented to a
          jury. The Coroner felt that six copies of photographs giving a
          representative cross-secton of what took place during the disaster
          (exact albums to be decided at a later date) would be the minimum he
         would require, i.e. one for himself, two for Solicitors/Counsel on
          behalf of the deceased and three for use by the jury. This would also
         be the subject of further discussion.

    Dear Mr McKee



    I was able to see your film on the Hillsborough disaster and the
    subsequent Inquiry last week in London.  I was greatly impressed with
    the work that your team has carried out.  If the finished product is
    anything like the copy that we saw, I am sure that it will be widely
    commended both for its accuracy and its sensitivity in handling an
    extremely difficult subject.

    Both I and my two colleagues were very grateful to you for letting us
    see the film and I feel sure that the representative from the DPP's
    office would make the same comments.



    Yours sincerely

1200 hrs

Meeting with Dr Popper, HM Coroner, Sheffield.     The following items
were discussed

     1.    Re the letter from Mr Meunier.   I advised Dr Popper that we
            had had communication from this gentleman previously and that
            I had already responded saying that I did not see his
            contribution as relevant.  Dr Popper's letter of reply seems
           most suitable and there the matter should rest.

    2.     I showed Dr Popper the draft letter which I propose to send to
           each of the deceased advising them on the progress of the
           investigation and the delay in the Inquests.  Dr Popper agreed
           that this was most suitable as a response.

    3.     I agreed to supply Dr Popper with a copy of the report by
           Superintendent Taylor and colleagues on the Zeebrugge
           disaster.

    4.     I mentioned to Dr Popper the likelihood of Yorkshire T.V.
           broadcasting the documentary on the Hillsborough disaster on
           the publication of Lord Justice Taylor's report.  I advised Dr
           Popper that we expect Lord Justice Taylor's report to be
           published in the middle of February; however it is not public
           knowledge.

    5.     Dr Popper advised me that he is meeting with his Counsel to
           discuss the   Hillsborough Inquests. The Counsel is Mr Michael
           Powers, a Barrister, who is an authority on Coroner's law. Mr
           Powers is both legally and medically qualified.

    6.     We agreed a    visit for Dr Popper to   Nechells on Tuesday, 23
           January.  I    will arrange transport for Dr Popper to be
           collected at home in Nottingham at 0930 hours and brought to
           Nechells.   He would return at a time to be fixed when business
           is completed.

    Meeting concluded at 1245 hours.
FILE NOTE DATED 12.1.90.




Mervyn Jones called in.    He brought me the first set of

statements submitted to the D.P.P.    We arranged that I

would meet at Nechells on the 23rd.    I told him that I was

meeting Counsel on the 17th.   He also showed me a letter

which he was proposing to write to the families telling

them that there would be further delay.    I approved the

letter.



He mentioned that he knew about Mr. Menuir and that as far

as he was concerned, no further correspondence was

required.

        As agreed previously, we have not at this stage, enclosed the first part
        of the report we preparing for submission to the Director of Public

FILE NOTE DATED 12.12.89.
TELEBBONE CONVERSATION WITH INSPECTOR MATT SAWYERS,

He had spoken to Dr. Siva and the Whelans.     Dr. Siva has explained
by "well built" he meant not deformed.   By "freckles" he meant
any skin blemish
which could have occurred whilst the lad was being manhandled.
In any event the Whelans were now satisfied.     They were appreciative
that the matter had been sorted out so promptly.     Dr. Siva has
written a supplemental report which will be forwarded to me.

Dear Sir

HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - RELEASE OF STATEMENTS

As you know I am currently leading, on behalf of Mr Geoffrey Dear, the
criminal investigation into the events that occurred at Hillsborough on
15 April 1989.  That investigation is continuing with maximum possible
speed and I would hope to have completed the full file for the Director
of Public Prosecutions by the Spring of next year, although for obvious
reasons I cannot guarantee that at this time.

Over the last few weeks I have received quite a number of requests for
information which we presently hold which was initially collected for
Lord Justice Taylor's public inquiry and also for Her Majesty's Coroner
in Sheffield.  All the information gathered now forms part of the
criminal investigation and the Director of Public Prosecutions has
requested that no material is released, until such a time that the
Director has had the opportunity to consider all the circumstances and
decided whether to issue proceedings or not.  Lord Justice Taylor and
Her Majesty's Coroner are in agreement with this policy of non-release
at this time which, as you will appreciate, is what would normally apply
in any criminal investigation.  I am afraid, therefore, that I am not in
a position to respond to your requests for material at this time.  If
during the coming months we interview any of your clients, you may think
it advisable that they should ask for a copy of any statement at the
time that they make it to my police officers.




                                Lloyd House, Birmingham
I trust that this letter clarifies the current position.  I am sorry I
cannot be more helpful, but I think you will appreciate the reasons why
the policy exists.  Once the Director of Public Prosecutions has reached
his decision, or proceedings have concluded, then I will address any
requests you have to Her Majesty's Coroner in Sheffield.  I will continue
to keep your interests in mind.

Yours sincerely

       HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - CRUSH BARRIER 124A

       I refer to your letter dated 1 December 1989 in which you indicate you
       are satisfied with the work carried out by the Health and Safety
       Executive.

       In the light of your response I am now writing to the Director of Public
       Prosecutions to say that the barrier, or parts of it, can now be released
       for the purposes of further examination, subject to the Director of
       Public Prosecutions having a representative present, who may be you.
       After tests have been completed by the interested parties then the
       barrier will be returned to the custody of the criminal investigation
       until the Director of Public Prosecutions has decided whether or not to
       issue proceedings.

       If the Director of Public Prosecutions is to involve you we will contact
       you in due course.  In the meantime, may I take this opportunity of
       thanking you for the work you have so far completed and have done so
       promptly.

Dear Mr. Jones,

                 Hillsborough Inquiry, Crush Barrier 124A

     I have read the draft report on the examination of barrier
124A prepared by P.F. Heyes and J.G. Tattersall of the Health and
Safety Executive, Research and Laboratory Services Division,
Sheffield.  On the 29th November 1989 I visited the laboratory,
inspected the barrier and discussed the findings with Dr. Heyes and
Mr. Tattersall.

     I understand that plans are in hand for the laboratory to carry
out a bend test on a length of tube similar to one in 124A.
However, this will not require the presence of 124A at the
laboratory.

     The draft report is detailed and comprehensive, and I do not
think that it is necessary for the laboratory to carry out any
further metallurgical work on 124A.

     I can therefore see no objection should you decide to recommend
that 124A now be released from the custody of the Health and Safety
Executive laboratory.

                             Yours sincerely,




                             P.B. Wilson

      HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - RELEASE OF CRUSH BARRIER 124A

      Further to our telephone call of this afternoon, you will recall some
      weeks ago we discussed release of crush barrier 124A for the purpose of
      tests to be carried out by parties to the civil proceedings.   Although
      these civil proceedings, set for IQ .June 1990, are unlikely to go ahead
      there is still considerable interest in access to the barrier for the
      purpose of tests.

      I have since written to Lord Justice Taylor, the Health and Safety
      Executive, HM Coroner in Sheffield and Forensic Science Service.   You
      will see attached replies from each of these parties indicating that
      they are quite happy for the barrier to be released for such tests.

      Accordingly I have now written to each of the parties, including of
      course the owners, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, indicating that
      the barrier is available.  I have arranged for all enquiries about
      access to be made to me so that T can ensure that our representive is
      available to monitor the tests, take any photographs and receive early
      copy of their results.  This is in accordance with your original letter
      on this subject.

      I have choosen as our representative Hr P B Wilson, Principal Scientific
      Officer at the Home Office Forensic Science Service Laboratory at
      Wetherby (see attached letter). Mr Wilson has been particularly helpful
      to us and would seem to be the idea] choice from a technical point of
      view.  I will also arrange for one of my senior officers to be present.




  PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT         I.Ioyd House, Birmingham
                                       -   ?    -




Whilst, T would recommend to you that, we release the barrier for tests,
we would not want to release total custody of the barrier until such
time that a decision has been reached by the Director of Public
Prosecutions and the Coroner has concluded his inquests.    In other words,
the release of the barrier for testing will only be on a temporary and
supervised basis.

            Dear

            HILLSBOROUGH - RELEASE OF BARRIER 124A FOR TESTING

            I am now in a position to allow access to the barrier 124A for samples
            to be taken for metallurgical testing.  However, as you represent the
            interests of the owners of the barrier then it is wholly appropriate
            that any other parties with an interest in the barrier should first make
            application through you for access to take samples.  Obviously I am very
            concerned that all parties should have an equal opportunity to gain the
            "best" evidence.

            The Director of Public Prosecutions has laid down the following
            conditions about the taking of such samples from the barrier.   Those
            conditions are that each party requiring to take samples should provide
            the following undertakings in writing:-

            1.    When samples are taken and when tests are carried out wherever they
                   occur a representative nominated by the Crown Prosecution Service is
                   to be present.

            2.    Photographs are to be taken whenever samples are obtained and copies
                   provided to the Crown Prosecution Service.

            3.    All reports and data are to be provided promptly to the Crown
                   Prosecution Service.

Please note that at this time I do not intend to return the barrier to
the custody of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.  The return of the
barrier will not take place until a decision has been reached by the
Director of Public Prosecutions and HM Coroner has concluded the
inquests.  In the meantime it will be retained as a potential exhibit.

I trust that the above arrangements meet with your satisfaction.    I have
written to the other parties concerned with the civil proceedings
informing them of the action I have taken with you.   A copy of the
covering letter to them is attached with circulation.

Yours sincerely

     HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - REQUEST FOR STATEMENTS

     Thank you for your letter of 21 November which I have shown to
     Lord Justice Taylor.   So far as Lord Justice Taylor is concerned,
     he would be quite happy for anyone to have access to any of the
     statements collected and prepared for his Inquiry.   But he
     recognises that others have an interest, and is therefore
     prepared to permit you to operate a policy of non-release in
     accordance with the DPP's wishes, as suggested at the foot of
     page 2 of your letter.   He has noted the views which Dr Popper
     and Captain Taylor have taken, and is content for others to
     decide having regard to their specific responsibilities.    in
     summary, therefore, no release if others officially involved
     think there should not be.

     I hope this is helpful.  I daresay the pressure will certainly
     remain and probably intensify, so please keep in touch and let us
     know if it proves difficult to sustain.

     I am copying this letter to David Brummell.

      FACSIMILE MACHINE - HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

      At our recent meeting we discussed the arrangements for telephone lines
      and fax machines at the Medico-Legal Centre.  I have been advised that it
      would be administratively difficult for you to purchase the fax machine
      presently based at your office.  As you are aware financial arrangements
      between the West Midlands Police and South Yorkshire Police are
      complicated by contributions from the Home Office, all the equipment
      used on the Inquiry has to be purchased and disposed of by agreement of
      all parties.

      I have, however, advised the Telecommunications Department in Birmingham
      to maintain the existing line, ie 0742-726247 for time being.  I am
      advised that if you apply to British Telecom in Sheffield, for the
      retention of the line on your own account, you will be able to retain the
      same number.  Unfortunately, the requisition has to come from you and
      cannot just be transferred at my request.  Upon confirmation that you
      have taken the line over, we will discuss withdrawal of the fax machine
      which will hopefully coincide with the timing of any new machine you are
      able to purchase.

      I have made arrangements for the remaining telephone line 0742-726105 to
      be disconnected.  British Telecom have agreed to arrange a three month
      intercept of all incoming calls on that number, advising them of the new
      number for Furnival House, ie 0742-731546.

I have asked the Liaison Officer at South Yorkshire Police, Mrs Christine
Nelson-Murphy, to contact Mr Batley direct, in order to arrange for any
minor repairs caused by our occupation to be made good.  For example
locks, screw holes in the wall etc.

I trust these arrangements will be satisfactory to you and look forward
to seeing you next week.

        HILLSBOROUGH - RELEASE OF CRUSH BARRIER 124A

        You will recall I have raised this subject with you on a number of
        occasions.  I have now received written communications from the Director
        of Public Prosecutions and Lord Justice Taylor indicating that they have
        no further use for the barrier.  At present the Forensic Science Service
        are reviewing the work already done and will be writing to me in the not
        too distant future to advise me if any other work needs to be done.

        If I receive a reply from them which indicates that the work carried out
        by the Health and Safety Executive is completed, please can I have your
        permission to release the barrier back to the owners? Of course, if the
        Forensic Science Service indicate extra work needs to be done then I will
        arrange for that to be undertaken without delay.  I have written this
        letter at this stage to minimise the time it will take to return the
        barrier once I have the Forensic Science Service response.  Pressure is
        building up at the present for access to the barrier and I do not wish
        to delay its return any longer than I have to.

        Looking forward to hearing from you in due course.        Best wishes.

                   MEETING WITH DR POPPER, HM CORONER


                  At T he M e d i c o - L e g a l Centre, S h e f f i e l d

                        On T h u r s d a y 16 N o v e m b e r 1989




The following items were discussed

1.     The civil proceedings are now set for the trial date of 19 June
       1990 in Liverpool.  The High Court Judge has not yet been
       named.  As a result of the setting of this date requests are
       now coming in for evidence currently in our possession which we
       are assemblying for the Director of Public Prosecutions, the
       Coroner and the Police Complaints Authority.   Dr Popper and I
       agreed that much of the material initially gathered for Lord
       Justice Taylor was in fact to meet a parallel objective of
       servicing the Coroner's needs. Dr Popper agreed that it would
       be improper to release any material which had been gathered on
       his behalf until at least the conclusion of the Director of
       Public Prosecution's proceedings (if taken) or the decision
       not to issue proceedings.   Then it will be a matter for
       Dr Popper to decide, depending on the timing of any civil
       proceedings, adjourned or otherwise, and how they relate to the
       dates set for Inquests.   If there was likely to be a long delay
       which could frustrate civil proceedings then Dr Popper would
       consider releasing material subject to it not prejudicing any
       party or his Inquests. Dr Popper mentioned the case Regina -v-
       Peach which had some bearing on this subject.

2.     We discussed the definition of the material we held and in
       particular identified those aspects which could be referred to
       as being in the "public domain" and, therefore, unrestricted.
       We agreed that the transcripts, statements "taken as read" and
       any statements listed in Lord Justice Taylor's Report were
       likely to be in the public domain.  However, we did not think
       that the bulk of the material, some of which may have formed
       the private reading of Lord Justice Taylor, can be construed as
       being in the public domain. However, I agreed to write to Lord
       Justice Taylor to seek his clarification about the non-release
       of material.  I agreed that I would include the fact that our
       statement taking was dual purpose.  I also agreed to supply
       Dr Popper with a copy of the letter for his information.   I also
       agreed that I would write to Dr Popper to seek his formal
       response to requests for release.
                          - 2 -


We had a general discussion about the timing of announcements.
In particular I expressed Mr Gareth Williams QC concern and
desire to time the Director of Public Prosecution's decision
(if any further action) with any decision about discipline
proceedings and the commencement of the Coroner's Inquests.
Both Dr Popper and myself saw the timing of the announcement of
the Coroner's Inquests as being relatively easy given that we
could very quickly, if not at the same time, announce a
commencement date. We both thought that it would take at least
6 to 8 weeks to make arrangements for the Inquests.

A related issue with the timing of any proceedings. Obviously,
any criminal proceedings would take precedence, once they had
been completed if police discipline proceedings were to follow,
then Dr Popper would have to be contacted in order for a
decision to be made as to whether those proceedings should come
before or after the Inquests.  The progress of the civil
proceedings would also have to be taken into account, as well
as any private prosecution, if one were to be embarked upon
before the commencement of the Inquests.

Dr Popper said that if a deceased was to be selected for the
purpose of a criminal prosecution then he would like to be
consulted about this in conjunction with the Director of Public
Prosecution.  (D/Chief Supt Foster to note).

We discussed the vacation of the Medico-Legal Centre by West
Midlands Police Officers.  We agreed, now that we have
sufficient accommodation at Furnival House, that there was no
further need for our occupancy.  Dr Popper advised me that he
was installing his own Fax machine in the very near future.   I
agreed that it would be appropriate for him to take over the
allocated British Telecom Fax number which had already been
circulated by Dr Popper to interested parties. Dr Popper
agreed that if any Fax messages were passed over that line for
our attention then he would make arrangements to pass them on.
I agreed that Mrs Harper, or her representative, would make
contact with John Batley to sort out the transfer of the number
and the removal of our Fax machine and existing telephone and
British Telecom lines (two).

Dr Popper mentioned that he had been contacted by the Mercury
Press Agency in Liverpool.  Do we know anything about their
request? Answer, no.

Dr Popper mentioned that there was a suggestion that a
Mr Gilpin was dying of cancer in Liverpool.  There was some
suggestion that the cancer was brought on by _____________
involvement on the terraces at Hillsborough, although Dr Popper
was a little dubious about such a correlation.  We both agreed
                                       - 3 -


           that if and when __________ died it would be a matter for the
           Liverpool Coroner to make preliminary enquiries.   If the
           Liverpool Coroner felt that there was a correlation then it
           will be a matter for him/her to make contact with Dr Popper for
           the transfer of the Inquest.

    9.     I have written    to South Yorkshire Police formally requesting
           copies of the    mortuary photographs. When they are to hand we
           will supply a    copy to Dr Popper (D/Chief Supt Foster to note
            and action as   appropriate).

    10.    We also discussed South Yorkshire Police senior officers mess.

    I also gave Dr Popper an up-date on the progress of the investigation
    on his behalf.  I advised him that we thought that we now may be in a
    position to identify 91 in the pens. We also discussed the content of
    the files for the Coroner and I agreed to write to him to formalise the
    arrangements so that all the costs, which will be borne by us, are
    incurred within this current financial year.

         HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - RELEASE OF STATEMENTS

         As you know the civil proceedings have now been set for 19 June 1990 in
         Liverpool.  As a consequence many of the legal representatives for the
         parties to the civil proceedings are requesting evidence which is in our
         possession and which has been collected for you,  Lord Justice Taylor
         and the Police Complaints Authority.

         The purpose of my writing is to inform you that I have declined requests
         from the legal profession for such evidence.  This is based upon the
         advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions who said that the material
         must remain confidential until the end of any criminal proceedings or
         the announcement by the Director of Public Prosecutions that no further
         action will be taken. At that time it would be appropriate then for me
         to request your permission to release material.

          I would be grateful, therefore, if you would advise me, if you agree
          with my policy of non-release, as described above.

         The barrier is also at issue and I am still awaiting a response from the
         Health and Safety Executive and the Forensic Science Service as to
         whether any additional work needs to be done on behalf of yourselves,
         the Director of Public Prosecution and Lord Justice Taylor.  I will
         write to you in due course when I have this response.

      HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - REQUEST FOR STATEMENTS

      The purpose of this letter is to seek Lord Justice Taylor's views on the
      release of statements which we gathered for    his inquiry and which we also
      anticipated would be of use for HM Coroner.     At present we are receiving
      an increasing number of requests from those who made the statements (or
      their legal representatives) and others, parties to the civil
      proceedings, who require information in our possession to help in the
      preparation of their case.  The agreed policy with you was that the
      individual who made the statement would be furnished with a copy on
      application.  However, on taking responsibility for the criminal
      investigation I suspended that policy.  The position is as follows.

      From April to July when the oral hearings ended West Midlands police
      officers obtained something in the order of 4,000 written contributions.
      They took three main forms, viz:-

         (1)   Statements of witness under the provisions of the Criminal Justice
               Act.

         (2)   Written recollections not under caution or within the provisions
               of the Criminal Justice Act.

         (3)   Written recollections prepared and submitted by legal
               representatives on behalf of their clients.




  PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE A T         Lloyd Hpuse, Birmingham
We still hold the original documents here in Birmingham, having supplied
complete sets to Treasury Solicitors and to yourself.  The objective of
taking the written evidence was to furnish Lord Justice Taylor with an
accurate and complete account of what happened at Hillsborough.  A
parallel objective, knowing that a Coroner's Inquest would inevitably
follow, was to secure evidence about the ninety five deaths whilst the
detail was still fresh in the minds of witnesses.  This latter objective
was primarily achieved by statements of witness taken at (1) above.   It
was always recognised that relevant evidence received in forms (2) and
(3) would have to be converted at a later stage for the Coroner.

As you know after the publication of Lord Justice Taylor's report on
4 August 1989> Mr Wright, the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire raised
the question of a criminal investigation with the Director of Public
Prosecutions.  This led subsequently to an invitation to Geoffrey Dear
to undertake a criminal investigation (see Annex 'A').  Mr Dear Agreed.

Since that time we have been pursuing the criminal investigation with
the objective of completing all our enquiries, interviews, analysis and
final report by the end of February or early March 1990.  At present we
are still operating on that timetable.

Requests for copy statements declined after the publication of Lord
Justice Taylor's report.   However, recently they have started again.
The reason for this is two-fold.   Firstly, there are still some
outstanding applicants to the Hillsborough Disaster Fund who are
required by the executors of the Fund to produce some kind of evidence
of attendance/involvement.   Secondly, and the greatest cause of
requests, is that the civil proceedings have been set to commence in
Liverpool on 19 June 1990.   Legal representatives for the plaintiffs and
the four defendants are now busily preparing their respective cases.
Unfortunately for them much of what they require is in my possession and
is relevant to the criminal investigation.   As you know normal policy is
not to release information to civil litigants or others until the
investigation is complete and the Director of Public Prosecutions has
made his decision.

For obvious reasons I am keen to follow the normal policy of non-release
as is the Director of Public Prosecutions who has issued a letter to that
effect (see Annex 'B').  Confidentially, I can advise you that a decision
of the Director of Public Prosecutions is unlikely to be announced before
the start of the civil proceedings.

The issue is, therefore, will Lord Justice Taylor permit me to operate a
policy of non-release in accordance with the Director of Public
Prosecution's wishes?  I have to say that release has the potential to
seriously impede the process of the investigation.  I would also point out
that I am not in a position to operate a selective policy given that I
will not know what is "relevant" until the investigation is complete.
                                   - 3 -


On a question of definition I am not attempting to restrict release of
those statements which were taken "as read" at the Hearings, the
transcripts or other material which could be defined as in the "public
domain".  Rather I am concerned about the vast bulk of material which was
not called by Andrew Collins QC, some of which may have formed part of
the private reading of Lord Justice Taylor.

For your information I have also raised the issue of non-release with
HM Coroner, Dr Popper, and Captain E N Taylor of the Police Complaints
Authority, both of whom have indicated that evidence gathered specifically
for their purposes should not be released whilst the Director of Public
Prosecution's involvement continues.  Thereafter they will decide upon
release dependent on their individual concerns and responsability.

I have taken the liberty of copying this letter to Mr David Brummell of
Treasury Solicitors for his information.

PS: With regard to the release of barrier 124A I am still awaiting the
    response of the Forensic Science Service before formally inviting
    Lord Justice Taylor, the Director of Public Prosecutions and HM Coroner
    to give their permissions.    i

 I have today received a letter from t$« Director of Public Preseeueiens
 expressing his view that
                     t)   in relation to the events at Hillsborough on
 15 April last there should
                     s'     now be a full criminal enquiry - not Limited to thi
 possible culpability of
                      < police officers alone. I understand you are in
 receipt of a copy of this lettar. I vould be grataful if you will undertake
 thia enquiry together with any police discipline aspects which may emerge.
 There are currently three matters of public complaint under investigation and
 which have been raised
                 rai    by Mr Trevor Hicks.

 The South Yorkshire P<
                     Police Authority is to consider his complaint against my
            fater Hayes,
 Deputy, Hr tater Hay*   on Friday next.

 His conplaint
     complaint againat
                against Hr Duckenfield is with Mr K Cooper, Assistant Chief
 Constable of Northanp
               Northamptonshire Police:, and is supervised by Mr E N Taylor of
 the Police Complaints Authority. A meeting is arranged between them and
 Hr Hicks
    Hick* on 23'
             23 August and until this has taken place it is considered
 appropriate that
             that the
                   this complaint remains with Mr Cooper. If after 23 August
 Mr
 Hr Hicks is persisting
             persiatin with the matter of complaint then I suggest it should
 be referred to you and
                      an this will be arranged through the Police Complaints
 Authority.

  His remaining complaint
                 compli    is of incivility which is being investigated by a
 | superintendent from this Fore*.

  There is a fourth complaint
                     cot      of corruption! namely police officers allowing
  fans into the ground on payment, which i a being investigated by an officer
  from Greater Manchester
               Hanehesi   Police. You may wish to consider which if any of
  these you would wish to take over.

 I In relation to costs,
                  costs 1 am advised by our Treasurer that in the light of on­
   going negotiations between
                      b       the Authority and the Hope Office It la highly
   probable that an agreement
                    agr       will soon be reached. The effect of this 1» like]
   to be that the coats of the enquiries you have undertaken so far and in the
G J Dear Esq QPM DL LIB               2                          16 August 191



future In relation to any discipline or criminal matters or in raapect of tht
Inquest will be met in full from central government following the agreed
contribution from the South Yorkshire Police Authority. If such an agreement
Is reached It will affectively d«al with tha queries you raised in your lettei
of 11 August.

It ia my intention to make an announcement of the Director's advice and of
action on the afternoon of 16 August.

   HILLSBOROUGH ENQUIRY
   REQUESTS FOR STATEMENTS

   Thank you for your letter of 24 October.  I have given careful
   consideration to the points which you raise on dealing with
   requests from witnesses for copies of their statements.
   I can quite understand the d e c i s i o n to supply statements upon
   request during the earlier phase of the enquiry.         However, I
   feel that there is a distinction to be drawn between the
   inquisitorial nature of Lord Justice Taylor's Public Enquiry
   and the full criminal investigation which is now being
   conducted.  I feel that such statements should remain the
   confidential "property" of the investigation and they should
   not be released until either after the end of any criminal
   proceedings or after the Director has reached a decision not
   to issue proceedings.

   If it is necessary, of course, there would be no objection to
   witnesses refreshing their memories from their statements in
   the usual way prior to giving evidence.

   I would, of course, be prepared to discuss this matter with
   you on the telephone and I would also be most interested to
   hear the response which you receive from the Police Complaints
   Authority.

    SUBJECT                                                             DATE     21 November 1989
              DISASTER


              Further to my report of 17 October 1989, concerning a visit to Kent
              Constabulary Headquarters in connection with the Zeebrugge Disaster, I have to
              report attending with Detective Superintendent Cobb (Systems Manager) and
w             Detective Chief Inspector Tope (I/C Body Teams H/I) on 15/16 November 1989.
              Separate reports from these officers are attached. Consequently where they
              have dealt with as items of information I have not repeated it unless it is to
              make an additional point.

              Following our arrival shortly after 12 mid day on 15 November 1 9 8 9 , there
              was a general discussion with Detective chief Superintendent Rixon and
              Detective Chief Inspector Hawswood about our respective inquiries prior to
              lunch. The afternoon was occupied with discussions on the setting up/use of
              HOLMES in the investigation and this was dealt with by Inspector Hatfield and
              Sergeant Parkinson.  Later in the afternoon/early evening Detective Inspector
              Scott joined us and the presentation developed into the international aspects
              of their enquiry and some of the difficulties encountered abroad.

              On the 16 November 1 9 8 9 , the morning was concentrated almost exclusively on the
              Coronal aspects of their enquiry including the repatriation of bodies,
              identification/continuity, deceased families, inquest(s) and these items were
              presented by Inspector Fautley and Police Constable Maddox (Coroners Officers -
              Dover). Part way through the morning we were joined by Superintendent McCarthy
              (H.Q. Operations - Former Sub Divisional Superintendent Dover) who was able to
              give us a broad over view of the Coroner’s enquiry (from both perspectives), as
              well as information on Kent Constabulary emergency planning.

              The period after lunch and up to almost the time of our departure, was then
              occupied with Detective Chief Superintendent Rixon and Detective Chief
              Inspector Hawswood explaining the method of their reporting the Zeebrugge
              disaster to the Director of Public Prosecutions, the preparation/conduct of
              interviews with those thought to have some criminal culpability and discussions
              concerning current thinking on Manslaughter, including corporate manslaughter.
              The visit concluded with a brief but interesting visit to the Force Control
              Room/Casualty Bureau with Detective Chief Inspector Hawswood.

              Throughout the two days of our visit we were accompanied by Detective Chief
              Superintendent Rixon and Detective Chief Inspector Hawswood, who had structured
              a comprehensive programme of presentations to try and answer our wide range of
              questions. All questions were dealt with frankly despite the senstivity of
              their enquiries and we were given every facility to learn from their
              experience.  In addition we were extended considerable hospitality and in this
              connection I would ask that a letter be sent to the Chief Constable, Mr
              P.L,Condon, thanking him and all the officers named in this report for their
              time, and assistance and kind hospitality.          Continued.....

          M y m a i n area of in t e r es t centred around the Incident room, however,                         I have made
          comments about other aspects as relevant.

          Incident Room

          Background

          A t the time that the C r iminal Investi g a t io n got underway, K e n t h a d just
          a c c e p t e d the M c D o n n e l l Douglas Holmes System. Their t raining p r o g r a m h a d
          commenced, w i t h a v i e w to go operational some two m o n t h s later.

          Hence the d e c i s i o n to use Holmes, brought the o p erational us e of the syst e m
          forward.  I suggest that this is important, as the Force at that time h a d no
          previous ex p e r i en c e of Holmes to d r a w upon, this w a s in fact, t h e i r first job.

          The Public Inq u ir y (Sheen) w as complete, as w a s the Cor o n e r s Inquest. A ll of
          this d o c u m e n t a t i o n w a s available to the I n v es t i g a t i o n Team.

          Staffing

          The I nv e s t i g a t i o n T e a m co n si s t e d of a D e t e c t i v e Superintendent,   DCI,    and some
          20 C I D staff as outside crews.

          The Incident T e a m c o n s i s t e d of a DI as 0 M (Formerly Port O f f i c e r sent to
          Zeebrugge), PS P a r k i n s o n (ex Holmes Na t io n a l Tra i ni n g Team) a nd some 4
          indexers.

          System

          M r R i x o n d e c i d e d that he and the D CI w o u l d act as Statement Readers. They read
          all if not mo s t of the doc u m e nt a t i o n and M a r k e d U p an d A c t i o n e d U p as they saw
          necessary.

          Actions

          M r R i x o n P r e f a ce d ea c h a c t i o n w i t h b a ck g r o u nd i n fo r m a t i o n a n d a list of items
          to be cov e re d f r o m transcrip t s / s ta t e m e nt s in the statement to be t ak e n (example
          attached).

          He c o n s i d e r e d the q u e s t i o n na i r e approach,   he w as leading d e t e ct i v e s a nd decided
          u p o n the A c t i o n Pref a c e approach.

Sectioning

The Inqu i r y w a s s e c tioned off into important areas, e.g. Stability, B o w
Doors.         A m a n u a l / p h y s i c a l b ox w as set-up for each section, w h i c h w e r e
c o ns e c u t i v e l y numbered.            Boxes w e r e r eg i s t e re d on Holmes as ODs.

All nominal, ad d r e s se s etc., w e r e created.            Cat e g o ry titles w e r e cre a te d

File Preparation

A v e r y useful fact o r involves the Engl i s h Free Text S e a r c h Facility.

A search w a s m a d e on a K e y w o r d e.g. STABILITY, if say 60 statements w e r e

I n v e s t i g a t i o n B a se

The SIO chose 4 cases to prove f r o m the 100 + deaths.                           These r e pr e s e n te d
those w h o w e r e killed.

          Consequent to the above visit a number of points were highlighted which may
          assist in the preparations for the Inquest into the Hillsborough disaster.

          The following matters can be the subject of further discussion, as this inquiry
          progresses for ultimate agreement with the Coronerj-

          DKCKASKD FAMTT.V

          1. Officers who initially dealt with the relatives should be attheInquest.
          2. Information on families should be checked prior to the Inquest in case of
              other deaths/divorces etc.
          3. Question of expenses to be clearly made out as to who from the family will
              be paid.
          4. Counselling to be available.
          5. Small admin team for contact with relatives.
          6. Separate room available.

               WITNESSES

          1.   Admin team for warnings.
          2.   Expenses to be explained.
          3.   Separate room required for families
          4.   Counselling to be available.

               JURY

          1.   In the distressing circumstances selection is very important.
          2.   Pre-prepared sheet for each deceased so that the jury can record their own
               notes and space for verdict.
          3.   Counselling to be available.

               GENERAL

          1.   Tape recording of the Inquest with a transcript being provided to legal
               representatives I
          2.   The officers at Kent regarded our proposal of a precis to legal
               representatives prior to the Inquest as being most advantageous.

          All these issues many of which we had already considered, can be the subject of
          further discussion.

 to be unnecessary to prove the involvement of any "directing

 mind and will" of the company.        However,   for the    reasons

 given by the Wrecks Commission at pp.71-72 of their Reoort,

 it seems clear that the company was not guilty of this

 offence nor of that under s.3(1) of the Merchant Shipping

 (Load Lines) Act 1967.        I am not aware of any other offence,

 apart from manslaughter itself, of which the cor,;psny was

 guilty, and, in the absence of such an offence there is no

 case of manslaughter to answer on this ground.

 (2)   Manslaughter by "gross negligence" or "recklessness"

       Lntil recently it w.is arguable that manslaughter could

be committed by acting (or omitting where there is a duty to

act) with a rd gh degree of negligence - that is, by deviating,

not slightly but greatly, from the standard of care to be

expected of a reasonable person - and that this did not require

proof of any state of mind.        The test laid down in Bateman

(1925) 19 Cr App R 8 at 11 is whether -

       "... in the opinion of the jury, the negligence of the

accused went beyond     a mere matter of compensation between

subjects and showed     such disregard for the life and safety         of

others as to amount     to a crime against the State and conduct

deserving of punishment."

       Tnougn the words,    "showed such disregard for the life

and safety of others," suggest that the accused must be aware

of a risk to the life and safety of others, other cases

suggest that "criminal negligence" did not require proof of

any foresight of harm.       Thus in Lamb [1967J 2 Q.B.981 at

990, Sachs LJ said (obiter) -

       "... it would, of course, have been fully open to a jury,

if properly directed,      to find the accused guilty       of man­

slaughter   because they considered his view as to there being

no danger was formed in a criminally negligent way."             In

  Dear Mi

  HTLISBC53DUGH INQUIRY - BARRIER 124A

  In your letter of 26 October 1989 you wrote concerning various matters which we
  had previously discussed on the telephone. The one outstanding item concerns
  barrier 124A. We have completed our studies on this barrier and have no
  further use for it. I have discussed this matter with Professor Maunder and he
  too agrees that no further work is required of HSE.

  As you know, your colleague from the Forensic Science Service has examined the
  barrier at our laboratories and will shortly receive a draft copy of our
  metallurgical report. He will then be able to give his view on the need for
  any further work.

  As far as HSE are concerned, I am ready to release the barrier upon your
  instruction following your communications with Lord Justice Taylor, HM Coroner
  and the Director of Public Prosecutions as outlined in your letter.

  Two sets of the HSE photographs are enclosed as requested.       An invoice will be
  sent to you in due course.

  Yours sincerely

     Dear Sir

     HILLSBOROUGH - FATALITIES ON OR NEAR          BARRIER

     I refer to your letter of 3 November 1989 in which you request detail of
     where the fatalities and serious injuries occurred within the Sheffield
     Wednesday Football Club ground at Hillsborough.  You are quite right, a
     considerable amount of work has followed on this aspect since the
     conclusion of the Taylor Inquiry, but I am not in a position at the
     moment to issue a definitive statement on our findings.

     Secondly, as you know, Mr Dear is charged with a criminal inquiry and is
     ultimately required to report to the Director of Public Prosecutions.
     It seems proper, therefore, that I should raise this matter with the
     Director for his advice.  I have already put that request in hand.   I
     will advise you as soon as I receive a reply.

     If the Director of Public Prosecutions allows release then I will have
     to consult the Coroner, Dr Popper, in order to seek his approval.

     I am sorry if this appears unhelpful at this time, but I am sure you
     appreciate that the policy I am presently adopting is the one that
     would follow in a normal criminal inquiry.   However, I can assure you
     that when I have the necessary approvals I will supply you with all the
     required information as quickly as possible.

     Yours faithfully




     !




     Assistant Chief Constable
     (Hillsborough Inquiry)

FILE NOTE.

I spoke to Inspector Mat Sawyer who came to see me on the 22nd of November

regarding the points raised by Mr. Whelan, i.e., that the p.m. report

indicated that his son had freckles and that he was circtansized and

Mr. Whelan says that neither of these things are so.   In addition,

he was a bit concerned about the hei^it and wei^it and the fact

that age is stated between 20 and 30 years.

The latter three points are relatively easy to resolve but I am somewhat

more concerned about the circumcision and the freckles.   Inspector Sawyer

will see the pathologist Dr. S$va to try and sort out what is what.

I suspect that this is a case where we will need photographs.
FILE NOTE BATED 15.11.89. TET.TgPHONE CALL FROM JOAN TAYLOR
 \    '; ■•*

Apparently one of the solicitors had rung about one of their clients
who had died of cancer.     This patient had been at Hillsborough and
there had been a suggestion that the cancer might have been caused
by his experiences.     He wanted to know whether he should refer the
matter to me or to his local Coroner.     I told Joan to tell him
that it should be referred to the local Coroner and he should tell
the local Coroner that if he wanted to discuss it with me, then
he was free to do so.



I think it is hardly unlikely that there is any causal relationship
and we should only take this case if there was good hard
evidence to that fact.
FILE NOTE   15.11.89


TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH MERVYN

He is coming to see me on the 16th to discuss various matters.
He indicated that he had had a recent conversation with the D.P.P.'s
representative and it now looked as if although they still hoped
to have their reports completed by spring Counsel to the D.P.P.
did not think that he would have his report in until sometime in
June (which is over the time when the civil case is going to
commence) and that the D.P.P. seemed to indicate that there was
going to be a considerable delay before he would be able to take
a decision.  If that is right the inquest isn't going to take place
until 1991 or later.

There are various other matters he wants to bring me up to date
with and we will discuss those tomorrow.
FILE NOTE DATED 13.11.89.



I visited Nechells in Birmingham.

One of the primary objects of this visit was to meet the various people

who had been doing such a lot of work for myself as well as for other

people and secondly to be updated and discuss any immediately

outstanding problems.

I spent most of the day with Mervyn Jones, C/Supt Foster and C/Supt

Taylor and I also spent some time with Inspector      and various other

people in the department.

We looked round the various sections including the computing side,

the proof readers,sorters, photographic section and the /-Vv    t

presentations and in general terms discussed the work that had been

done.   I had taken the opportunity of thanking those who I met

for the work which they haS done up to now.

I was updated to the effect that 90 plus bodies had now been

identified.   Efforts were now being made to meet with various families

in order to confirm identifications and to try and fill in the ones

which hadn't yet been positively sorted out.   It was interesting that

apparently 4 identifications have had to be revised as a result of

input of friends and families.

On the whole most people seem to be co-operative but there were one or

two families who were very reluctant either to view photographs or

film or prepared to meet with the police at all.    Whilst it was

obviously right that nobody should be forced to view distressing

photographic or video material, it was also of course important that

one should obtain the identification, because in final analysis this

was very often what the families really wanted.    What we did not want

to happen was that we should be faoed with the complaint at the last

moment, that somebody had not been identified.     We agreed that if

in the final analysis it was necessary to talk to family solicitors to

see whether there co-operation could be obtained, we would do so but

the general opinion was that things were going remarkably well, bearing

in mind the difficulty which the whole thing had presented.
   We discussed the question of preparation of the folders for each

   individual case.      The staff thought that this would be probably towards

   the end of January.    I said that as far as I was concerned I have never

   really pressed them and this still applied.     My only reservation was

   that if we should have enough time to complete all the necessary

   photographic work etc before the           date in March when financing

   apparently is going to become more difficult.

   We spent some time discussing the number of copies of the precis.       On

   the whole the officers felt that the precis would perhaps not be entirely

   suitable for transmission to various people and I said in the

   circumstances we ought to defer decision as to how many odpies of

^^that we would need until later.

   We also spent    quite a bit of time ( parti cularly with C/lnspector

   discussing the photographs.     I had been under the impression that

   these were the thick and thin bundles but in fact they were referring

   to the photographs of the individual deceased at various locations.

   I had thought that we probably would not need all the photographs and

   indeed for some individual they may be very many but that the odd one might

   be sufficient.     The difficulty is that if the files are not complete

   there is always the problem of lack of disclosure.     There was also

^ ^ t h e problem that some of the photographs might be distressing both to the

   family and to the Jury and one wanted to minimise that as far as possible.

   We agreed that we would meet again in January to try and sort out exactly

   should be contained within the folders and how many copies.

   Whilst I was at Nechells it was reported that South Yorkshire had announced

   that they were going to negotiate settlements with the relatives of the

   deceased and other injured parties.

   I had lunch with Mr. Dear and the people mentioned.

      The matter at present rests with the television companies and their local

    HI LLSB O R O U G H - CRUSH B A R RIE RS

    I refer to your letter of 2 November 1989 on this subject.  You will, no
    doubt, have seen by now various letters on the question of releasing the
    barrier.  Briefly, I am at present trying to establish whether the
    criminal investigation and Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry have all they
    need from the barrier and its examination.  Once I have established that,
    with the help of the Health and Safety Executive and the Forensic Science
    Service, I will write to you formally asking for your position.  Bearing
    in mind what the Forensic Science Service may say and what the Health
    and Safety Executive already say, it is likely that I will be advising
    you that all the necessary work has been done and there is no
    obstruction to us returning the barrier to the owners, Sheffield
    Wednesday Football Club, and advising the other parties to the civil
    action what we have done.

    In the meantime we wait.            I will write to you in due course for your
    direction.

     HILLSB OROU GH INQUIRY - REQUE STS FOR STATEME NTS

     Thank you for your letter of 31 October 1989 advising us not to release
     statements at this time.  I have noted your comments and have put a new
     policy into effect immediately.

     Attached to this letter you will find a letter from Hammond Suddards
     dated 3 November 1989 which is attempting to identify precisely where
     fatalities and serious injuries occurred.  Of course, this will be
     primarily an issue for HM Coroner in Sheffield, but in the light of your
     letter of 31 October, I do believe a parallel can be drawn.  Consequently,
     unless you have any comments to the contrary I intend to invoke a
     similar policy on non-release of material.  I will, therefore, write to
     Hammond Suddards to that effect once you have indicated to me that you
     agree that their request should be treated as if it were a request for a
     statement.

     I am also writing separately to HM Coroner, Dr Popper, and advising him
     of this policy in the meantime.  I feel sure that he will concur.

     I do believe that we will get a number of requests both from the
     plaintiffs and the four defendants to the civil action.  I understand
     that the civil action will commence in Liverpool on 19 June next year,
     before an unidentified, as yet, High Court Judge.  You may feel it
     appropriate that you or I ought to write to the legal representatives of
     those parties to the action and advise them of the policy whilst the
     criminal inquiry continues and up until a decision of the Director of
     Public Prosecutions or conclusion of any proceedings instituted.   I await

         Dear Miss Steel

         HI LL S B O R O U G H - C R U S H B A R R I E R S

         I have noted the contents of your letter dated 21 October 1989 and in
         particular your concern about the barrier and access to it. The
         situation at present is that the Director of Public Prosecutions does
         not see any further need to retain the barrier. However, this is
         subject to receiving assurances from the Health and Safety Executive, in
         writing, that they have no further use for the barrier. Secondly, that
         the Director of Public Prosecutions has the opportunity of having a
         representative present at any future tests. Thirdly, that an opportunity
         will exist to take photographs of such tests.  Fourthly, all reports and
         data are made available to the Director of Public Prosecutions/Crown
         Prosecution Service as early as possible after the tests.

         However, as you know the interest in the barrier is not restricted to
         the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Lord Justice Taylor has an
         interest and once I have received the letter from the Health and Safety
         Executive declaring they no longer have interest then I will write to
         him to seek his approval. Furthermore, HM Coroner at Sheffield will also
         want to give similar approval once the Health and Safety Executive have
         written.

         All this might seem a little bit bureaucratic, but given that thebarrier
         could be an important part of any subsequent proceedings then I wish to
         be assured that all parties I relate to have had every opportunity to
         examine and carry out tests. Having said that, I do hope that it will
         not be long before I can release the barrier and certainly in plenty of
         time for you to carry out what work you wish in good time for the
         commencement of civil actions.




   PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE A T . . . . Lloyd House, .Birmingham
                                   - 2 -


I have received other letters also requesting access to the barrier for
the purposes of securing samples. Consequently, I have agreed with the
representative of the Director of Public Prosecutions' office that once
I have all the assurances that we no longer need the barrier then he,
Mr Kennedy, will undertake to contact you and the other representatives
of the parties involved in order to discuss the best way forward.
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club who are ultimately the 'owners' of the
barrier, no doubt will wish to have their say in respect of the way
forward

I trust this letter is of assistance to you.  Please rest assured that I
will not delay the release of the barrier without good cause. I have
taken the liberty of copying this letter to the legal representatives of
the other parties joined in the civil action.

Dear Sir/
                  /
                  /
Hillsborough

On 20th October, we wrote to the Coroner, Mr. Popper, with a request
for advance disclosure of certain information which will be relevant
to the civil actions.

One issue which has been raised is the extent to which injury or
death may have been caused or contributed to by the collapse of a
barrier in pen 3 of the Leppings Lane terraces*

The question of precisely where fatalities and serious injuries
occurred will be highly material evidence on this issue.  Certain
evidence on this point was presented to the Taylor inquiry, but
considerable further progress in investigations will no doubt have
been made by the West Midlands Police on behalf of the Coroner, so
that the positions at which the great majority of the fatalities
occurred could now be determined with considerable accuracy.

Our unusual request of the Coroner reflected the unusual
circumstances in this matter, because there seems to be every
possibility that a civil trial will take place before inquests on
the deceased are held.  Certainly, directions have already been
given in open Court by Mr. Justice Steyn in relation to the exchange
of expert evidence, the precise nature of which will inevitably
depend on where the majority of fatalities and injury occurred.   It
is difficult to see how such evidence can be completed and exchanged
without the relevant information.



                                                                                                                        /... contd.

 Our letter to the Coroner, Mr. Popper, did ask him to consider the
 position and let us know if we could approach the West Midlands
 Police with regard to this additional information.  We did express
 that any information supplied to us would, of course, also be
 available to other parties in the civil action.  We would also
 advise that our letter to the Coroner pointed out consent would also
 be required from the Director of Public Prosecutions, on whose
 behalf you are also conducting your investigations.

Unfortunately, in response to our letter, we received, on
26th October, a letter from the Coroner, Mr. Popper, stating that he
did not, in any event, think it right that he should release or
authorise release of the West Midlands files whilst the criminal
investigation was under way.

We would be obliged if you would advise us of any specific objection
the West Midlands Police may have to the disclosure of this
additional information.


Yours faithfully,

       HILLSBOROUGH - CRUSH BARRIERS

        I am receiving a number of requests from parties to the civil proceedings
        for samples of the barrier in order to carry out their own tests over and
        above what has been undertaken by the Health and Safety Executive in
        Sheffield.

        As you know the barrier ultimately is the property of Sheffield Wednesday
        Football Club and whatever happens to it after we have finished with its
        use must be in consultation and agreement with them. The Club's
        solicitors, Davies Arnold Cooper, have already written to me declaring
        their ownership and requesting access to it.

        At the present time I am declining such requests until

                  1.     The Forensic Science Service has had the opportunity to look at
                         the barrier and examine the Health and Safety Executive's
                         findings in their two reports, the second one at present being in
                         final draft form.

                  2.     I have a undertaking in writing from Dr Nicholson of the Health
                         and Safety Executive that he has no further tests to undertake to
                         the barrier.

                  3.     I have obtained the Director of Public Prosecutions' approval to
                         release the barrier.

                  4.     I have similar approval from Lord Justice Taylor.

                  5.     Approval from H.M. Coroner.




  PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE A T                   Birmingham
Once I have that undertaking from the Forensic Science   Service and Dr
Nicholson then I will write to the parties at 3, 4 and   5, seeking their
respective formal approval to release. The purpose of    this letter,
therefore, is to give preliminary warning of what I am   doing.

Once release has been approved by all the parties concerned then I will
write to Davies Arnold Cooper and other solicitors representing the parties
to the civil proceedings advising them that the barrier is now available so
they can workout amongst themselves and with the owners how they would like to
proceed with any tests. This will be important because the tests may lead
to the destruction of the material and therefore could cause complications
later where perhaps like has not been compared with like.

      Dear

     HILLSBOROUGH ENQUIRY
     REQUESTS FOR STATEMENTS

      Thank you for your letter of 24 October.  I have given careful
      consideration to the points which you raise on dealing with
      requests from witnesses for copies of their statements.

     I can quite understand the decision to supply statements upon
     request during the earlier phase of the enquiry.  However, I
     feel that there is a distinction to be drawn between the
     inquisitorial nature of Lord Justice Taylor's Public Enquiry
     and the full criminal investigation which is now being
     conducted.  I feel that such statements should remain the
     confidential "property" of the investigation and they should
     not be released until either after the end of any criminal
     proceedings or after the Director has reached a decision not
     to issue proceedings.

     If it is necessary, of course, there would be no objection to
     witnesses refreshing their memories from their statements in
     the usual way prior to giving evidence.

     I would, of course, be prepared to discuss this matter with
     you on the telephone and I would also be most interested to
     hear the response which you receive from the Police Complaints
     Authority.

       HI L L S B O R O U G H INQUI RY - T E L E V I S I O N D O C U M E N T A R I E S

       The purpose of this letter is to advise you that early on in Lord Justice
       Taylor's Inquiry approaches were made by the BBC and Yorkshire Television
       companies to be permitted to make, respectively, a television documentary
       on the Hillsborough investigations.  The approach was originally made to
       my Chief Constable Mr Geoffrey Dear, and he took up the requests with
       Lord Justice Taylor who agreed that the filming could take place.

       Since that time both television companies have invested an enormous
       amount of time and money into making their documentaries.  Initially it
       was agreed that they would not show their documentaries until the time
       of the publication of Lord Justice Taylor's final report, which was
       anticipated at the beginning of 1990. Before the documentaries were
       shown an opportunity would be given to Lord Justice Taylor and Mr Dear
       to view the finished product.

       Of course, since that original agreement the investigation has moved on
       to involve your good selves.  As a consequence I have spoken to the
       senior executives both in the BBC and Yorkshire Television companies and
       advised them of our responsibility for the criminal and complaints
       investigations.  This new involvement means that their original
       publication dates cannot now proceed, given that the investigations have
       yet to be concluded, decisions to be made and followed by the
       possibility of proceedings.  There is also the Coroner's Inquests to
       consider.  As a result of my meetings both television companies are
       examining the material they have and are putting the matter to their
       respective legal advisers. It would seem, however, that neither company
       feels confident to be able to show a worthwhile programme for some
       considerable time.

Most of the filming has now been concluded and there is, therefore,
unlikely to be many further requests for access. However, I will be
grateful if you would indicate what your feelings are on this particul
subject.

        HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

        The purpose of this letter is to follow up a call made by my Detective
        Chief Superintendent Foster to you today to seek some involvement of the
        Forensic Science Service in our investigation into the tragic events at
        Hillsborough in April of this year.  I understand from Mr Foster you are
        willing to assist and that you will be inviting a member of your staff,
        Mr P. B. Wilson, to undertake the work.

        As 1 see it at present, we would like Mr Wilson to view the broken barrier,
        identified as ’124a', and to review the tests and results made by Dr
        Nicholson and his Health and Safety Executive staff. We would be seeking
        an early indication from Mr Wilson whether he was satisfied with the
        tests/results and whether in his professional opinion more research needs
        to be done on the barrier.  If more work needs to be undertaken then we
        would negotiate that with you.

        I am also aware that parties involved in civil proceedings arising out of
        Hillsborough have an interest in testing the barrier. The Director of
        Public Prosecutions has agreed in principle to releasing the barrier for
        tests subject to three conditions.   These are:-

                       (i)     samples/tests are in the presence of arepresentative
                               nominated by the Crown Prosecution Service.




  P L E A S E R E P L Y T O T H E O F F IC E A T                B . i n n i ngharn
        (ii)   photographs are to be taken whenever samples are
               obtained and copies provided to the Crown Prosecution
               Service.

       (iii)   all reports/data are provided promptly to the
               Crown Prosecution Service.


Whether the Director of' Public Prosecutions will ask the Forensic Science
Service to undertake the representative role I am unsure but there could be
that possibility.  If so I would hope that the role does not become too
onerous for any of us.

To assist Mr Wilson's deliberations I enclose a copy of Dr Nicholson's
initial report to Lord Justice Taylor.  It was presented at the hearings
and therefore is in the public domain.

I would hope to meet with Mr Wilson in the near future and introduce him to
Dr Nicholson.  T would also make myself available to show Mr Wilson the
football ground if he wishes and to answer any questions about our
investigation and findings to date.  1 understand that you have permitted
us to make our arrangements direct with Mr Wilson.

In closing may I take this opportunity to thank you for affording us the
assistance of the Forensic Science Service in this sensitive enquiry.

       Dear Sirs

       HILLSBOROUGH - CRUSH BARRIERS

       I refer to your letter of 20 October and my reply of 23 in respect of
       Hillsborough and your request for samples of the barrier 124a.

       Since my writing to you there have been further developments and I have
       now received an undertaking from the Director of Public Prosecutions
       that he has no objection to the release of the barrier and for samples
       to be made available to interested parties for further tests subject to
       three conditions which he lays down.  I understand that he has written a
       letter to you stating what these conditions are.

       However, you will appreciate that the Director of Public Prosecutions is
       not the only one who has an interest in the barrier. Lord Justice
       Taylor, on whose behalf I originally seized the barrier, has an
       interest, as does H.M. Coroner at Sheffield.  I have also received a
       letter from Davies Arnold Cooper, who as you know represent Sheffield
       Wednesday Football Club and who also want access to the barrier and who
       make it quite clear in their letter that their clients are ultimately
       the owners of the property. Because of these various interests the
       purpose of this letter is to inform you how I intend to proceed.

       The situation at present is that the Director of Public Prosecutions
       does not see any further need to retain the barrier subject to receiving
       assurances from the Health and Safety Executive, in writing, that they
       have no further use for the barrier and that the Director of Public
       Prosecutions has the opportunity of having a representative present at
       the time of future tests, that the opportunity will exist to take
       photographs and all reports and data are made available to the Director
       of Public Prosecutions/Crown Prosecution Service.




   PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT                       Lloyd House, Birmingham
                                   -   2   -




However, as you know the interest in the barrier is not restricted to
the Director of Public Prosecutions, or myself on his behalf.  Lord
Justice Taylor has an interest and once I have received the letter from
Dr Nicholson at the Health and Safety Executive declaring they no longer
have interest then I will write to him to seek'his approval.  Furthermore,
HM Coroner at Sheffield will also want to give similar approval once
Dr Nicholson has issued his letter.

All this might seem a little bit bureaucratic but given that the barrier
could be an important part of any subsequent proceedings then I wish to
be assured that all parties I relate to have had every opportunity to
examine and carry out tests.  Having said that, I do hope that it will
not be long before I can release the barrier and certainly in plenty of
time for you to carry out what work you wish  in good time for the
commencement of the civil case.

I trust this letter is of assistance to you.   Please rest assured that I
will not delay the release of the barrier without good cause.

                 Dear’ Sirs

                 HILLSBOROUGH - CRUSH BARRIERS

                 I refer to your letter of 20 October and my reply of 23 in respect of
                 Hillsborough and your request for samples of the barrier 124a.

                 Since my writing to you there have been further developments and I have now
                 received an undertaking from the Director of Public Prosecutions that he
                 has no objection to the release of the barrier and for’ samples t.o be made
                 available to interested parties for further tests subject to three
                 conditions which he lays down.  I understand that he has written a letter
                 to you stating what these conditions are.

                  However, you will appreciate that the Director of Public Prosecutions is
                  not the only one who has an interest in the barrier.   Lord Justice Taylor,
                  on whose behalf 1 originally seized the barrier, has an interest, as does
                  H.M. Coroner at Sheffield.   I have also received a letter from Davies
                  Arnold Cooper, who as you know represent Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
                  and who also want access to the barrier and who make it quite clear in
                  their letter that their clients are ultimately the owners of the property.
                  Because of these various interests the purpose of this letter is to inform
                  you how I intend to proceed.

                  The situation at present is that the Director of Public Prosecutions does
                  riot see any further need to retain the barrier subject to receiving
                  assurances from the Health and Safety Executive, in writing, that they
                  have no further use for the barrier and that the Director of Public
                  Prosecutions has the opportunity of having a representative present at the
                  time of future tests, that the opportunity will exist to take photographs
                  and all reports and data are made available to the Director of Public
                  Prosecutions/Crown Prosecution Service.


                                                                    B i rm in g h a in                          Con t.
            PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT
However1, as you know the interest in the barrier is not restricted to the
Director of Public Prosecutions, or myself on his behalf.   Lord Justice
Taylor has an interest and once I have received the letter from Dr
Nicholson at the Health and Safety Executive declaring they no longer
have interest then 1 will write to him to seek his approval.    Furthermore,
II.M. Coroner at Sheffield will also want to give similar approval, once Dr
Nicholson has issued his Jetter.

All this might seem a little bit bureaucratic but given that the barrier
could be an .important part of any subsequent proceedings then 1 wish to be
assured that all parties I relate to have bad every opportunity to examine
and carry out tests. Having said that, 1 do hope that it will not be long
before I can release the barrier and certainly in plenty of time for you
to carry out what work you wish in good time for the commencement of the
civil case.

I have received a letter from Hammond Suddards, who as you know represent
South Yorkshire Police, who have also requested access to the barrier for
the purposes of securing samples.    They have also written to the Director’
of Public Prosecutions seeking his permission for such samples.    It occurs
to me that Hammond Suddards may not be the only parties who wish to take
samples of this barrier and carry out further tests. Consequently, I have
agreed with the representative of the Director of Public Prosecutions'
office that once I have all the assurances that we no longer need the
barrier then he, Mr Kennedy, will undertake to contact you and the other
representatives of the parties involved in order to discuss the best way
forward. Sheffield Wednesday Football Club who are ultimately the
'owners' of the barrier’, no doubt, will wish to have their say in respect
of the way forward.
                                                                       X'"
I trust this letter’ js of assistance to you. Please rest assured that I
will not delay the release of the harrier without good cause.

           Dear Dr Nicholson
                                                                                                         ft

           HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

           I refer to your letter of 23 October and our recent telephone
           conversations.   The purpose of this letter is to confirm the agreement we
           made over the telephone. We discussed the following points

                   1.      I have noted the reports etc, you prepared for Lord Justice
                            Taylor'. No doubt Mr Wha 1 1ey will find that information most
                            helpful.

                   2.      I also note that you are about to prepare a second report which
                            is at present in final dr-aft.   1 would like a copy and I would
                            seek your approval, subject to Lord Justice Taylor agreeing, to
                            be able to submit that report to the Director of Public
                            Prosecutions for’ his information.   I would also seek approval
                            from Lord Justice Taylor for the Forensic Science Service to
                            examine the barrier, to read your initial report and second report
                            presently in draft.

                   3.      I have noted the view from Health and Safety Executive Management
                            so far as your further involvement is concerned.   As we discussed
                            on the telephone today, the Director of Public Prosecutions is
                            attempting to involve the Forensic Science Service which may mean
                            there will be no need for’ any further H.S.E. involvement, other
                            than perhaps the giving of evidence on findings you have already
                            made.

                                                                                                     Cont...




    PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT                       ^ i rm in g h a m
    4.   .1. noted the copy of the Chief Constables' Working Party on
         Hooliganism at Sporting Events and their1 invitation to you to
         contribute.    I have no objection in principle to you discussing
          the process you adopted, but I would like you to tread warily
         where you could supply information which could be material to
         any criminal proceedings.    Having said that you may well be able
          to get round that difficulty by concentrating on the processes
         rather1 than the findings.

    5.    A prime purpose of this letter’ Is to address the Issue of the
          barrier IP^ia and whether you have any further use for it. As you
          know we have received a number’ of requests for’ samples of the
          barrier from solicitor’srepresenting civil litigants.    What I
          need to establish from you, in writing, is whether in fact you
          have completed your1 tests on the barrier, that you are satisfied
          wi tli the resul ts and that you have no further use for the
          barrier.    At this time 1 am not interested in any other barriers
          you possess or any tests that you may undertake upon them. Once
          I have a letter from you indicating that you have no further
          interest in the barrier I will write formally to Lord Justice
          Taylor, 11.M. Coroner and the Director of Public Prosecutions
          advising them accordingly.     I will seek from them letters
          indicating that they have no further interest in the barrier.
          Once 1 am in possession of all those letters then I will advise
          the Director’ of Public Prosecutions who will progress the matter
          with solicitors representing the owners, Sheffield Wednesday
          Football Club and the other civil litigants.

    6.    As you know the pre-trial hearing took place this morning before
          Lord Justice Rose.   It may well be that as a result of what the
          Judge has said and in the light of a letter’ written by the
          Director’ of Public Prosecutions that attempts will be made to
          secure samples of the barrier in the very near future. (A copy of
          the Director of Public Prosecutions’ letter which they may quote
          is attached for your information)   I have since discussed this
          letter with the Director of Public Prosecutions' representative,
          Mr Kennedy, and he agrees that we must: complete the procedures
          identified at (5) above before anything is released.   If you
          should have any undue pressure from any of the parties requesting
          samples, please decline their requests and refer them to me.

I look forward to hearing from you in due course.

Yours sincerely

   FIEB NOTE DATED 2A.10.89.   TIME 16.20 amrrnTlmatelv.



   Short conversation with Mervyn Jones about the letter from Hammond
   Suddards.   He mentioned that the civil case was now being held
   before Mr. Justice lose in Manchester in Chambers.      Apparently
   Mr. Justice Steyn was not        any longer.   He was not attending
   as it was in Chambers.   He said that he had spoken to the D.P.P.
   and the D.P.P'S feeling was that this was a criminal investigation
   and that as such should be dealt with on those lines.      I said
   that it was a difficult matter, but I felt that until all the
   work had been done and until the criminal investigation had been
   completed, it was premature to consider releasing any information
   any way.    I discussed with him whether or not he thought it would
^ ^ b e a good idea to get in touch with the judge and point out the
   problems.   He said it was a matter that he would advise to let 'nature5
   take its course*.   No doubt the civil           as   I would realisethe
   problems, and the judge could always get in touch with us or him
   if he needed anything.
   He expressed the view that it was helpful if we all tended to speak
   with the same voice, and at the present time certainly the D.P.P.
   and I were saying the same thing i.e., that it is too early to consider
   letting information go out.

      Thank you for our most useful meeting of last Thursday and also for your
      company at lunch-time.

      As promised I forward notes of our meeting for your records. I am sorry
      they are brief but I think to the point.  If, however, you would like to
      add or alter anything please do not hesitate to do so.

      I have also arranged for a copy of the South Yorkshire composite album of
      photographs used at Lord Justice Taylor's hearing to be forwarded to you
      in the next few days.

      If there is anything I can assist with please do not hesitate to contact
      me. Of course we will be keeping in touch.

      Best wishes.

1.         Press Publicity.


2.         Interim Report - Private and confidential basis.
           Copies to PCA, DPP and QC, Gareth Williams.
           Discussion re categories
           Not get the assessment report - wrong to do so.
           Dr Popper agrees.


3.         Discussed Bradford fire and report.
           Visit to Kent.
           Advanced disclosure - furnished precis of evidence.
           Senior Officer to prove the precis.
           Dr Popper agrees if it can be achieved.


4.         Civil proceedings.   Position in law.
           Hearing on 26 October.
           Releasing information to litigate not until the end of the
           criminal investigation, then a matter of policy for Dr Popper to
           decide.


5.         Police Complaints Auhtority supervision explained. Policy re
           statement release to witnesses. Also Public Interest Immunity
           problem addressed.


6.        Opening of Furnival House. Retaining room downstairs.
          Fax machine remaining.  Leave key with Dr Popper.


7.        Questions 1 - 1 0       discussed

           Impressed with draft book.             Convenient way of presenting evidence.

8.        Finance - Cover for Coroner's Inquiry, Criminal Inquiry,
          Disciplinary Inquiry and Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry.
          Must incur expense in this financial year as much as possibly can.


9.        How many copies of deceased files - Difficult - Depends on how
          many we are going to hand over to other people. At least two,
          possibly a third, a spare set. Jury? Argument whether or not you
          should hand documents to a Jury.  Personally does not think it is a
          good idea. If decide to hand to Jury at least two would be
          required. Mr Jones - about six. Whether chargeable - something
          to look at. Decide whether to disclose the whole of the file
          or just part.
Discussion re Police Federation concern and representation.


Photographs - Dr Popper is missing bundle of South Yorkshire
photographs.  Copy to be forwarded. Dr Popper does not want to use
too many photographs because (1) distressing (2) people don't
understand them.   Dr Popper - 8 sets of photographs. Mr Jones
stated 12. Dr Popper to look at photographs to decide which and
how many.

Role of Mr Jones to manage investigation. Mr Foster and Mr Taylor
- Evidential Responsibility.  Policy issues can to referred to Mr
Jones and to stay with HM Coroner throughout the Inquest
proceedings.

Video - Video Room? Dr Popper - show compilation video in court.
Retain video facilities in court in case anything came up, saves
moving whole court. Two copies of video required.

Re categories at Question 4 - Health & Safety Executive are covered
at (b). Happy with being provided with deceased files as and when
ready.


Blood samples - Continuity - Dr Popper not too worried.


Identification of fire/ambulancemen - Dr Popper found this one the
most difficult to answer. Doesn't think finding individuals is
going to add much to how the deceased died. But may be a question
that relatives will ask. Don't really need the identity of the
individuals. Have to draw the line somewhere.   If workload is
going to be excessive we have to say no. (Satisfaction - high;
evidential value - low.)


Precis - Dr Popper agrees. Which officers would it be.
They would be of senior rank, say Inspector/Chief Inspector.


Finance. To consider a procedure for charging and recovering the
cost of providing extra copies.


Discussion re Anacapa and its immense value, almost a precis.
                      QUESTIONS FOR THE CORONER



How many copies of each deceased file do you require (full file).     Do
you need any separate sections of the file?   If so quantity.


How many albums of photographs required -

     (a) West Midlands
     (b) South Yorkshire


How many video cassette copies do you require?

(Reminder - You may need video room as per Judicial Inquiry for the
Inquests.    Could this be an area to address with respective solicitors.


A report is being compiled for the Director of Public Prosecutions into
the following categories and produced as they are completed:-

     (a)    Police - all relevant statements and documentary
            evidence from police officers.

     (b)    The ground - all statements and documentary evidence
            relating to aspects of the ground, e.g. broken barrier
            signs, tunnel etc.

     (c)    Other emergency services - all relevant statements and
            documentary evidence.

     (d)    Supporters - all relevant statements and documentary
            evidence, including crowd conduct, arrests, etc.

     (e)    Ground Staff - all relevant statements from stewards,
            turnstile operators etc.

     (f)    Extracts of the evidence as provided to you re the deceased
            and injured.

     (g)    The evidence from interviews of those people to be identified
            in consultation with the Director of Public Prosecutions
            relating to their individual culpability.

     We will provide a short report for you for each category and there
     will be a list of witnesses and respective page numbers, properly
     documented for easy reference. Also the evidential document file
     with similar references will be provided where applicable.


     If agreed we intend to provide the copies of the deceased files
     as and when complete as opposed to when all 95 are complete.
     Do you agree?
It is proposed that Detective Chief Superintendent Foster is to be
called for evidential purposes at the Coroner's Inquest, but with
Mr Jones available on site at all times.


Blood samples - negative/positive. Do we strictly prove
continuity to Doctor Forrest. We can do this in most cases but I
would suggest we only prove positive. Does the Coroner agree? (It
may be difficult to prove some of the continuity of these samples
from our early investigations.)


If continuity is otherwise completed and we have some evidence of
first aid being administered to a deceased person do we need to
try to identify individual fire/ambulance officers who have
rendered first aid also. (Because of the volume of evidence and
the poor quality of some of the statements from fire and ambulance
officers it would be necessary to show the video and the
photographic evidence to develop this further. This would
considerably delay the preparation of files.


Will the Coroner consider the use of a precis of evidence in
relation to each of the deceased which would be served on
solicitors acting on their behalf. If agreed a single police
officer would then be able to give all evidence in relation to
that body in accordance with the precis of evidence. (This was a
procedure used at the Bradford Fire Inquest and further details
are included in the attached paper.  If accepted it is felt this
would have considerable ramifications in terms of reducing the
time that it would take to complete the Inquest.)


As the Inquest is now to be held after 1 April 1980, which Police
Force will service the Inquest, i.e. West Midlands Police or
South Yorkshire Police, bearing in mind the costing arrangements
decided by the Home Office and the possible problem of financing
after that date.

              DISASTER


              Following management teams meeting and our conversation yesterday 16 October
              1989, I have been in touch with Detective Chief Superintendent Rick Rickson,
              Kent Constabulary, the Officer in Charge of the investigation into the
              Zeebrugge disaster and made arrangement for the visit of yourself, Detective
              Superintendent Cobb, Detective Chief Inspector Lancaster and myself to his
              Force Headquarters on 15/16 November 1989.

              Briefly the itinary will include lunch on our arrival at Kent Headquarters on
              15 November 1989, followed by the afternoon with Detective Chief Superintendent
              Rickson, Detective Chief Inspector Mike Horswill (Office Manager) and Detective
              Inspector Hugh Moore (Holmes Manager). These Officers will be in a position to
              talk about the Criminal Investigation including the input onto Holmes and
              reporting to the Director of Public Prosecutions but not the Coroners
              Inquiry/Inquest side of the disaster which was dealt with by the Corners
              Officer(s) at Dover with legistical assistance from uniformed operations and to
              a certain extent CID.

              Arrangements have provisionally been made for an overnight stop at Great Danes
              Hotel, Hollingbourne, Nr Maidstone, Kent ME17 IRE, telephone number 0622 30022,
              for the night of 15/16 November 1989, and these will be confirmed with an order
              from Nechells in due course.

              On 16 November 1989 we will return to Kent Headquarters and complete any
              outstanding business we may have with Detective Chief Superintendent Rickson
              and his team. A Senior Officer from Uniformed Operations will then join us
              with the Coroners Officer from Dover and we can discuss aspects concerning the
              Coronal Inquiry, including the report to the Coroner, warning of witnesses for
              the inquest and the handling of the inquest.

              If it was considered necessary/beneficial Detective Chief Superintendent
              Rickson has indicated he could probably secure the attendance of the Coroner
              for a meeting on 16 November 1989, but at this stage I have declined that
              offer.

              After lunch at Kent Headquarters we would then travel back to Birmingham.

We discussed the problem regarding Mr. Pemberton and in particular
the difficulty with regard to the height shown by Dr. Clarkgr
I explained to Inspector Sayers that although I had said that I
wasn't intending to conduct Inquest by post and therefore wasn't
in principle prepared to deal with detailed inquiries on p.m's,
in this particular instance, as the matter had already been raised*
unless it was a one off matter, I had no objection to him getting
in touch with Dr. Clark and indeed within reason, satisfying
Mr. Pemberton regarding the discrepancy in whatever way he
felt was appropriate or necessary.


I said that if there were any unusual comments from Dr. Clark or something
which was unexpected he should of course let me know.

We discussed the post mortem photographs.     These apparently are still sith
South Yorkshire and will sort out how to get hlld of them.

         I hope you had an enjoyable holiday and have come back with fully recharged
         batteries.

         Joan will no doubt tell you that I am hoping to come up and see you on
         Thursday (19th) to update you on the progress we are making.  I have a
         number of questions to raise with you and in order to give you some time to
         consider I forward a list.  If you have chance to glance at them we both
         may find it helpful.

         I have also forwarded a draft copy of a file which we could use.  The
         content is still in preparation but I thought we might be able to discuss
         format and how you would like to see the evidence presented.

         I thought on Thursday I would take.you for lunch locally and if you did not
         mind I would take Inspector Matt Sawers and Sergeant Graham McCombie with us.

         Look forward to seeing you Thursday.




  PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT       Birmingham
                      QUESTIONS FOR THE CORONER



How many copies of each deceased file do you require (full file).     Do
you need any separate sections of the file?  If so quantity.



How many albums of photographs required -

     (a) West Midlands
     (b) South Yorkshire



How many video cassette copies do you require?

(Reminder - You may need video room as per Judicial Inquiry for the
Inquests.   Could this be an area to address with respective solicitors.



A report is being compiled for the Director of Public Prosecutions into
the following categories and produced as they are completed:-

     (a)    Police - all relevant statements and documentary
            evidence from police officers.

     (b)    The ground - all statements and documentary evidence
            relating to aspects of the ground, e.g. broken barrier
            signs, tunnel etc.

     (c)    Other emergency services - all relevant statements and
            documentary evidence.

     (d)    Supporters - all relevant statements and documentary
            evidence, including crowd conduct, arrests, etc.

     (e)    Ground Staff - all relevant statements from stewards,
            turnstile operators etc.

     (f)    Extracts of the evidence as provided to you re the deceased
            and injured.

     (g)    The evidence from interviews of those people to be identified
            in consultation with the Director of Public Prosecutions
            relating to their individual culpability.

     We will provide a short report for you for each category and there
     will be a list of witnesses and respective page numbers, properly
     documented for easy reference.  Also the evidential document file
     with similar references will be provided where applicable.



     If agreed we intend to provide the copies of the deceased files
     as and when complete as opposed to when all 95 are complete.
     Do you agree?
It is proposed that Detective Chief Superintendent Foster is to be
called for evidential purposes at the Coroner's Inquest, but with
Mr Jones available on site at all times.



Blood samples - negative/positive.   Do we str ic t l y prove
continuity to Doctor Forrest.   We can do this in most cases but I
would suggest we only prove positive.   Does the Coroner agree? (It
may be difficult to prove some of the continuity of these samples
from our early investigations.)


If continuity is otherwise completed and we have some evidence of
first aid being administered to a deceased person do we need to
try to identify individual fire/ambulance officers who have
rendered first aid also. (Because of the volume of evidence and
the poor quality of some of the statements from fire and ambulance
officers it would be necessary to show the video and the
photographic evidence to develop this further.  This would
considerably delay the preparation of files.



Will the Coroner consider the use of a precis of evidence in
relation to each of the deceased which would be served on
solicitors acting on their behalf.  If agreed a single police
officer would then be able to give all evidence in relation to
that body in accordance with the precis of evidence. (This was a
procedure used at the Bradford Fire Inquest and further details
are included in the attached paper.  If accepted it is felt this
would have considerable ramifications in terms of reducing the
time that it would take to complete the Inquest.)



As the Inquest is now to be held after 1 April 1980, which Police
Force will service the Inquest, i.e. West Midlands Police or
South Yorkshire Police, bearing in mind the costing arrangements
decided by the Home Office and the possible problem of financing
after that date.
FILE NOTE DATED 6.9.89.


Mervyn popped in to see me:-


1.    We discussed the timing for the Inquest. Things are going
       well but to be realistic didn't look as if it would be
       possible to really get going until September or October
       1990, assuming that there were no hitches.     This was partly
       because of the time the D.P.P. would take and partly of
       course because of holidays.

2.    Mervyn confirmed that there were now no further problems with
       regard to them undertaking the coronal work.


3.    That the® were still some difficulties with regard to the
       D.P.P. investigations as far as finance was concerned,
       this of course doesn't concern me.


4.    Mervyn confirmed that they were progressing with the
       identifications, but he thought that there would be a
       few where they would be able to find nothing at all.
       These were mainly people who had either come along or come
       with people who had themselves died.

5.    I drew Mervyn's attention to the case in Ashford, the electrician
       had been charged with manslaughter.    I asked whether it might
       be possible for him, through his C.P.S. contacts to see if
       they could get a transcript of the summing up as this would
       be very interesting, bearing in mind that it would have had
       to be a summing up directed at recklessness based on gross
       negligence.

6.    Mervyn said that they were still working on the individual
                                              would let me see them-
       as soon as it was possible to present them.

7.     Mervyn wanted to know whether it would be satisfactory if
       statements which were presented to me were in fact duplicate
       copies of what the D.P.P. all correctly indexed etc with
       appropriate summaries.   I thought this would be a very good
       idea.   This would mean that I would see preeisely what the
       D.P.P. had and also would be much easier to follow.
  FILE NOTE   4.9.89


  TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH MERVYN


  At about 12.30 p.m. Mervyn rang to say that Nick Foster had spoken
  to the Blands and that he had been able to caj^Prayfy the situation to
  such an extent that it was felt that it was unnecessary andperhaps
  even inappropriate to follow it up with a letter.

  In those circumstances the letter which we had discussed was being
  detained on his file and was not being posted.

  I told him the substance of my conversation with Dr. Howe and in
  particular that Dr. Howe would make it clear to the Blands again that
  the police were not responsible but thet he had merely sought and been
  given appropriate advise.

  I said that in the circumstances I felt it was correct that the letter
  should not go.

   I then switched to another subject namely that Angela Rowland a Social
  Worker had been in touch, that they were arranging a Study Day for 6th
  October and that they wondered whether somebody from West Midlands
  would wish to attend.   This was intended to prepare the ground work for
^^support of bereaved etc. at the inquest.

  Mervyn felt that this was a little bit premature and that at this stage
  particularly in view of the involvement of the D.P.P. etc. it might not
  be appropriate  for someone to attend but he would very much like to speak
  to Angela so that he could clarify the position.

  Certainly when they came round to having the further Study Day shortly
  prior to the inquest that would be a different situation.
  FILE NOTE   1.9.89


   Telephone call from Mervyn .

 He was rather concerned because apparently the Blands had been in
 touch with the local Police Authority, they had been given to
 understand that it was the police who had said that Dr. Howe couldn't
 or shouldn't take the action which he had been proposing.    Mervyn
 felt that this was not quite right and it was Dr. Howe's responsibility
 as to what he did clinically, but that they had expressed a view on
 the facts which they had been told as to whether a particular action
 fell within or without the law.   I agreed that I was ......... ring
 Dr. Howe and explain to him that he ought to rediscuss the matter
 w ith the Blands and that it had to be clear that the decisions which
 were taken were his.   Mervyn said that he would arrange for        ..
 Foster to speak with the Blands and put the position to them and that
 he would also write a letter so that they would have something in
 writing regarding this matter.

 Mervyn consequently rang me and said that he had drafted the letter and
 wanted to let me have a look at i t . I explained that I would not be in
 in the afternoon and we agreed that he would phone me as soon as the
 draft was typed so that I could think about i t .

        Medico-Legal Centre
        Watery Street
        Sheffield
        S3 7ET




        Dear Dr Popper

        HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

        Thank you for your letter of 1 August 1989 inviting me to undertake the
        enquiries on your behalf into the 95 people who died at Hillsborough on
        15 April 1989.  Your letter was most useful in clearing the lines of
        responsibility with South Yorkshire Police.

        As you know the Director of Public Prosecutions has suggested to Mr Peter
        Wright, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, that it would be
        appropriate for a full criminal investigation to follow.  Mr Wright has
        written to me and invited me to undertake that investigation.  I will be
        accepting that responsibility.

        Of course this will have an effect on the timing of your full inquests
        which I know were scheduled to commence on 15 January 1990.  Our criminal
        investigation clearly will take some months before we are in a position
        to submit a file of evidence to the Director of Public Prosecutions.
        Furthermore, it is unlikely that the Director of Public Prosecutions will
        respond very quickly on this very important issue.  Consequently, I
        cannot realistically see the Director of Public Prosecutions giving his
        decision until the summer of 1990 at the very earliest.

        As you appreciate this will impact upon your inquests.  As you know Rule
        26 of the Coroner's Rules 1984 indicates that I should make application
        to you for you to adjourn your inquests for 28 days or for a longer
        period as you may think fit.  At this point in the investigation I
        cannot say whether any person or persons may be charged with an offence,
        but we cannot discount the possibility.  I think it appropriate,
        therefore, for me to formally request you to continue your adjournment
        of the inquests until such a time that we have received a response from
        the Director of Public Prosecutions.  At that time, depending upon his
        decision, we can perhaps discuss further the way forward.
                                        - 2 -


     In the meantime we will continue our enquiries into the deaths so that
     we will be in a position, when we receive the Director of Public
     Prosecutions decision, and if it is to the effect that no further
     action will be taken, to proceed with your inquests as soon as
     practicable.

     As you know Mervyn Jones is leading the investigation and over the
     coming months he will keep you informed, on a confidential basis, of
     developments.

     Can I also add at this stage how much we have appreciated your direction,
     advice and support.  The Hillsborough Inquiry, given that there are
     effectively four investigations within one, would have been further
     complicated if you had not taken such a helpful and supportive role.  I



'•
     am sure that Lord Justice Taylor also sees it that way.

     Yours sincerely




     Chief Constable

BILE NOTE DATED 16.8.89.
MEETING WITH MERVYN JONES. MEDICO LEGAL CENTRE


1.   Mr. Jones said that he was still waiting to hear from the D.P.P/
     South Yorkshire whether ¥est Midlands were to deal with the
     criminal investigation.    He explained that strictly speaking
     this had to come via the Chief Constable in South Yorkshire.
       He would let me know.

2.   We discussed timing, he thought that the paper work wouldn't be ready
     until the turn of the year and that they would be several months
     before the D.P.P. were in the position to take a view.
     It was obvious that if I had to postpone the Inquest that there
     would be a considerable delay and that it would exceed a year,
     for/rlgxstration purposes.

3.    We discussed the matter a little bit further.      He explained that
     he was going to get the assistance of Counsel earlier on to give
     him guidance.    I asked him what was involved.    He said he wasnt
     entirely sure but he hoped that Counsel would be able to direct
     him with regard to some of the legal aspects which had to be
     considered.     I said that obviously this was a matter for them
     but it seemed to me that some of the legal questions which had
     to be answered were a. whether in fact a person could be guiltyy
     of a manslaughter charge if he had done his best, even if his
     best was an imcompetent best.     If the answer to that question was
                                                         U t *

     "no, one could not file a manslaughter charge* than unless one
presupposed malice or some form of deliberateness it was difficult
     to see how a charge could lie.     I explained that I didn't
     know the answer to this question and that it was a matter of
     getting a real good lega,l brain to think this through.     The
     second question that I thought needed thinking through fairly early
     was similar but not quite the same and that is, whether     m not   a
     perfos   who has been placed in a position where he was supposed
     to assist such as for example a doctor or policeman for that
     matter in the Hillsborough context, whether such a person could
     be deemed to show such a degree of recklessness if he made a
     mistake as to enable him to be charged with manslaughter, and
     in particular whether it was in the public interest that people
     in that situation iould be faced with such a criminal risk.
     The point I was trying to make was that it may not be in the public
     interest to put people who seek to help, sort out situations or
     ameliorate problems in a positio^yhere they axe potentially liable
     to^crijgLnal proceedings even if      ±g justified that they might
     be^liable for damages is there were some breech of duty.         Mervyn
     pointed out that the whole thing hinged on the issue of duty and
     breech thereof with damage, but it was obviously a matter which
     would have to be carefully considered.     The final point of course

     is t& jgo&siiK®    what (vx,+pn+ •»•#> .4. _ n
                0Xtent if at a 1 1 W     criminal activity could be
_
                               - 2 -



                 out of the "common purpose” which Lord Justice
Taylor seemed to refer to when he said that the fans had a single
minded determination to enter the ground".     However the fact
that a lot of them were not drunk was undoubtedly a factor
which would have to be considered in this context.

We then spent a few minutes talking about the Glub and the
Structural Engineer.    The position of course there is rather
different re the criminality and the police and perhaps a little
bit more analogous with the situation in Zebrugge.      We did not really
explore this in any detail.
I mentioned th&ttl had seen     Jim   Tua&nbull the Coroner who dealt with
the Bradford Fire Disaster and who had indicated to me that in 1985
-things, the question of manslaughter had not really been raised in
any meaningful way.     The odd thing of course was that the fire
had started as the result of debris beneath the wooden stand
and it would be interesting to see what the attitude would be
at this present time.     I felt that there had been avery substantial
change in people's attitudes.
Mervyn mentioned that there was a Mr. a*oay down in London who
was very keen on having the Blub prosecuted for Manslaughter and
he was talking of taking out /•*•*■*«£-*»-«* against South Yorkshire
Police Force to force them to do this.
I asked whether there was any problems with regard to continuation
of the coroner's work and it would appear that no further difficulties
were being experienced with regard to Ahat and in particular the
suggestion that they shouldn't be doing it.

Mervyn gave me a copy of the transcript of the first day of the hearings •
He also gave me a copy of the work which had been done up to now on
 the visual identification of the deceased, „a very impressive chart
 it is too.
 Mervyn very kindly offered to allow Vicky to show me and Joan how
 to use their word processor so that if need be we could use it whilst
 we were waiting for ours to go on stream.
 I thought it might be needed in connection with the circulation
 regarding the possible postponement of the Inquests, if the D.P.P.
 decided that he wanted a criminal inquiry.
 Mervyn said that he would let me know any developments.




 I was travelling in the car at           when I heard on the news that
 the D.P.P. had announced that he was carrying out a criminal inquiry.
 I telephoned Mervyn and told him of this development or rather I
 told Vicky as he was on the phone to his Chief Constable.        He then
 rang back later and asked what I had actually heard and in particular
 had it been the D.P.P. or South Yorkshire who had made the announcement.
 I said as far as I knew it was the D.P.P. that I was referring to.
Mervyn wanted to know whether I still wanted to have the statements,
particularly as I had indicated that I was not likely to be
making such an effort "to read it all fast.   I said I thought it would
still be useful to read these, though I did intend to slow down
the amount of effort that I was putting into it, bearing in mind that
it was not known whether the work I was doing wouldn't be abortive.
Mervyn agreed that he would keep me informed of progress, in particular
as we might still have to make plans for the Inquest, and the more
notice we had the better it would be.
Friday 11th Aug. 1989

Tel call from Mervyn in the evening.
                                                      O   f   f      ~
He told me that they had had a short meeting with the €PS/Mr. Newell.

He anticipated that the DPP would want an investigation but that
the mechanics had still to be sorted out.

He thought that that he would increase his team and still continue with
the Coroner's inquiries whilst at the same time dealing with the criminal
investigation.

I confirmed that I felt that was necessary because if the DPP decided
toproceed than we would still have to take the medical evidence and possibly
the evidence relating to the position of the deceased in the croud. We
would not deal with the other aspects as the inquest would be adjourned
under sect 16 C.A 1988. In effect it would be a truncated inquest.

If the DPP did not proceed than we would have todecide how to deal with
the matter but I thought that it would have to proceed with a full
inquest on^he lines which we had been discussing up to know.

I pointed out that if the DPP decided to have aninvestigation that I
would after notifying the solicitors/bereaved that the inquest would
not proceed on 15th Jan as at present invisaged that I would probable
slow downif not stop with my consideration of the evidence as there
was not much point in doing a lotof work which in the end would not
be needed.

We agreed that we would meet during the coming week to discuss the
situation and how to proceed.



Tel conversation 14th Aug. 1989

tel call from Mervyn at home. I was not in. I phoned him in
Birmighham and we arranged a meeting for Wed 16th for 9-9.30 a.m
FILE NOTE 11TH AUGUST 1989 FRIDAY.

Tell call from Mr. Newall CPS.

a. had conversation with WMP (Mr Dear and Mr M Jones) He felt
that CPS would probably have to look into the matter but that the
request had to come from S.Yorkshire and in particular that S. Y
wanted WMP to carry out the inquiries.

b. He felt that this would like be asked for shortly but that until
he had sorted out the responsibilities he would not be able to write
to me.

c. Nevertheless he felt that he wanted to get in touch with me as
soon as possible but of the record so that I might be aware of what
was going on and so that I might not wander what had happened to
his reply.

d. He felt that if the matter proceed that WMP would probably be able
to produce a reportby say the Christmas or the turn of the year.
He thought that theCPSwould take a few months over the consideration
but that with all these things it was possible that it would take longer
than anticipated.

e. I pointed out to him that I would like to be informed of the decision
as soon as possibleandin particular that I would like to have a letter
asking me to postpone the inquest if that was their wish, he indicated
that he thought that that was what they would like.
FILE NOTE DATED 8.8.89. TELEPHONE CALL WITH MERVYN JONES.
HE CONFIRMED THAT HE WAS MEETING THE D.P.P. ON FRIDAY.


He said he would let me know what the outeome was, but he

had the impression that there were inclined to want to look

into the general aspects first.    I said if he would let me
                                         ( f t

know the outcome of the conversations, 4are, particularly

it's important to know how long it will take, as I thought

that if they were going to investigate it, there would be

no way in which we could meet the 15th of January.

I also mentioned to Mervyn that he might like to consider

whether or not it was possible in the case say of a

Police Officer or a Doctor for them to fall within the second

limb so to speak of Involuntary Manslaughter, where their

objective was to keep order etc.     If as a matter of law

it was felt that the public interest would not be served

by bringing p rosecutions in that sort of circumstance, then

of course the issue in some ways was resolved irrespective

of what blunders if any were made.

I said clearly this was a matter which had to be very carefully

thought about, and I wouldn't expect the D.P.P. to take an

instant decision on it, but it was important to know whether

this was an argument which held water.      I said that I still

didn't feel that I had correctly formulated the point that I

was trying to make to him.   Mervyn thought that the D.P.P.

would probably want to look at the overall situation, not just

as it affected the police.   I said obviously that for other people

these considerations which I had just mentioned would not

apply probably and in the end it would be a matter for the D.P.P.

to decide.   As far as I was concerned, we could either go on

under his agreement or alternatively wait until he has finished.

My impression was that Mervyn would prefer the latter as he

thought that it would be more convenient                          .
FILE NOTE DATED 3.8.89. THURSDAY.
MEETING WITH MERVYN JONES AT THE MEDICO LEGAL flBfflFRlB.
*

1.   We discussed a matter on which I had written to Mr. Dear.       Mervyn

      confirmed that this was entirely satisfactory.

2.   We discussed the draft letter to the D.P.P. and he had no

      amendments to surest.

3.   He mentioned that if a D.P.P. Inquiry were to be initiated,

      apart from the delay it would cause delay in the Coroner's

      Inquiry, as they would have to deal with that first.

4*   He informed me that Civil Litigation had commenced

      and that two cases had been selected, namely, Chapman No. 6 7

      and Simmer N o. 4*

5.   He told me that disciplinary proceedings were being initiated

      in connection with various matters, one of which was Mr. Hayes's

      comment regarding the Disciplinary Aspects relating to Chief

      Superintendent Duckenfield.    The matters had been referred

      to two separate police forces apart from the complaints procedure.

      Clearly this would complicate the investigation and matters

      even further.

6.   He told me that they were going to employ a psychiatrist

      to assist with psychiactric problems    in particular with

      regard to members of the force but also with how to handle

      some of the problems arising out of questions posed by the

      bereaved.   He confirmed that if I wanted to have access to

      the psychiatrist to discuss matters with him he was sure that

      this could be arranged.

7.   He confirmed that they were going to debrief the officers.

      He told me that the number who had been present and the

      maximum was 437*

8.   He told me that he was obtaining a copy of the Hillsborough

      Report for me when he attended on the Friday.

9.   During the meeting, in fact Mr. Whalley, Secretary to Lord

      Justice Taylor rang to say that a copy would be available

      for me with the compliments of Lord Justice Taylor at 11.a.m.

      at Committee Hoom 4 from Chief Superintendent Cornwell of Her

      Majesty’s Constabulary.
10.   We arranged to go and visit the ground and Mervyn indicated

       that *he wanted to meet with me in about a fortnight or so.




1.    We attended at the Hillsborough Postball Ground, the scene of the

      disaster.   We inspected the external approaches, in particular

      turnstiles A to G.   We then entered the ground and then went on

      to the Leppingp Lane terraces and had a look at the position,     fhese

      of course had by now been repaired though the barrier which had

      collapsed had not been replaced.   We had a look at the tunnel and

      in particular the slope.

2.    Whilst we were there Mr. Macks’
                                    ll 1 came for a few moments.     He introduced

      himself but apart from greeting him and saying Goodbye I in fact had

      no conversation with him.   He indicated that he was going on holiday

      soon.

5.    11 thi meeting earlier that morning Mervyn had indicated that the

      cost of the Inquiry was very substantial and that they were in

      negotiations with South Yorkshire regarding these and in particular

      there was some concern as to their involvement in respect of the Coronal

      activity, but he thought that the matter would now be satisfactorily
      resolved.

4*    We were accompanied, when we went to the sports ground by Chief Inspector
      Malcolm   .he.......

                          SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE RECOLLECTIONS

        Thank you for your letter of today's date, which we have already discussed.

        The main difference between the initial and final versions of the South
    Yorkshire Police Officers' statements is that any expressions of opinion were
    (as I understand it, on the advice of Mr. Woodward) removed from the final
    version. As I understand it, Andrew Collins' view is that there is absolutely
    no reason for excluding such expressions of opinion when they touch on natters
    relevant to the Public Inquiry and that,in the circumstances,there is no
    objection in principle to written statanents containing such opinions being
    submitted to the Inquiry.

        Clearly, in view of the personal undertaking which you have given to the
    Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, Andrew Collins agrees that it would not be
    appropriate to use the original statement for the purposes of the Inquiry when
    this has been superseded by a subsequent statement. However, what I understand
    nay have happened in the case of the Officer who gave his evidence yesterday is
    that the original unamended statement was circulated because of the need to
    circulate statanents to all parties as much in advance of the calling of the
    relevant witnesses as possible and because at the time of circulation of the
    relevant batch of witness statanents the revised, final version of the
    statement in question had not yet been received. I understand that in total
    there are three cases where this has been necessary: P.C.s Best, Huckstepp and
    Illingworth. However, in such cases only the final, revised version of the
    statement was given to the press.

        I trust that this problan will not recur       in the future.

        I have not copied this letter to the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire
    Police, but am naturally happy for you to do so.

 HIE NOTE DATED 6.6.89. MEETING WITH MERVYN JONES AMD SUPT NICK FOSTER

     FOBNIYAL HOUSE - 2.15.



     1.   A review meeting was held to discuss progress and action to be taken.

     2.   I was informed that considerable progress was being made with

          regard to identification.     They thought that maybe anything up

          to mid-sixties had now been identified to their location though

          not necessarily as to the point of death or place of death.        It would

          seem that nearly all the dead were in Pen 3, though there was at

          least one confirmed death in Pen 4*      They were still working

          on it but they anticipated that there might be some whom      they

          would not be able to pick out.

3.        I drew their attention to the letter from the solicitors about

          Gary Philip Jones.      This is one whom as far as they can tell

          was not picked out as they had not expected to find somebody who

          had managed to climb over the fence alive.      I said that I would

          let them have a copy of that letter so that they could look into

           it.

4.        I agreed to let them have any other correspondence which would

          appear to be relevant to the work which they were doing.

5.        We discussed continuity i.e.,    trying to trace a person from

           terrace to mortuary.     §on& of these had been established but

           there were a few where it was thought that it was unlikely that

           the full tracing would be possible.

6.        I was given a flow chart of time sequences which had been

                                   .   Wfest Midlands were working on similar

           charts for each one of the 95 deceased with a view to tracing

           their progress from home to death.

7.        The work on the individual files was progressing, where others

           were by no means complete.

8.        They now had about 9>000 references and maybe 2,000 statements.

9.        We discussed the statements.     It was agreed that they would let

          me have a representative sample of key statements over the next

           few weeks so that I could see and get the feel of what was being
In view of the volume and the impractical!ty of trying to

read every single statement, bearing M    mind that I was

on my own and I also had normal coronal work, they were proposing

to prepare a briefing schedule giving the major key witnesses

and some indication of the volume and substance which the

evidence had.     This would then enable me to consider the

evidence with a view to deciding who to call.

We discussed the ambit of the Inquest in relation to the

Public Inquiry.    On the whole we thought that we would have

to do a fair bit of what had already been done in the Public

Inquiry particularly as the Jury could not be expected to

read the transcripts.

We discussed the possibiliiyof maybe agreeing bundles of statements

with solicitors with a view to reducing the length of the Inquest,

but this is obviously something for the future.

We discussed releasing of p.m. reports.     On the whole, Mervyn

felt that I ought to stick to my normal practice and not let

them go, despite the pressure, as this could create difficulties.

I said I would reconsider the matter, but I was inclined perhaps

to let all the ones who had died at Hillsborough go, but retain

the ones who had been shifted around, as there might still be

some amendment to those.

We discussed the duration of the Inquest.    Mervyn was of the opinion

that it might easily take 3 months and taking into account the

volume of work and the detail* and the xomplexity of establishing

individuals, locations and so on.    In addition to that there was

all the general information which would be required.    It might

be that if Counsel were present who had already been at the Inquiry,
                                   their
they might restrict the length of/questioning. This on the

whole was a little longer than I had estimated and for Budgeting

purposes I had considered a budget of about 2 hours per Inquest,

which should equal on the assumption of about 2 5 hours per week

to around 8 weeks.

Mervyn thought that they would not be ready until the beginning
We briefly discussed the question of criminality.   I explained

that if there was any suggestion that Sfecklessness/Manslaughter

or Unlawful Killing could be a factor, then I wanted to be told

as soon as possible and in particular we would have to obtain

the advice from the D.P.P./Crown Prosecuting Service.   I explained

that I would prefer to pre-empt this question by obtaining the

D.P.P's opinion rather than have to adjourn the Inquest in

the middle of the evidence.    Obviously if there was nothing

to point that way, then that was a different question altogether.

We discussed future meetings and              the 22nd of June

but we would review it, and that there was no point in meeting

if there was nothing to say.

Arrangements were being made for 2 sets of p.m. reports

to be sent to me.

I confirmed that I had no objection to Dr. Nicholson the H.S.E.

seeing the p.m. reports as he was working on questions directly

relating to the Inquiry.

I was given a set of plans of the stadium.

The meeting broke up at about 4*15 or 4*20.

                               TIMING OF INQUESTS

    Thank you for your letter of 25th May.    Lord Justice Taylor has now seen a
copy of this.

    I confirm that your understanding concerning the two stages of the Inquiry
is correct.

    As regards the timing of the inquests, this does not pose any problems as
far as I am concerned. I would also confirm that Lord Justice Taylor is content
with what you propose.


                                  Yours sincerely,




                                  D. Brunmell
                                  Assistant Treasury Solicitor.

 FILE NOTE DATED 31.5.89.



 Spoke to Mervyn.   Arranged to meet him to discuss the
 work for the Inquests next Tuesday.   I raised with him
 the question of releasing the post mortems.    He recollected
 that this had been discussed and on looking through his
 records, he found that on the 2nd of May we had discussed
 this question at Fumival House and come to the conclusion
 that it would be wiser not to release them at this stage.
 He had. made a note that he would discuss this with the
 Inquiry Team on the 3rd, and apparently this was done.


 Mervyn thought from his observations that Counsels and
solicitors at the Inquiry would almost certainly want to come
back to the Inquest and go over the ground again.   He also
could see that because of the need for detail, that the inquiry
would take a great deal of time.   This incidentally is the view
which is shared by Dr. Chambers, who felt that I would need
to sp end a fair bit of time on this Inquest.

            Dear Dr Popper

            HI LLS B O R O U G H D I S A S T E R

            I am grateful for your letter of 22 May in which you enclose your most
            useful aide memoire.  My initial reading indicates that it will be a
            most useful document over the weeks to come to refer.  Detective Chief
            Inspector Kevin Tope is overseeing the enquiries into the disaster on
            my behalf for you and I have passed the aide memoire on to him to
            consider with a view to a response.  I will let you know in due course
            what our reaction is, either by letter, by meeting or possibly both.

            Yours sincerely

                                                 25th May         89

    Mr. D. Bruxmell,
    Treasury Solicitor,
    Hillsborough Inquiry,
    Town Hall,
    Sheffield.


    Dear Mr. Bruramell,


    ReI TIMING OF INQUESTS

    When I first met Lord Justice Taylor on the 18th April X felt that
    X would probably want to conclude ray inquests after completion of
    the Inquiry.

    However in the light of my understanding of the way Lord Justice
    Taylor i® proposing to conduct the Inquiry I feel that X may well
    wish to revise my opinion as to timing in respect of the inquests.

    As X understand it Mr. Justice Taylor is intending to have two parts
    so to speak to the Inquiry*-
       1.     Relating mosaor less sracifically to Hillsborough and based
              to a large extent on formal evidence which X understand may
              be complete sonewrai&feP towards the end of June* X understand
              that it would be Mr, Justice Taylors Intention to issue an
              interim report preferably before the commencement of the next
              football season making any urgent interim recomMtetioas

       2.     Thgesecond part of the Inquiry will be conducted more by
              means of written submissions and would go to the wider aspects
              of safety in sportsgrounds generally as opposed to the
              Hillsborough disaster in particular.

    If my understanding is correct the second limb of the Inquiry clearly
    does not impinge upon the tnqusitions in respect of the deoeased at
    Hillsborough,

    X am therefore minded (subject to having all the information I require
    available) to aim at holding the inquests in the Autumn or early winter.
    This should be well past the time when the oral evidence presently
    being taken has been completed and probably well after the submission
    of any interim report of Lord Justice Taylor. ,
                                              25th May      89


Mr. D. Brummell
(2 )



Before I take any definitive decision I would be gratefulf if you
would let me know whether either you or Sasrt. Justice Taylor have
any views or comments which you would like me to take into account
in making up my mind.

I should perhaps add that it occurars to me that M i m m mayb* a marginal
advantage in concluding the inquests before the final report is
submitted*"this is because if 4tor some reason any evidence were
produced which Lord Justice Caylor might be interested iu he would
still be in a position if he wisheddto incorporate the evidence (or
even re-convene a hearing if he felt that necessary} prior to the
preparation of his final report.

I look forward to hearing from you on this as soon as possible.



Yours sincerely.

LIVERPOOL CITY COUNCIL.______       ,    ____________ __________




We discussed how to reply.   On the whole he felt that he couldn't quite
see what the City were after.   I indicated the sort of reply that
I had in mind and he did not seem to demure from that.


We also discussed the timing of the Inquest in relation to the Inquiry.
I said that I would be writing to him on this in due course.

I mentioned to him that I had been told that there had been a
programme on Channel 4 at about 11.25 or 35 P»a* on Saturday
the 20th called "After Bark" in which had been a discussion
which apparently had dealt with the identification etc.
of the dead and I asked him whether it would be possible for him
to obtain a copy of the tape.   He said he would try and let
me have one.

Telephone conversation with Mervyn Jones, he confirmed that the
Treasury Solicitors felt that we should not disclose the P.M. Reports
to third parties at this stage but to follow normal practice.

He also said that it was perfectly satisfactory as far as they were
concerned to send reports direct to Treasury Solicitors to Dr. David
Brunnell.

                I forward herewith copy letters from Mr Peter Wright, South Yorkshire
                Police, dated 2 k April 1989 and 28 April 1989 respectively. A summary
                of requests made by South Yorkshire Police are as follows. Under each
                item I have made my recommendation to you as to whether the item should
                be released; I leave it to you to instruct me accordingly.

                1.      Copies of South Yorkshire Police Officers completed questionnaires

                        Recommendation - we have possession of the original questionnaires
                        completed by South Yorkshire Police which were produced as a result
                        of a demand from the Chief Constable, South Yorkshire Police, to
                        his officers.  This has already been actioned and they are in
                        possession of copies.  We have retained the originals.

                2.      Copies of statements (or other accounts) provided by South Yorkshire
                        Police Officers to my enquiry team

                        Recommendation - that South Yorkshire Police be furnished with copies
                        of statements made by their officers.  That in all future meetings
                        where written submissions are made by South Yorkshire Police
                        officers, they should be permitted to retain a copy if they have not
                        already done so.

                3.      Chief Superintendent Duckenfield's match briefing notes

                        Recommendation - no copy was retained by Mr Duckenfield and I feel in
                        fairness to him that he should be furnished with a copy in order to
                        assist him in his recollection of events.

                k   .   Copies of the match logs

                        Recommendation - these logs are a record of the transmissions that
                        took place about the time of the incident.  I recommend that a copy
                        be made available to the South Yorkshire Police.

    5.   Photographs

         Twenty-two albums of photographs were produced from film negatives,
         taken by South Yorkshire Police Officers at Hillsborough.  On
         receiving these photographs one full set of 22 albums of photographs
         was returned to South Yorkshire Police.  They now require 8 copies
         of all the photographs for their Solicitors/Counsel.  They require
         the original negatives to produce these OR for me to prepare all 8
         copies.

         Recommendation - I am exploring the practicalities of producing copy
         negatives which will allow South Yorkshire Police to produce as many
         photographs as they wish.   If this is feasible I recommend that copy
         negatives be supplied to them.   If not I can see no alternative
         other than for me to arrange for my Photographic Department to
         produce the albums and charge to South Yorkshire Police.   However,
         this will entail my people producing something in the order of 6,000
         prints which as you can appreciate will take some time.
         Furthermore, I will not be able to do this at the moment as the
         negatives are being worked upon for the purpose of Lord Justice
         Taylor's Inquiry.  To release them now would impede the inquiry and
         you know we share an understanding that that must come first.    If
         you could give me your approval or otherwise to release copy
         negatives or photographs when available, I can proceed.

    6.   Copies of statements provided by non-South Yorkshire Police   Officers
         who performed duty at Hillsborough

         Recommendation - You will see that a total of k 2 police officers
         drawn from Merseyside, Nottinghamshire and West Yorkshire Police
         Forces performed duty at Sheffield on a mutual aid basis.   For all
         intents and purposes, and certainly for manning and payment purposes,
         they became "South Yorkshire" police officers.   I, therefore,
         recommend that they be permitted access to copy statements provided
         by these officers on the same basis as identified with South
         Yorkshire Police officers as described above at item number 2.

    7•   Lay witnesses brought to the attention of the Inquiry Team by South
          Yorkshire Police

         Since these two letters have arrived we have received a verbal
         request for copies of any statements taken from non police witnesses
         who were referred to us by South Yorkshire Police.

         Recommendation - such statements are the property of Lord Justice
         Taylor's Inquiry Team.  South Yorkshire Police do not have any title
         in them and I, therefore, recommend that they are NOT furnished with
         copies.
8.   Lay witnesses - General

     During many meetings between my Inquiry officers and witnesses to the
     Hillsborough disaster, requests have been made for copy statements.
     My officers have not acceded to those requests.

     Recommendation - I recommend that copies are NOT made available
     at this stage.  As we discussed on the telephone, title to the
     statements is with Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry Team and if it is
     intended to call any witness then copies will be furnished at or
     before the hearings.

I will be writing to the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police and
the Secretary of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and advise them
that if they wish to obtain any copy material relative to the Inquiry
they should first make application to you through their respective
Solicitors.  I will not release anything unless I receive direct
instruction from you to that effect.  I think that once the above matters
have been dealt with the number of requests which will follow will be
limited.

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as is convenient as there is a
considerable amount of pressure coming from South Yorkshire Police for an
early answer to their questions.
FILE flOTE   4.5.89


I spoke to Mr. Snow if the Horae Office regarding instructing
independent solicitors an particular whether he thought it would be
a good thing to instruct the Treasury Solicitors.   His view was
that not  .......... the solicitors as they were representatives
of the Government and he did not think it would be a good idea if
they represented me as the Goverments conduct might also be called
into question quite apart from anybody elses e,g, the Council.

I asked him why he thought it was satisfactory for Treasury Solicitors
to act on behalf of the Judicial Inquiry as opposed to the Inquest,
hs view was that the Judicial Inquiry had in fact been set up by
the Goverment which was a rather different situation to mine, I was
an independent Judicial Officer financed by Local Authority.

Mr. Snow seemed to be under the impression that there was not likely
to be any mileage in help for the Council over financing of this
inquest.

He also didn't think that the mere fact that they might be open to
critism would present particular difficulties, this could happen
with any road traffic incident  and it was a matter of carrying the
Council with me.

I enquired as   to what the patter should the Council refuse to finance
matters which   I thought necessary e.g. Council opinion etc., his
view was that   if that were to happen then the only thing one could
do presumably   would be to go for todays judicial review.
  FILE NOTE   3.5.89           HILLSBOROUGH



  Meeting with Mr. Mervyn Jones and Superintendent Taylor of 2.5.89.

  I had a very useful meeting 'with .Mr.. Jones. A.C.C. of West Midlands
  Police Force to discuss the Hillsborough situation.

 Mr. Jones confirmed that he recognised that he was acting not only
 for the Judge but also as my Coroners Officer in this matter and
 that he was extremely anxious that I shall   be fully informed as
 to what was going   on, be involved with the procedures so that Icould
 "take charge" of things as appropriate.

  He informed me of   the scale of the inquiry which issubstantial and
  escorted me round   the building in Sheffield to show me how they were
  proceeding.  In particular he showed me the computer set up where
  the information of each individual case was being logged and also
  the property room where the Sergeant was dealing with the return
  and disposal or property.   A lot of this had been done but there was
  still quite a bit of property which was unidentified and which they
  are a bit doubtful as to whether they would ever find the true owners.

 We dicussed various aspects of the inquiry in particular 1, the lines
 of communication for sending letters and so on which I received to
 the Judicial Inquiry v/here these might be relevant to it.  In principal
 we thought it would be best if these were channelled through West
 Midlands in order to ensure that there was" one central point.
 2, I drew his attention to the fact that Treasury Solicitors had
 requested proper P.M. reports, again I felt that it might be wise if
 these were chanelled through West Midlands.   He was meeting with the
 Treasury Solicitors today and he vtould discuss this aspect with them
 and would let me know what they felt.
 3, We dicussed supplying photocopies of P.M. reports to G .P :s and
 •             department in Liverpool for counciling purposes but
 his advice was that we diould defer this and that I should follow
 my usual practice which is not to disclose these until the inquest.
 Individual cases could be dealt with on their merits if necessary.
 4, We spent some time discussing the interaction of the Inquest with
 the Public Inquiry.  I pointed out to him chat I usually, that an
 Inquest is restricted to dealing with the question of who, when, where
 and how and that for practical purposes cannot deal with why and who
 is to blame(except in so far as it was essential to stray into those
 areas to establish how).

 .1 thought it was important that we should try any avoid unnecessary
  overlap in the two inquiries as it would cause trauma and distress
  to faming and witnesses.  Mr. Jones agreed with this but he feared
  that/a'number of Solicitors in the case ( apparently 72) they might
  well want a re-run of the Public Inquiry.  I said we would try and
  cross the various bridges when we came to it.
6.Mr. Jones said that he would be talking to the Treasury Solicitors
  and Council to the Inquiry on Wednesday 3rd May and discuss with them
  the method of communication.  He would come back to me.
7.He invited me to   come to West Midlands to see how     theOperations
  Room was set out   over there and to meet the Chief Constable.   We
  thought it might   be opportune if Ivisited before the    opening of the
  Public Inquiry.    We agreed that we would try and find a suitable date.
8.He let me have copies of their floor diagrams and procedures which they
  were following, which seemed very interesting and very impressive to
  me.

HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL DISASTER


Meeting with Chief Inspector Tobe.

Chief Inspector Tobs came to see me to inform me that he would be
based in Sheffield together with Superintendent Foster andthat it
would be their path to ensure that the Coroners Inquiry was being
properly conducted and that I would be kept informed etc.

He discussed with me sons of the points which they have in mind and
these were basically in line with what I had already mentioned in
earlier discussions with Sergeant Haste and others mainly that they
would try and establish who had certified the patients, when they
had been certified and that they would try and sort out in particular
the cases who had gone to the hospital . I pointed out that it would
be helpful if one could tie in if possible the crews that had moved
the people from the   ....... and to the hospital and what criteria
if any had applied.   I was particularly anxious to try and establish
those patients who were at the Northern General and at that point
were still alive as opposed to having been brought in dead.

We also discussed the location for the various deceased people, and
in particular how they were going to sort out where they were
positioned.  I mentioned that, I thought it would be helpful if one
could talk to the identifiers as they might be in a position to say
where the people were positioned in the stadium, this should make
the task of the photographic/video reviewers that much easier.
                  V\ ^   s **   V \ ,ir\,
Police Officer              had seen the questionaire which we had sent
out which he thougtt was both helpful and in the sense of what it
contained and also the fact that the approach has been «iade by the
Coroner as opposed to by a police authority*   He reaffirmed that they
were very anxious to co-operate with me and to do all that I thought
was necessary.

I then discussed the question of how and felt that perhaps we ought
to wait and see what the judge would be saying about that on the
following Friday.




THUSDAY     27.4.89

I had a telephone conversation with ACC Jones.   He confirmed that he
had asked someone to call on me, he said he was very aware of my
leads in this matter and that he was sorry that he hadn't been in
touch with me before.  We arranged to meet to discuss the    ........
aspects of the matter on Tuesday 2nd May in Sheffield.

He also gave me the name and telephone number of a Mr. Whally who is
the secretary to the Judicial. Inquiry.  I telephoned Mr. Whally who
was out, I spoke to his secretary , I suggested it would be useful
if I met Mr. Justice Taylor and suggested that Friday might be a
convenient day as he would be in Sheffield.    Mr. Whally's secretary
said that Mr. Whally would be seeing the Judge later on that afternoon
and would no doubt raise it with him.   I gave her my office phone
number, my home phone number and my mobile phone number just so that
they get back in touch with me if any arrangements were to be made.

Nobody in fact got in touch.

            employed as a Dog Ha nd le r ./



            On Saturday 15 April        1989 as part of the mutual aid for South

            Yorkshire Police    I attended at Sheffield to assist with the policing

            of the football match,       Liverpool           versus Nottingham at Hillsborough

            Football Ground.     After being briefed by South Yorkshire supervisory.

f \ ^
            Y o rkshire Police Dog Section,



            Our duty was to patrol       the A&1& road and monitor              incoming vehicles;

            consequently our time was spent away from the ground until

            approximately S.50 pm when we drove towards the ground.
                                                                                PAGE           2
                                                                                si a 11



At this time I saw large numbers of Liverpool                supporters making their

way to the football ground.             The majority of the supporters were

males.      The greater majority were running and on more than one

occasion        I saw   members of the public being jostled by the         supporters.

It was obvious          to me that a number of the s up po rt er s1 were   drunk.   Some
                                                                /
of them were drinking from cans or bottles of bear- as they ran.



PC Ellis and I were then called to 'O’ gate             sA   the ground    to assist      in

crowd control and did not attend at the Lep/irigs Lane end of the

s ta d iu m .



X did not witness any of the deaths or injuries that took                  place.



When the match was eventually abandoned and the supporters                  left the

stadium,        PC Ellis and 1 commenced foot       patrol   in the streets

surrounding the area.            We were insulted on a number of occasions by

Liverpool        supporters,   many of them being drunk,       but due to the

circumstances no action was taken.



I am unable to add any further            information which could assist.

  Dear

  1 am grateful for you advising me of your information about the tragic events
  at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989. I have noted the information which has also
  been made available to Secretary of the Inquiry as well as the Treasury
  Solicitor, who is instructing Counsel to the Inquiry at the oral hearings.

  Having considered your contribution I do not intend to arrange a personal visit
  to obtain any further statement. However, if you have any additional
  information since you last contacted my investigation team or you feel that a
  personal visit is essential please do not hesitate to make contact at any of my
  offices listed above. Alternatively you can write to the Secretary of the
  Inquiry as below: -

  Mr R M Whalley
  Secretary to The Inquiry
  50 Queen A n n e ’s Gate
  London SW1H 9AT

  Lord Justice Taylor has asked me to convey his personal thanks for your taking
  the trouble to make contact and for the contribution you have made to his
  Inquiry.

  Youra    s in c e re ly

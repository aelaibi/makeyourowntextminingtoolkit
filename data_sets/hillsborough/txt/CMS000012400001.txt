               HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM: INTERIM ADVICE



    The Home Secretary and Lord Ferrers have seen your submission
of 26 April and have decided that it would not be right to
circulate guidance at this stage but to wait for Lord Justice
Taylor's interim report.

 HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - HOME OFFICE GUID— ^ ^ ^ N C E TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES

 The M a s t e r may like to see this copy         jf the advice which Home
 Office officials have given the Horn                 Secretary about the
                ^°f lssulng interim guidanc   =    e  to local authorities
   der the Safety at Sports Grounds Act,                 the Taylor Inquiry
 is sitting.

The official advice is doubtful about                 issuing anything now,
because of the risk of pre-empting Lord           J u s t i c e Taylor's report,
They suggest that, if the Home Secretary              considers it essential
to do something, a short circular should            fc>e issued drawing local
authorities'   attention to certain asp            acts        of the existing
guidance. They recommend more firmly agair         i s t an immediate request
to local authorities to impose tighter -           ~estrictions on terrace
capacity, both to avoid pre-empting Tay             o r     and because of the
      t    changing the existing limits               ■-cjht be open to legal
challenge (by the clubs) as "unreasonable
I understand that the Home Secretary has             not   responded to this
submission yet.

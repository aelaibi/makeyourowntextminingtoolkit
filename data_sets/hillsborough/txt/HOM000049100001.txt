 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:                           Good afternoon.       It is very nice of
 4       you to come and see me.                             What is it you would like to
 5       tell me really about your daughter's interview with Miss
 6       Appleton?
 7   A    I was disgusted.                           My late husband and I were disgusted
 8       with the interview.
 9   Q   Were you present during the interview?
10   A   No, I was in the kitchen opposite to the loungewhere                                    the
11        interview took place, and Debra came from the lounge into
12       the kitchen and said, "I can't take any more.                                She is
13       Jaullying me all the time. She is calling me a liar" and my
14       husband threatened to go into the lounge and actually
15       throw her out.
16   Q   You didn't hear any of this?
17   A   I was there in the kitchen.
18   Q   I know, but did you hear?
19   A   No, I just heard raised voices.
         v>_____________________________________                      â€” ----*

20   Q   You heard raised voices.
21   A   That's right, coming from the lounge.
22   Q   And then your daughter came out and said,                                "Ican't take
23        any more of this."
24   A   Yes, "The bullying has to stop now."
25   Q   When was this?
26   A   During the interview.
27   Q   Did she go back then afterward and sign the statement?
28   A   Yes, she went back.                           She said,   "Iwill do anything to get
29        rid of this woman, anything.                             I just want the woman to
30       go. "
31   Q   Did you think that was rather an odd thing to do?
32   A   Yes.            My husband ----
33   Q   Wait a moment.                            I think you are not listening to my
34        question.                       Did you think it was rather an odd thing for
35        her to go back in and sign the statement if she didn't
36        want to?
37   A   Yes.
38   Q   Did you tell her not to?

                                                              2
 1   A   We both - my husband and I - told her that on no account
 2       was she to sign the statement.
 3   Q   But she nevertheless did?
 4   A   Yes.
 5   Q   That's strange, isn't it?
 6   A   Yes.   My husband actually said, "I   will go into the lounge      I
 7       and if needs be forcibly eject the woman, but Debra you
 8       must not go back into the lounge and sign the statement."
 9   Q   So, disregarding your husband, she goes back into       the room
10       and signs the statement?
11   A   That's right.
12   Q   Did that strike you as being rather strange?
13   A   Yes, very strange.
14   Q   Did you ask her why she did that?
15   A   Yes, and she was just in a muddle. She is so confused.
16       She was so angry.     She was so hurt.
17   Q   Did she say what it was she was supposed to havelied
18       about?
19   A   It's such a long time ago, but yes, by the sounds of it,
20       as though she had lied about everything.     This WPC
21       Appleton ---
22   Q   About everything.
23   A   About everything.    She had writtenanother statement, a
24       second statement, and apparently Debra wasn't actually
25       there in some places at Hillsborough.     She wasn't in some
26       places that Debra had written about. It was all so
27       confusing.   It was Appleton's word against Debra's I know,
28       but it was Appleton saying, "You are a liar."
29   Q   She was saying she wasn't in some parts of Hillsborough
30       where she claimed to have been, is       that right?
31   A   Yes.   Debra was hit on the back of   the head, and we don't
32       know by what - it could have been a stone or whatever
33       missiles were being thrown about at the time;     she had a
34       lump on the back of her head.    Appleton said, "You were
35       very badly concussed through this ---- "
36   Q   How do you know that?   How do you know she said that?



                                     3
     A   This is Debra was telling.       I only know what Debra told
         me, you see.
 3   Q   Debra said she had been told she was concussed?
 4   A   Yes.   And this is what was causing all the confusion, and
 5       not knowing what she was saying and so forth.         Quite
 6       honestly ---
 7   Q   When did you first see Debra after Hillsborough?
 8   A   It was on the Sunday morning.      It would be about      7 am,
 9       something like that.
10   Q   She had been up most of the night, hadn't she?
11   A   Oh, she had been up the whole of the night.         The first
12       inkling that I knew she was home was running water.           I
13       found Debra with her head underneath the cold water tap
14       and a bottle of washing up liquid in her right hand,
15       pouring the washing up liquid all over her hair.           She had
16       long hair then.    All the words I got out of her were,           "I
17       can't get rid of the smell.      I cannot get rid of the
18       smell."    I undressed and put herin the shower,         and she
19       tried to scrub herself until she     was    sore.   She could not
20       get rid of the smell.     The police uniform I put into a
21       black sack;     it did smell terrible, but the smell
22       apparently was on Debra.     She scrubbed and scrubbed and
23       scrubbed to try and get the smell off.
24   Q   Did she succeed?
25   A   No, sir;   she didn't;   she never   has    done until this day.
26   Q   She was obviously very upset by this       case?
27   A   My daughter has suffered every day.        There isn't    one day
28       since it happened that she has not spoken about Kevin
29       Williams or Hillsborough.     She wanted a career in the
30       police force.     She couldn't take that career.      It was all
31       finished at Hillsborough.     Her life stopped at
32       Hillsborough.
33   Q   So apart from what Debra has told you, you don't really
34       know anything about what took place between Miss Appleton
35       and her?
36   A   No, only the raised voices and Debra being so very very
37       upset and in tears.


                                      4
 1   Q   She has been upset, I am afraid, by my interview with her?
 2   A   Yes, I knew that would happen.
 3   Q   She is quite an emotional girl, isn't she?
 4   A   She's a very sensible girl.
 5   Q   Is she quite an emotional girl?
 6   A   She is emotional;    she is emotional;   so am I.   She is a
 7       very intelligent girl.     She is not stupid.    She does not
 8       bear fools gladly.     There is one thing I do know:   Debra
 9       came home from Hillsborough that Sunday and told me
10       everything, the horror that she had been through, and I
11       believe my daughter;     there is no reason for her to lie.
12       The horror that she had been through - a young woman.
13   Q   Do you think she was confused at all about what she had
14       done that day?
15   A   No, sir, not at all;    no.   It was so clear.
16   Q   She didn't know how she managed to find her way onto the
17        pitch at one stage.
18   A   Yes.    She has told me many times that somehow she found
19       herself in the foetal position not far away from one of
20       the gates, and she climbed up someone's back apparently,
21       and for some - she doesn't know whether it is seconds or
22       minutes or whatever, she blanked out.     She cannot remember
23       how she came to be in this particular position.
24   Q   You see, in the first statement she made when she says she
25       made in her own words a few days after the event she      says:
26              "I can't really remember how, but somehow I got
27              inside the ground through the large blue gate which
28              was open, and I ended up on the pitch.     I didn't go
29              through the tunnel."
30   A   She has told me that the crowd were crowding in, and      there
31       was a policeman on horseback and if it hadn't been for him
32       grabbing hold of her collar, she would have been trampled.
33       The gate was pushed open and she went through, apparently,
34       with the crowd.
35   Q   I don't know whether you know much about what happened at
36       Hillsborough.     Was it your understanding that this had



                                       5
 1       happened where all the trouble was, where the Liverpool
 2       fans were coming through?
 3   A   All I know is that Debra was on duty at one end, and that
 4       is where - she asked to be moved to help bring the players
 5       in, apparently, by radio.    It was at Debra's end, where
 6       she was, and I can't remember the name of the gate there.
 7       That's where the trouble really started.    That's where the
 8       build up started, you know, it began.
 9   Q   Where the Liverpool fans were?
10   A   That's right, yes;    they were drunk, and they were
11       smashing the houses windows and so forth.
12   Q   You see, I could understand it if she had said that, but
13       she actually says in her statement that she was at the
14       other end, and she confirmed to me today that that's what
15       she meant.
16   A   I only know what she's told me, sir.
17   Q   It does seem as though she is a bit confused.
18   A   I wasn't there.    I can only repeat ----
19   Q   At any rate, you got the impression she was talking about
20       the Liverpool end where the Liverpool fans were?
21   A   Yes.
22   Q   And that was the gate that was opened?
23   A   Yes.
24   Q   You see, the odd   thing is - I don't know really whether I
25       should say this to you, but you are her mother and you
26       obviously love her very much - the problem is that in her
27       statement she was saying that a gate was opened at the
28       other end, at the Notts Forest end, and that she was
29       swept, she now says, she was swept through by the crowd at
30       that end.    Nobody else, as far as I know, who has ever
31       said anything about Hillsborough has ever suggested that
32       the gate at the Penistone Road end was ever broken in or
33       was ever opened.     It is perhaps not surprising that the
34       police were a little puzzled by her saying that.
35   A   Yes.
36   Q   Do you see the problem?    I have to say that when I read
37       her statement originally, I was very confused because I


                                      6
 1       thought she must be referring to the Liverpool end and
 2       that she had got down that end at some stage, but she made
 3       it perfectly plain to me, and on a re-reading of the
 4       statement, that it is plain that she is not referring to
 5       that end;    she is referring to the other end.    I think it
 6       probably will not help for you to talk to her about that,
 7       but I am afraid the truth of the matter is I think she
 8       must be very confused about that.
 9              How many times did Miss Appleton come to your house?
10   A   About four times.
11   Q   What happened on the previous occasions?
12   A   She came with a gentleman a couple of times.      I remember
13       Debra saying he was very nice;    very, very friendly.       Then
14       Miss Appleton came - I think it was three or four times
15       she visited ---
16   Q   Why did she come three or four times?
17   A   Just to go over the statements and everything.      I know    the
18       last time that she came she said that her boss - to
19       Debra - "I have something to tell you Debra.      My boss
20        (whoever it may be) has said that you are a liar;     you
21       were never there."
22   Q   You didn't hear that?
23   A   No, this is Debra.   You know, what Debra told me.     And
24       that she was just a liar and that she was never there at
25       all.    She never gave mouth to mouth or anything to anyone.
26       She wasn't with the bodies or anything.
27   Q   That is an extraordinary thing for a police officer to say
28       because not only was she rostered as being on duty that
29       day, but there is video evidence of her being present.
30   A   That's right.
31   Q   You cannot really help about that.    You are only relying
32       upon what Debra said to you.     Is there anything else you
33       would like to tell me?
34   A   No, sir.    It is just from a mother's point of view, my
35       daughter has suffered.
36   Q   It is very distressing.   I can quite see that.

LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:   There we are, I am afraid.   That is
    the way it is, isn't it.     Thank you very much indeed,
    Mrs. Martin, for coming down.    You have been very helpful.
A   Thank you for seeing me, sir.

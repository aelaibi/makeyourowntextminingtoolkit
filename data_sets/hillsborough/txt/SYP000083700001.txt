                     P o l i c e Stat i o n at Rotherham.

                     At the time of football            m atch which was                   played         in 1988 between the

                     above    two teams,       I was on duty at the L a p p i n g s Lane                             turnstiles,        the

                     end   into which the Liverpool              fans were                converging.                The    crowd entered

                     into an orderly         fashion     until         2,30      pm      (1430)     when           large numbers

                     converged on the          crowd and the queues                      converged          into one mass          of

                     people    tyring    to enter      the   ground.

                     All   e v en tually entered the         ground without                   the amount               of   pressure     that

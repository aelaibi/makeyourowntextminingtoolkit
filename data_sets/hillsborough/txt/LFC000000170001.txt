Far the attention of Mr. G. A. Qisar


Dear Sirs,

             Agreement far Police Services at Football Matches
                             The Taylor Report

       Since our meeting at Anfield I have been able to obtain and read
both Safety Certificates, Operational Orders in respect of matches
held at each ground and further information from Chief Superintendent
Lyons.

      I enclose a draft Agreement for your consideration. Can I
emphasise that in the time available I have not been able to take
detailed instructions from the police as to the content of the
Agreement or tiie Schedule to the Agreement - which details the number
and deployment of police officers at each match. I do not think that
this will be a major stumbling block as existing operational orders
for matches at each ground are already very comprehensive and can
easily be adapted for this purpose.

       You will no doubt recall that when we discussed matters there
was considerable talk of what happened when there was a "major
incident", would the police take over and if so what was the mechanism
for that? This issue, together with the paperwork that I have been
able to read, touches upon the crucial policy issue that has to be
determined in drawing up this Agreement. It was generally agreed that
any agreement would be best and most safely rooted in the existing
safety certificates. It is quite clear in those certificates that the
d u b is responsible for safety with the police acting as their agents
with sole responsibility for public order matters. My immediate view
is the Club, through its nominated officer, should remain responsible
for all decisions throughout a match, in the knowledge that on
occasions he will of course be acting on police advice. I have
drafted the Agreement to reflect that view on which I appreciate there
may well be a difference of opinion.
                                   2
      I look forward to receiving your comments. May I remind you
that I am away on leave until the 27th September.

      Can I suggest that, until the signed Agreement can be finalised,
this document will be the basis upon which Merseyside Police will
provide services at matches? This would cover both clubs far the
Derby match on September 23rd but would not in any way prejudice your
position when it came to suggesting drafting amendments.

      Finally, I have taken the liberty of forwarding a copy of this
correspondence to the club Secretaries direct, so that they are
immediately aware of the up to date position.

                           Yours faithfully,




                             Helen Mercer,

                     re: Agreement for Police Services at Football Matches

       Further to our letter of the 8th September, we have  now had an opportunity
of looking at this matter with our clients. We appreciate    that it is a first draft,
but our clients feeling is that it is probably too detailed in certain areas.

       Before returning the draft amended perhaps you could let us have your
observations on the following matters

       1. Under the definition clause, do you not think that there should be some
definition of "the Police Officer in command" who is referred to under clause 3 (8).

              2. Can you explain to us the intent behind clause 2 (3).

              3. It appears that clause 2 (4) are complementary to clauses 2 (1) and                                                                           (2).

       4. Clauses 3 (1) (iii-iv) are of concern to our clients in the event of a Public
Order situation arising. You will be aware of recommendation 29 of the Taylor Report
provides that the Police Authority should be responsible for the postponement of a
kick-off.

       5. Our clients do not see the necessity for the inclusion of clauses 3 (5)
and (7).

              Perhaps a further meeting with the Club may help to resolve some of these
points.

                                                               Yours faithfully,

Dear       '&
                              re: Agreement for Police Services at Football Matches

            I enclose a letter received from Keith Tamlin via Brussels!

           You will see he is quite content to sit back and wait for the Police.

      I am not sure that this would help us to answer any criticism, but I welcome a
further discussion with you as to this.
                                                          Yours sincerely,

     Dear Tony,

                                     Re: Agreement for Police Services at Football Matches

         Currently               I    am in Brussels for a series of meetings but my secretary
     has read to me                     :*- letter dated the 10th instant and also the enclosure
     thereto.

     Frankly, 1 hav- : ot taken any further steps with regard to the Police
 Authority's letter (although several of the points referred to in your
 draft letter 1 had noted for further query) because I understood that
 the Police Authority, since our meeting, had attended a Conference which
 had led it to believe that the strict attitude which it had thought
 appropriate, following consideration of the Report, was not necessary.
 I believe that discussions will be taking place, if they have not
 already done so, to consider the matter afresh and might I suggest,
 therefore, before any reply is sent to the Authority's Solicitor, the
 current attitude of the Police be sought - on an informal basis?



                                                                        Yours sincerely,

Dear            fix
                                        re: Agreement for Police Services at Football Matches

     Yesterday I met Assistant Chief Constable Richard Adams who advised me that we
 should put the agreement with the Police on "the back burner".

     Discussions were taking place with the Home Office which might lead to the
 requirement for a written agreement being revised.

              I do not therefore propose to respontffc-to Helen Mercer's letter.

                                                                     Yours sincerely,


                                                                               l<0


                                                                     G.A. ENSOR.

               On the afternoon of 15th April 89,        I returned from London where I had

               attended a course on the care of families with a dead or dying member.

               When I heard about the disaster,       I volunteered to help with the cars

               of ^bereaved families & arrived at the Hillsborough Gymnasium temporary

                irtuary at about 21,00.

                 am a Gene ral Practitioner     in medi c ine & a Hospice Doctor.       My

               qualifications are MB ChB M R C G P . I qualified in 1979.

               A policeman approached me jaft /afctfijlft 22,00 & asked me to see a body &

               to the Northern General Hospital for treatment but that no record

               could be found of a doctor      certifying death at the hosp i t a l .I examined

               the body and found no signs of life.

         that I was not required to jgdTv^^vidence of the description or

         i dent ity of the de ceas^k^Jr'" certified death at 22.05,

         I was not asked to certify death in any other case,             though I saw other

         bodies during the process of identification & grieving by bereaved

         relatives.

         I unfortunately cannot remember any details of phe ^identity of the

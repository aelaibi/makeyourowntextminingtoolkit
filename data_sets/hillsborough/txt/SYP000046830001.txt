    Dear Dr Popper

    Enclosed please find the copy of a letter dated 23 Hay 1990 from Messrs Davies
    Arnold and Cooper Solicitors, acting for Sheffield Wednesday Football Club,
    concerning removal of the remaining barriers and safety fence to the Leppings
    Lane terrace before the start of the 1990 football season.

   I have already replied acknowledging receipt of the letter indicating that
   before I respond I would wish to consult you concerning any objections you may
   wish to raise.  In this connection will you please let me have your views in
   writing before mid July 1990.

    From my point of view, I can see no valid reason for objecting to the
    proposals.

   Yours sincerely

     YOUR REF           LS/SA


     Dear Sir

     Hi11sborough Disaster

             to my letter of the 17th May, I have been informed by
     F u r th e r
     the Club that it is their intention to remove the remaining
     barriers and safety fence to the Leppings Lane terrace
     immediately before the start of the forthcoming season.

     The Club have already agreed to the removal of a further
     barrier from the ground for testing in accordance with the
     agreement reached between the experts in the litigation at
     their meeting on the 5th April, it is anticipated by the end
     of July/beginning of August, that these experts will have
     completed their enquiries for the purposes of preparing a
     report, and therefore from that point of view, there is no
     need for the Leppings Lane terrace to remain in its present
     state as the parties to the litigation will not be prejudiced
     by such works being undertaken.  I have informed the parties'
     Solicitors of the Club's intentions in this regard, and have
     said quite clearly that the whole matter should be reviewed
     once again at the end of July when we have a much clearer
     picture of any potential problems that may be caused by these
     intended works.

     However, I am of course extremely conscious of any continuing
     interest your Investigation team may have in the terrace
     remaining in its. present state, together with that of H.M.
     Coroner and the Crown Prosecution Service. I would ask you to
     confirm whether there is any objection to the^e works being
     carried out.    As stated above, the position needs to be
     reviewed at the end of July, but at this stage I would be
     grateful if you would indicate whether there is any continuing
     interest in the terrace.


                                                                                                                                   Contd../..

        pen was        fuller      than      it should be for            that    time and          it was        then that          I

        could feel          the    build up of           crowd      pressure.         The    crush of         peopIe

        w i t h i n the     pen became worse               and we were         pushed agai n s t          our will,           with

                 had hold of my               brother and we            both fell       forw a r d onto            the    people      in

                 upright       once more.

                 After       this    I tried        to drag my brother                thro u g h the         crush       in order      to

                 get him to safety,                 out of       the    crowd    pressure was            so bad that             I could

                 h ardly make any              headway.          I was    s h o uting     for     people          to help me,         but

                most     could no I because                of     vi& crusn.          hows v s r , i mus C i*a v 0 oeen >iv.? ij

                 by some       of the         supporters,         because       I remember         that after what               seemed

                 lifetime,          I reached        the    tunnel       mouth    onto     the     terrace,           w ith my broth

                who was        o n 1 y just       conscious.

                The    crowd        pressure        had eased          by this    stage and           I was able           to half         pu

£5   M          and                carry               into      the    tunnel.        There      I saw       a    policeman       stood

               ! describe          him any further              nor    say what       rank he was,            or    if he was a

                     gular     or special           constable.           I a s k e d him to help me                 but he said.

                                        So     1 kept      going,       trying    to get down the                  tunnel

                Eventually           I was a ss i s t e d        by two s u p p o r t e r s     who    helped me           carry my

                brother        to an amb u l a n c e        at    the back       of    the west Stnad.                   There   he

                received medical                 a s s i s t s n c e and was     revived        en o u g h    10    rr.ak e his a wn w

                much     later to the             coach.

                As    I had been trying                to make my way thro u g h                the    crowd        in pen three

                w ith my       brother         I can recall            seeing    a white male,               2 0 - 2 5 years     of thi

                build,       wit h dark          brown straight           hair    cut a r o u n d      the        ear and over         his

                second       position          in the      pen probably          close     to the       barrier and was

                facing       t h e stand.

                He was       bleeding          pro f u s e l y from his         nose,     crying and              s c r eaming    in pax

 He a p p e a r e d       to toe in alot         of     pain.         I only saw him f i e e t i n g l y and                    cl

not    pay any more a t t e n t i o n            to him as            I was more i n terested                    in gettin

my brother           out.

Once     out of the             tunnel    at    the back of            the West Stand,               I remember

seeing an oldish ma n helped out of a gate                                    from the area at the                      back

of the        t u r n s t i l e s , into the drive            betw e e n      the     river and the               back     of

the West Stand.                  The man,       a white male,             5 0 - 6 0 years        old,       5 ’7 ,!~8"     tal

of m e d i u m      build,       w i t h grey    curlyish short               hair        receeding         at    the    fron

and back           on top was          helped    out       the     gate and was stood opposite                          one     o

the a m b u l a n c e s     parked       in the    driveway.                Then      he s u d d e n l y    collapsed

and fell           to the       ground and       I can recall             seeing          his face         going    blue        i

colour.            There were          people a r o u n d him trying                 to    revive     hirn and          I did

not see        him a g a i n after         this,      so    I cannot          say whet h e r          he was

resuscitated              or not.

After my brother                 had    received some             tre a t m e n t    I left him and tried                     to

get    back        onto    the    terraces,       in order           to find out what                had become            of

          and                                         our    friends.               The    po lice w o u 1 d not a 11

me    ba ck    into       the    pen,    and    so we      h ad    t o wai t f o r a b a ut          thr ee       hours

before        we    saw    them    and    realised         they were          unhurt.

Some    time after              rejoining       them we all            made     our way a way              from the

g round and          returned          to the    coach terminal               to     return to Liverpool.

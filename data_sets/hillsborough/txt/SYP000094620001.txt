               Further to my questionnaire given to the West Midlands Police                                                              in

               connection with the Hillsborough disaster;                                                in which I refer to an

               incident            involving two South Yorkshire Police officers                                                removing a

               supporter from off the pitch during the Li ve r poo 1 /Nott i n gharri Forest

              Cup Semi Final-                    At the time that                  incident took place I was standing

               on the North West terrace,                        between half and three quarters of the way

               up and in about                 the middle of the terrace?                                so I had a clear view down

               onto the pitch and towards the Liverpool                                             goal.            Two or three minutes

              after             ’kick off* and             certainly before the game was stopped I first

                                                                                               83888

                  which 1 produce     reference

                  I then saw the two policemen        go   to this person and pick him up.

                  Although I can not truthfully describe now how the officers               picked him

                  up,   I can remember that     it was done roughly and the officers         possibly

                  thought the man was drunk.        These officers         then carried the man off

                  the pitch and onto the perimeter track where they again seemed to

                  treat him rather     roughly by just      "dropping5 him onto the track.       This

                  was a deliberate action of        'dropping1' rather than an accidental       one.

                  1 did not see where the two policemen came from before the               incident

                  and 1 did not see where       they went to after the incident.          1 can not

                  describe either officer except to say that they were both male and in

                  uniform wearing helmets,        and I cannot   identify either.

                  Dealing with the person on the pitch,          I can not now describe him and

                  I did not see how he came to be in the position on the               pitch in the

                  first   place.    I do remember that this person was waving his arms

                  about at one stage as though the re was somethi ng wrong with hxm and 1

                  assume that he may have been injured.           This assumption was      probably

                  correct     because after   the policemen had dropped the person he was

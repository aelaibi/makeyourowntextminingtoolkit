Whereas   operational error contributed to this tragedy, it is the
existence   and  design of such a spectator section that is at the
core  of   the  problem.    Such facilities not only provide for a
dangerous   situation, they encourage behaviour that compounds the
risk.

I have   always feared   that an incident of this nature was just
waiting  to happen.    I am truly sorry that one of such enormity
took place.

I would   assume  that   some   sort of  public  enquiry  will  be
conducted  regarding   this   issue.  I wish to volunteer whatever
service I might contribute to that effort.

Very truly yours

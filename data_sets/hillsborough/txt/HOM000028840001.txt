         s ta te m en t a b o ut the disaster at the S he f f i e l d Wednesday l“ 'r‘‘0
         Football Club ground at Hillsborough S ta d i u m on Saturday.
         E ve ry o ne has been horrified by this incredible tragedy in
         w h i ch 94 lost th'ir lives and 174 were injured.


         S hortly after the start of the match there was a surge of
         spectators on the Lecoings Lane terrace which c rushed m an y at
         the front a gainst the perimeter fence.                               This accou n te d for
         m os t of the deaths and injuries.


         The m a t ch was due to start at 3 D .m.                         To help ensure orderly
         access, the gates of the ground were opened at 12 noon.                                                    At
         2.30 D.m. m os t of the Nottingham fans were In the ground, but
       many of the Liverpool supporters were still arriving.                                              It was
       clear to the police officers in charge that there was ample
       capacity still to be filled in some Darts of the enclosure
       all oc a te d to Liverpool.


       At about 2.45 p.m.                    there was a large crowd                      of       Liverpool
       s upporters at the turnstiles in Leppings Lane behind the West
       Stand.        There was difficulty in coping with the pressure on
       the turnstiles and the police, used loudhailers to urge the
       crowd to be patient.



                                                                          /At about 2,50 o.m.

       At about 2.50 p.m. more Liverpool supporters a rr i v e d ond the
       numbers      in        front   of   the     turnstiles        increased.         Some
       supporters        started      to climb     the walls ond         turnstiles and
       those at the front of the crowd outside the s tadium were
       under considerable pressure from those behind,


•      The senior police officer p resent considered that there wos a
     Possi b le danger to the lives of the spectators ot the front
     of the crowd o ut s i d e the stadium.             In order to relieve the
    pre ss u re he arr an g ed for an exit sate near the turnstiles to
    be    opened         to    let    a section    of the     crowd       through.      The
    relationship of that action to the disaster on the terrace
    shortly a ft er w ar ds           is clearly    a central        auest i on   to     be
    investigated.


    Hy Rt Hon friend the Prime Minister and I yesterday visited
    the football ground and the two Sheffield hospitals which
    received casualties,               I would like to Day tribute to all
    those    involved           in    the rescue operations     at     the    ground,
    including the many spectators who gave their helpj                       and to
    those others,             including the hospital staffs and voluntary
    agencies who have since been working so hard treating the
    injured and consoling the bereaved. We heard many accounts
    of courage exerted on behalf of others.

            However, we need also to take a wider view.                               The Government
           b el i e v e s that the future of football in this c ou n t r y lies in
           o national m e m b e r s h i p scheme in desisnated grounds and now it
           seems also in providing all                      seated a c c o m m od at i on at m ajor
           football          clubs.          This would     involve     the d i s a p p e a r a n c e         of
           terraces at those grounds.                    It m i g ht also involve amendments
•           to strengthen              the    Football      Spectators        Bill        so       that its
           p ro vi s io ns    for       the     licensing      of     grounds        m at c h e d        this
       concept. We shall be considering these m atters urgently and
       b ri n g i n g chonges forward as soon as possible.


       An appeal fund is being set up by the civic a uthorities of
       Liverpool, N o t t i n g h a m           ond Sheffield.        The Gov er n me nt will be
       c on tr i bu ti n g £500,000 immediately towards this fund.


       This was a d ev as t at in g tragedy.                   Our deep sympathy goes to
       the families of those who died, to those recovering, and to
       those still fighting for life                      and health.         We owe o duty to
      these p a s s i o n a t e supporters of football to exomine urgently
      and        thoroughly the couses and background,                       and to do all in
      our power^ to p re v e n t such a thing happening agoin.                                   We have
      to set our sights high ond find a b et te r way for British
      football.

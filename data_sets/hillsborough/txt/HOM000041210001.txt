   This was somewhat excessive from 10.30 am, the manpower could have been put to better use
  until, for instance 12.30 pm, monitoring public houses near to the football ground. To have 20

DELETED:-

  (1) Why, during the period 2.00 p.m to 2.45 pm when the Leppings Lane end and the West Stand
were not veiy full, except for the centre pen, was the kick offnot put back and the delay broadcast
to the supporters outside. You cannot pass 30-40 thousand through the turnstiles at the Leppings
Lane end in one hour. At 2 pm. I would estimate that only 12,000 were in the ground.

(2) Why was there ten percent reduction in manpower from the previous semi-final in 1988. 80 more
Police Officers at the Leppings Lane end could have made a difference, filtering fans at the Leppings
Lane end. Approximately 980 officers were used for the semi-final in 1988, 1 000 for the semi-final
in 1987 and 1,200 for the semi-final between Wolves and Spurs.

(3) The control room staff are not used to the pressure o f working in the control room. The staff for
control room duties should be from weekly leave staff or mornings, as they are used to making
decisions under pressure.
(5) The policing at Hillsborough has become complacent over the last 2-3 years, because there
hadn t been any significant or major outbreaks o f trouble, supervisory officers assumed that it
wouldn’t happen. Various officers working the track and in the ground, had warned that things were
starting to go wrong over this period, yet no notice was taken. Manpower levels had been steadily
cut over this season to the detriment o f policing the ground efficiently.

(6) ....... This did not happen this year. (Talking here about how in previous years Chief
Superintendent Mole would walk around the perimeter track asking officers how things were going
and obviously noting the ground capacity).

(7) The decision to replace Chief Superintendent Mole before the semi-final needs to come under
some scrutiny. This man had many years experience o f policing big matches at Hillsborough.

(8) Compared to other semi-finals held at Hillsborough, the organisation o f this event was poor, as
has been the case for most o f the season. Too little notice had been taken o f current trends and
football intelligence and too much reliance has been placed upon previous information held.

(9) Too many non-operational supervisoiy officers were in charge o f important and critical parts o f
the football ground.

(10) The deployment o f officers around the crucial time needs to come under scrutiny, too many
were sat around in the gymnasium whilst others were rushed off their feet.” (pp 149-151)

           up at a steady            rate.        The N o t t i n g h a m Forest   supporters were           coming

           into the ground            reasonably early and were                 for    the greater      part very

           well     behaves.        During        this     period we    received frequent visits                from

 position of the        crowd on the Hop and             the nearest         section of the South

 Stand.     Visits     from other supervisory officers                   i.e. Chief

 Su p erintendent      D u c k e n f i e l d and Inspector Darling were           somewhat      less

 frequent.

 Twenty officers,          mo s t l y Community C o n s t a b l e s   from    *F 1 " Sufa-Division,

 were    placed a r o u n d the      perimeter     track at     intervals.        This was

 somewhat     excessive       from     10.30 a.m.,      the manpower         could have    been put

 to better     use    until,     for    instance     12.30 p.m. monitoring           public houses

 near    to the    football     ground.       To have 20 Police Officers              stood around

 for two hours wit h hardly anyone                 in the ground was a bit of a waste.

By    12.30 p.m.      that    day the N o t t i n g h a m Forest      supporters started to

 come    into the     ground    in increasing numbers and by 2.30                  p.m.    the Spion

Kop was four fifths            full.      There was      room at the front         of the Kop but

not much.         I noticed that tne          corner     of the Lappings Lane         terracing

was     full and     plenty of       room was available         in the sides of the

t e rracing.

i/ur^i.-g bi~:S period between           lii.30 p.m.     and 2. 4L> p.m.      many Liverpool

supporters naa gone            onto the Spion fto p with tickets               purchased from

touts outside        the     ground,    or had gained entry with forged tickets.

■ne     raised area    of     i-he Kop,   near to "Che N o r t n Stand had been set

aside    for up to     "i,000 Liverpool          supporters      in the Kop.        Inspector

Calvert was        in charge     cf a serial         a i v i d i ng the Liverpool    and

N o ttingham supporters.             During    the    period   -i2.30 p.m.      to 2.30 p.m.

there were     no signs        of trouble      from this area.           An officer of

inspector C a l v e r t ’s experience          of Policing at H i l l s borough would have
                                                                                                       m

curing this       period myself and Police              Constable 2046 Holmes must have

directed as m a n y as        120 Liverpool          supporters       up to the   raised section.

About c..4.1 p.m.      tnau    aay about       eight Liverpool          supporters    came up to

gate 2 ar.d a s k e d me to escort            them up to the          raised section.       I

contacted       Inspector Darling,              who went       to seek advice as to what to do

wit h these       supporters.              The Liverpool       supporters       could not get up to

the    raised section due to N ot t i n g h a m Forest                  supporters        blocking their

way.

By 2.47 p.m.            Inspector Darling           returned and told me              to escort these

supporters across             the front        of the Kop       in front of the Nottingham

supporters        and      into the        raised section.           I pointed cut to              inspector

Darling      that       this wouI'd be dangerous              to myself and the Liverpool

supporters.             However,       Inspector Darling            insisted that         I escort      the

Liverpool       supporters         in front of the Forest               fans;    and not across           the

F ortun a t e l y Police        Constable Holmes             accomp a n i e d me with the Liverpool

supporters        as far as        the main e x i t /entrance           underneath the end of the

raised section.              I then accomp a n i e d the Liverpool               fans from the           rear

of the Kop         into     tne Kop and through a very densely                     populated Hop and

As    I returned across            the 0ack of tne Kop towards                  gate      ’O',      I saw. many

were    rushing         up to that               I returned to gate 2.                A few seconds

obviously making                  them more and more         upset.     We turned the Liverpool'

fans around and sent t/iem back towards the Leppings Lane                                        end.     Many

Liverpool          fans bega^f to break up advert i s i n g              hoardings and ferry the

Control RcTbm seemed to have been hit by some                            sort of paralysis.

Liverpool          supporters           began to    run down towards us and break up

  vertising             hoardings.         I began to assist          them in this.              I then

helped to           carry an advert i s i n g hoarding up to the Leppings Lane end

and was        helped by a Liverpool                supporter    to bring       it over towards                the

Control        Room.

Three or four Liverpool                    fans    loaded    up a body onto the hoarding

saying,        "TAKE rii'M OUT Of HERE,              HE*S    DEAD."     Myself and maybe 4 or 3

L iverpool         fans         ran with the hoarding         towards    the exit      Detween the

North Stand and the Kop.                     The    exit was    very    crowded with supporters

and hoardings and                  injured and dead         p&opie.     I lest my grip of the

noardmg          as     it disapp e a r e d towards         tne gymnasium.       I was           knocked to

one    side- and e v e n t u a l l y       returned to       gate 2 and tne Boutn Stana.

Chief        Inspector Beal             instructed me tc assist Police Constable

Helliwell          at    the South Stand with spontaneous                 fights    breakinng             out in

the South Stand.                  Many Nott i n g h a m Forest    supporters were                still

abusing        Liverpool          supporters and fights were             breaking      out        in the

S outh Stand.             M a n y Liverpool        fans were    still    swarming      down towards

the Forest            end of      the   ground,     obviously upset and trying                   to pick

      ht <        1any of        these Liverpool       fans were       drunk.    I could smell

intoxicants and they were                    unsteady       on their    feet,   some    could hardly

It was noticeable             that the only s upervisory officers above                       the   rank

of Inspector          on the      pitch were Chief               Inspectors Beal and Sumner and

Superintendent Greenwood.

C ert a i n supervisory officers were                      conspicuous by their absence.              It

was utter       chaos.

Eventually,          about 4.05        p.m.    things       seemed to be       running more       smoothly

and things were becoming                  organised.            The ground started        to empty and

half    of rny serial         and half of serial                2 were     placed near to the

players       entrance      on standby.            Many Liverpool           fans were    still

w andering around the               pitch,     intoxicated.

At 6.00       p.m.    1 a t t ended the        'so-called'         de-brief     in the North Stand

and then helped             colleagues        from       *F1* area with their        emotional

problems.        I went       off duty at          1.00 a.m.       on 16th April,        1989.

As    regards    the    policing at the event and my                       prevoius experience       of

t o o t c a l 1 matches     at H i l l s b o r o u g h    I would add the following           points.

(1)    why,    during       the   period 2.00            p.m.    to 2.45    p.m. when the Leppings

       i_ane end and the west S tand were                        not very full,      except      for the

        centre       pen,   was    tha    kick     off not       put back and the delay broadcas

       to the supporters              outside.            You   cannot     pass 30-4-0 thousand

       through        the   turnstiles at            the Leppings        i.ane end   in one hour.

       At 2 p.m.        1 w ould estimate                that only   12,000 were        in the ground.

(2)    Why was there a ten percent                       reduction    in manpower       from the

       previous semi-final                in 1988.         80 more Police Officers at the

       ueppings Lane end              could have made a difference,                  filtering      fans

       at the Leppings Lane                end.      A p p r o x i m a t e l y 980 officers were used
                                                                                                           m
       for the       semi-final          in 1988,        1,000 for the semi-final           in 1987

       and    1,200 for the          semi-final           between Wolves and Spurs.

()     The    control       room staff are           not used to the          pressure    of working

       in a control          room.       The    staff      for    control    room duties should be

       decisions        under       pressure.

(4)    In previous matches which have                     involved Liverpool         at Hillsboroug

       there have         been m a n y drunk supporters            getting    into the ground,

       fighting        broke    out     in the      league match at the end of the               1984/85

       season,       and at last year's              semi-final    there was a pitch invasion

       at tne end of the              game,       Liverpool    fans swarmed onto the            pitch,

       attempting         to goad and fight with Notti n g h a m supporters.                         The

       N o t t i n g h a m supporters wrec k e d the exit gates and some fencing at

       the Kop end,           while fencing was           torn down at the Leppings Lane er,

       No b o d y   learned from this,              last year's    semi-final       was    seen as a

       success.

f      Tne    policing at H i l l s b o r o u g h has         become    complacent    over the         last

       E~3 years,         because      there hadn't been any significant                   or major

       outbreaks        of trouble,          s u p e r visory officers assu m e d that          it

       wouldn't        happen.        Various       officers working the track and in the

       ground,       had wa r n e d that things were starting                to go wrong over

       this     period,       yet    no notice was       taken.        Manpower    levels had been

       s teadily       cut over       this season to the detriment                of policing         the

       ground efficiently.

i£j/   In previous years Chief Superin t e n d e n t Mole would walk around

       the    per ime ter track asking               office rs how th i ng s were         going and

       o b viously      noting       the    ground    capacity.        This did not happen this

       year.

<7)    The d e c ision to           replace Chief       Superintendent Mole          before the

       semi-final         needs     to come under        some scrutiny.           This man had

       many years         experience         of   policing big matches at Hillsborough.

(8)    C o m p a r e d to other      semi-finals        held at Hillsborough,             the

       orga n i s a t i o n   of this event was          poor,    as has been the          case for

       most    of this        season.       Toe    little     notice   had been taken of curren

       trends and football                 intelligence       and too much reliance has been
4                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                   R289

              placed upon   previous   information held.

        (9)   Too m any n o n -operational   supervisory officers were     in charge of

              important and   critical   parts   of the football     ground.

        (10) The deployment    of officers around the      crucial    time needs   to come

              under some scrutiny,     too many were   sat around     in the gymnasium

              whilst   others were   rushed off their feet.

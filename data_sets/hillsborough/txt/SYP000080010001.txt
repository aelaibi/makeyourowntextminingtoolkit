 is    aged       about             40    years.

 At    '10 a m     (1000)                on       match        day                          picked          me        up    at       my    house          in    his

 car       and    we       drove          to                            house          where          we" p i c k e d        him          up    at    about

 10.45       am    (1045).                    We    stopped                 at                        house           for    a       coffee.              We    all

 set       off    about             11    am       (1100)           for          Sheffield.                 We        went       on       the       M62    to

 Salford          and          on    to       Sheffield                 via       C^mntry             and       on     the       motorway.                 The

 motorway          was          subject             to     de                    at    the       Sheffield                 end       due       to    heavy

 traffic.              We       did       not       stop           en-route.

 I    have       been          to    Hillsborough                       before          and        I was         at        the       19               u-final          at

 Hillsborough                   when          I    had     a       seat          for     the       North         Stand.

             parked             at       2.25       pin    ( 1 4-%lr)            in    S h e f f i e 1d         in     a    side          street          in

 Hillsborough,                      only          about        a    ten          minute          walk       from           the       ground.

 We    all       walked             towards           Leppings                   Ln    where          we    all        had       tickets             for       this

 part       of    the          ground.

 It    was       busy          with       people           in       the          area.           It     was       a    warm          dry       day.        I    saw

 people          drinking                from       cans           of       alcohol           in      the       street           but       everyone             was

 well       behaved.

 We    got       outside             the          turnstile                 entrance             atyu'epplngs                Ln       at       2.35       pm

 ( 1 4 3 5 )„      I       saw       a    c ou p 1e        of       p o 1 ice          off/cers             on        horseback                at    the

 entrance.                 1    think             they     were             L.i v e r/tfao 1 F o 1 i c e              Officers             but       they       were

 away       from       the          turnstile              entrance.                     It      was       very        busy          with       lots       of    fans

 in    the       area.              There          was     no       recognisable                      queues.               We       approached                the

 turnstiles                and       behind           u s y e re             a    set       of     blue         doors        or       gates.              These

 gates       were          closed             a fter/we             passed             through             them        but       I    believe             they       were

 then       burst          open          and       never           cdrosed            again        afterwards.                       Above          the

/turnstile             I       saw       fans       ts t a d d i n g         on       top     of      the       w a l l,     these             fans       were

 throwing          tickets                into        the          crowd          outside             and       these        were          people          waiting

 o u t s i de     who          did       not       have        tickets.

The     crush         was       very       intense,                 the       worst           that          I    have          ever       experienced                 and

it    seemed          that       there          were        far          too        few       turnstiles                      for       the    amount           of

people          trying          to    use       them.               I    got        sypara/ed                   from          my    two       f r i e n ds      in

this       crush.

There       was       a    lot       of    screaming                    going        on.              There          was       pain       in     these

screams          and       people          were        shouting                 for       others                to       push       back.           People           were

shouting,             " W e ' re      getting           crushed."                     I       began             to       get       frightened              as       well.

There       were          so    many       heads        so          close           together                that          the       air       was     becoming

warmer          and       warmer.

the     gates         at       the    outside.                  This          would           be       betw^en %                   pm    (1500?        and          3.03

pm    (1303).              I    knew       the     game             had       kicked              off       as       I    had       heard        the       cheer          go

up    while       I was          still          waiting                 outside.

I walked          through             a    hole        in       the       wall        towards                   the       direction              of    the          South

At    a bout      3,.07         pm    (1507),                             and        I went                onto          the       t e r r a c i ng    into          the

back       of    the       terrace          leading                 into        pen       1.           We       were          still       at     the       steps

leading          to       the    terrace           when             we    came        upon             a    girl          who       was       coughing              and

in    d i s t r e s s ■■        She       was     with          a       young        lad.              I would                describe           this        girl         as

yhite,          aged       about          20s,     plump,                wearing              a       black          coat.              She    was     a     bit

blue       around          the       face.         I    thought                 she       was          having            an        asthma        attack             and

I    sat    her       down       and       calmed           her          down.            A       Police             Officer             carne      along           and

I asked             him       to       call       for       an       ambulance                 for     the       girl,        which          he    did.                 We

left          the       girl       with       the       young             lad        and       the     Policeman.                  By       this       time             she

appeared                to    be       recovering.

               and       I    then       moved          towards                the        terracing.                  The     crowd          were          saying

the       game          had       been       stopped.                 I       climbed           onto        a    railing           to       try    to          see

what          was       going          on.        The       game          had        stopped.               The       players           were       walking

off.           I    saw       a    body       being          given             cardiac              massage           at     the       Leppings                Ln       end

of    the          pitch.           jK^aw          people,                a    lot        of     people,           at       the    front          of       the

perimeter                fa*fce,         many          trying             to       climb         over       t he      fence        onto       the          playing

area      ,




I    re&f'lsed               that       I may          be    able             to     help       and        I approached                 some       Police

Officers,                identified                myself             as       a     nurse          and     offered           my       services.                    A

Policema n               escortsd                            and          I    onto          the      field.            I    had       refused             to       leave

               on       his       own    and,          in    fact,             he      ended          up    acting           as    a    stretcher-

bearer             for       the       afternoon.

At    3„09          pm       ( i5 0 9 ? ,     I made             my       way        to      the      Liverpool              goal       area.              There

was       a    lot       of       people          in    shock,                wandering               around          and     in       the    goal             area,

people             were       lying          on    the       grass.                  Many        of    the       people           lying       down             in       the

goal          area       were          blue       coloured                and        had       no     pulse.            At    first          I was

surprised                that          these       young             fit       men        failed           to    respond           to       treatment.

People             would          approach             you       and          ask     you        to    work        on       the    particular                   person

they          had       found          and    if       you       could             not       because            you     were       busy       on       someone

        The Appointment of a Chief Executive to Act as
          Administrative Head of Both Organisations




       With two organisations sharing a building and sharing
the    services        of    a   number       of           departments      within       that
building, it is quite evident that unless one individual
is identified as having absolute authority in all matters
related     to     the       building,                such    as    its     maintenance,
security,     cleaning,          opening              and     closing      hours,      etc.,
there is going to be friction.


       No   matter          whether    it             is     decided    that       a   Chief
Executive with authority over both administrations should
be    appointed or whether the traditional                                system of two
Secretaries       is    retained,        only one              individual      can have
the last word on all matters relating to the building.
In the latter event the Secretary of the S.F.A.                                        would
clearly have that authority.


       It is not unusual around the world for the Chief
Executive     of      the     National        Football             Association         to   be
at least the titular administrative head of the National
League.      In practice, such individuals tend to be known
as the      Secretary of the West German,                              French or Dutch
F.A.s, for example.              They are never referred to as League
Secretaries although they also fill that role, in theory.
In each case the National                     League's affairs are                     looked
after by a Secretary who works under the general loose
authority        of     the      Chief        Executive.                   These       League
Secretaries        frequently have                    quite    a    high    profile         and
in some cases would appear to be as well known nationally
and    internationally            as   are             the     National      Association
Secretaries.




                                          -   8   -
      No matter what the set-up might be it is probably
inevitable      in    Scotland,        as           elsewhere,     that     a    Chief
Executive    controlling         both        bodies       would    be     identified
as the S.F.A. boss and whoever handled the daily affairs
of the League would become known as the League Secretary.
That in itself is not particularly important.


      If the current Secretary elect of the S.F.A. were
to    be    appointed       as    a         Chief        Executive      over      both
organisations it would still be imperative that the League
should appoint        a capable         individual to look after                   its
daily affairs.          It will not be                   sufficient to      look to
a clerk to perform this function.                         The person concerned
will have to have the ability, authority and personality
to    administer      the    functions              of    the    League    and     its
Management Committee, deal with the member clubs, handle
the staff and be capable of representing the League 'up
front' before the public and the media, notwithstanding
that all of these activities will be carried out under
the   general    umbrella        of     the          authority     of     the    Chief
Executive.


      More often than not, in the frantic bustle of modern
day   football       legislation,       such a Chief Executive will
not be available to attend to the League's daily round
of problems, meetings,           and sundry chores.                     For matters
of major policy and significance of course his services
would require to be forthcoming, but it would be naive
and a serious miscalculation to imagine that any one person
could give close detailed attention to all of the affairs
of the League,         or indeed of the S.F.A.,                    if he is the
principal officer of both bodies.


      The    concept        of   one         Chief        Executive       could    be
unworkable      in    practice     if       both         organisations      were   to



                                        -   9   -
seek to exercise          an employer's rightful          authority over
him.     He has to be answerable to someone.                     There has
to be one ultimate authority to whom he must                       account.
There cannot be two.               Obviously,    that    authority would
be the Council of the S.F.A.               represented in the person
of its President.         That being the case, what is to happen
when the President of the S.F.A. requires that the Chief
Executive should accompany him to, let us say, a meeting
abroad, when at the same time the President of the S.F.L.
wants    his     services    for   some    inportant     League purpose?
The answer as to what would happen is that he would travel
abroad and the League's top administrator would attend
to whatever League business was on hand.                 It is difficult
to imagine that these circumstances or something similar
would not arise        repeatedly,        and very quickly,        as soon
as the concept of a Chief Executive were adopted.


        In all probability the Chief Executive would soon
become identified as the S.F.A.'s man and the other person
as the League's man.              There would be a danger too that
before     long the       Chief    Executive     might   feel    resentful
that    he was being         'excluded'     from League     affairs     and
that    League     officials were turning to his                subordinate
rather than to him in matters where he would prefer to
be involved.


        The other side of the coin might be that the S.F.A.
people could feel that the Chief Executive was spending
too much time on League matters at the expense of S.F.A.
affairs.


        People    being     people,   it    is   improbable      that   both
sides would feel satisfied to be sharing the top man.
Even given the unlikely situation that the top officials
of both organisations were completely selfless individuals
whose        only       motivation           was       the           general       fostering          and
improvement             of     Scottish          football,             it     is     difficult         to
imagine that they would not harbour resentment over the
Chief Executive's leanings towards one side or another,
real or imaginary.


        If one considers the position in which such a Chief
Executive          would          find      himself            whenever        the       clashes       of
interest          which       have       already              been     mentioned          arise,       it
does seem that,                   quite frequently, he will be perplexed
to     put     it       no        stronger.                   When     either        of    the        two
organisations                is    pursuing           a        course        of    action           whose
successful          conclusion will not necessarily work to the
benefit of the other, or on some occasions might actually
work     to        the        disadvantage                of     the        other,        and        such
circumstances do arise from time to time, it is essential,
if the desired objective                             is to be           achieved,          that       its
administrative                leader         should             apply        himself           to     his
organisation's cause with enthusiasm,                                        determination and
vigour.           No other attitude will do.                                 Lofty notions of
seeking only those                     conclusions which are acceptable to
all    sections of the game would appear to be                                             in grave
danger of being found to be no more than mere notions
and    quite        unworkable              in       the       real     world        of    football
administration and politics.


       It would be wrong to paint too negative a picture
of     the        problems             which         would            confront           one        joint
administrative                boss       even        although          it     would       certainly
not be        difficult            to     list many particular                       areas where
difficulties would surely lie.                                  It is possible that the
theory       could           work       given         that       the         subject       had       the
sensitivity             and       deftness       of           touch     to     avoid      the       main
pitfalls          and    to       at     least       convince           enough people               that
he was        a     defender           of    all      interests.                  What    would       be
achieved by embarking on a course which is fraught with
such uncertainties is difficult to imagine.

                                Recomnendations




        To sum up the results of this examination into the
basic    proposal        that    the    S.F.A.       and    the       S.F.L.       should
be brought more closely together and perhaps be served
jointly by one           Chief Executive,             and to translate that
summary into recommendations would give the following:-


(1) The         idea     that     there           could     be        a    complete
        integration        of     the       two     bodies,       politically,
        administratively          and       financially          is       unworkable
        and is not worthy of pursuit.


(2) The two            bodies    should           retain    their          separate
        identities, with the S.F.L. continuing to function
        under    the     general       umbrella       of    the       S.F.A.,        in
        the privileged          situation afforded to it by the
        S.F.A.'s Articles of Association.


(3) It would be advantageous to both bodies and to
        their various           members      if they were to                 operate
        side by        side under one roof,                at Park Gardens,
        at least for the immediate future.                       For the longer
        term,    a more         suitable      location would be                   joint
        headquarters on the site of the national stadium,
        wherever that may turn out to be.                                 That    is a
        problem for another day, perhaps not so far away,
        and does not detract from the advantages to be
        won     immediately       by    a    coming        together         at    Park
        Gardens,        notwithstanding             the     chronic          parking
        difficulties        there       which        confront             staff     and
        visitors.
(4) Scotball        Travel and Leisure                    Limited should move
      from    Park    Gardens        to the              League H.Q.         at West
      Regent       Street.         Other              S.F.A.    departments         may
      have    to do    likewise,             but all of the                logistics
      of     the    transfer       of        personnel          and    departments
      would have to be worked out by the Secretaries
      of the S.F.A. and the S.F.L.


(5) Complete authority              for          all      matters         related    to
      the    building     at       Park          Gardens       would      rest     with
      the Secretary of the S.F.A.


(6)   The    League    should not                dispose       of     its building
      at West       Regent        Street but             should retain it as
      a valuable and tangible asset.


(7) Complete authority              for          all      matters         related    to
      the building        at West            Regent           Street would         rest
      with the Secretary of the S.F.L.,                               but on-site,
      secondary       authority              and        responsibility            would
      have to be        conferred on one person,                          presumably
      the Manager of Scotball.


(8) Financial         arrangements                covering          the     use     of
      accommodation          at    Park          Gardens       and West       Regent
      Street will        require to be worked out by joint
      consent.


(9) The      proposition          that       a        Chief    Executive      should
      be     appointed       to    act        as        administrative        leader
      of both organisations should not be adopted.


(10) The S.F.L. should take immediate steps to appoint
      a suitable person to replace its Secretary who
      will    assume the position of Secretary elect of

                         the    S.F.A.    on 8th   January,           1990.     As   soon as
                         an appointment is made, the party concerned would
                         have the advantage of being able to work with
                         the    present    Secretary      until        his    departure    on
                         the date mentioned.


                  (11)   Work    should    begin   immediately           to   organise    the
                         League's move to Park Gardens and the transfer
                         of    Scotball    to West       Regent       Street.        Ideally,
                         the new League Secretary                  should be on hand to
                         participate in the setting-up of his new domain.

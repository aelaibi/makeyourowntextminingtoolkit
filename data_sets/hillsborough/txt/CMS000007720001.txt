HILLSBOROUGH

Following the Home Secretary's statement to the House on 17 April
about the Hillsborough   disaster, Mr Gerald Birmingham asked if
the Home Secretary would ensure that film coverage of the events
of the day was retained and made available to the inquiry, the
Home Secretary undertook to pursue the matter.

A copy of the relevant   section of Hansard is attached as is a
draft self explanatory letter to the Member.

Following my statement to the House on 17 April about the
Hillsborough Stadium disaster you asked whether, because of
its great value, I would seek to ensure that film coverage
of the events at Hillsborough was not destroyed.   You also
asked if I would arrange -for the footage involved to be
made available to the inquiry.   I undertook to pursue the
matter.


My officials have now been in touch with the television
companies who have agreed to retain the footage available.
Lord Justice Taylor has been advised of this and will, I
expect, wish to consider requesting that a copy of relevant
footage be made available to him.


As I said in the House, your suggestion was a valuable one
and I am grateful for it.

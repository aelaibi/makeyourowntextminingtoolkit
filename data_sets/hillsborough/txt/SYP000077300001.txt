             with     regard             to     the    time     I spent        on     the   p i t c h all    I can      do     is tell          you

             what     I did,             but     I would        not     be a b l e     to   identify any          of    the       casualties

              I dealt          with.At           first       I was      going       round     looking       at   fans       l a yi n g    on    the

              pit c h ,    and        if      they     displayed         any     signs      of    life,     I would         put    them        onto

              their       side,          so    that        in the      event     of    them      being    sick    they would              not

              cho k e .        There          were     only     a     couple     of    fans      I dealt     with      in t h a t        way.     A*

                  They    were        carrying             them      the    length         of    the    pitch          to a    corner        of     the

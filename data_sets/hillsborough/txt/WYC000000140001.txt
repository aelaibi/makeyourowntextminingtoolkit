                         PRESENT:        Mr. Taylor, Counsel; representing the Airedale

H.M. CORONER

Good morning, Mr. Blackwell, I understand you are representing Mr. Bland’s family?

I do, sir, yes.

I am sorry to hear that you have had an accident this morning, are you..

No I didn’t have an accident this morning, sir, it happened a few weeks ago but I am still
suffering from it.

Oh, I see. Good morning, Mr. Taylor. You are representing the hospital trust?

I am, sir. Good morning.

And you are instructed by Mrs. Heley?

Sir. Good morning.

Mr. and Mrs. Bland, good morning.

Good morning.

                touching the death of ANTHONY DAVID BLAND




I believe that Father Morrow is present. Good morning, Father Morrow.

Good morning, sir.

I think you wish to make an application?

Yes. I would like to make an application for Your Honour to exercise the discretion I believe
you have under Rule 20 to permit a person with a genuine interest in the case to participate
by questioning witnesses. My interest in the case, legally, would be that I have a case pending
before the Queen’s Bench Divisional Court against Bingley Magistrates for failure to take
action in this case and my appeal to the Queen’s Bench is expected now some time in
February. A date was arranged earlier but only twenty minutes was allocated and we had to
postpone for more time for representations to be made in that court. I believe that the
outcome of today’s proceedings could have important repercussions for the case currently in
hand before the Queen’s Bench and so my interest would be that I am concerned about the
outcome of these proceedings. My second reason is much more informal but really perhaps
more important that there is no one formally appointed to represent the interests of the
general public and in particular of any hospital patients who may in the future find themselves
in an identical condition to Tony. That it would be desirable, I submit, for someone to
represent that side of the public and put questions with a view to their interests. Sir, those are
my two reasons for this application.

Well, Father Morrow, in a very real sense I represent the interests of the public. This is a
public enquiry for the public, for the Queen technically, but I am sure she would forgive me
if I substituted the public as a general term.

I see.

So in that respect I represent the public. Moreover the issues which I know concern you
greatly and one is bound to have sympathy with people who have strong views on a topic as
emotional as this and I express no personal view of my own but the issues that you are deeply
concerned with I know are issues which have been ventilated in the High Court and the Court
of Appeal and in the House of Lords, as you well know. The Court in those instances made
and confirmed a declaration for which the hospital trust applied, as I understand it, with the
acquiescence of Mr. and Mrs. Bland. Now, first of all, I believe, and I shall be confirming later,
that I am bound by that declaration in so far as it impinges upon the enquiry with which I am
engaged and so I think the second point that you make I could not agree with because if I did
it would mean, in general terms, that every member of the public who came to an inquest, and
of course it is a proceeding in court but in public, would have the right to ask questions and

Yorkshire        at        BRADFORD                                                      before me

                 for the           COUNTY               0f WEST YORKSHIRE          upon an inquest

                 touching the death of ANTHONY DAVID BLAND




that would not be helpful, I don’t think, for the administration of justice. On the first point I
would find it very hard to admit an argument suggesting that because you had an application
before the High Court affecting Bingley Magistrates that that would give you necessarily the
right of audience here. You have rightly quoted Rule 20 which deals with the question of
entitlement to examine witnesses; I am sure you know the Rule at least as well as I do and you
will be referring to sub-section 2 (h) I think, dealing with the lists of people who are entitled,
under the Rule and by law, to examine witnesses and the only category, I think you will agree,
into which you could possibly fall is under sub-section (h) ‘any other person who in the opinion
of the Coroner is a properly interested person’.

Yes.

I am afraid that I cannot agree to exercise my discretion in that respect. I say again that I have
sympathy with anyone who holds strong views and seeks all legal means to express them but
I do not believe that it would be right for me to admit you into the position of being entitled
to examine witnesses. I am sorry that this will be a grave disappoint to you. I believe that I am
right in law. I will ask Mr. Taylor and Mr. Blackwell if they wish to add anything but that is
my view.

Thank you for your consideration, sir.

Thank you, Father Morrow. Do you wish to add anything, Mr. Taylor?

Save to endorse the opinion you have given on this matter, sir.

Mr. Blackwell?

No, I am in agreement with you, sir.

Thank you. I opened an inquest into the death of Anthony David Bland on the 4th March of
this year, Tony, if I may refer to him as Tony, having died on the 3rd March 1993. That is the
date upon which his death was certified by a doctor, as will be confirmed shortly.

Now everyone knows that Tony Bland was a spectator at a football match at Hillsborough in
Sheffield on the 15th April 1989 and there has been a good deal of publicity, not only about
the inquest, but about the medical condition over the years which Tony has suffered.

It is right that I should explain first of all why I am seized of this case. I think evidence will
certainly satisfy the court that the injuries which Tony suffered could be directly associated with

Yorkshire       at        BRADFORD                                                      before me

                for the           COUNTY              0f WEST YORKSHIRE           upon an inquest

                touching the death of ANTHONY DAVID BLAND




the events which took place at Hillsborough on the 15th April 1989 and in ordinary course,
upon his death, although that occurred within my jurisdiction, I would have suggested to the
Coroner for that particular jurisdiction, that is South Yorkshire, that he take the case instead
of myself. As I made plain at the opening of the inquest, Mr. Dorries, the present holder of
the post of Coroner in that part of South Yorkshire, was not the Coroner at the time of the
Hillsborough disaster. The inquest into the deaths of those who died at Hillsborough, or soon
afterwards, was held under the direction of Dr. Popper who has since retired. Mr. Dorries had
a peripheral interest as a practising solicitor in Sheffield in the Hillsborough inquest and he
thought it right, and I agree with him, that in all those circumstances the inquest into the death
of Tony should be retained within my own jurisdiction. I having accepted jurisdiction it was
then open to me to try to decide when Tony died. What was proper in relation to the conduct
of any resumed proceedings, which are starting today. I said at the opening of the inquest that
there were two possibilities in general terms. It is of course possible to argue that this inquest
should take the form of a complete rehash of the Hillsborough proceedings. I am of the
opinion that that would serve no useful purpose, either from the point of view of Tony’s
parents and family or from the point of view of the strict law which is set up under the
Coroners’ Acts and the Coroners’ Rules and which specifically states the purpose of an inquest,
which I will relate in a moment. I have read the whole of the transcript of the evidence of the
inquest, which runs to eighty volumes, and in that respect I have been assisted greatly, and my
thanks are due to him, by Police Constable Greenway of the South Yorkshire Police and to
many of his colleagues in South Yorkshire and indeed the West Midlands Police. I have also
read the interim and the final report of Lord Justice Taylor who undertook, at the instance of
the Home Secretary, a judicial enquiry into the circumstances surrounding the Hillsborough
disaster. Lord Justice Taylor made certain recommendations and it would be invidious for me
at this time to seek to so widen the inquest proceedings as to open it for my purposes to make
additional recommendations. First of all I have read the recommendations and I would entirely
agree with them and, secondly, after this passage of time it would be totally inappropriate for
me to do so. I mention that as another reason for not pursuing the path of a lengthy inquest
such as took place over many months in Sheffield.

Of course, as everyone knows, other issues have arisen out of the medical treatment and
subsequent death of Tony Bland and in that respect there might have been an argument that
those issues should be ventilated here. Well again they have been ventilated, discussed in great
depth, both in the High Court in London, in the Court of Appeal and in the House of Lords
and I may find it necessary and apposite to refer to the judgements of their lordships from time
to time but I don’t believe that it would be helpful to open up those issues here. I believe that
I am bound by the declaration which was then made and I don’t think that it would be useful,
either for the purposes of the inquest or indeed for the sake of Mr. and Mrs. Bland, for those
issues to be reviewed at length again. As I understand it the declaration made by the High

               Depositions of Witnesses                             taken on oath or affirmation

Yorkshire      at        BRADFORD                                                      before me
 to wit
               JAMES AWTY           TURNBULL,   one of the Coroners of our Lady the Queen

               for the           COUNTY               0f WEST YORKSHIRE          upon an inquest

               touching the death of ANTHONY DAVID BLAND




Court arose out of an application by the hospital trust, now represented by Mr .Taylor, with the
acquiescence and full agreement of Mr. and Mrs. Bland, which I will be asking Mr. Bland to
confirm and the declaration is binding. It ought to be mentioned of course that it is a
declaration which is binding in respect of Tony Bland only and not in respect of any other
patients, either receiving treatment now or in the future and I will mention that again in due
course.

Therefore for those reasons which I have briefly stated it seemed to me that I should properly
concentrate at this resumption on the death, specifically, of Tony Bland and the specific Rule
which directs me as to the purposes of an inquest and I read out for the sake of the court the
Rule concerned. It is Rule 36 and it says ’the proceedings and evidence at an inquest shall be
directed solely to ascertaining the following matters, namely, who the deceased was; how when
and where the deceased came by his death; and the particulars for the time being required to
be registered under the appropriate Acts. It might of course be necessary to refer to various
judgements from time to time and I think that it would be right in my summing up to refer to
them when I have heard the evidence directly concerned with Tony’s death.

I underline what I have said by relating what has happened in a legal sense and a procedural
sense since the fateful day on the 15th April 1989, which was the day of the football match at
Hillsborough. Two days later Lord Justice Taylor was appointed to conduct an enquiry by the
Home Secretary. On the 19th April, four days later, the West Midlands Police were instructed
to undertake an investigation, both on behalf of the police but more particularly on behalf of
the Coroner for South Yorkshire and again in that respect I have had the benefit of reading
the West Midlands report and am grateful to the Coroner for South Yorkshire for making that
available to me. The Taylor hearing started on the 15th May and was concluded on the 29th
June. Lord Justice Taylor issued an interim report on the 4th August of that year and the final
report on the 18th January the following year, that is 1990. In addition to all this there was at
the same time being conducted a disciplinary investigation in relation to the acts and
procedures of South Yorkshire Police, which doesn’t concern me. Dr. Popper, the South
Yorkshire Coroner, resumed the inquest, first of all on the 18th April 1990, in order to receive
medical evidence and resumed the inquest in greater detail on the 19th November 1990. It was
concluded, with certain adjournments over the Christmas period, on the 28th March 1991. I
should state that the findings of that inquest are not binding upon me.

Recently there has been an application for a judicial review of the findings of the jury at
Sheffield. That application for judicial review was made on the 5th May 1992 and the
judgement was given on the 5th November 1993. The application for review was dismissed and
I may add at this juncture that with the acquiescence of Mr. and Mrs. Bland, through their
solicitor, Mr. Blackwell, I have postponed the resumption of this inquest until that judgement

was delivered. I am glad, however, that it was delivered in time for me to resume this inquest
before the end of the year because I would very much like Mr. and Mrs. Bland, Tony’s sister
and the whole family, to be able to start a new year with a new leaf and with all this behind
them in so far as it is possible to put it behind them.

As everyone knows Dr. Howe was the consultant physician in charge of Tony’s case and
became concerned about certain aspects of his condition and the impossibility of that condition
improving. He took advice and the Airedale General Hospital Trust made an application to
the High Court, by originating summons, on the 25th September 1992, for a declaration, the
details of which I will relate in due course. The judgement on that summons was given on the
19th November and the judge in that case suggested, I think, left the way open certainly, for
his judgement to be reviewed by the Court of Appeal. His judgement was upheld on 9th
December 1992 and leave was given for further appeal to the House of Lords; again I shall be
referring, as appropriate in due course, to the judgements. On the 4th February of this year
the House of Lords delivered its judgement and the five Law Lords agreed again that the Court
of Appeal finding should be upheld.

I have related the history of the various applications and the various hearings in order to
explain why I can see no purpose at the present time of reviewing all that again, either from
the point of view of the events at Hillsborough on the 15th April 1989 or from the point of
view of the medical arguments, or the legal arguments on medical matters, which were put
before the High Court. As I say I believe that I am bound by the declaration which the High
Court made upon the application of the hospital trust. I am concerned with receiving evidence
specifically in relation to the death of Tony.

I think it might be helpful if I explain to the court how I propose the evidence should be called
and the order of the calling of witnesses. I shall ask my officer, Police Constable Meredith, first
of all to give evidence again about the identification procedures, merely as a matter of formality
and as to the fact of Tony’s death when it was confirmed. I then, with some regret, will ask Mr.
Bland to give evidence. I know that he has been informed that that unfortunately I think is
necessary, mainly to confirm two aspects which are not included, for reasons that they were not
being ventilated at the time, in his original statement. I hope you will forgive me for adding to
his distress by asking him to do that but ringing in my ears are the words of the judge at first
instance and the application of the hospital trust who described him in a way which would
make proud if it was ever accorded to me and that is ‘a splendid Yorkshireman’. I am very
proud myself to be a Yorkshireman, if ever anybody thought it fit to call me a splendid
Yorkshireman I shall be absolutely delighted and I believe Mr. Bland is indeed a splendid
Yorkshireman. I will then ask Mr. Ian Grew and Mr. Alan Gill, who went to the match with
Tony, to give evidence about that day and then Police Constable Jenkinson of the South

Yorkshire Police, who was the first police officer who was able to identify Tony as one of the
injured at the Hillsborough football disaster. Then Dr. Naidoo, who attended Tony when he
was taken to the hospital in Sheffield; that is the first doctor who has been identified as giving
him treatment. Then I shall ask Dr. Howe, the Consultant Physician at Airedale Hospital, to
give evidence about the treatment over many months, indeed years, which he and his staff, both
medical and nursing, administered to Tony with such great care and indeed consideration and
love. Then Dr. Lowe, my own pathologist, a Consultant Pathologist at Bradford Royal
Infirmary, who kindly undertook at my request a post mortem examination following Tony’s
death. I will, of course, hear any application for any other evidence to be heard if that is made
but I cannot envisage myself the necessity for that to take place.

Mr. Taylor, Mr. Blackwell, there is nothing you wish to say before I call the evidence is there?

No, sir.

PC. Meredith, being the Coroner’s Officer for the area of Keighley I think you had been
concerned with matters relating to the treatment of Anthony David Bland who was treated at
Airedale Hospital and you know the various applications which were made?

Yes sir.

And the fact that medical treatment, following the High Court declaration, was in fact
withdrawn?

Yes sir.

Is it correct that on the 3rd March of this year you were notified by Dr. Richardson of that
hospital that he had certified the death of Tony at 9.15 p.m. at the hospital on that day?

Yes sir.

Were you concerned a short time later in making arrangements for a formal identification of
Tony’s body to be made by his father, Mr. Bland?

Yes sir, that occurred at 10.30 p.m. that evening.

Were you also present when Dr. Lowe, a Consultant Pathologist, undertook a post mortem
examination at which Dr. Howe was present and I myself?

Yes sir. That occurred on Thursday, 4th March of this year.

Thank you. I doubt very much whether it will be necessary for photographs taken at the post
mortem examination to be considered or produced but I ought to tell the court that they are
available. Thank you, PC. Meredith. There are no questions, gentlemen?

No sir.

You were aware that on Saturday, 15th April 1989, Tony planned and indeed set off to
Hillsborough to a football match?

I was, yes.

Were you also aware that he was going to travel with two friends of his who had accompanied
him to matches on previous occasions, Mr. Ian Grew and Mr. Alan Gill?

That’s right, yes.

Now I think you watched the match on television, Mr. Bland?

In bits, yes.

And were able to identify Tony on the television picture?

I thought I had, yes.

At any rate there was somebody that you thought might be Tony in a position in which you
expected him to be?

That’s right, yes.

Which was behind the goal mouth on the west side?

Yes.

I think sadly you became aware that a disaster, which we later know it was, was occurring and
you were later that unfortunately Tony had been severely injured and was being treated at the
Northern General Hospital in Sheffield?

That’s right.

And that he was transferred later to Airedale Hospital and continued treatment there until his
death?

That’s right, yes.

There is just one thing that I would like you to confirm for the record, Mr. Bland, and that is

that the application which was made by the hospital trust in respect of treatment to Tony was
made with your full knowledge and acquiescence?

Yes, it was.

I don’t think that there is anything else that I need ask you. Is there anything else you wish to
add?

No, no, thank you.

Thank you very much, Mr. Bland. There are no questions, gentlemen?

No questions, sir.

Thank you, Mr. Bland. Mr. Ian Grew, please.

On oath saith:

Please sit down, Mr. Grew. I am sorry that after this passage of time it is necessary to ask you
to recall the tragic events of that day in April of 1989 but I am sure that you understand the
reasons for it?

Yes.

Are you Ian Alan Grew?

Yes.

And you are a friend of Tony Bland’s?

Yes.

And have attended football matches with him as a supporter of Liverpool?

On the 15thApril 1989 did you plan and indeed did you go toHillsborough with Tony and
another friend of you both, Alan Gill?

Yes.

Did you go in your car?

Yes.

Can you recollect, roughly, the time you arrived in Sheffield?

About quarter-to twelve, twelve o’clock.

Did you have a ticket?

Yes.

Did Tony have a ticket?

Yes.

What about Mr. Gill?

He obtained one outside the ground.

I see. And I think it is right that when that ticket had been obtained, so you all three had
access to the ground, you then went and have some lunch and a drink?

Yes.

Was your ticket for the same area as the tickets for the other two?

No. It was for the stand behind Leppings Lane, to sit down.

And they only had tickets for the standing area?

Yes.

               touching the death of ANTHONY DAVID BLAND




So when you went into the match you would have to separate, I imagine?

Yes.

What time did you get into the ground?

About a quarter-to two.

Quarter-to two?

Yes.

So that was some time before the kick off?

Yes.

And you all went in together but separated at the Leppings Lane entrance?

Yes.

You to go into the stand and the two of them to go into the area.Did you understand that
they were going to be behind the goal posts at that end?

Yes, that’s why we went earlier.

The match, I think, was due to start at three o’clock?

Yes.

And it did in fact start on time?

Yes.

Had you a view of the area where Tony and Alan were?

I could see the front of the crowd but that was all. I was halfway back in the stand so I could
just see the front, the fencing and few people behind it.

When the ground filled up, say between half-past two and three o’clock, were you able to
identify either of your friends, where they were standing?

No.

Now the match started at three o’clock and as I understand it difficulties arose quite soon after
the kick off?

Yes.

Can you briefly describe what you saw, please?

Well I could tell people at the stand where I was sitting were pulling people up from down
below and other people were spilling over the fence onto the pitch.

Before that happened had you felt any concern yourself for the number of people who were
in that area?

No because I couldn’t really see, apart from the front people.

And soon after you noticed, I think, that the match was abandoned, or stopped at any rate?

Yes.

Now I think it would become apparent to you seeing what developed that this was a very
serious occurrence?

Yes.

Of course when the match was abandoned and you noted the severity of the events there was
nothing that you could do and I think that you then left the ground and waited for the other
two?

Yes.

And eventually Mr. Gill met you at a pre-arranged spot?

Yes.

                 touching the death of ANTHONY DAVID BLAND




But unfortunately Tony didn’t turn up and you had to return to Keighley without him
wondering whether in fact he was alright?

Yes.

And you didn’t know that he had been injured until later?

No.

There was given in evidence information about an attempt at the goal at that end which hit the
crossbar. Do you remember seeing that?

At the other end, it was at the other of the ground.

I see, so you didn’t get a very good view of that?

Well I could see it hit bar, yes.

I see. Did you notice anything particular about the crowd at that time?

Well there were people spilling on the field already then. There were some at side of goals.

I see. Even when that occurred?

Yes.

Thank you very much. Any questions, gentlemen?

No questions.

Thank you. Mr. Gill, please.

Yes.

And you are the Mr. Gill that Mr. Grew just referred to as one of the trio who went to the
match?

Yes.

Now Tony had a ticket but you got one from a tout outside?

That’s right, yes.

And got into the ground about a quarter-to two, I understand?

Quarter-to two, two o’clock, yes.

Now it was always the intention of course that you and Tony should stand in your favourite
place behind the goal?

Yes.

Were you together to begin with?

At the beginning, yes.

Was that directly behind the goal? Mr. Bland thought he saw Tony towards the right-hand side
as you look from the pitch, I think?

As we were looking from the terrace onto the pitch we were at the right-hand side of the goal
so if you’re looking into the crowd it would be the left-hand side.

Oh, the left-hand side, well I may be mistaken about that. I see. Would you look at the plan,
please, first of all of the ground. I think you were standing in front of the West Stand?

That’s correct.

And there are a number of sections to that standing area. Do you remember coming through
the tunnel underneath the West Stand to gain access to the standing area?

Yes.

                touching the death of ANTHONY DAVID BLAND




As I understand it you were then, as it were, to bear right into the area numbered 3?

Yes, that’s correct.

Would you look at the other plan, please? I am sure you will recognise it, this shows the
tunnel as it is divided so that some spectators can go into Gate 3 and some into Gate 4?

Yes.

And you were in Gate 3?

Yes.

And the goal, of course, is on the pitch round about here? (points on plan)

Yes.

I wonder if it would be possible, Mr. Gill, for you to mark on the plan that you have where you
both were standing when you were together? Could you do that for me, please?

Yes.

Thank you. PC. Meredith, would you show it to Mr. Blackwell and Mr. Taylor, please?

Sir.

You have marked an area which appears to be between two sections of the barrier?

Yes.

Now you must have been standing there, or thereabouts, for at least an hour before the match
started?

Yes.

And I imagine that there were not so many people to begin with?

No, not at first, no.

                 touching the death of ANTHONY DAVID BLAND




How would you describe the build-up, Mr. Gill, of the spectators in the vicinity?

Well it were a good atmosphere. I mean everybody were looking forward to the game
obviously. There was people throwing balls about, like they normally do, in the crowd. Singing,
chanting, just a normal football game, really.

But the build up of the crowd, was that a steady build up or was there a sudden increase?

At first it was steady and then all at once they just hit you, I mean everybody came in then.

Yes. Was that quite soon before the match was due to kick off?

Roughly just before three o’clock.

Had you, I mean I know you have been to many football matches before, you’ve been to
Hillsborough before?

Yes.

And into this particular part of the ground?

Well that end, I mean I’ve been in the stand since.

According to your experience were the conditions, as far as crowd mass was concerned, worse
than you had experienced before?

Terrible, yes.

Did you and Tony remain together until the match started?

Yes.

But at some stage you did become separated?

Yes.

Can you, again on the same plan, show where he was and where you were when you last saw
him?

Well roughly where we are now but when the crowd, when it filled up        Do you want to mark
where I ended up?

Yes. Where you ended up and where Tony was when you last saw him, please?

Well Tony were there, where I’ve marked before, when I last saw him.

He stayed there?

I mean I didn’t really see him when the crush started because he went to one side and then
that’s when I lost visibility of him and then I fell this way towards the perimeter fence.

You fell forward?

Yes, in the crush.

And at that time he wasn’t in sight?

No.

You say you fell forward, did you fall onto the ground?

Near the fence at the bottom yes. Luckily there was a gateway, a perimeter gate, which is
shown on the diagram.

Yes. This is Gate 3, is it?

Yes.

I see. And by this time you were down there?

That’s right.

So am I right in thinking you were pushed, as it were, with the crowd down to that area?

With the force of the crowd, yes.

Were you up against the fence?

No.

When you fell down were there a number of people who fell down as well in the vicinity?

Yes.

But you didn’t see Tony?

No.

I wonder if you could describe the conditions when you fell down? Were you able to regain
your feet by yourself?

Well luckily enough a policeman was on that gate and the gate was open. He was reaching in
and pulling spectators out, which he pulled me out.

Before you regained your feet?

Yes.

I see. And again you had no idea where Tony was?

No.

You never saw him again?

No.

It’s very difficult to imagine after this length of time but I think we can all remember seeing
the videos and the photographs. Were there a lot of people on the ground?

What, inside the fence?

Inside the fence, yes.

Not a lot at that time, no. I mean most of them were crushed up against the perimeter fence
itself and there was just like a little bottleneck where people were getting out of the gate.

You were fortunate enough to be near the gate and be pulled out but were you injured?

No.

But I think you experienced a feeling of being crushed?

Yes.

Rather frightening I would imagine?

And I think you looked around for Tony without any success and eventually when you realised
you weren’t going to find him you met up with Mr. Grew and you didn’t see Tony again?

                touching the death of ANTHONY DAVID BLAND




At the Leppings Lane end, yes.

Will you describe to the court in general terms what the conditions were there in the build up
to the kick off time?

It started off quite normally in that the people were just entering as such and then it became
more crowded but it was more just busy and then eventually it got so bad that people couldn’t
actually go back against the crowd of people pushing through to the turnstiles. As you looked
out from the turnstiles it was just a seething mass of people all with the object of coming into
the football ground. I was actually penned into a small corner and couldn’t move out of the
way or do anything to assist the crowd finally because the push was just too much.

Did that give you cause for concern as to what might be happening within the ground?

Not at that time, no, I was more concerned about what was happening outside and I didn’t
realise that anything was wrong inside the ground until a short time later.

You described the crush, did it ease off immediately before the kick off?

Yes. It suddenly seemed to vanish, the pressure just suddenly seemed to go and then there
were just a few people going in and it just vanished. It was amazing how suddenly there was
a mass of people then all of a sudden it seemed to disappear.

So I suppose at that time you thought that all was well and the problems were over?

Yes, that’s right.

Were you still outside when the kick off took place at three o’clock?

Yes, I was.

But I think you were called later to be inside the ground?

Yes.

Will you tell the court about that?

It was about five minutes I would say, I’m not sure of the exact time and the call we got was
that there were people on the pitch. At that stage we wondered whether there had been a

pitch invasion or whatever, we just didn’t know so my serial got together and we all went round
to the front of the West Stand.

How did you get there?

There’s a passageway as you go into the back of the ground. Imagine going into the ground
you can go down the right-hand side of the West Stand and then there’s a passageway that led
straight down onto the front of the pitch; it was kept clear.

And you were able to get past the area marked as the ‘police control’?

Yes, it’s just down the side of there actually, yes.

And you were able quite easily to get onto the pitch?

Yes it was straight down. As I say that area was kept clear.

Of course the people standing in front of the West Stand were in various sections which were
divided by high fences. What was the situation when you got round there, PC. Jenkinson?

Well it was quite obvious there was a tremendous push actually in the stand itself. I personally
saw quite a few people who were literally pushed up against the fencing to stop the spectators
going on to the pitch, the fencing actually pushing into people’s faces it was such a strong push
and obviously people were very seriously injured in that crush.

Yes. Do you know how the relatively small gates came to be opened onto the pitch?

The only thing is the assumption that the officers at the gates did actually open them. That’s
the only thing, it’s an assumption, sir.

Yes. Were you concerned with helping to get people out at that stage?

I certainly was, yes. I went to one of the open gates and started to help people out through
this.

Do you know which one that was?

It would be Gate 3 I would imagine, sir.

                  touching the death of ANTHONY DAVID BLAND




Yes. I don’t suppose you recognised Mr. Gill?

No, afraid not.

Now there came a time when you were aware that there was an ambulance nearby?

That’s correct, yes.

And that there were two casualties already in the ambulance on the trolleys or....

Yes, on the sides.

You were concerned with assisting another person into the ambulance?

That’s correct, yes. We actually laid him on the floor of the ambulance because there was
nowhere else to put him.

And started on the journey to hospital?

That’s correct.

You accompanying the ambulance at that time?

That’s right.

But then it was asked to stop and a fourth person was introduced?

Yes.

Now were you able, at a later time, to identify any of the people in that ambulance that you
accompanied to the Northern General Hospital?

Yes I identified Tony when we got there.

I see. Was he the first one to be laid on the floor of the ambulance?

No, he was the last person to be put into the ambulance.

The second one, I see. So he was the fourth into the ambulance?

               touching the death of ANTHONY DAVID BLAND




Yes, he was actually laid on top of the lad who was already on the floor of the ambulance
because it was the only place we could put him.

Did you help to lift him in?

Yes. I was actually at the door of the ambulance and another officer         passed him to me and I
took him and carried him into the ambulance.

I see. So there were four casualties in the ambulance and who else was in the back?

There was another police officer in the back of the ambulance. He was already there when
I got into the ambulance.

So there were six of you all together, two police officers and four casualties?

Yes, that would be right, yes.

Now were you able to form any opinion as to Tony’s condition and were you able to do
anything for him on the journey?

Well I checked that he’d got a pulse and he did have a pulse but he wasn’t breathing so I
commenced mouth to mouth resuscitation and carried that on all the way in the ambulance to
the Northern General Hospital, stopping occasionally to check that there was still a pulse but
yes I did mouth to mouth all the way.

Are you saying that that procedure restored respiration?

By the time we actually got to the Northern General Hospital, just as we were pulling into the
bay he was actually breathing at that point.

Spontaneously?

By himself, yes.

But it sounds as though that was as the result of your assistance?

I presume so, I did my best.

Yes. But showing no signs of consciousness?

                touching the death of ANTHONY DAVID BLAND




No, none at all.

While you were tending to Tony were you able to detect a pulse?

Yes.

And I think that when you got to hospital you continued to assist with him until he was taken
in charge of medical staff and taken to be x-rayed?

That’s correct, sir, yes.

How did you know who it was?

Once we’d got him into the hospital he was laid on a trolley just waiting to be seen to. I went
through his pockets and found a, I think it was a students union card although it could have
been a travel car, I can’t remember now, that had his photograph and name and address on.
Obviously I took note of that.

And you made a note that that was a reasonable supposition, that this was Tony Bland?

Yes sir.

Cam I ask you, PC. Jenkinson, to give your mind to a question of timing. We know that the
match kicked off at three o’clock and that trouble started very soon afterwards. Have you any
idea what time it was when put Tony into the ambulance?

I haven’t. If you’re asking me to guess I would say it would have been 15 to 20 minutes later
perhaps because I dealt with somebody else first, then tended to a lad who was just laid on the
ground who went in the ambulance on the bottom, if you like, so 15 to 20 minutes perhaps.

From the start of the difficulty?

Yes, I would say so, yes.

And so far as you know, and I think it is accepted, nobody has been identified as having seen
Tony so as to be able to speak of it from when he was lost sight of by Mr. Gill until you were
able to identify him in the way that you have discussed?

Yes.

Thank you very much, PC. Jenkinson. Any questions?

Thank you, PC. Jenkinson. Dr. Naidoo, please.

DR. R.K.A. NAIDOO. JESSOP HOSPITAL FOR WOMEN. LEAVYGREAVE ROAD.
SHEFFIELD

On oath saith:

XD H.M. CORONER

Sit down, Dr. Naidoo, please. Am I right to say that your forenames are Rani Kristina Anita,
Dr. Naidoo?

That’s correct.

And at the time you were working at the Jessop Hospital for Women in Sheffield?

Well at that particular time I was working at the Northern General Hospital. I subsequently
went to the Jessop Hospital.

I see. Your address is given as the Jessop Hospital, that is where you were staying?

Yes.

Yes, I see. And how did you come to be aware that there had been a serious event at
Hillsborough football ground, which was needing additional medical and nursing staff at the
Northern General?

I was working at the Northern General Hospital at that time as a Senior House Officer in
Obstetrics and Gynaecology and I was on duty that weekend and the gynaecology wards are
adjacent to the Accident and Emergency Department. During the afternoon we became aware
that there was a lot of activity going on, with a lot of ambulances arriving and so I went down
to the department to see if I could be of any assistance. I had worked there until February of
1989 as a Senior House Officer in the department so I was familiar with it.

                touching the death of ANTHONY DAVID BLAND




In the A & E Department?

That’s right.

I see. Now I know that you can give evidence that you treated Tony Bland and I can refer you
in a moment to the A & E department notes if you will take us through them please. Was he
the first casualty that you dealt with?

Yes he was. I arrived at the ambulance entrance to the department where I met the consultant
in Accident and Emergency and he directed me to the area where Tony Bland had been taken
so he was the first person that I treated.

Would it help....Have you got a copy of the report?

Yes, I have.

Will you tell the court, please, about Tony’s condition when you first saw him?

When I first saw him he was lying deeply unconscious on a trolley. He was unresponsive to
painful stimuli. He was breathing spontaneously with a respiratory rate of 20 per minute and
his observations were stable. His pulse was 88 and his blood pressure was 190/100. His pupils
were equal in size and reacted to light. On examining him there was very little evidence of
external injury. At that time I wasn’t sure of the exact nature of the injuries which he had
suffered but all I could find when I examined him was some very mild bruising on his back and
some grazing on his right upper arm.

At any rate nothing that you found was inconsistent with his having been crushed at some
stage?

No.

As far as can be said, when he was being observed by PC. Jenkinson there was a pulse, which
is not to say that there might not have been at some stage previously to that but that is
impossible to say?

There’s no way of knowing.

And I think he was taken for x-ray?

                 touching the death of ANTHONY DAVID BLAND




That’s right. After I had examined him I ordered some basic blood investigations. I gained
intravenous access. I gave him oxygen by mouth and put a tube into his mouth. After
performing the x-rays it was noted that he had some fractured ribs on the left side, the poster
angles of the 6th-10th ribs on the left but otherwise the cervical spine and skull x-rays were
normal. I performed some blood gases which were also satisfactory and at that stage he left
the Accident & Emergency Department and was taken a ward that had been specially opened
to receive the casualties and there he was attended to by a consultant anaesthetist and after
that I wasn’t directly involved with his care any further. I went to see him up there about half
an hour to an hour later by which time he had been intubated and had been ventilated by the
anaesthetist but as far as I aware nothing untoward event occurred in between times that was
done routinely on the casualty ward.

Of course the information that arose out of the x-ray, that the 6th-10th ribs on the left were
fractured, would again be consistent with him being crushed?

Yes.

And also with the evidence given by PC. Jenkinson that when he put Tony into the ambulance
he wasn’t breathing but later breathed spontaneously?

Yes.

It seems probable, though not certain, that PC. Jenkinson’s procedures, which he described,
restarted the respiration?

Yes.

Thank you very much, Dr. Naidoo. Any questions?

No questions.

Dr. Naidoo, I don’t know whether it is your intention or wish to remain for the rest of the
hearing, you needn’t if you want to return to duty but by all means stay if you wish.

I’ll stay for a little while if that is alright.

Certainly. Dr. Howe, please.

DR. J.G HOWE. CONSULTANT PHYSICIAN. AIREDALE GENERAL HOSPITAL

On oath saith:

XD H.M. CORONER

Dr. Howe, could you please state your full name and your medical qualifications?

James Gordon Howe. I am a Bachelor of Medicine and Fellow of the Royal College of
Physicians.

And you are a Consultant at Airedale General Hospital?

That’s correct.

I understand that from the time that Tony Bland was admitted to Airedale General Hospital,
from the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield, you had charge of his care and medical
treatment?

Yes.

Was he transferred on the 12th May 1989?

That’s correct.

Was it possible to say, on his admission, whether there had been any material change from the
time that Dr. Naidoo has described to the time of his admission to Airedale?

Yes there had been some changes. The consultant who was responsible for his care in
Sheffield had telephoned me the week before and said that after a few days ventilation in
Sheffield the ventilation was stopped and he began to breathe spontaneously. At that time he
was deeply unconscious but began to open his eyes spontaneously and began to respond to
painful stimuli. That was more or less the state when he arrived at Airedale.

There is just one point that I should make, Dr. Howe. Although the father didn’t mention it
I think one of the points that he wanted to make was that there may be proceedings, of which
I know very little or nothing, which may be instituted against you and I think that he has
suggested, informally before the hearing, that I ought to warn you that if there are any
questions which you would rather not answer, because they might be incriminating, you needn’t.
I don’t know whether you have taken that in any way seriously?

Thank you for that information.

Very well. If there are any such questions perhaps you would let me know, would you?

Yes.

Will you, in general terms, please tell the court of the course of Tony’s treatment at Airedale
and the development of his condition and how it came to be diagnosed and described?

On arrival at Airedale Tony Bland was unconscious but his eyes were open and it was clear
from the start that he was in a vegetative state.

From the start?

Yes, from the start. The consultant who saw him in Sheffield, the Consultant Neurologist
there, Dr. Venables, had described him thus to me on the telephone the week before. His eyes
were open but there was never any eye contact. There was no response to questions or
commands. He never made any purposeful movement or showed any sign of interaction with
his environment or with those who were tending him. He woke and slept but his eyes never
focused on anything. Muscle tone was increased and gradually he developed contractures.
There was a tracheostomy in situ when he arrived but since he was breathing spontaneously
and coughing we removed that. Throughout the time that he was with us he was fed
nasogastrically with specially prepared feeds. During the first months that he was at Airedale
the physiotherapy team and speech therapists worked with him every day. His father helped
them in their work. He spent time in our therapy pool. Various assessments were carried out
and he was seen by a senior registrar and another consultant from St. James’s who confirmed
my impression that he was in a vegetative state.

And that was during the first few months?

Yes.

               touching the death of ANTHONY DAVID BLAND




Was it as early as that when you began to wonder what the future might hold and what it
should hold?

At the beginning Mr. and Mrs. Bland and I talked a lot about what the outcome might be and
I counselled them that we would make every effort we could to prevent complications, to
provide the best possible environment for any recovery to occur but that we must just be
patient and hope for the best. Gradually as it became clear that there was no improvement
Mr. and Mrs. Bland began to ask me about it and we began to discuss the fact that sometimes
in patients with severe brain injury there is no improvement and we began to talk about that
probably after three or four months at Airedale.


And the possibility of withdrawing medical treatment?

Yes we discussed that because it has become accepted practice in Canada, the United States,
Australia, New Zealand and South Africa to withdraw treatment from people who are in a
persistent vegetative state.

Yes. Is it recognised on the best medical opinion that recovery from that state which you’ve
described as a persistent vegetative state is not known?

There is recovery from persistent vegetative state but such recovery usually takes place in the
first few months. To the best of my knowledge there are no cases of good recovery from
persistent vegetative state after one year.

Now I think at some stage you, thinking along these lines, you sought the advice of the then
Coroner for Sheffield, Dr. Popper, who advised you that there was a danger, if you took steps
on your own initiative, that you might fall foul of the criminal law?

Yes. He pointed out that this matter had never been tested under English law despite what had
been done in Canada and so on and advised me, and this was advice subsequently confirmed
by the Regional Health Authority solicitor and the Medical Protection Society, that were we
to withdraw treatment at that time I would be liable to prosecution for murder.

Do we speak now of a time during the middle or end of 1990?

We spoke to Dr. Popper and obtained other legal advice I think probably about six or eight
months after Tony’s arrival at Airedale.

Yes. And in due course you were advised that a course was open to you to make under the
guidance and auspices of the Airedale National Health Trust, an application to the court for
a declaration that it may be lawful for you to discontinue medical treatment?

That’s correct. We came to that course when Tony developed a severe complication of his
care, namely a fistula from his urethra, and at that point we had thought that an operation
might be necessary to repair this and it seemed to all concerned, including the surgeon who
was asked, that to do an operation was futile and that really the surgeon himself said that he
was not prepared to do an operation so at that point we sought advice from the Health
Authority solicitor’s office and the Trust decided to make an application to the High Court for
a declaration that it would not be unlawful to withdraw all medical treatment.

Yes. And throughout this process of thought and planning Mr. and Mrs. Bland were kept fully
informed?

That’s correct, yes.

And as I have heard from Mr. Bland were in entire agreement?

They were indeed. The point that Mr. and Mrs. Bland made to me on many occasions was
that from their knowledge of their son they felt that he would not have wanted to be kept alive
like that.

And I think opinion was sought from experts in this field who gave evidence before the High
Court?

That’s correct. Tony was seen by Professor Jennett and Professor Behan from Glasgow,
Professor Jennett being the person who first described persistent vegetative state with Professor
Plum from New York and also from Dr. Cartlidge, a Neurologist in Newcastle, and Dr.
Andrews, who is a rehabilitation specialist at Putney in London.

I wonder, Dr. Howe, if I can ask your confirmation of my understanding that the medical
problem really started from the time that Tony’s brain was starved of oxygen, became anoxic?

That’s correct. Perhaps at the time when his chest was crushed, before he was resuscitated or
later when he was being resuscitated with the pneumothorax Tony’s brain was deprived of
oxygen and this will have resulted in death of the cerebral cortex, the surface of the brain, the
part which does all our thinking and feeling and remembering, all our experiences and so on,
the part of the brain that makes us persons and gives us our experience but he was clearly

resuscitated in time for other parts of the brain to survive, the brain stem, the part of the brain
which controls blood pressure, pulse, respiration, coughing, sneezing and so on, purely
automatic vegetative functions which led to the term ‘persistent vegetative state’ being accepted
as a description for this condition.

You have heard the evidence of PC. Jenkinson that when he first saw this casualty, later
identified as Tony, there was a pulse but he wasn’t breathing?

That’s correct.

Does that fit with your understanding of what might have happened and the subsequent
medical events?

Yes indeed. I mean that is quite characteristic. Other causes of persistent vegetative state
which are well recognised are attempted hanging, attempted suicide with carbon monoxide,
where oxygen supply to the brain is interrupted but not enough to cause death of the brain
stem.

I see. So that are you saying that there probably was a pulse throughout the whole time or that
the heart stopped and started again?

No. It’s possible that his heart stopped and started again but I think it more likely that he
suffered anoxic brain damage while his heart was still beating.

I see. In other words there was a reduction of the blood flow?

Yes. Well reduction of oxygen delivery to the blood because of damage to the lungs.

Consistent with being crushed?

Yes.

I wonder if you could distinguish persistent vegetative state from the other perhaps more well-
known terms of coma and brain death? It’s not the same, is it?

No it’s not the same. Coma refers to someone being unconscious with their eyes closed and
so the medical definition of coma is that there is no eye opening in response to any stimuli.
So someone who is in a vegetative state is unresponsive but their eyes are spontaneously open.
The parts of the brain that control eye opening and eye movement are in the brain stem and

conscious thought is not required to do this. Brain stem death refers to the death of the brain
stem and in that case it is widely accepted that treatment can be withdrawn. In brain stem
death it is necessary to ventilate someone because respiration will stop and in fact if you go on
ventilating someone whose brain stem is dead eventually their heart will stop beating after a
few weeks so it is now accepted practice in this country, and in other countries, that when the
brain stem death criteria are fulfilled, that requires two doctors to examine the person on two
occasions separated by at least eight hours, that ventilation can be stopped.

Yes. That is known as brain death?

Brain stem death.

Yes, specifically, but generally known as brain death?

Yes.

Following the declaration by the High Court that you and your colleagues made, to quote
"lawfully discontinue all life-sustaining treatment and medical support" and the subsequent
appeal to the Court of Appeal and to the House of Lords, then you took advantage, as it were,
of the protection of the declaration and ceased medical treatment?

That’s correct. We withdraw life-sustaining treatment. Tony continued to be cared for in
exactly the same way as before, he was kept warm and clean, his skin was cleaned, his eyes
were bathed, his mouth was kept clean but we withdrew feeding and we withdrew the drug
treatment which we had been giving him for infections.

Yes. And as we have heard he died on the 3rd March. When was treatment withdrawn?

I will have to refer to my notes.     Treatment was withdrawn on the 22nd February.

And was the process that then ensued in accordance with your expectations?

Yes, there being published descriptions from the United States and Canada and it was as we
expected. Within a few days Tony lapsed into a state of coma, that is his eyes became closed
and he died peacefully and quietly on the 3rd March.

Yes. I think it was made plain in the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the House of
Lords, that in future, at any rate in the foreseeable future, similar cases should be the subject
of separate applications to the court?

                  touching the death of ANTHONY DAVID BLAND




That’s correct.

And that the declaration in respect of Tony Bland should not be assumed to be an authority
in respect of any other patient?

Yes.

And you would agree with that line of thinking?

Yes.

There must be, Dr. Howe, must there not, a clear link between the condition in which Tony
was seen to be by Police Constable Jenkinson and the subsequent treatment at Northern
General and more particularly at Airedale and the resultant death, following the withdrawal
of treatment under the protection, if I can put it that way, of the High Court declaration?

I think that’s correct, yes. I think the damage to Tony’s brain occurred on the day in
Hillsborough. This left him unable to swallow and unaware, unable to interact with his
environment, unconscious effectively, and his death, when treatment was withdrawn, in my
opinion was related to the initial anoxic brain damage.

Yes. And in so far as the description by PC. Jenkinson can be authoritative as to the condition
from which Tony was then suffering, namely anoxic brain damage, it is consistent with the
condition in which he was found at Northern General?

That’s my opinion, yes.

In his judgement, Sir Stephen Brown said this, Dr. Howe "that if withdrawal was undertaken
then within ten to fourteen days the lack of sustenance would bring to an end the physical
functioning" and he goes on to say "that Anthony Bland himself would be totally unaware of
what was taking place". Did you agree with what Sir Stephen Brown said at the time?

Yes, that’s correct.

And was that borne out by the facts?

Yes.

Of course quite properly although the High Court was concerned with morals and ethics it was
not concerned with theology, was it and it would, perhaps you can accept it from me that it
wouldn’t it have been right for the High Court to be concerned with theology but of course it
is an area which concerns others.

You might be interested to know that on a subsequent occasion I met representatives of all the
major Christian denominations in this area, including the Bishop of Ripon, the Catholic Bishop
of Bradford....

Leeds.

The Anglican Bishop of Bradford at an ecumenical meeting where they expressed the opinion
that what was done was not inconsistent with Christian theology. I also received a copy of an
article written in The Tablet, which is a leading Catholic journal, by a Jesuit philosopher and
priest in London, arguing that the course of action which we followed was consistent with
Christian teaching.

Yes sir.

Just for the record can you confirm that those present included myself, Dr. Howe, Mrs. Rooke,
the Nursing Officer who was concerned with counselling the nursing staff who had been caring
for Tony, the Coroner’s Officer and another police officer, who took some photographs?

That is correct, sir, yes.

I wonder if I can ask you to summarise your post mortem findings, Dr. Lowe, and at the same
time will you deal with the report, which I believe is non-controversial, of a colleague to yours
to whom you submitted tissue for further examination, that is the Neurological Pathologist, Dr.
Bridges?

Yes sir. My examination on the morning of the 4th March 1993 showed a thin young man
weighing 36 kilograms and of height 155 centimetres. There were flexion contractions of both
arms and the wrists. Both feet were extended. The left leg was flexed and adducted, covering
the external genitalia. My examination showed that there was no evidence of pressure sores
on the body of Tony and this suggested to me that a very high level of nursing care had been
maintained until Tony died. I found no evidence of bony injury, in particular the fractures that
were identified at the time of the incident had healed completely. My examination showed that
there were the changes of bronchopneumonia in the lungs and I confirmed this later on
microscopical examination. The examination of the cardiovascular system was unremarkable
except for the presence of a mild degree of what I considered to be uraemic pericarditis, sir.
The cardiovascular system showed no evidence of significant pre-existing natural disease which
in any way would have influenced the final outcome, sir. Examination of the alimentary system
was also unremarkable. In the genito-urinary system the kidneys showed scars and there was
a degree of pyelitis with thick muco-pus in the renal pelvises. A urethral fistula, as described
by Dr. Howe, was confirmed and this was associated with inflammation and fibrosis, sir.
Following my examination tissues were submitted to the Department of Neuropathology at the
University of Leeds and a report was received from Dr. Bridges, the Consultant
Neuropathologist there. Dr. Bridges describes that the brain showed narrowed gyri, particularly
on the lateral surface and the occipital pole. The ventricles were dilated and the cortex was
reduced in width and there was reduced white matter, particularly in the corpus callosum. The
basal ganglia were reduced in size and the hippocampi were atrophic. Microscopical
examination showed extensive neuronal loss and gliosis, together with cortical laminar ischaemic
necrosis. It was the conclusion of the neuropathological examination that there was severe
anoxic brain injury and that this was consistent with an acute cardiorespiratory failure several
years prior to death. It was also commented on that the severity and the extent of the brain
injury were of such a degree that there could never have been any recovery beyond the

vegetative state. It was my opinion, following my examination and following the
neuropathological examination, sir, that Tony died as a result of Pyelitis and
Bronchopneumonia due to Anoxic Brain Damage and Traumatic Asphyxia.

Yes. And were your findings consistent with the course of Tony’s illness and treatment and the
withdrawal of medical treatment on the day which Dr. Howe mentioned?

Yes sir.

Thank you, Dr, Lowe.

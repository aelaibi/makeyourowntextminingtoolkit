know    the    extent           of    the       disaster.               I    think        it was        now a a o u t          ten        to

four     ( 1550).         I gathered               the       equipment              and     moved       off       diagonally

across     the       pitch       towards           the       first          aid     room     aItnough             the      pitch          wa s

thinner       now     with       casualties.                  People           were       still        giving         CPR      and        I

noticed       a few        dead       people           with        tneir       faces        covered.




I had     decided          at    this           time    to     go      to     the    First       Aid        room      to     help         out

there.         I passed          through           a Police                 line    which       wa s       across        the       width         of

t he    Football        p it c h .         Just        as    1 did           pass    through           the      line         I looked            to

 the    North    Stand          ana        I noticed           a       scuffle       between           quite         a tew         fans,

 perhaps       four7 or         f i ve .         I think           a    couple       of     Police          Officers           dished

 into    the    stand       to        sort       them       out.            I had    enough           on my       m in d .         I d i d n ’t

 take    any    further              notice       of     them.              1 did    notice,           however,              in.^C        Uie

moved       i nto     the        first       aid      room.           Whilst           in     there        I saw          a    lad       on a

 coach      who      was     se mi        conscious.                 His    eyes           were     flickering.                     he    seemed

 alright,           perhaps         slightly           warm.              I left           him     in     this       room       with          a       iac       t

                             tending            to    him.           1 moved           back        out     of       the       room       to       the

 passage        outside.               Here      1 saw          another              lad    layed         down       by       the    back             of a

 vehicle.             I asked          him      if    he    was       okay .           he     stated         vas,         so     i moved                  on.

 1 moved        b a ck      to    him,       suddenly            realising                 tnat     although              I was          looking

 for     a more        seriously             injured            casualty,              they        had m ove d            onto       the

 hospitals            and    that         the    people          1 was           talking           to     were       now m y         priority.

  I went       back        to^lim.           I asked            where           it    hurt. ' He            said         his     r i g ht         arm.

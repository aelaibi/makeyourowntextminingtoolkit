P.O. 1*f9?
Operations Dogs *C* Division
Report re Saturday 15 April 1989
F.A. Gup Semi-final




I commenced duty at 8 a.m. Saturday 15 April 1989 and paraded for briefing
at Niagara Sports Club at 9 a.m. We were briefed for duty by Superintendent
Marsh and Inspector Phenix. My duties were to be 0620 in company with
P.O. 2522 Shilitoe of West Yorkshire Dog Section. We were to patrol Penistone
Road North, paying particular, attention to the entrance to the South Stand
car park at Highbridge, Parkside Hoad and Catchbar Lane, extending to Bradfield
Road as required to assist 0GS2 in that location. (P.S. 2227 Dent)

At 10 a.m. that date we commenced patrol. In order to effectively cover our
designated patrol areas it was necessary to occasionally travel along Leppings
Lane, Herries Soad and Kerries Hoad South, as well as occasionally straying onto
Middlewood Road.

There was a steady build up of supporters throughout the morning with movement
of fans towards the ground but also backtowards City. All was good natured.

At about 12.30 p.m. as a result of radiomessages we began to monitor the Royal
Hotel at the junction of Bradfield Road and Penistone Road. A large number of
Nottingham supporters were   inside and anequally large number were outside
on the footpaths, drinking   from glasses,bottlesand cans. Four P.C.'s and a
Sergeant were posted across the road to monitor the situation although at that
time, although boisterous, all was good natured.

Numbers of fans moving along Penistone Road was increasing and it was apparent
that a large proportion of the crowd either had been, or indeed still were
drinking. Cans and bottles were being carried openly and groups were sat around
drinking. At about 1.35 p*m. a radio message was received to the effect that two
Special Constables were in dificulty somewhere along Penistone Hoad towards
Hillfoot Bridge. We patrolled along that road in search of the specials but without
success. At least three other pubs in that area were open and large numbers of
boidorous Notts fans were drinking outside and also apparently inside. Having
worked other big games at Hillsborough in the past I was surprised by the number
of pubs open and serving fans. It was also apparent that local off-licences
around Middlewood Road/Catchbar Lane and the ground area were serving the fans with
alcohol.

At I.^Op.m. a radio message was received from the Sergeant stationed at the Royal
Hotel that the crowd outside were becoming hostile, and that one bottle had been
thrown across the road towards the Officers. We attended within seconds and
spoke with the Sergeant who said that the licencee had been outside to say that
the fans inside were 'smashing the place up'and he had requested further assistance,
and directed us to await their arrival. I would estimate there was at least
200 fans outside the Royal Hotel. The area was covered with glassess, cans and
bottles, and other smaller groups were across the road from the pub also drinking.
There was a great deal of noise coming from within and the place was obviously
pafiked to bursting. A large proportion of this number were still drinking from
cans and bottles. On arrival of (father Officers the pub was emptied and the fans
moved away toi^ards the ground. The pub I believe, was closed and staff began
to clear up outside. The fans were still on the whole good natured.

We resumed patrolling our points st about 2.20p.m. and the vicinity of the ground *.a
was extremely busy. Still large numbers of the Nott. fans were drinking on their
way to the ground, and there was also movement of fans along Parkside Road onto
Leppings Lane. From the radio I was aware that at about 2.35p.m. Leppings Lane
was closed to traffic
Catchbar Lane and 1'iddlewood Hoad was heavy with fans, a large proportion of
whom were drinking and just standing around in groups. Numerous radio
messages wore being received in respect of the crush taking place at the Leppings
Lane turnstiles.

At abort 3 p.m. a radio message was received that all dog section were to enter
the ground via gate 0. We attended from Parkside Hoad and were directed with
dogs onto the tunnel between the North Stand and the Spion Kop. Ue were directed
to remain there. I could see fans were running around the playing area, lie were
being spat on from the Notts fans above us in the Spion Kop. Gradually casualties
were being brought off the pitch area via that tunnel and we were directed to
standby outside the ground with our vehicles.

Me returned to Penistone Road North, Gate 0. Ue assisted in holding back fans
who were attempting to enter the ground through gate 0 as ambulances wore being
reversed into the ground. At this point P.O. Shilitos and I became separated. I
believe he returned into the ground to assist Ambualne staff, without his dogf
and. I remained, outside the ground.

At about 3.30p.m. we were directed by radio back onto the pitch with dogs. Myself
and a number of other Dog Section Officers were deployed by Chief Supt. Nesbit
ina line behind the Spion Kop goal. Some fighting broke out in the North stand
around the half way line and a number of dogs were re-directed to move to the
perimeter track facing that stand. I remained behind the Spion Kop goal.

At about ’t-.30 p.m. we were directed back to our phase three points, ours being
Parkside Road/Penistone Hoad. We took that position and monitered the crowd
leaving, which in the whole was subdued and quiet.

At about 4.’+5 p.m. a radio message was received of fighting in Hillsborough Park.
We attended on foot with dogs, but were overtaken by Mounted Officers. The fight
was at the Middlewood Hoad end of the park and was broken up by Mounted.

At 5*05 p.m. we were re-called to fighting in the park. Again it appeared to be
at the Middlowood Hoad end of the park and we could play no part. V/e continued duties
with other Officers, directing traffic gnd attempting to clear a way through for
Hospital staff and emergency service vehicles.

At about 6»30p.ra. traffic had cleared and v/e were called to Niagara. Ln route
P.C. Shilitoe visited the Hillsboro Gym with a personel cassette handed to him
having been found on the pitch. V/e were on standby at Niagara until stood down
at 7 .30 p.m. and went off duty at 8 p.m.


I have been present at other 'Big matches' at Hillsboro in the past both as
Dog Section and Uniform. In general thePolicing of the game appeared to be as
the normal plan. However I was amazed at the drinking talcing place amongst the
fans, most of which that I was involved with being Notts fans. In the past local
pubs have remained closed, or merely admitted regu3.ars via rear doors, but on this
date many seemed open as usual and indeed packed out. Local off-licences appeared
to be serving to fans, and I cannot recall ever having seen drinking amongst fans
in the vicinity of a game to that degree. In general there was a relaxed holiday
spirit, but a good proportion v/ere drunk or had been drinking heavily.

              FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL:                          SAFETY ISSUES



      The Home Secretary, Lord Ferrers and Mr Lloyd saw your
  submission of 6 October.  Lord Ferrers' comments were recorded
  in Miss Nicholson's note of 9 October and Mr Lloyd was also
  content.  The Home Secretary agreed the proposals for the
  present, but commented that:

        "If Mr Moynihan feels strongly the other way
         we shall have to discuss. An evenly balanced
         argument."

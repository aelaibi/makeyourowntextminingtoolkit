NAME:         Qualified Ambulanceman

VEHICLE:      R608

SHIFT:        1400 - 2200 hours (15 April 1989)


DATE AND TIME OF INTERVIEW:              18th April 1989, 1000 - 1230 hours




I was       on afternoon duty on Saturday 15th April 1989,                  at 1515 hours we
received      a    telephone      call from   Control whilst       on Station   to attend    an
incident at Hillsborough Football Ground, Sheffield


We arrived at Hillsborough at approximately 1537 hours, after experiencing
difficulties in getting through traffic and crowd congestion.                       Eventually
we arrived at the Leppings Lane end of the ground and saw a lot of people
lying on the ground.                As we attempted to get into the ground          to remove
casualties         we had to struggle because          lots of people seemed to want our
Services,          I   noticed three     policemen     on   horses   who were    having    great
difficulty in          controlling       the crowd.    A policeman pointed      to the floor
which indicated to me that we were needed there.


I stopped the ambulance in the area which I believe was adjacent to                          'C'
Gate     (on the plan)        at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.              I left the
ambulance and walked to the rear and immediately noticed what I now know
was     a   group      of   deadbodies    lying   on      the   ground up   against some   iron
railings.          I reached     the rear of the        ambulance and was pulled away by
someone to         a wall on the other side of the drive where a doctor was dealing
with a number of patients.


Together with Leading Ambulanceman                          (my crew mate) we took out both
stretches         from our ambulance,       the doctor pointed out to us the two most
seriously injured patients and with assistance from bystanders we placed
them on our stretfchers and loaded them onto our ambulance.


                                                                                    /continued

Once we were in the Ambulance we administered Oxygen to both casualties who
appeared to be suffering from crush injuries.           At this time I realised that
we were being assisted in the ambulance by someone who I now know to be an
off duty ambulanceman,                   , from Barnsley Station, who had come to
watch the football match and had been caught up in the incident at the
Leppings Lane West stand area of the ground.


Somebody   closed   the   rear   doors   of   the   ambulance   and    after making   the
casualties as comfortable as possible I drove from the ground with a police
motor cycle escort and proceeded to the Northern General Hospital, arriving
there at approximately 1550 hours.


We were met at      the Casualty department by hospital           staff with    trollies
where we transferred the casualties from our stretcher onto the trollies
and we immediately returned to the Football Ground.


We arrived back at the Leppings Lane end of the ground and parked                     the
ambulance in the same area of the driveway as on our previous journey and
experienced exactly the same difficulties as before.                  Along with Leading
Ambulanceman              and Ambulanceman             1 we placed on our Ambulance
four more casualties (two stretcher and two sitting cases).                At this point
an off duty nurse asked if we needed any help, we said                 'Yes' and she got
into the back of the Ambulance.           Leading Ambulanceman                decided to
stay at the ground to do whatever he could.




                                                                              /continued

I drove the ambulance whilst ambulanceman _______ and the nurse treated the
four casualties.          Before I set off a Parkway Ambulanceman told              me that the
Northern General          Hospital was getting full so I went           to the      Hallamshire
Hospital.


I arrived at the Hallamshire at approximately 1610 hours.                      The roads en-
route by this time were well policed and we experienced no difficulty in
getting through.          Hospital staff met us on our arrival          and we      handed over
our patients       to     them,    I radioed Control thatwe were clear              and we once
again returned to the Football Ground.


We arrived back at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.                        Again for the
third time I experienced great difficulty in getting the vehicle through
the crowds and onto the driveway close to Gate 'C'.


I eventually got through and was able to link up again with my crew mate
Leading Ambulanceman                     .    At this stage there were no live casualties
to deal with only the bodies which I had seen earlier and these had now
been screened off with green sheeting.                  Leading Ambulanceman                told
me that we were now needed at the Gymnasium and we proceeded to this point.
We   were   able    to    get     onto   Penistone    Road   and were   then   in    a line    of
Ambulances waiting along Penistone Road.


At this time I saw Assistant Chief Officer Jones who was getting all the
blankets off the ambulances.                 I removed the blankets from our ambulance and
placed them along with a pile of others onto the pavement.                       We were then
instructed by either Mr Jones of Station Officer ________                        to go to     the
Herries Road Bus Depot approximately 800 yards away and to stand-by at that
area.


                                                                                     /continued

After standing-by at the bus depot for approximately 40 minutes we were
directed back to the Gymnasium car park at the Football Ground.            On our
arrival we were parked up        in   the car park with   approximately 10 other
ambulances.   Shortly after Mr Jones assembled all our staff and he briefed
us on what was to happen next.


After Mr Jones had established that we were a 1400 to 2200 afternoon crew
he released us from the ground to contact Control and return back to our
own area or Station.


We   travelled     back   to   Maltby   Ambulance   Station   arriving   there   at
approximately 1845 hours.

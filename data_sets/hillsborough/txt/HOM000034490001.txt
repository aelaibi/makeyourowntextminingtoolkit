    Mr Astling, the Cleric to the West Midlands Police Authority, telephoned
    me on an informal basis to ask if there was anything that could be gain
    in response to his letter on behalf of his Authority seeking central
    government funding for the costs of the police enquiries on
    Hillsborough.


    2.   I told him that there was a Parliamentary Question from Mr Bruce
    George, as well as the letter of which he was aware from the South
    Yorkshire Police Authority; I said that the likely response the Home
    Office would make to each of these at this stage was that they indeed
    had representations from South Yorkshire, would be considering them,
    and would respond as soon as they were able to do so.


    3.   X added that X did not think it likely that the matter would be
    settled at once, or that the Home Office would refuse to entertain
    argument and justification from South Yorkshire; I also said that it
    was not apparent that West Midlands had direct responsibility for any
    of the three aspects involved:   the judicial enquiry, South Yorkshire
    Police's own need to establish the facts, and potentially the
    investigation of complaints under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act.

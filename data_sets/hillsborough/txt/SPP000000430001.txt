Mr. C. F. Bone,
The Hillsborough Scrutiny,
Room 1106,
50, Queen Anne’s Gate,
London, SW1H9AT

Dear Mr. Bone,

                                    Hillsborough

Further to my telephone conversation with you today I enclose:

       1. A schedule in which I give the page numbers of the enclosures to my letter
       of 3rd December which I hope will be of use.

       2 .1 also enclose a copy of list which one of my then secretaries prepared to
       assist in finding the location of the witnesses who gave evidence at the main
       part of the inquest. I have not checked that it contains every name but I have
       found it useful and it may be of assistance to you.

One other small matter . On page 17 line 21 of the shorthand note I refer to Chief
Superintendent Nesbit being on the scene at about 19 minutes p a st. I think he may
have been there earlier then that but and you may wish to verify the time either with
the video or probably more easily by checking the transcript of the late Lord Justice
Taylor’s inquiry.



Yours sincerely,



S. L. Popper

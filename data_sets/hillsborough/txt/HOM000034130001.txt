                SW1H 9AT.

                Dear Home Secretary,

                Following the recent documentary drama 'Hillsborough' (transmission date
                5th december, 1996), I met with members of the Hillsborough Family
                Support Group (H.F.S.G.) who wanted to discuss with me its implications.

                They expressed to me their need for the documentary to have been made,
                because they felt certain that the terrible events they had experienced
                had not previously been properly conveyed to the national audience.    The
                families now feel that the film has rectified this position and bear
                evidence to this by way of the considerable sympathy and concern
                forthcoming from many different quarters.

                The Hillsborough documentary highlighted certain discrepancies between
                evidence presented at the inquest and the findings of Lord Justice
                Taylor's report.  This, together with other matters relating to lost
                video recordings and the film's claim that crucial video evidence was
                available, appear to leave serious questions unanswered, which is rather
                concerning and upsetting to the families.

                As a result of the discussions with members of the H.F.S.G., and at their
                request, I write to express the hope and wish that you as Home Secretary
                will give serious consideration to commissioning an official review of
                the unanswered questions that apparently now exist.




                                                                                                                              continued

Questions still remain unanswered and public opinion is gathering pace
for these matters to be addressed, and addressed quickly.   The members
of the H.F.S.G. have experienced seven agonising and frustrating years
since the tragedy.   They now feel that these outstanding issues should
be resolved as a matter or considerable urgency and I should appreciate
it if you would let me know if you agree that the issues should be
resolved and whether an official review will be commissioned.

Yours sincerely,




David R. /Moores
Chairman/

    the       pub was        ful               iverpool           fans.      We were        told to go to the                    pub by

 a mate             up here                   I think        his    name     is because             the     this                had    been

    there       last year             to a christening and the                       licensee          had said to go                 back

 anytime,                so thats why we. went we                     just k n o c k e d on the                 door and        said we

 were          friends         of             and they let us in.                       Once    inside we              had two

was    the fact      that    there was a mass              of    people and         no orde r l y queue.

T here were        no other      places        or gates     open only the            t urnstiles       and    the

    ducked under n e a t h because               I was    holding        his    coat.         I saw no

            to get out.            People were             c'r^^i ng on top of me             to get       onto    the

            P olice were          doing      this       as they thought            it was a pitch          i n v asion      but

            because       there were           so many         climbing      over    the    top they then

            realised something was wrong.                             The Police      that were       in front         of

            the    fence were            being         pleaded wit h by people             in the    crowd to help.

            I could hear           this      but       not see       it.   The Po l i c e    in front       paid no

            caught       the     fencing w ith my              right arm and w i t h rny left              I grabbed         the

 kid ar o u n d          the w a i st and     pulled him towards                me and move           his      face

 towards           the    fence    so he     could breath.             As    I did that          there        s eemed

 to be a lapse              in the      p r e s s u r e and    I moved       back     slighty.          At     this

 the     bloke          standing a top of me fell                 to the       floor and         landed on

 his     back ahd          the young        lad fell     on top of him.                The     lad

 who     fell       from    N^e      fence was wre g t ^ i . h i s _                       I w e n t i e s.     There

 was a sudden              surge a g a i n and        I was      pushed onto          the fence a g a i n

 which        I grabbed wit h both hands.                      I drop p e d s l i g h t l y and         I landed

 on the           bloke    on my shins.

 I started to              crawl     up the     fence w ith my hands.                  I stood on the

 bloke       on the        floor    for about a minute.                 I c o u l d n ’t help        standing

 on him but              because    of the      pressure         from the       back      I couldn't           help

 it so       I started to            pull    up the fence as hard as                   I could to get               off

 him.      But      it took Vq^l^ong          because         of the     pressure         from the       people

 other       side.         A t th i s po i n t I saw t h e p 1ay er s walk i n g                 of f the

 pitch.            I picked myself           up off the floor               and w a l k e d   onto      the

 grassed area and saw Ala n H A N S O N                       talking       to a spe c t a t o r     on the

 floor       two feet away            from me.

 My    chest        felt    really      tight    and    I was       having      difficulty           breathing.

 I looked behind and the                     best way         I can d e s c r i b e    it is that             the

 people were              like    s q u a s h e d fish agai n s t               ejvce_^       I saw the         gate

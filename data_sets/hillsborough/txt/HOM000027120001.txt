              BEHAVIOUR OF PEOPLE IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS

              Recently I met Dr Helen Muir from the College of Aeronautics at
              Cranfield.  Helen works in the Applied Psychology Unit and following the
              tragic fire at Manchester in 1985 when 54 people died in a fire in an
              aircraft on the runway, she was asked to look at behaviour issues of
              passengers.  Whilst her findings have not yet been completed she
              believes, as do I, that many of the issues could be related in some way
              to our concerns about crowd safety as it relates to individual behaviour.

              I enclose the papers that she has sent me which you may care to
              discuss with Sir Peter.  If you would like more information or would
              like to arrange a meeting, please do not hesitate to contact me.

              Best wishes.

                     _o_^r
              Thank you for your recent communication enclosing your paper on "Human
              Factors in Cabin Safety" and your- Literature Review on passenger
              evacuation.

              During Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry we were anxious to find somebody
              who could help us consider the behaviour of individuals in crowd
              situations.  Unfortunately, we drew a blank.  However, having now spoken
              to you and having read your documents I do believe that there is a
              similarity between behaviour in crowd/panic situations and with those in
              aircraft accidents.  It was also interesting to note the influence of
              alcohol.

              Whether Lord Justice Taylor wishes to pursue     crowd behaviour in the
              second phase of his Inquiry, I am not sure.      However, I have written to
              his Secretary, Mr R M Whalley, enclosing the     documents for his
              information and that of Lord Justice Taylor.      If they do wish to pursue
              a discussion, no doubt they will be in touch     with me, and in turn with
              you.

              Thank you for taking the trouble to write and if anything more comes to
              your attention which you think could be relevant in some way to our
              studies in crowd behaviour, I would be most obliged.

  which Mr Jones at West Midlands Police has
   passed to the Inquiry.

  The papers are now with Lord Justice Taylor for
  his consideration.  If he wishes to pursue any
  of the points raised, we shall contact you
  again direct.

This report has been produced in response to a request from the Civil
Aviation Authority for a review of the literature which relates to the
topic of passenger evacuation.    The report has been divided into two
parts.   Behavioural  Aspects  of  Passenger  Evacuation are   reviewed
initially, and are followed by a review of the Technical Aspects of
Passenger Evacuation,

The Behavioural Aspects of Passenger Evacuation       includes sections on
Preparation Prior to an Emergency, The Effects       of Fire and Smoke on
Human Responses, The Behaviour of Passengers in      Emergency Evacuations
and Factors Influencing The Behaviour of Subgroups    of Passengers.

The Technical Aspects of Passenger Evacuation includes sections on
Statistics regarding the Number of Evacuations, Analysis of Worldwide
Accidents involving Evacuations, The Effects of Aircraft Fire on the
Production of Smoke and Toxic Fumes and The Responses of the Fire
Services.

1.1   INTRODUCTION

Over  the   last  two  or  three  decades,  air  travel  has  become   an
increasingly popular means of transportation.      Whilst this form of
transport is considered to be relatively safe, unfortunately accidents
do occur.    In 1985, the worldwide fleet of commercial airliners were
involved in 115 accidents of which 29 were classified as non-survivable.

In accidents such as the Air India Boeing 747 which       exploded   over the
Atlantic in June 1985, the crash forces     were of such severity    that all
those onboard were killed instantly.         However,  in the majority of
accidents the deceleration forces imposed on the aircraft occupants and
their immediate environment during the crash sequence, are such that the
passengers are not exposed to unacceptable "g" tolerances.         On such
occasions, an emergency evacuation maybe instigated by the cabin staff
with the objective of facilitating the rapid transferance of passengers
from the potentially hazardous cabin interior to the outside world.      The
success of the evacuation will be dependent on a number of extrinsic
factors, these include the number and location of exits, whether any of
these are blocked by flame or impact damage, the help received from crew
and some passengers and the intensity       and progress of any fire and
smoke,  which may   be present, within the cabin.       Survival   is also
influenced by the physical and mental attributes which each individual
passenger   holds,   which   may facilitate   or  prevent   the   effective
exploitation of the short time which is available.

It is in fact possible to group the factors which may influence
emergency evacuations into configurational, procedural, environmental
and behavioural aspects. These can be observed in Table 1.1 (a).

Much research into the configurational and logistical factors has been
undertaken by the airframe manufacturers although it is for the most
part unpublished.  The regulatory bodies have specified certain minimun
conditions which must be met by the manufacturers, in addition to which
an evacuation drill must be conducted on each aircraft type prior to
certification.

In the drill the complete passenger load must be evacuated within 90
seconds through half of the avialable exits.       Over the years the
conditions in which the drill to be conducted have been refined to
increase the realism of the evacuation.   This has included conducting
the evacuation in semi-darkness, the use of children over 8 years, and
baby dumbies, together with the placing of items of baggage in the
aisles.

To date, in the evacuation drills, the passengers evacuate the aircraft
in a we11-organised and orderly manner.  Although this situation should
and infact has often been reported in actual emergency evacuations, for
example  the evacuation of a Boeing 747 at Vayne County Detroit
Metropolitan Airport in April     1985.   There are other reports of
evacuations in which the orderly process has not been adhered to and
confusion in the cabin has been associated with blockages in the aisles
and at exits and the loss of life, as was seen in the Boeing 737
incident at Manchester in August 1985.

Unfortunately, but perhaps not surprising in view of the associated
difficulties,  experimental research   which has   been   instigated to
investigate human behaviour during high stress situations, equivalent to
aircraft emergency evacuation is minimal.   The information available is
infact limited to that obtained in the early 1970's when Robson (1973)
and Johnson (1971) conducted small scale projects with the sole aim of
determining the behaviour of passengers in evacuations.

The   Robson    (1973)   study was    based   on   information    gained    from
questionnaire given to cabin staff who had been involved in an emergency
evacuation in the preceding three years.         Data was gathered about the
reactions    of   passengers   before,   during   and   after    the   emergency
evacuation.     Johnson (1971) on the otherhand reviewed the relevant
psychological      literature   and    accident    reports    to     develop    a
classificatory system of passenger behaviour during aircraft accidents.

Since 1973 research in the area has remained static.      This may be a
reflection of the ethical constraints imposed on psychological study,
which make the totally realistic investigation of such areas impossible.
Additionally, Johnson (1971) has argued that as self-preservation is the
primary motive of those involved in a true emergency evacuation, such
behaviour, it is reasoned, should not and possibly could not be tampered
with.
                                    - 3 -


Information relating to the behaviour of passengers has therefore been
gathered from alternative sources, these being accidents reports which
are produced by the regulatory bodies after an emergency aircraft
evacuation and reconstructions of passenger behaviour during actual
events.   Available accident reports proved to be surprisingly lacking as
a source of data, although at first sight it would appear that accident
investigators have an unparalleled chance to gather information on human
behaviour   in  stressful   situations.    The  second  methodology,   ie.
ultilising survivors themselves to provide an insight into what actually
occured is not new in psychological investigation (re: Allport, 1942)
and proved to     be much more educational, although it appears to have
been seldomly used.

To fill the void of information, it was considered to be pertinent to
examine the behaviour of individuals during fire, and other natural
disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes and war situations.
The validity of extrapolation to the aircraft accident situation may be
questioned, due to the unique nature of the setting.  The variables that
consitute the differences between passengers in an aircraft accident and
other threat situations are shown in Table 1.1 (b). The important point
to note is that in the aircraft situation all of the five factors apply,
whereas in the other settings only some may be present at any one time.
For example: in a mine disaster only factor (iv) is applicable; in a
theatre fire factors (i), (ii) and (v) are applicable, and in a train
crash all except the vital factors (iii) and (iv) are to be found
(Robson,   1973).   Despite such limitations,    the evidence which is
available from these sources is thought to be relevant and consequently
expands the base of data, although the reliability and validity of the
information is uncertain.

Table    1 ,1   (b)

          Factors Contributing to the Uniqueness of the Situation
                            in an Aircraft Cabin
                            (Taken from Robson, 1973)
(i)     The passengers from a fairly large amorphous group with no fixed
        hierarchy.

(ii)    The passengers have usually never met   before.
(iii)   The passengers are in what to the majority of them   isa strange
        environment.

(iv)    The cabin is a cramped environment.

(v)     There are essentially only two levels of group structure in the
        cabin, the crew and the passengers.


Although each aircraft accident is unique, it is possible to classify
them according to a number of criteria.    The most critical of these is
whether or not the accident was survivable, obviously in the latter case
passenger behaviour is a non-issue as the impact forces encountered by
the occupants is such that they are killed instantly.
                                 - 4 -


However,  other criteria which have been ultilised are of greater
relevance to the study of passenger behaviour these being the portion of
the flight path at which the accident occured, whether the incident
resulted in fire, whether there was any warning of an impending accident
and whether an emergency evacuation was impelmented.

In this report only the analysis of those survivable accidents in which
an emergency evacuation was inplemented is included.   Thus the criteria
of prime   importance are whether any warning was available of an
impending accident and whether or not emergency evacuation took place in
the presence of fire.

To ascertain the determinants and variety of behaviours which passengers
exhibit in an emergency evacuation, this report is divided into four
parts these being : Preparation Prior to an Emergency, Effects of Fire
and Smoke on Human Responses, Behaviour of Passengers in Emergencies and
Factors Influencing the Behaviour of Subgroups of Passengers.

1.2     PREPARATION PRIOR TO AN EMERGENCY


Between the years of 1959 and 1985, 48.3% of aircraft accidents occured
during the final approach and landing and 21.5% during take-off and the
initial climb; sections of the flight path which accounted for only 4%
and 2% respectively of the total flight time (Boeing Commercial Airplane
Company,  1986).    It is hardly surprising therefore that of those
emergency evacuations which were implemented, in only 15% of cases was
there time for the cabin staff to inform the passengers of the imminent
danger and the need to evacuate the plane using all available exits.

The preparation of passengers   prior to an emergency may be considered in
a number of ways: briefing      and recall, ultilisation of information
gained form the pre-flight      briefing and the effects of warning on
passengers behaviour, each of   which will be dealt with independently.



1.2.1     Passenger Briefing and Recall

As stated previously, the vast majority of emergency evacuations are
initiated without warning.    Airlines therefore attempt to inform and
prepare passengers via a pre-flight briefing and safety cards, of the
procedures to be adopted     in the unlikely event of an emergency
evacuation being required. During the pre-flight briefing passengers are
informed of the location of exits, the use of seat belts and life
jackets and the rules governing smoking whilst on the aircraft.     Thus
reducing the risk of maladaptive behaviour, and increasing passengers
knowledge  regarding the procedures which are available during an
emergency situation.

The National Transportation Safety Board (1985) published a study in
which an attempt was made to investigate differing methods of presention
of such information.    This study was a response to the considerable
concern which had been expressed at the poor attention which passengers
paid to these pre-flight briefings.       Poor attention to pre-flight
briefings is often cited as one of the reasons for    the high number of
fatalities and injuries which can occur in aircraft evacuations which
are undertaken    without any warning.      Questionnaires completed by
passengers who had undertaken an evacuation from a TVA Boeing 747
indicated that of the 114 responses, 72 individuals had not read the
safety information card (National Transportation Safety Board, 1985).
Of the 72 passengers who had not read the card, 40 persons sustained
evacuation-related injuries.   By contrast, of the 42 persons who had
read the card, only 7 received evacuation-related injuries.
                                 - 6 -


An experimental programme was undertaken by Berkun et al (1962) in order
to assess the extent to which information contained within the pre­
flight briefing was retained.       Three experimental conditions were
included, subjects from the first group boarded an aircraft and were
given a briefing being subsequently told that they would have to perform
an emergency ditching operation.      A second group of subjects also
boarded the aircraft, were given the pre-flight briefing but were not
informed of any emergency while individuals allocated to the third group
remained on the ground and where they received a briefing.   All subjects
were then tested after a specified time interval for retention of the
briefing information.   The results indicated that subjects in group 1
performed significantly worse that group 2, with group 2 performing
significantly worse than group 3.  Essentially, the group who would most
need the information was the least able to recall it, apparently the
flying experience and the ditching warning had a negative or inhibitory
effect on the ability to remember the briefing instructions.

Passengers who have been involved in evacuation incidents frequently
suggest that there is a need for greater dissemination of safety
information.   Ironically, much of the safety information suggested is
infact currently available to passengers, which supports the general
observation  that the techniques for presenting information in order to
attract and maintain the attention of all passengers are currently
inadequate.

In addition to poor or a lack of attention to the briefing or the card,
other factors which are influential in the preparedness of passengers
include whether the instructions are actually understood, remembered and
followed at the time of the emergency evacuation.   No data is available
which either supports or refutes the assumption that passengers having
read to safety card and listened to the pre-flight briefing actually
understand the information contained within them.  Research is therefore
required to validate this assumption.




1.2.2      Ultilisation   ofInformation Gained            from   the
                       Pre-flight Briefing

It is currently assumed by       the airlines that once information is
understood and remembered it will actually be followed.   Analysis of the
behaviour of passengers in one accident undertaken by LeRoy (1967)
indicated that only one passenger went back more than one row behind the
last row that he passed during boarding.      This indicates the strong
tendency by passenger to exit, via the door by which they had entered
the cabin.    This attraction    has also been noted inother emergency
evacuations.   The assumption that this effect will be replaced by the
pre-flight briefing information must therefore be questioned.
                                  - 7 -


The National Transportation Safety Board's report on the accident which
occured King Salmon,     Alaska   in February   1982 concluded that the
initiation of egress was so slow that it could easily have resulted in
fatalities.   The passengers   it seemed were not able to open   the right
overwing exit until assisted by the captain thus increasing the time
required to evacuate all the individuals.        Subsequent investigation
revealed that the catch was difficult to locate and exit signs were far
"too subjective" and did not take into account fully the reactions and
understanding of passengers unfamiliar with air travel, or of different
sociological/cultural backgrounds.    The briefing cards which were issued
to the passengers on the aircraft were said by the Safety Board to
contain "diagrams of the emergency exits which were small and unlabeled
and the methods for operating the exits were presented in written form
only.    Although all 36 passengers and 3 crew members of the Reeve
Aleutian Airways Nihon YS-11A aircraft survived the crash, the incident
shows the need for clear and concise instructions to ensure that all
passengers can locate and disarm the emergency exits.

Thus, the briefing matter provided should be clarified to the greatest
extent so passengers know exactly what is required of them in an
emergency.    Information contained within the preflight briefing and the
safety cards should enable the passenger to (i) be prepared to act in
the face     of confusion which exists in a post-accident setting, (ii)
perform novel responses, such as opening emergency doors and (iii) act
under conditions which may pose physical threat for incorrect responses
or inaction.

In 1971, the M cDonnell-Douglas study reported that contrary to popular
thought, the passengers who wished to have an increased knowledge of
emergency procedures were in the majority.    Additionally, if explained
properly    safety precautions may infact allay passenger fears     thus
enabling them to attend to the briefings more effectively.



1.2.3   The Effects of Warning on Passenger Behaviour

Although the majority of accidents occur spontaneously and there is no
time inform the passengers of an impending evacuation, in some cases
there is time to prepare the passengers for an emergency evacuation.  In
the intervening time between warning and the actual instigation of the
evacuation, cabin staff play a vital role.      They must allocate able
bodied males at the emergency exits to facilitate the egress of
passengers and ensure that all passengers are positioned in the brace
position with their seat belts fastened to reduce the incidence of
impact injuries.   If time is available the cabin staff may run through
the pre-flight briefing and indicate the the most appropriate escape
routes.    It is therefore presumed that the incidence of maladaptive
behaviour during the actual evacuation will be reduced.     Ho research,
however, is available which compares behaviour during evacuations which
have initiated spontaneously and those in which the passengers were
informed.      It is therefore not possible to assess whether warning
passengers has either a positive or negative effect on their egress.

1.2.3.1    Performance and Stress

Informing passengers that the aircraft is in some sort of distress which
will necessitate an emergency evacuation is, not surprisingly, anxiety
provoking.   The effect of anxiety and stress on performance has been
extensively studied in psychological research.    A relationship is now
known to exists between the complexity of the task and the individual's
level of anxiety (Re: Figure 1.2.3.1 (a)).



Figure 1.2.3.1   (a)

          The Relationship Between Levels of Stress and Performance
                     For Both Simple and Difficult Tasks

                   Low Stress       Moderate Stress          High Stress



A very high level of fear therefore interferes with the learning and
behavioural response processes resulting in a reduction in levels of
performance, for both difficult and simple tasks, ie. the effect of
stress is greater on more difficult tasks.     Evidence relating to the
effect of anxiety on performance during emergency egress from aircraft
has been noted.   For example : the ability to remember instructions is
reduced (Berkun et al, 1962), a situation which may nullify the effects
of the briefings given to the passengers prior to the actual evacuation.
Equally,  although not directly applicable to this study during a
ditching of a DC-9 in 1970 some passengers had great difficulty in
donning their life jackets even though there was more than ten minutes
between the warning and the actual ditching.
As stated previously, passengers in an emergency evacuation are required
to make a series novel and difficult responses, such as locating and
opening doors, negotiating the safety chutes, in a situation which is
potentially life threatening.      The physiological and psychological
effects of smoke, fire or lack of oxygen (hypoxia) which may result from
the malfunction, crash forces or decompression also have the potential
to reduce the ability to respond effectively.    It is hardly surprising
therefore that optimum egress rates do not occur even in evacuations
which are implemented after the passengers have received additional
instructions.

Equally,   the passenger's ability to undertake simple tasks such as
undoing their seat belts may also be reduced, individuals in numerous
instances have reported problems in releasing their safety belts after
accidents (For example: Teneriffe 1974).       This difficulty may be the
result of an individual reverting to a more familiar mode of behaviour,
Spence   (1960, cited in Levitt     (1968))   suggested that the reponse
highest in the habit hierarchy is the one a person is most likely to
perform in a given situation.    Thus a passenger may therefore revert to
actions which would open his car seat belt rather than the more novel
lap belt available on aircraft, ie. reverting to a familiar mode of
behaviour.    Fear it is stated acts as a drive, increasing the likelihood
that the most automatic and frequently used response is made.

Cabin staff must therefore be available to direct individual's whose
capacity for the retention of new information is greatly reduced and who
are extremely anxious.   Instructions must therefore be concise and clear
and nullify a number of previously correct behavioural responses, for
example : exiting via the door of embarkation.

The effects of high stress on performance may also be applicable to
cabin staff.   It should therefore be anticipated that cabin staff may
suffer from a reduced ability to carry out their allotted duties in an
emergency situation.  The fact that in the vast majority of cases, cabin
staff do carry out their duties in an exemplary fashion, suggest that
their high level of training may lead to a situation in which their
actions are automatic and thus the cognitive input required is reduced.
Equally, the responsibility to ensure the safety of passengers may lead
cabin staff to envelope the role of a confident and self-reliant
individal with the capability to react in an effective manner in a tense
situation.

1.2.3.2   Depersonalization

A sense of fear and a reduction in performance are not alone in being
characteristic behavioural responses to life threatening situations.
Hoyes and Kletti (1977) in their study "Depersonalization in Response to
Life Threatening Danger" noted that 72% of the people who had been
exposed to considerable danger reported an altered awareness of the
passage of time, although the slowing of environmental events contrasted
with the speed of mental processing.       Other survivors reported an
absence of emotion, being calm and deatached, 30% of those studied
indicated that they felt as though a wall existed between themselves and
their feeling during the depersonalised state, though most reported a
state of intense fear right before or right after the state of
depersonalisation.

Depersonalisation seemingly occurs instantly upon realisation of extreme
danger, and disappears when the threat is past.  Via this adaptive state
the individual is able to intensify alertness and the ability to think
by detaching himself and being an 'observer', thereby reducing the
strong emotion which could disorganise the ability of the person to
think and act.

Johnson (1984) generalised these findings to aircraft accidents, "it
would seem that many passengers and crewmenbers might be aware of the
danger of the situation but some of them,           especially the cockpit
crewmembers, would be doing what they could to prevent the accident from
occuring.   Other crewmembers might be mentally reviewing what they would
do as soon as the plan comes to a halt.     . . . Some passengers may think
of things they will do, such as moving from their seats to an exit, but
others may not focus their minds on anything in general".

Such depersonalisation may account for reactions of passengers during
the warning period classified by Robson (1973).  Cabin staff categorised
the behaviour   of 268   passengers who were    involved in the three
evacuations which had prior warning 35% were calm, 47% were mildly
agitated, 15% agitated, 2% were very agitated and less than 1% exhibited
signs of uncontrolled panic.   It is interesting to note that less than
20% of passengers referred to the emergency evacuation leaflets during
this warning period.


1.2.4     Summary

Considerably more research is needed before the full effects of warnings
on the behaviour of passengers during emergency evacuations can be fully
understood and the most     appropriate techniques   for imparting the
necessary information implemented.
                                  - 11 -


Research is therefore necessary to identify :

    (i)    The amount of   information which can reasonably be presented
            for the most reliable recall and comprehension.

    (ii)   The portion of the flight path or the warning period which is
            most effective for reliable recall of briefing information.

    (iii) The most effective   method of   presentation   for the   flight
           briefing.

    (iv)   The amount of warning period required to minimise the fear
            response and thus reduce   the incidence of maladaptive
            behaviour.

    (v)    The effects of giving flight safety information before
            passengers board the aircraft. For example: in the departure
            lounge, on tickets.

    (vi)   The most effective method to overcome the pre-learnt
            tendencies, ie. the undoing of seatbelts and the attraction of
            the door of embarkation.

1.3     THE   EFFECTS   OF   FIRE   AND   SMOKE   ON   HUMAN   RESPONSES


The information obtained from accident experience suggests that fire and
smoke are the most serious environmental factors to affect an emergency
evacuation.    In fact, the threat or presence of fire and smoke is
frequently one of the primary reasons for initiating an evacuation an
aircraft.   The Air Canada DC-9 aircraft in-flight fire in June 1983,
developed to such an extent during the eleven minutes which intervened
between discovery of the fire and landing the aircraft at Cincinnati
International Airport, that only the passengers who escaped within one
minute of landing survived.

Equally, otherwise survivable accidents that are followed by postimpact
fire, often result in injury and death.  An example of such an accident
is that of an Convair 340/440 owned by Allegheny Airlines which on June
7, 1971 crashed while making an instrument approach to the Tweed-Few
Haven, Connecticut Airport.  The fire and smoke from the burning houses
and aircraft fuel entered the cabin when the overwing exits were opened.
Only two passengers and the first officer survived the crash and
postcrash fire.

Smoke and     fire may limit the number of exits available, produce toxic
fumes and     induce disorientation and fear.    The effects of a limited
number of     exits, toxic fumes and disorientation are considered below,
while fear    response is examined in the following section of the report.



1.3.1     Limited    Number    of   Exits

If smoke    and fire are outside the aircraft when an     evacuation is
initiated   the number of usable exits is often limited, as cabin staff
are trained not to open an exit which has smoke or fire immediately
outside.     If a member of crew makes an misjudgement vital exits may
remain closed thus reducing the efficiency of egress.    However, if an
exit is opened which is adjacent to a fire allowing it to enter the
cabin this may increase the threat to the passengers.

A limited number of exits, obviously increases the demand on available
escape routes.   Accounts from survivors of accidents such as the British
Airtours Boeing 737 incident at Manchester in August 1985 indicates that
passengers egress over seat-backs and forcibly push themselves towards
exits, only to be confronted with a mass of bodies pushing forward to
the doors.    It was noted that human blockages occured adjacent to the
overwing exit and the vestibule area of the galley on the Boeing 737 at
Manchester.   Such blockages have the potential to dramatically decrease
the efficiency of the evacuation, passengers may be overcome by smoke or
may be trampled by others in the anxiety ridden push towards the exits.
                                  - 13 -


1.3.2   Toxic Fumes

If fire or smoke are present in the cabin and are allowed to persist, be
they external or internal in origin, they create an environment which
impairs breathing and vision and in which passengers can only survive
for a short time.  Fire propagates rapidly through an aircraft producing
large quantities of toxic smoke.  The two agents which are usually cited
as the cause of postcrash fatalities are carbon monoxide and hydrogen
cynacide although other toxic gases have been reported.

The extent of the problem was shown in the Manchester Boeing 737
accident in which the pathological examination of the 54 fatalities,
indicated that apart from 9 passengers who were categorised as "fire
deaths", 83% of the fatalites were deemed to have been incapatitated by
the effects of toxic fumes inhalation (Trimble, 1986).

Although the individual levels of toxic gases found in the smoke from
aircraft fires are not always fatal, combinations of nonfatal levels of
toxic gases can cause fatalities.   In addition, the physical effects of
one toxic agent can influence the effects of another.       For example,
inhalation of hydrogen cynacide causes a person to breathe more rapidly,
which in turn leads to ingestion of greater concentrations of other
toxic gases (National Transportation Safety Board, November 1974).

Certain of the toxic fumes which emulate from cabin fires also have the
potential to influence psychological functioning, which may in turn
effect   the behavioural  responses  of  individuals  in an   emergency
evacuation.



1.3,3   Disorientation

Smoke during an evacuation often leads the aircraft occupants to become
disorientated because it causes the visibility in the cabin to decrease
rapidly.   Smoke generated from aircraft fires is normally dense, black
and toxic.   This smoke reduces cabin visibility in three ways:

    (a) Heat from the fire causes smoke to rise and reduce         or obscure
    lighting which is normally located in the ceiling.

   (b) Smoke   eliminates or   reduces     external light   entering   through
   windows.

   (c) Smoke causes eye irritation which further reduces the occupants'
   ability to see.

The disorientation which is induced by smoke, has a two fold effect on
passengers.   It will increase levels of anxiety which, in combination
with the psychological effects of the chemical agents in the smoke will
reduce their capacity to make appropriate decisions.   Secondly, it may
cause passengers to enter areas of the aircraft from which they are
unable to escape.
                                - 14 -


"In the Air Canada DC-9 accident at Cincinnati one passenger moved past
an open and available exit because the exit was obscured by smoke.    In
another DC-9 accident in December 1972, two passengers headed from the
rear of the aircraft to the forward exits, they went past those exits
and continued onto the flight deck where their bodies were eventually
found" (Butcher, 1987).   The number of these fatalities may be reduced
following the introduction of floor proximity escape path lighting
system, which illuminates the lower part of the cabin where the smoke is
least dense.

As mentioned previously, smoke stratifies according to it's heat and
density, being at it's most extreme near the ceiling of the aircraft.
The training of cabin staff in conditions similar to those which they
may encounter during an severe aircraft fire may be most beneficial.
Equally, passenger responses in such emergencies may be improved via an
educational programme which provides information on the strategies to be
adopted in conditions of smoke and fire, ie. to keep as close to the
floor of the cabin as possible and to protect themselves against the
smoke inhalation by covering their mouths with a piece of damp fabric.
Additional research is also required to examine the effect of obscured
vision on behaviour and identify cues which may increase passenger's
ability to locate available exits quickly.



1.3.4   Summary

Although, the effects of the differing chemical composites within the
smoke have been studied in animals, minimal experimentation has been
undertaken to examine their effects on humans due to the obvious medical
and ethical objections (Phillips, 1978).     Attempts will therefore be
made to tie in the behaviour observed during emergency evacuations with
the effects of fire and smoke in the following section of the report.

1 .4    THE   BEHAVIOUR         OF   PASSENGERS    IN A N   EMERGENCY   EVACUATION



1.4.1      The   Need     for    a Classifactory      System    of   Behaviour

Several methods have been ultilised to describe the behaviour of
individuals in high stress situations.       These have included 'non-
adaptative/adaptative'      (Mintz,     1951),     'rational/irrational'
(Quarantelli, 1957), and as suggested by Lazarus (1966) that when a
threat is perceived, the person may strengthen.his resources, attack the
threat, avoid it or remain inactive.

One of the problems with the adaptive/non-adaptive classification is
that it is equally possible to define specific behaviours observed
during emergency evacuations as adaptive or non-adaptive.   For instance
a behaviour which is considered to be adaptive in one emergency
evacuation situation may well be less successful in another and thus be
non-adaptive, for example: if a passenger spent a considerable amount of
time successfully opening a jammed exit, the behaviour may be considered
to be adaptive; whereas given the same environmental cues but a reduced
time for evacuation the same behaviour would be labeled 'non-adaptive1
if the passenger did not survive (Johnson, 1971).

Equally,  behaviours may also be classified as either rational or
irrational,  however,  ascribing rationality to a behaviour is      only
possible when all the premisees on which the individual   acts are known
and the process to achieve the deductions are analsyed for faultiness.
This is an extremely difficult situation to achieve as the observers are
usually untrained and are involved in an unexpected and physically
stressful situation.    Therefore, one should not accept as reliable,
information from other participants in the disaster.

Lazarus (1966) suggested that the gross motor behaviour of others and
one's self could be ultilised as a reliable indication of behaviour, as
fewer inferences are necessary.   Any behaviour may be categorised after
the threat is perceived, as a strengthening of resources, an attack or
an avoidance of the threat or the individual may remain inactive.    For
example: in a aircraft inflight fire an individual may :-

       (a) strengthen his resources - by      increasing the base of his
           knowledge of emergency procedures via the pre-flight briefing,
           thus making him better to cope in an accident.

       (b) attack   the    threat - the     individual may try to       extinguish the
           fire.

       (c) avoid the threat - the individual may engage in a behaviour
           which prevent contact with the fire or the area associated with
           the fire
                                - 16 -


Although this schema makes it possible to categorise behaviour during an
aircraft   accident,  the  relability  of  classification  may  well  be
questioned.   The untrained observer or participant must retrospectively
categorise behaviour, which may therefore be subject to disortion both
due to the time lag and the individual's selective inattention to some
aspects of behaviour that may have been unacceptable to him.    Equally,
an individual may include behaviours which actually did not occur, a
response which is not a vindictive act but occurs when the participant
actually believes he observered a particular mode of behaviour.



1.4.2     Classification of Behaviour

In view of the problems which are associated with the classificatory
systems which have previously been adopted in the analysis of behaviour
during high stress situations, no actual classificatory system has been
ultilised in this report.  As it is essential that clarity is maintained
in a document of this nature,       a number of differing behavioural
responses to an emergency evacuation will be considered, these being :
Fear-Flight, Panic, Behavioural Inaction and Affiliative Behavioural.

Hopefully,  in the future psychologists in conjunction with accident
investigators will have the opportunity to conduct extensive research
into the differing behavioural     responses and thus develop a more
comprehensive classificatory system.    This situation would enable the
examination of the more subtle distinctions between passengers rather
than the gross categories which have been considered in this document.



1.4.2.1   Fear-Flight

Fear   is  the   dominant and  appropriate  response when survival  is
threatened,   in situations such as an emergency onboard an aircraft.
Anxiety and it's physical concomitants are familiar - racing heart and
dry mouth, tightness inside and tenseness of muscle.

The earliest   psychological  investigations  of   fear, identified two
responses that of flight and fight.         It is quite unlikely that
passengers would respond to an emergency onboard an aircraft by
attacking the agent of harm.  Obviously the response of prime importance
in the case of aircraft passengers is that of flight.

It may be possible to divide fear-flight reactions, into minor and major
flight responses.      Obviously these are   related to the degree of
perceived threat.Behavioural     reaction to a small cabin fire, whose
origins may be in    a toilet or on a seat,   may result flight from the
specific area of the fire.    In comparison, if the threat to passengers
well-being  is more   considerable   the  flight  response may be more
dramatic.
                                   - 17 -


Unlike   victims   of  hurricanes,  tornadoes   or  volcanoes,  aircraft
passengers do not have the opportunity to flee from the immediate
enviroment.   Being trapped within a metal fuselage they must wait until
the aircraft comes to a halt and the exits are open before they have the
opportunity to escape.

Many passengers, including those on the British Airtours Boeing 737 at
Manchester in August 1985, disregard the advice of cabin staff and
attempt to egress before the plane comes to rest. LeRoy (1967) quoted
an aircraft accident in which "The foreward passenger entry door on the
left was supposed to opened by the 'A' stewardess who sitting on the
jump seat right by the door.    When the. aircraft stopped sliding on the
ground, Stewardess 'A' attempted to get out of her seat to open the door
but was overwhelmed by six to eight men crowding the entry way.       She
could not reach the door handle".

It is hardly surprising that the motivation to         leave the cabin
environment is greatest in the presence of smoke and fire or when the
atitude of the aircraft is abnormal.  In cases where the reason for the
instigation of a emergency evacuation is not visible to the passengers,
egress is more leisurely and the cabin staff may be required to adopt an
aggressive stance to ensure that the urgency of the situation is
apparent.

Like the panic category, the fear-flight classification of response to
an  emergency   evacuation situation may    be regarded  as  avoidance
behaviour, in Lazarus's classificatory system.



1.4.2.2   Panic

The concept of panic is a powerful one.           According to the scenario
people threatened by entrapment compete with each other for limited
access to an escape route.      Entrapment is defined as a situation in
which there is (i) an impending physical threat to the lives of a number
of people situated in the same physical situation and (ii) access to an
escape route is diminishing rapidly (Schultz, 1964).         The behaviour is
characterised   by  self-preservation    at   all   costs   and   "irrational"
animalisitic behaviour,   involving the breakdown of group ties            (ie.
"nonsocial"   behaviour:   ignoring   of    group    members;   or   "asocial"
behaviour: kicking, trampling) (Sime, 1985).

The  term panic   has been    used to a significant     extent  in both
retrospective and anticipatory contexts.    Panic has been ultilised to
describe behaviour in newspaper accounts and the statements of survivors
describing the behaviour of others in high stress situations.       Such
extensive use has lead to a situation in which individuals anticipate
that will they act accordingly in a disaster and will also expect others
to respond in a corresponding manner.   This perception is reinforced by
literature and procedures which address safety by just stating "Do Hot
Panic".
                                    -   18 -


However,  evidence from the analysis of behavioural responses after
earthquakes,  tornadoes, mine explosions,   hotel fires and industrial
explosions in the 1950's infered that panic as response was not as
widespread as one might have been lead to believe (Quarantelli, 1954).
The cramped conditions and unfamiliar environment may lead one to
believe that a considerable amount of panic may ensue, especially if
fire and smoke are present; elememts which may propagate rapidly to
reduce visibility and impair breathing.    However, the little research
which has been undertaken into the analysis of passenger behaviour
during aircraft accidents indicated that such a behavioural response was
rare.

Robson (1973) in his study of cabin staff's perceptions of passenger
behaviour during an emergency evacuation indicated that less than one
percent of passengers displayed responses akin to uncontrollable panic.
Equally, Snow et al (1970) suggested that the incidence of panic could
be related to the severity of the accident, ie. a correlation with the
more   objective  assessments  of  the  intensity  of  the  thermotoxic
environment.   According to descriptive evidence, in the accident which
was classified as the least severe of the three which were investigated
by this team, no passengers indicated that there had been panic.     In
fact in 5 statements it was noted that panic had not been present.
Whereas in the assessment of an accident which involved considerable
fire within the cabin interior and culminated with an explosion, 11 of
the 29 survivors stated panic was present compared to only 2 (6.9%) who
stated that it did not occur.

Despite such evidence, it would be inconceivable to dismiss panic as an.
unimportant issue in the consideration of the behaviour of passengers in
emergency evacuations,   It is therefore vital that the assumptions and
notions underlying the concept of panic are examined.

Quarantelli (1954) delineates several types of panic behaviour including
emergent,  preciptious   group  panic,   and    individual   panic.    The
differentiation   is  based  on  the   presence    or  absence   of social
interaction as a vital mechanism in the appearance of panic behaviour.

        (a) Preciptious Panic

        This reaction typically originates in sudden crisis situations, in
        that a relatively ambiguous event is interpreted by some as highly
        dangerous.  While the inital definition of the situation, portends
        to  danger,   it  is  not  decisive  in   initiating  action.    The
        individuals are affected by fear and become highly sensitised to
        the enviroment - notably the actions of others around them, if some
        start to run others respond likewise.      The individual starts to
        interpret the behaviour of others as confirmation of his belief
        that the situation is dangerous.    Social interaction therefore is
        usually perceptual rather than at a verbal level (Johnson, 1971).
                                - 19 -


   A   number  of   evacuation incidents  may   be  ultilised   as  an
   illustration of the preciptious panic interpretation of passenger
   behaviour.   For example : an unwarranted emergency evacuation was
   initiated during taxiing when the flames erupted from the APU of an
   Trans World Airlines Boeing 737 at Chicago O'Hare International
   Airport on April 1, 1971.   The flames were noticed by passengers
   and their fears were then substantiated when a flight attendant
   supervisor, who was not wearing a uniform, initiated an evacuation.
   The cockpit crew only became aware of the evacuation, when the aft
   door warning light illuminated, by which time four passengers had
   sustained serious injuries as a result of the evacuation and eight
   others sustained minor injuries.


    (b) Emergent Panic

   Unlike preciptious panic, emergent panic origins are intensive
   verbal   interaction by a number     of socially disorganised but
   contiguous individuals.     Through interaction,    the participants
   mutually support one another's definition of a progressive crisis
   situation as involving real danger.     It is conceivable that this
   type of panic may occur in a situation in which an aircraft
   malfunction   occurs  in  flight   and   little,  ambiguous,  or  no
   information from the crew is given.    Although obvious overt escape
   behaviour would only be possible once the aircraft had landed.    It
   is possible, however, that if the danger within the aircraft was
   localised, such as a toilet or galley fire, panic behaviour may
   occur in that escape from the particular area is achieved.



    (c) Individual Panic

   It is unlikely that individual panic would occur during emergency
   evacuations, as such panic behaviour is manifested when individuals
   are isolated from others either perceptually or physically.     The
   behaviour is defined as simultaneous but generally short-lived by
   socially isolated persons who independently and initially define an
   instantaneous or sudden crisis situation in such a way as to come
   totally under the control of the danger object (Quarantelli, 1954).
   From the first the crisis is defined as extremely dangerous.    The
   acute consciousness of fear results solely from the individual
   suddenly perceiving an imminent threat to personal survival.    The
   verbal or overt behaviour of others does not define the situation
   to the individual.   The threat is initially so attention-getting
   and focusing that it blocks out any conscious responsiveness to
   what others are doing (Johnson, 1971)


What is clear is that the panic paticipant always defines the situation
as highly dangerous, in both personal and physical terms, in that there
is a direct threat to survival.
                                   - 20 -


Additionally, the participant sees the threat as very immediate with
survival being dependent on rapid response, ie. he knows he is afraid
for his own physical safety and is also conscious of what he is afraid
of.   Panic therefore generally ceases when the individual leaves the
area designated to be dangerous.

The danger, by definition, must always be in the future with attention
never directed towards past danger.  For example: a number of passengers
may return to the aircraft having made their escape to retreive personal
items.    Consequently,  cognitive assessment is not lacking,    as the
individual has defined the situation although it may not be considered
by others to be highly rational.

An issue which is quite commonly overlooked is that panic is sometimes
imposed as an interpretation of a pattern of behaviour.         If the
behaviour of other people during escape conflicts with the individual
(ie. reduces his chances of    escape),  he may   consider them to be
panicking.   Yet the individuals to whom he attributes panic may be as
unlikely to consider that they, themselves, were behaving irrationally
as he would himself.   Equally, behavioural cues such as screaming may
not be indicative of panic but may be a person's yelling commands or
crying for help.

The   concept     of panic   has   come  under   increasing  scrunity    from
psychologists from the University of Surrey and Portsmouth Polytechnic
in their studies of human behaviour in fire (Canter, 1980; Sime, 1985).
Behaviour is    seen,      by them, as a reflection       of an individuals appraisal
of any given circumstance, thus any explanation of behaviour in any high
stress    situation    must   take   account   of   people's   own    personal
interpretation     of what it is like to try to escape in circumstances in
which time is limited and people are unfamiliar with an alternative
escape route (Sime, 1985).

Turner and Killian (1957) state that "When people, attempting to escape
from a burning building pile up at a single exit, their behaviour
appears highly irrational to someone who learns after the panic that
other exits were available.   To the individual in the situation who does
not recognise the existence of these alternative, attempting to fight
his way to the only exit available may seem a very logical choice as
opposed to burning to death".

Such an interpretation may be applied to observed behaviour during an
emergency evacuation.   Lack of familiarity the location of exits in
association with the cramped conditions within the cabin may lead to
blockages at certain exits, particularly in the presence of smoke when
the visibility is reduced to such an extent that alternative exits are
not observed.

The "optimum" egress of passengers is only possible therefore when
individuals believe that there is sufficient time available for all
passengers to leave the plane, and can view alternative means of escape.
This characterises an aircraft in normal use, not a situation in which
there is a serious threat to people's safety.
                                 - 21 -


In an emergency situation, lack of information about alternative escape
routes is sometimes a major determinant of the behaviour which will
severely reduce egress rates from the aircraft.  Such behaviour can lead
to the creation of human blockages at bulkheads and exits (Trimble,
1986).   Thus the announcements during an actual emergency which are
solely reliant   on "Do Hot Panic"     statements would appear to be
inappropriate and probably are ineffective.        Highly motivated and
aroused passengers who perceive they are in obvious and immendiate
danger need clear and precise instructions which will allow them to
evaluate which course of action will increase their chances of survival.

Additionally,  the public must be made aware that      it is a false
expectation that the majority of people in a disaster situation will
always panic.   They should be told how, when faced with circumstances
like aircraft accidents, they should decide on the most appropriate
course of action.



1.4.2.3   Behavioural Inaction

Behavioural inaction is classified as a stunned and bewildered response
to a disaster situation, a pattern of behaviour which has also been
referred to as 'freezing' or 'negative panic'.       Individuals display
behaviour which is described as dazed or immobile, and which consquently
is totally inapprporiate in an aircraft emergency as the person does
little or nothing to escape from, or resist, the threatening situation.

Evidence seems to indicate that this mode of response is more likely to
occur than panic in a high stress situation.      Allerton (1964) in his
behavoural analysis of four disasters reported that 10 to 25% of people
behaved in a "confused,     anxiety-ridden,  somewhat   immobile manner".
Equally Dill (1954) noted a relatively high incidence of inaction and a
low incidence of panic in a number of disaster situations.

Behavioural  inaction has also    been observed   in passengers during
aircraft emergencies; a pertinent example, although not totally relevant
to the present study, is that of an ditching near San Juan, Puerto Rico
on April 11, 1952 which was reported by Paullin (1963), in which all 52
passengers went down with the aircraft.

    "Passengers had not been briefed on location or use of life
    vests and were not told when ditching was about to occur.
    After the airplane was on the water, cabin attendants shouted
    to the passengers the location and told them to put on the
    vests.  The second officer brought a life raft into the cabin
    and launched it through the forward overwing exit.      ...The
    Captain went to the main cabin door, ordered passengers to
    abandon ship but he received little response.        He and a
    passenger opened the door, and he began forcibly evacuating
    passengers.   A wave slammed the door shut.       The Captain
    pushed the door open but as he did so, another wave pushed it
    violently outward throwing him into the sea from which he
    could not return".
                                 - 22 -


Other examples of behavioural inaction have also been observed during
emergency evacuation situations.    A number of passengers onboard the
taxiing Boeing 747 which was in collision with another 747 at Teneriffe
in March 1977, were judged by their fellow passengers to make no
atttempt to escape from the burning aircraft.    One passenger noted that
the majority of the passengers in the mid-section of the plane were
behaviourally inactive, passengers who the survivors suggested could
have escaped if they had simply moved from their seats to the available
exits.  Survivors of this incident also stated that they had experienced
this phenomenon but overcame it, by commanding themselves or being
ordered by others to escape.     Equally, fatalities of the Boeing 737
accident at Manchester Airport in August 1985 and the DC-9 at Cincinnati
in June 1983, were located in seats which had been allocated to them
before take-off.   Some of which were closer to the exits and further
from the fire than others who escaped.      Of the Cincinnati fatalities,
two were found sitting with their seat belts fastened, although both
were sitting at a considerable distance from the source of the smoke and
toxic fumes.  Such individuals must have remained inactive to a point at
which they were overcome by smoke and fire.

Even short periods of inactivity,      like those experienced by some
passengers on the Boeing 747 at Teneriffe, are deemed as unacceptable by
accident investigators.   This is especially true in evacuations which
take place in the presence of fire, due to the large quantities of toxic
fumes which are propagated in a cabin fire.         The amount of time
available for egress in such situations may therefore be as little as
one minute.  One accident report shows that the survivors of an aircraft
accident were only those who evacuated in the first 30 seconds post
impact (Carroll, 1968).

Behavioural inaction as a response to an aircraft accident is hardly
surprising.  Passengers may be forced to perform extremely complex and
difficult tasks which are for the most part novel.       Such tasks may
include the location and operation of emergency exits, in an environment
which may be physically threatening and confusing, due to smoke, fire,
structural impact damage and the behaviour of fellow passengers and
crew.

The conclusions of most 'natural' research into disasters indicate that
the  most   common  undesirable  behaviour   is  immobility  or  inaction
(Quarantelli, 1954; Dill 1954).     Despite this situation, behavioural
inaction has received little experimental attention to determine why
when an individual perceives a threat to his physical being he performs
little or no motor behaviour.   The lack of research is probably a result
of the inherent nature of the subject matter, guidelines relating to the
use of humans in experimentation deny placing subjects in high stress
situations which would be equivalent to that of an aircraft accident.
Additionally, little data is available from those individuals who have
displayed a inactive response in high stress situations, as they are the
very ones who do not survive.
                                 - 23 -


Johnson   (1970)  conducted an laboratory based study of behavioural
inaction, in which he assumed that inaction in emergency evacuation
situations was a reflection of the anxiety which is associated the
confusing environment.    In this situation, passengers not only need to
perform novel responses quickly and effectively but they must be carried
out in the knowledge that any incorrect or slow action may result in
painful consequences.    The experimental design was such that electric
shocks and delayed auditory feedback, ie. what the subject said was
broadcast back after a 0. 19 second delay, were ultilised alone and in
combination.     Thus the effect of physical threat and confusion on
performance of a novel task could be determined.    The results indicated
that neither electric shock or delayed auditory feedback (singly or in
combination) had a significant effect on the incidence of inaction.    In
this situation, inaction was judged to have occured if 30 seconds or
more passed without any gross motor movements.     It should be noted at
this juncture that today this project would not be ethically acceptable,
due to the incorporation of electric shocks into the experimental
design.   The minimal experimental evidence available therefore suggests
that the lack of adequate knowledge regarding of which the behaviours to
perform is the major determinant of behavioural inaction, rather than
the presence of physical threat or the existence of external confusion.

The reports of responses by members of cabin staff in emergencies do not
seem to include instances of behavioural inaction.       Their positive
reactions must be a reflection of the high degree of training they
receive.    The implication of such findings indicates the need for
procedures which can be clearly described by the cabin staff and thus
can be understood by all passengers.

Having   discussed   the   overt   features  of   behavioural   inaction,
consideration will now be given to the covert or underlying cognitive
states which lead individuals to respond in high stress situations in
this characteristic way.     The cognitive states which are thought to
manifest themselves via inaction are "conflict of impulses" and "no
impulse for action", these were put forward by Lazarus in 1966.

(i)   Impulse conflict

When an individual appraises a threat or agent of harm as overpowering,
he may believe that it can only be dealt with by avoidance.       Thus he
will respond by escaping from the immediate vicinity of the threat.
Behaviour   is  inhibited,  it   is  suggested,   when  the   situational
constraints which are associated with avoidance or escape, equal or
exceed the strength of the original threat.    One may suppose that if a
passenger is forced to leave a loved one who was unable to evacuate due
to injuries sustained on impact,     behaviour may be inhibited as to
survive without that person may be less bearable than facing death.

The likelihood of such conflicts existing in disaster situations is
unknown and little attention has been paid to this hypothetical cognitve
state as the "no action impulse" interpretation of behavioural inaction
was perceived by psychologists to be a more intrinsically viable
explanation.
                                   - 24 -


(ii)     Ho action impulse

Lazarus in his book "Psychological Stress and the Coping Process" (1966)
suggests that one of three conditions may lead to an individual taking
no behavioural action after a threat has been identified.           These
conditions are   (a) When the individual is totally resigned to the
conclusion that there is no way of preventing the harm,       (b) When a
successful defensive reappraisal is made, and a second conclusion is
introduced that no danger 'really' exists, or (c) When a person may not
know which action he should take.     Each of these conditions will be
dealt with independently.

       (a) Resignation

       If harm cannot be prevented or avoided it is not unnatural to
       assume that an individual would remain inactive with no impulse to
       either escape from the situation or attack the agent of harm.    At
       present no experimental data is available to substantiate this
       proposition, although observational data from aircraft accidents
       suggests that resignation may be an important and reoccuring factor
       in the occurence of behavioural inaction.

       One of the survivors of the two Boeing 747 crash at Teneriffe in
       1973 stated that she remembered thinking "This is it".      She was
       convinced she was going to die and yet had no thought of escaping.
       It was only after her husband shouted at her to follow him she was
       impelled to act.     Another lady recounted that after the planes
       collided she sat for several moments quite immobilised.         She
       remembered thinking "This is the way it feels to die in an airplane
       accident", then suddenly the thought came to her that she had to
       get out of the plane.


       (b) Defensive Reappraisal

       Behavioural  inaction  may   also  occur  when  a  person makes a
       successful defensive reappraisal that no danger exists.   A defense
       is a psychological manoeuver in which the individual deceives
       himself about the actual conditions of threat.      If an appraisal
       results in the reduction or elimination of the threat, however
       temporarily, it is in actuality a reappraisal of a once-threatening
       stimulus configuration (Johnson, 1971).


       (c) Response uncertainty

       Perhaps the most plausible explanation of behavioural     inaction
       during high stress is that of response uncertainty, ie.   a person
       may not know which action he should take.
                                  - 25 -


    In a laboratory assessment of behavioural inaction, Johnson (1970)
    concluded that the reason subjects gave for not responding was that
    they did not know the correct action of take.  It is  quite feasible
    to suggest   that  in actual emergency situations,      the lack of
    direction and information regarding the accessibility of doors, the
    disorientating influence of smoke together with it's physiological
    and psychological effects on        agility and reasoning, and anxiety
    about  travelling  companions act  in combination to reduce an
    individual's ability to make rational decisions regarding the type
    of action he should be taking at a time when speed is of the
    essence,



To summarise, behavioural inaction is perhaps a more common behavioural
reponse to a high stress situation than is currently recognised.     In
circumstances such as aircraft accidents, it can reduce the chance of
survival  significantly  as   the  inactive  individual may  experience
conflicting impulses, ie. whether to escape or remain.   Perhaps a more
plausible explanation is that he may manifest no desire to escape as a
result of resignation, reappraisal or uncertainty.

Behavioural inaction is not only a behaviour which may reduce an
individual's chances of survival, but those inactive passengers may
impede other passenger's egress by blocking routes to aisles, thus
reducing the chance of survival,

Johnson stated in 1971 that "The phenonmenon of behavioural inaction is
important for those involved in aircraft emergency procedures.    Ho major
effort has been devoted to the elimination of the phenomenon; indeed
little has been written on the subject except to note i t ’s occurence in
stress situations.   Little experimentation has been found which is aimed
primarily at determining what precedes or causes inaction, under what
condition it occurs, who is likely to manifest it, or how it can be
controlled".   Sixteen years later this statement still holds true and
the   improvement  in   knowledge   which  has  occured   regarding   this
behavioural response is minimal.      Research is therefore required to
allievate this situation and perhaps lead to the introduction of
procedures and stategies which will combat the occurence of responses in
passengers during emergency evacuations.



1.4.2.4   Affiliative Behaviour

According to the afore mentioned panic scenario, people threatened by
entrapment compete with each other for limited access to an escape
route.   However, more recent research concerned with the behaviour of
people in building fires suggest that escape behaviour is characterised
by movement towards the familiar, ie. the direction of movement will be
related not only to the location of the threat but also to the location
and degree of familiarity of the individual with attachment objects (ie.
person and place affiliation)   (Sime, 1985).   Researchers now believe
that this sort of response is indicative of much behaviour in disaster
situations.
                                 - 26 -


In the investigation of the escape routes taken by the survivors of a
fatal fire which occured at the Summerland holiday complex in August
1973, the most influential factors in the determination of movement were
deemed to be a combination of the person's role (ie. patron or employee
and by definition, familiarity with escape route), affiliative ties to
individuals located elsewhere in the building and proximity to exits.

The results provided no evidence of the usually expected panic scenario,
nor was there a consensus of decision to leave by one exit.    Employees
were shown to have ultilised the fire exits to a significant extent,
while the patrons used the entrances, displaying a    tendency to leave
via the door of entry (72%) although the proximity of alternative exits
did to some extent over ride this tendency.

Individuals within groups were also shown to delay their escape until
all members were present, thus jeopardising their chance of successful
egress.   However, individuals who were separated from their group or
family members moved towards the familiar, ie. the door of   entry and
disregarded the exits which were closer at hand.

This model of affiliative behaviour has not been applied to the aircraft
accident situation, although the examination of passenger statements
does indicate that such behaviour is present.     Evidence suggests that
individuals are attracted towards the door of embarkation.  LeRoy (1967)
stated that in one accident, only one passenger ever went back more than
one row behind the last row that was passed during boarding.   Obviously
this attraction will be mediated by the location and intensity of fire,
if present, and the proximity to alternative exits.

Groups of passengers, be they socially or emotionally tied usually are
placed in adajacent seating on the aircraft, thus movement towards the
familiar in terms of people will be minimal.   However, escape behaviour
displayed by passengers does indicate that attachment has survival
value, in that individuals tend to act in an altruistic manner ensuring
the safety of family and friends.     The reports of such behaviour are
frequently  found   within  the  reconstructions   of events   given  by
passengers. Below is a portion of a statement given by a passenger after
the British Airtours Boeing 737 crash at Manchester in August 1985.   It
indicates to what lengths some individuals may go to guarantee the
safety of those to which they are emotionally attached.

   "I got across the aisle to Ann and got her seat belt off and
   dragged her out of her seat.        She said "Vhat about my
   handbag?". I told her to leave it.    It only took me a matter
   of seconds to get Ann out of her seat and onto her feet.
   ...I grabbed hold of Ann's right arm in my left hand and
   pushed her in front of me and started to push her along the
   aisle towards the front of the plane.     Obviously there were
   other people in the aisle in front of us as I was pushing her
   along, I was using my right hand to reach out and touch seats
   as we went past them whilst counting down so I could roughly
   guess whereabouts we were in the plane.
                                 - 27 -


    ... I then tripped, I think it was a body on the floor of the
    aisle.   As I tripped I gave Ann a push forward intending to
    get her nearer to the exit, I thought with the push and the
    momentum of the people bheind me that would be sufficient to
    get her to the exit."

    Although the gentlemen   survived   the   accident,   the   lady   in
    question did not.



Altruistic behaviour, however, is only orientated towards those with
whom the individuals are emotionally or socially attached. In the three
accidents analysed by Snow et al (1970) only one passenger mentioned
that  they  were   helped  in their   egress by a previously    unknown
individual.    Additionally in statements given by survivors of the
British Airtours Boeing 737 crash at Manchester none mentioned being
aided by strangers (Trimble, 1986).

Pre-flight   briefings may   nullify  the  attraction of  the  door  of
embarkation for passengers.     However,  it would be inconceivable to
suggest that passenger's behaviour should be totally orientated towards
self-preservation, disregarding family and friends who are less able to
make an appropriate behavioural response.

It has long been noted that passengers do have a possibly dangerous
tendency to take their hand luggage with them or return to the aircraft
in an emergency situation.   The model of affiliative behaviour may well
be applied to this sort of response.      The perceived value of items
contained within hand luggage, such as passports, credit cards, currency
and keys to house and car, may outweigh the danger or the reduced rate
of egress which passengers believe they may encounter if they take their
luggage with them.  Although pre-flight briefing state that luggage must
be left on the aircraft, this may not infact instill in passengers the
risk that they run when trying to escape with hand luggage.    There may
be a need for an educational programme which identifies hand luggage as
factor which reduces the rate of egress from aircraft.

Further analysis and research is required into the exent to which
affiliative behaviour, towards both animate and inanimate objects, is
displayed during emergency evacuations. Following this, action must be
taken to reduce the impact of inappropriate affiliative behaviour on
emergency evacautions.

1.5     FACTORS    INFLUENCING  THE  BEHAVIOUR        OF   SUBGROUPS   OF
                             PASSENGERS



An individual's behaviour is a reflection of an their appraisal of each
situation.   This appraisal is influenced by many factors, including past
experience, biological and physical makeup and cultural background, all
of  which   may  act   in  combination  to determine   each  individual's
perception of the most appropriate action to take in any situation.

It is hardly surprising therefore that subgroups within the population
respond in differing ways when faced with a life-threatening event.
As a result of ineffectual or inappropriate responses to the situation,
a differential exists in survival rates between subgroups.   The factors
which are thought to be most pertinent to passenger behaviour in an
aircraft   accident   are   :   Demographic,  Cultural   and   Cognitive
Differentials, and the Influence of Alcohol.



1.5.1   Demographic   Differentials

In general, aging leads to a reduction in agility and strength, together
with slowed reflexes.     As a person becomes older the retention of
information becomes more difficult and quite often decisions cannot be
made without hestitation.   These factors, which act in combination, may
place  the  older passenger at a disadvantage during an emergency
evacuation.   It has also be noted that the majority of elderly people
travel less frequently than the young, and thus are less experienced air
passengers.

It is therefore hardly surprising that the elderly, along with children,
exhibited higher mortality rates in three accidents which occured in the
I960's.   Older adults (ie. those over 55) were identified to have a
statistically poorer chance of survival in the two accidents, Salt Lake
City and Rome, where speed, strength and agility would be expected to
play a dominant role in reaching an exit (Snow et al, 1970).      At the
present time, information is not available to suggest whether these age
related  trends are specific to these accidents or can be generalised to
all aircraft accidents.

In addition, to the psychological and physiological impairments which
occur during aging, research is also available to suggest that the
elderly and the young are particularly vulnerable to the physiological
effects of toxic fumes which emulate from a cabin fire.  Fumes which can
lead to confusion and thus to ineffective behaviour and sometimes death.

Children, quite naturally, may also be considered more susceptible to
death during   an aircraft   accident   because of their physical    and
emotional immaturity as well as their lack of air travel experience.  In
the three accidents considered by Snow et al (1970), 17 out of the 24
children died (66%) . Of the survivors, all were aboard the DC-8 which
crashed at Denver in July 1961, an accident which was classified to be
the least severe of the accidents considered,
                                 - 29 -


Evidence is available from fire research which suggests that, in the
face of danger, children respond with behaviour which is inappropriate,
for example: hiding under beds and in cupboards (Canter, Breaux and
Sime, 1978).  It is therefore not impossible to believe that children in
aircraft accident may lie between the seat rows, eventually succumbing
to the effects of smoke and fire.    More importantly, children may also
not have the physical stength which is necessary to maintain their
position within a queue to an exit, and thus may be overcome by the mass
of weight pushing towards a door.

Children being trampled by unsuscepting passengers in their anxiety to
egress is not uncommon and an example of such behaviour was observed in
the British Airtours Boeing 737 accident which occured in August 1985,
one female passenger noted :

        "Vhilst I was tring to get to the door I was aware of a
        woman stood ahead of me who was holding onto the doorway
        with one hand and was desperately holding onto a young
        girl with  her other hand, trying to pull the yound girl
        towards the door.   The woman shouted to the yound girl by
        name several times.    After seconds or so the young girl
        lost her balance and fell into the crowd."

        The young girl did not survive the   accident.

As with the young girl mentioned above, the majority of children travel
with their parents.    It may therefore be permissable to discuss the
influence  of parental   status  on behaviour and survival.      It is
conceivable that mothers and fathers may place their own lives in
jeopardy in order to help their children escape.    The results of the
analysis indicated that parental status had only a small effect on the
levels of mortality (Snow et al, 1970).

The sex of the passenger, however, was shown by Snow et al (1970) to
play a significant role in the determination of appropriate behavioural
response.    Among the 261 passengers of the three accidents, there were
90 adult females and 147 adult males, the fatality rates indicated that
34% of males and 46.7% of females were killed.      Such an differential
could be attributed to the size disadvantage which exists between the
sexes.    Size along with its correlates in both absolute and relative
strength,   would be expected to operate strongly against females in
evacuation in which active competition for exits occurs.     In addition,
there may be other less obvious disadvantages, such as experience and
differences in clothing, which may restrict movement.      Although less
evidence    is  available,  there  may  be  deeper-seated psychological,
physiological    and cultural  factors which might    also condition the
responses made by females in disasters.
                                  - 30 -


However,   this situation  was  reversed  in the   DC-9  evacuation  at
Cincinnati, in which 60% were female passengers survived compared to
only 39% of the male passengers.    This differential was explained in
part, by the fact that two of the female passengers were sitting next
to, and escaped with able-bodied men who had been instructed to open
overwing exits.  Alcohol consumption also may have been a factor in the
larger percentage of male fatalities (Barthelmess, 1984) (see section
1.5.3).

This section of the report has relied heavily 'on statistics which relate
to those who died in several aircraft accidents, as at present no
information is available which relates to the differing behavioural
responses of the sexes and age groupings in emergency evacuation
situations.   Reliance on such statistics leads one to the assumption
that those who die during their attempts to escape, respond in an
ineffective or inappropriate manner.    However, it is not possible to
extrapolate and thus give details of patterns of behaviour,

Further research is therefore required to establish whether age, sex and
family status do influence behaviour during evacuations.      If this is
found to be the case it would therefore be necessary to determine how
demographically differing groups within the population act when faced
with a life threatening situation, and which factors influence these
responses ie, are they physiologically or psychologically based,



1.5.2.    Cultural   Differentials

The  nationality   and  cultural    origins   of  individuals   can  have  a
considerable impact on responses to emergencies,     This may be the result
of differing religious beliefs, the acceptability of certain modes of
behaviour  within   a  culture   or   the   general  demeanour   of  certain
nationalites - consider the differing temperaments of the English,
Italians and those originating from South East Asia.          Differences in
behaviour will also be reflected in the responses of the cabin staff of
national airlines.

Past  experience   and  knowledge  plays  a  significant   role  in  the
determination of responses to disasters, factors which may differ as a
consequence of   the cultural background of an individual, this however
will be dealt with in the following section        (Re:  1.5.3 Cognitive
Differentials),

At present the information which is available regarding the cultural
differentials in response to emergency situations,    is not directly
applicable to  air transport accidents,  Consideration of the data is
still viable although the validity of the research findings may be
questioned in relation to the behaviour of passengers in an emergency
evacution situation.
                                  - 31 -


Perry et al (1982) in their study of "The Role of Ethnicity in the
Emergency   Decision-Making Process",   indicated  that   minority group
members, ie. Mexican and Negroes, appeared to be less likely to engage
in evacuation and tended to assess risk as lower and place less faith in
warnings of natural disasters than whites.    This implies that the risk
identification, risk assessment and response-choice process may differ
between racial groupings.

The researchers concluded that the differential between groupings was a
reflection  of   the  disparities   in  cohension   between the  racial
communities and the varying perceptions of the credibility of the
warning.     Ethnicity also appeared to be correlated with locus of
control, ie. the extent to which an individual believes he controls his
own life, and thus the willingness to undertake positive protective
actions in response to warnings.   The Negro and Mexican subgroups were
proved to have viewed disasters as uncontrollable and were         less
confident in their ability to deal with the hazard.

The concept of locus of control may well be a very pertinent one in the
consideration of differing responses to emergency evacuation situations,
especially if it is possible to identify subgroups or nationalities
which believe that events are beyond their influence.  National airlines
would therefore beable to adjust the focus of pre-flight briefings and
strategies during evacuations to cater for differing cognitive makeups.
Equally, the credibility of warnings can similarly be investigated and
improved.



1.5.3     Cognitive   Differentials

For  clarification  purposes   this  section  has  been subdivded,  the
influence of past experience and knowledge is followed by the impact of
cognitve schemas on behaviour in emergency evacuations.

1.5.3,1   Past Experience and Knowledge

There is evidence that experience and knowledge play a significant role
in the ability of individuals to react appropriately in an emergency
situation,   People determine the situational definition of the threat,
via the comparison of prior experience with the current circumstances in
order to decide whether the threat is real.        Such processing will
therefore preceed the behavioural response considered to be the most
appropriate by the individual.     This is shown quite clearly by the
following two accounts of emergency evacuations which were undertaken by
the same member of cabin staff within a period of two months (Sarah
Uzzell, Senior Flight Attendant, Overseas National Airways).

(a)   Loss of a DC-10 at JFK International Airport,   12 November 1975

During takeoff the aircraft experienced what was described by the
National Transportation Safety Board as a massive bird indigestion,
which resulted in an explosion and immediate engine fire.
                                   - 32 -


By the time the aircraft was brought to a stop, the fire had spread
towards the central section of the fuselage.   The mid cabin was filled
with dense,   black and toxic smoke by the time the evacuation was
instigated.   Visibility within the cabin was minimal and the fire and
smoke outside the aircraft limited the number of useable doors to three
of the available eight.

Despite the uncontrollable fire, all 128 passengers and 11 crew escaped
from the plane in less than one minute.   Passengers moved from the mid­
cabin which was rapidly filled with smoke to the fore and aft sections,
a number of passengers aided in the egress of others by assisting at the
top and base of each shutes.        The success of the evacuation was
attributed to the training and the background of the passengers, all of
whom were airline employees.   All passengers therefore had a sufficient
base of knowledge and experience to determine to most effective escape
route and the most appropriate action to take.



(b) Loss of a DC-10 at Istanbul,   Turkey on January 2, 1976

Unlike  the   passengers  in  the   previously  mentioned  account,  the
passengers on board the aircraft were all Turkish Nationals, none of
whom spoke English and ranged in age from 50 to 80,     additionally 90%
had never been on an aircraft before or seen an aircraft interior.

The aircraft hit short of the runway which resulted in a violent impact
consequently an engine caught fire and the left wing sheared off
resulting in    fire in the portion of the wing remaining with the
aircraft.  Despite this the passengers remained calm, since due to their
lack of experience they perceived the landing to be quite normal.

Passengers in the forward cabin were still seated rather placidly with
their belts fastened, they then preceeded to put on coats and gathered
hand-luggage.  No apprehension was shown, and the flight attendants had
great difficulty in motivating the passengers to egress quickly even
with the help of the interpreter.      The passengers also insisted on
taking their luggage with them and hestitated before moving on to the
slide, thereby complicating and slowing the evacuation.       The flight
attendants were eventually forced to push each one out separately, even
when on the ground the Turks refused to move away from the immediate
vicinity of the plane awaiting friends and luggage to arrive.

Even in the mid-section of the plane where there was a direct view of
the fire,   flight attendants had some difficulty in motivating the
passengers.   The interpreter and an experienced passenger helped start
the flow of the passengers to the exit, all of whom took quantities of
carry-on baggage some of which included five gallon jugs of water and
huge bags of rocks and sand.       Some passengers from the aft cabin
attempted to re-enter the fuselage for their personal belongings only to
be forced out by the flight attendants, while other passengers followed
flight attendants back to the plane after they had been directed to an
area of safety.
                                  - 33 -


Ms. Uzzell stated in her paper to the 29th Annual International Air
Safety   Seminar   (1976) that  the  success  of  the  evacuation,    (all
passengers and crew survived without major injury) was due in part to
the speed and efficiency of the airport's fire department.   The account,
however,   demonstrates unequivocally the influence of knowledge and
experience on behaviour during evacuations, and the need for a qualified
flight attendant who is conversant in the language of the passengers.



1.5.3.2   Cognitive Schemas of Escape

Evidence suggests that the "mental mapping" of the cabin ( ie. the
identification of the location of the exits, the number of seat rows and
approximate distances to exits)      prior to evacuation,   may have a
benficial effect on evacuation speed.

Passengers who on embarkation note the position of their seat in
relation to exit and visualise how they would make their escape during
an emergency, report that their egress from the cabin, even in the
presence of dense smoke, was made with greater ease than those who had
no schema.   All of the 23 survivors of the DC-9 evacuation at Cincinnati
in June 1983, indicated that they had mentally rehearsed 'game plan' on
when and how to get out of the aircraft.    The "when" being immediately
and the "how" depended on their seat location with respect to the
closest exit.

          For example: the passenger in seat 10B memorised the
          location and distance of the L2 exit from his seat by
          counting the seat rows and estimating the number of feet.

Although some of the passengers were diverted and or unable to find the
exit which they originally intended to use, there was clear evidence of
pre-planning and the fact that few of the survivors mentioned coming
into physical contact with other passengers indicated that they left
their seat before the majority of their fellow travellers.      If pre­
planning and quick action were major determinants of survival in this
situation, it is not surprising that all of the crew members survived.
Both cockpit and cabin crew members are taught to mentally rehearse
evacuation procedures and to act quickly (Barthelmess, 1984).

The Cincinnati survivor statements are not alone in their indication of
the influence of pre-planning.    One of the last passengers to escape
from the British Airtours Boeing 737 with his life, indicated that he
moved down from row 8 counting the rows by touch, before he tripped and
fell inbetween the seats in what he estimated as row 2.   After loosing
and regaining consciousness he was able to move from this position to
the exit, although he could not recall how he got to it.
                                 - 34 -


Individuals with "mental maps" therefore seemed better able to deal with
a rapidly changing environment in which decisions relating to escape had
to be made quickly and were also capable of changing their planned
escape route, if the most effective route became unuseable.  Research is
needed to authenicate these observations, and if 'mental planning' is
shown to be effective passengers should be informed of the sort of
rehearsal which is deemed to be effective.



1.5.4   The Influence of Alcohol

The number of    ways  in which alcohol    can effect performance are
considerable and have the potential to severely impede an individual's
ability to escape from an aircraft in an emergency.   Barthelmess (1984)
noted that in the DC-9 evacuation at Cincinnati,        four of the 23
fatalities had blood alcohol levels in excess of 0.08 legal intoxication
limit.  (Their blood alcohol levels ranged from 0.095 to 1.99).

Since alcohol impairs psycho-motor control, an intoxicated individual's
actions will be slower and movements maybe careless and disorganised.
Equally a person's ability to perceive rapidly changing events will
diminish and the capability to hear and understand instructions will be
reduced.   Any of these factors will affect the individual's ability to
make the most appropriate response to the situation.

Along with it's effects on motor and cognitive control, alcohol also
affects mood in either an inhibitory or exhibitory manner.    Both may be
equally as damaging to the efficiency of emergency evacuations.     Those
who become relaxed and sleeply will consequently be less able to think
rationally and consequently behave in a manner which may reduce their
escape capabilities.   In certain individuals inhibitions are removed and
affective control is reduced by the effect of alcohol.   This makes these
individuals more likely to scream and display behaviours which may
jeopardise not only their chance of survival but also the survival of
other passengers.    Thus the influence of alcohol on the behaviour of
passengers in any aircraft emergency must be a source of concern.

1.6   CONCLUSION'S AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH


The increasingly popularity of air travel has lead to the initiation of
a variety of research programmes,       the vast majority of which have
centred on the configurational and environmental aspects of emergency
evacuations.      Investigations   have    lead, for   example, to  the
determination of    optimal  seating densities and aisle widths,    and
introduction of fire retardent furnishings.

However, minimal research has been undertaken into the influence of
passenger  behaviour   in  emergency  evacuations,   and  the  types   of
behavioural response which are associated with aircraft accidents.   Such
a situation is hardly surprising, in view of the ethical and logistical
problems which are encountered in the experimental study of behaviour,
in circumstances equivalent to aircraft emergency evacuations.

Accident investigators,  by their very background,     have concentrated
their efforts on determining the cause of each incident and the
structural effects on the airframe.      The unparalleled insight which
passengers have of their behaviour during evacuations has for the most
part been unreported.    There seems to be some justification for the
incorporation within each investigative team of a professional with
highly developed   counselling skills    and a understanding of human
behaviour, who can gain a insight into the responses made by each
passenger during the emergency evacuation.

The factors influencing emergency evacuations were deemed by Snow et al
(1970) to be configurational, procedural, environmental and behavioural.
The conclusions   and recommendations   for  further   research will  be
considered independently for each of these four categories.



1.6.1.   Behavioural

The review of the literature has indicated that the physical and mental
attributes which each individual passenger holds may facilitate or
prevent effective exploitation of the time available for the evacuation.

The various forms of maladaptive behaviour, ie. panic and behavioural
inaction,    which were assumed to be prevalent in emergency evacuations
are not as widespread as one might have been lead to believe.      It is
highly desireable that a realisitc picture is amde available to air
frame   manufacturers,  regulatory bodies,   airlines, cabin staff   and
passengers of the incidence of each type of behaviour, so a suitable
perspective is available.    The public must be made aware of the false
expectation that the majority of passengers panic in an evacuation.
Equally they must be told how when faced with circumstances such as an
aircraft emergency, they should decide on the most appropriate course of
action.
                                    - 36 -


At the present time it is known that the frequency of passengers
exhibiting panic and behavioural inaction increases with deteriorating
conditions,  ie.   reduced visibility,    the increased toxicity of the
atmosphere and a limited number of exits.     A model of the relationship
between conditions and behavioural typologies is required, to establish
a clearer understanding of the the factors which influence responses, in
situations akin to those .experienced during aircraft accidents.

Affiliative behaviour, towards both inanimate and animate objects, has
been shown to be a frequently occuring response during emergency
evacuations.   While altruistic behaviour orientated towards family and
friends should not be disencouraged, attempts should be made to instill
in the travelling public the risk which they run when escaping with hand
luggage, due to the consequent reduction in the rate of egress.

Evidence suggests that subgroups within the population display differing
behavioural responses.    This information is however largely based on
statistics which relate to the number of fatalities between groupings
according to demographic, cultural and cognitve differentials.  Research
is therefore required to identify which groupings are at a higher risk
of responding in an inappropriate manner, and attempts should then be
made to reduce this risk.

The benefits of a cognitive schema of escape, ie. the mental mapping of
escape routes prior to an emergency, should be investigated further.  If
such research authenicates the indications that a schema of escape
enhance   egress,  the  briefing   of  passengers   should   include the
requirement to locate and plan an escape route to the exits.



1.6.2   Procedural

The greater the severity of the accident, the more likely it is that
passengers will find it difficult to establish which is the most
appropriate response.  Research has indicated that with leadership and
appropriate knowledge, the incidence of maladaptive behaviours, such as
panic and behavioural inaction will be reduced.    The fact that  cabin
staff who are highly trained, seldom respond to an emergency evacuation
in an inappropriate manner, emphasises the importance of knowledge and
leadership.

The knowledge which passengers acquire, is largely obtained from the
pre-flight briefing. Although research suggests that the effectiveness
of the pre-flight briefing is not all it might be, to enhance the
facilitation of passenger knowledge, research is required in to the
following:-
    (a) The amount of information which can be reasonably presented for
        reliable recall and understanding.

    (b) The most appropriate period prior to take-off for the effective
        and reliable recall of briefing information,

    (c) The amount   of   warning    period required to   minimise the fear
        response.
                                 -   37   -




    (d) The   positive and negative effects of giving     flight   safety
        information before passengers board the aircraft.

Consideration may also be given to the introduction of a training course
administered either by airlines or regulatory bodies, which would give
the members of the general public a grounding in emergency evacuation
procedures.     By  significantly   increasing the   knowledge  of  some
passengers,   thereby enabling them to facilitate the exit     of other
passengers.    Cabin staff may be able to direct the evacuation more
effectively. Obviously there is no guarantee that there would be fully
instructed passengers on each flight.



1.6.3   Environmental

Aircraft fires, originating from fuel or cabin fitments, are noted to
produce acrid smoke and toxic fumes.    As a consequence, visibility is
reduced and the smoke stratifies.      The training of   cabin staff in
conditions similar to those which maybe encountered in an aircraft fire
would be invaluable.   The experience of working in such an environment
would allow them to develop and practice the behavioural strategies
which could be required in an actual emergency.



1.6.4   Configurational

The considerable research which has been undertaken in this area, has
lead to the introduction of specific dimensions; for example : exits,
aisle widths e tc ..   These "optimal" dimensions, however, have been
identified via evacuation drills in which egress was both rapid and
orderly.   During actual emergency evacuations, certain cabin fitments
and exits have proved to impede passenger egress.  Research is therefore
required in which attempts are made to simulate the competitive element
of behaviour which occurs during emergencies,      when the evacuation
becomes disorderly.  From such a programme these configurational aspects
of the cabin which become potential points of blockage in emergencies
may be investigated.



1.6.5   Conclusion

There would appear to be a number of areas in which investigations could
be undertaken which relate to aircraft emergency evacuations.       Such
research would lead to a greater awareness of the behavioural responses
of passengers to both the provision of pre-flight information and
behaviour in potential emergency situations.   The co-operation and help
from all of the organisations consulted in the course of this literature
review, indicates that there is now a sufficient concern by all parties
to determine that the necessary steps are taken to ensure that air
transport remains one of the safest forms of travel.

2.1   STATISTICS REGARDING THE NUMBER OF EVACUATIONS


The gathering of useful statistics relating to accidents worldwide is a
major task to do this and to fully analyse the results is outside the
scope of this literature review.     The background of such an analysis,
however, is to be found in a recent paper given at a Royal Aeronautical
Society symposium on Passenger Cabin Safety (A.F. Taylor, "Accident
Statistics" RAeS October 1986).       In discussing the accident record
generally and comparing 1985 with averages from 1955 to 1974 and from
1976 to 1985 it was stated that 'apart from accidents involving only a
very few people, most of whom would be crew members, load factor appears
to make little difference to the proportion who fail to escape before
being overcome by fire or its effects' .     This finding was based on a
reasonably large sample     (174 accidents).     Since roughly the same
percentage were killed by the impact in each load factor group, this
result is a little surprising.    It was therefore suggested that 'if we
had a better understanding of the behaviour of survivors in what can be,
for many people,   seriously disorientating conditions (ie. emergency
evacuations often in smoke), we could considerably improve their chances
of safe evacuation without the need for expensive modification to the
aircraft' . In particular the statistics suggest that the behaviour of a
partial load of passengers,     with perhaps between 30% and 50% load
factor, would be of great interest.
                                - 47 -


2.2   ANALYSIS OF WORLDWIDE ACCIDENTS INVOLVING EVACUATIONS


To try to take at least one further step forward as part of this review
the CAA SDAU data base of accidents for the period 1976 to 1986 was
interrogated in September 1986 with respect to emergency evacuations.
The resulting listing excludes those accidents where the fuselage was
badly broken open, where there may therefore have been many deaths due
to the impact and where survivors either exit via the breaks or are
rescued from amongst the debris.  Unfortunately in the time available it
has not been possible to cross check the SDAU list of 90 accidents
against the complete list of survivable accidents but it should be noted
that the total number of survivable accidents for the same period (1976
to mid 1986) was around 1000 of which some 150 were fatal.  That only 90
apparently involved an emergency evacuation clearly needs checking to
establish whether such a small proportion is genuine or whether lack of
firm information has severly curtailed the SDAU list.

Nonetheless any list of accidents involving emergency evacuations is a
useful starting point thus the SDAU list, with additional information
from the 'World Airline Accident Summary', has been used to produce the
table of such accidents in Appendix A.  This, as may be deduced from the
layout, has been recoded for storage on a Cranfield computer in a manner
that enables fairly rapid updating.

From this table it can be observed that 10 of the 90 accidents were
fatal and in 7 of these fire was not only a cause of death but apart
form one single person, was the sole cause of death.  The exceptions are
the 1979 Sumburgh HS 748 accident when 17 people were drowned (an
accident of interest but not strictly relevant to this study), the 1981
Manila B747 where one person is classified as an evacuation fatality and
the 1985 Khartoum A300 accident for which few details are so far
available.

The 7 fatal accidents, which resulted in 112 fire fatalities out of 1016
on board, all involved a cabin fire and to these may be added 7 non
fatal cabin fires involving 521 people.    There were also 38 emergency
evacuations when there was an external fire which apparently did not
penetrate the cabin, thus there was a fire in 54 of the 90 cases listed
and a cabin fire in 14.

Also of relevance to an evacuation is whether or not the undercarrriage
has collapsed or there has been a wheels up landing.

There are 15 accidents involving a wheels up landing of which 6 had all
gear retracted, 5 the nose landing gear up and 4 either the left or the
right main gear up.

None of these resulted in a cabin fire nor in any fatalities, however 6
did involve a fire, made up of 4 of the 'all gear up' and 2 of the 'nose
gear up' accidents.

The principal cause of an emergency evacuation m y be designated in a
variety of ways thus the following table is somewhat arbitrary but does
give an idea of the type of accident included.



   Reason for              Number of                  Comments
   Evacuation              Accidents

                                                 of the 9 a cabin fire

Wheels up landing             15                 6 of which caused a
                                                 fire but none caused a
                                                 cabin fire

Bomb scare                     1

Overrun                        6                 Including 1 off side

Engine failure but
no fire

u/c problem

Total                         90



With such a sample it is not considered appropriate to go into any more
detail as the Manchester B737 accident killed as many as the next three
most severe put together.   It is however worth considering some of the
most severe accidents not on the SDAU list.

Some of those thought to be have involved at least an attempted
emergency evacuation are listed below, if confirmed as relevant to this
subject (ie. fuselage damage not too severe) they will be added to the
data base.   Those with more than half deaths by impact are excluded
automatically as being too severe.

A brief study has also been made of the SDAU listing of occurences to UK
registered aircraft involving an emergency evacuation.   This too covered
the period 1976 to September 1986 and showed there to have been an
average of some 10 evacuations per year for 1976-1978 and 3 per year for
1979 onwards.  Of the total of 57 emergencies to the fixed wing aircraft
of over 5700kg AUM 10 were bomb scares and 36 involved smoke, fire or
some indication of fire.    The remainder were mainly undercarriage or
brake problems some involving departure from the runway.

The five emergencies where the cabin is reported to have filled with
smoke might be worthy of further investigation. These are listed below:

This occurence list again highlights the problems of jammed doors and
inoperative chutes/slides, while these are not directly relevant to this
study such events will undoubtedly affect passenger behaviour and the
conduct of the evacuation.

2.3   THE EFFECTS OF AIRCRAFT FIRE ON THE PRODUCTION OF SMOKE
                        AND TOXIC FUMES


Aviation pathologists   have   recently reported on carboxyhaemoglobin
levels in accident victims for thirty years or more and on hydrogen
cynaide levels for nearly twenty years.    Those of the RAF Institute of
Pathology and Tropical Medicine, IPTM, who report their findings of the
Accident Investigation Branch, AIB, following all UK fatal accidents,
have written particularly detailed reports yet, by their own admission,
they   have  not   always   been   able  to   differentiate  between   an
incapacitating dose and a fatal dose.     This also applies to the many
other products of combustion known to exist but for which in many cases
there are no practicable or reliable tests.       The best and extremely
comprehensive (> 1800 pages and >600 references) study of these and of
many related subjects is by I.R. Hill ('Aerospace Pathology' University
of Cambridge MD Thesis 1984) who lists several dozen products of
combustion and tabulates dose related properties of eighteen.     However
even he admits his list to be far from complete and that the effects of
'some are controversial and others are something of a mystery'.

More recently graphic accounts by survivors of the Manchester B737 in
August 1985 have emphasised the incapacitating effects of large smoke
particles in addition to the choking, narcotic and anaesthetic effects
of the cabin fumes.  This suggests that fire testing of materials should
at least monitor a wide range of products of combustion so that
requirements may be continuously reviewed.

Hill also provides the only recent set of informative summaries of
relevant accidents in which he draws upon the pathologist's or human
factors reports and the witness group reports (including statements from
survivors) as well as the necessarily briefer final accident reports.
In the light of the real emergencies Hill makes the following comment
upon the certification of aircraft with respect to emergency evacuation
: 'The lack of realism in these conditions is instantly apparent.   There
is no smoke, no fire, no one is hysterical, the passengers are in normal
health, they have not been shaken up in a crash and none of them have
been injured.   More realistic tests could be made but there is the ever
present danger of causing injury and this is probably an unacceptable
risk.   Requirements could be made though, which would have a beneficial
long term effect during accidents' . This view is accepted in that more
realism can only be added one bit at a time under carefully controlled
conditions.    Thus there is a requirement for emergency evacuation
research first to introduce an element of competition in order to
establish datum points in clear air and then to explore the effects of
reduced visibility.   Further tests involving the stowage and donning and
subsequent evacuation with smoke hoods should be considered.
2. 4   THE RESPONSES OF THE FIRE SERVICE


No comprehensive review of the response or effectiveness of Airport Fire
Services to aircraft accidents has come to light since that by Easams
(ref: DORA Report 7201) to the CAA in 1972.    However, The International
Civil  Aviation    Organisation, ICAO,  periodically updates   the chart
(Figures 6 and 7 of the Easams Report) showing the position of accidents
relative to the runway in use.   The most recent of these by Fritsch and
Santamaria, published in an ICAO Bulletin in 1986, shows the location of
where aircraft come to rest after 254 landing and take-off accidents
reported to  ICAO between 1970 and 1984, some 70% of all the accidents of
the period.     In 88% of these landing and take-off accidents there were
survivors.

The Easams report stated that 'only a limited amount of information
concerning the activities of the fire and rescue services can be derived
from the accident reports.   Much of the work goes unrecorded because of
the success of their actions'.    Thus most accounts that are available
concentrate    on the fire service's difficulties and/or shortcomings.
Hill ('Aerospace Pathology', University of Cambridge MD Thesis 1984)
quotes several relevant accidents to illustrate the problems which may
be met with and since then fire service actions and relevant events
following the B737 accident at Manchester on 22 August 1985 have been
subject to special study.

The difficulties of dealing with an internal cabin fire have often been
discussed and proposals have been made notably by Birch ('Protection of
Passengers in Aircraft Accident Fires' Cranfield PhD thesis 1986) who
proposes a supply of air and water mist from fire vehicle to inside the
cabin and by others who favour a supply of just water to a sprinkler
system.   The latter is currently under test at the CAA Fire Servie
Training School, FSTS, at Teeside.    Both approaches also suggest that
the small amount of water present on board the aircraft itself cold be
put to good use prior to the arrival of the fire vehicles,        It is
suggested that these approaches to the important subject of  cabin fire
should be pursued as a matter of high priority.

       CONCLUSIONS     AND   JUSTIFICATION      FOR   BEHAVIOURAL
                             INVESTIGATION


All proceeding   avenues of enquiry lead to the conclusion that there are
major gaps inour knowledge and      understanding of passenger behaviour
prior  to and     during emergency evacuation.      The  occasional  major
survivable accident in the UK and the USA, where great care is taken to
interview surviving passengers, therefore offers substantial evidence
which is however inevitably confused in many essential areas.

The analysis of survival rates in a large number of accidents, for the
majority of which we at present have no witness accounts, produces few
answers but poses many additional questions.       One important key to
improving passenger survivability would therefore seem to be a better
understanding of passenger behaviour under relevant conditions.

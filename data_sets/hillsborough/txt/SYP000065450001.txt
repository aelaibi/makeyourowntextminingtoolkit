               the       ground and walked                 round to L e p pings Lane,                  at the Hop and side

from going           down and they di recte^r me down Fenistonir Road to Loppings

Lane,       and     I got     to L e p pings bane           just after          12ym i d d a y .     I bought       some

fish and           chips and sat o p / t h e            wall and ate                m , at this       time    there

were     quite a few Liverpool                   supporters          around,        they were all         well

behaved and           I did not see anyone drinking alcohol*

The    turnstiles were                  open and      people were           entering       the ground,        there

were a number             of u n iformed          policemen ar o u n d the Leppings Lane                      entrance

maintaining           the situation.                 There were        no queues at the turnstiles.

I got my ticket               from                                                   the v i c e - s e c r e t a r y of

                                                      I had no trouble              entering       the ^ground.           I

stub back            and Ihave now handed                this      stub to PC

Whilst       outside        the ground,           1 did not        see any         persons    selling        tickets

for    the match.             I also       bought myself a Liverpool                      flag off a street

seller.            I took the           pole   out    of the     flag and          left    it by the wall

a lo n g s i d e   the    river,

I was       searched by a u n i f o r m e d Police                 officer         before and after           entering

the ground,

Ail    the     people       I saw entering the ground did so via the turnstiles,                                          1

did not        see any doors              or gates       open.

On entering           the ground           1 purchased a programme                   off a steward who was

the yard as you               came       through      the   turnstiles and            it was one of these

officers           that   searched me for               the second          time,    but    there were        no

police       or stewards           at the entrance             to the tunnel.

             I went        to tiie same rnajMfh last season,                        arrived       that day at about Hpm

             and on that           occasion       I stood on the wi n g , on the                  left of the          stand,

             there       is no     p^Trt i cular    reason why         I changed my position this year.                             I

             went     down the       tunnel       and there was         lots       of    room,    there was       so m m u c h

             room that          three     of us    in the      pen    lay on the         terraces        sun bathing as             it

             was a nice           sunny day,,

             At the end of the tunnel                  there was a fence                dividing     the area          in t w o , I
        Mr
             went     to the       left of this        fence,

             I did not know at the                 time    but   I know now that this                pen is       referred to

             as     ps n 4 ,

             I think        that    the gate at the top of                         fence    on the       left    of    pen 4 was

 S O         When    the    players       first     carrfe onto      the    pitch in their          suits        I along       with

             the others stood up              and     cheered them,           this w ould have           been about

             1.30pm .       I remained        standing         after       that;    I was   positioned by a barrier

             at    the   rear      of pen 4.        There was         still    plenty of          room    in this       pen and

             in the      pen on my         right.

             The a t m o s p h e r e at     this    time was         good and       I did not witness             any

             fighting        or alcohol       being       consumed.

             Up to aoout 2 pin there was                  no   crush at all             then gradually          1 found

             m yself     being      pushed to my          left as      people       entered the          pen from the

             t u n n e l , this did not           bother m e     as    it is quite          normal       for    this    to

             happen.         As    time    passed    though      I found myself             being    pushed further and

             further        forward and       not    being able         to go       back.        N o r mally when the area

             is     packed with supporters                like    this you         do get pushed forward                by

             people at the back              pushing,       but you can            always go back a g a i n to your

             normal        position,       but on this day when you went                     forward you          could       not

             gat     back      to your     original       position.         To begin with you may have                       been

             pushed two           or three    steps       forward and you               could only go back             one

             step?       so gradually you went              further and further                  forward       not be i rig able

to go     b a c k    at all.      By Xhirff time         I was      beginning          to get    concerned,             it

was    now about £.30pm/<and I had not e x p e r i e n c e d a cru^i                            like this          in

any of the manv/rifatches                I have attended.                 I w a s ^ n o w somewhere          in the

centre of           pj^n 4 and still          being     pushed forward.                The    pressure was          so

great     that       I had my arm        in front        of me at head height                  so that       it was

more     comfortable and             1 could hold myself off the person in front of

me,,     My shoelace was             undone,      but    I could not            even get my hand             into my

pocket      to check what            time     it was     let alone         do my shoe          laces    up.        There

was    no way        I could get out           of X h ^ / p e n    as    it was    impossible          to go

backwards,           the    pressure     just J ^ p X     on building            up,    I was    now ext r e m e l y

concerned for my safety, J?ne only movement                                I had       control       of was

sideways,           and to my     left       there were       two barriers,             as    I was

p rogr e s s i v e l y     pushed forwards.             I turned         to go    left       in an attempt          to

get to the           barrier as        I thought        they w ould give me some                 protection,

the    pressure          e v entually    got me to this             barrier and          I got my whole             body

b ehind     it,      but    then the     pressure was             still    on me and my hips were

being     crushed against              the    barrier     causing me great               pain.        I could

still     at    this time see the              playing area,             and    people were          shouting at a

policeman on the track                  to open the         perimeter          gate,     but he either             didnt

hear     us or       ignored us        because       he d i d n ’t open the gate.                I do not

know     if there was a steward by this                       gate w hich was            on my       left    hand

side,,      1 could also          sue    people at        the front            trying    to climb out          of the

pen by going over              the     perimeter        fence      but    they were          being    pushed £>ack

by Police           officers.        1 also     saw that          the    standing area on my                left    in

the    corner was           not full     and there was             plenty       of space       there.        1 am not

sure     of the exact           time    but    it must      have        been somewhere          betwee n 2 . 30pm

and the time             the   players       came onto      the     pitch.

Although        1 was       now against        the    barrier and my             legs and hips          could not

go any further              forward the        top half       of my body was             still       being    pushed

forward        onto the        person    in front        of me,         who was    the other          side    of the

carrier,        my head was          being    forced onto the               person's    back    in front       of

«'<e ? the     people       on my    immediate       right and         left were also          on the

barrier.            The    barrier    continued on my            left       to the dividing          fence and

there were about              ten    people    between me and the               f e n c e , as my head was

pushed down           I w ould only see to my                 left.     I saw a number          of    people       on

my     left    trying       to get    under    the      barrier,       1 saw them go down below the

barrier        but    there was       no room for them to get                  up the otherside and as

they went           down the space         that    they       left was       immedia tel y filled and

there was           no way they       could get         back.        By this    time    I was    having

difficulty           breathing       but   I tried to          remain       calm,    everyone    was    still

shouting        for       help and trying         to get       people       to stop    pushing,       some were

crying and some were                 o b viously     panicking,         but nobody seemed to be

taking any notice.

T here was a lad on my                immediately         left,       he was about       15 or       16 years       of

age,     short       brownish hair,          white      I think       he was,       wearing    red.     I cannot

recall        any    other    details about          him,      my arm was       over his       shoulder       and

round his           head,    it was    not    there      by chance,          I could not move          it,    it

was     trapped       there    by someone         else.        He asked me          to move my arm but             it

was     impossible,          my eyes were         the    only    part       of my body    I could move,

an d    by now       I thought       1 was    going      to die.        T hen there was another               surge

of     pressure.           I don't think      that      the    players were yet          on the       pitch.

The     surge       pushed the       person    in front         of me       forwards and the          pressure

on my head and sh oulders                  pushed the top half                of my    body over the

barrier,,           I was    now bent      double       over    the    barrier and       in that mome nt            1

had a clear           view along       the    barrier         to my    left and       I saw people       getting

up,     these may have          been the ones            I saw getting          under    the    barrier       some

two minutes           earlier.        I cannot       say for         sure    if they were       the    same

ones,     some       people    did not       get back         onto    their    feet    before    the    crowd       in

front     came back and these                people were a gain trapped by the                       people

behind and           in front       of the    barrier.          As the       people    in front       came    tiack

see to my          left and all          I could see were              peoples         legs there was also 3

or 4 people who a p p e a r e d to be crouched down trapped between                                         peoples

legsu       The         lad I had had my arm round was also                         bent over         the   crash

barrier       on        top of rfte.      His    head was over            the    left side      of my       body.       He

appeared          limp and    1 thought          he    was     dead.       The    ones    I could see          on the

floor     to my         left were       still    alive    because I could see them moving

trying      to get up or go forwards                    but    they       c o u l d n ’t do either,          1 think

I was      bent doublj/over              the    b a r r i e r for about          two mi n a t e s , then

there      appealed        to be another          surge       of    pressure,          as the   pain on        my hips

increa^d.               I think    it was       somewhere about             this       time    that    I passed

outx      I can remember            hearing a          cheer       from the       crowd and       I ^presume this

was when          the    players    came       onto    the     pitch, but         that    is fA.i      I can

I got      out     of    pen 4,    as    I regained          consciousness,             I was very confused,.

I did      not know what           had h a p pened or what was                   going on,

I do not          recall    anyone       in particular          being with me,                there were       some

Li ve rp oo l      fans    close    to me,       but    I cannot          say    if they brought me to

where     I found myself,

Leppings          Lane    end of the       ground and g r adually my memory                       of what       had

h a p p e n e d started to         return,       I tried to get             to my feet,          but was       very

u n s teady and          I remember       this    policeman          putting       his hand on my head to

push me back,             he was    only a young          policeman,             and    there was another

young     one with him.             One    said       ’He's    drunk * and the one wit h his hand

pushing my head said,                   ’Piss    off    back to where you have                   come from        i4

you have walked this                far you       can walk          back,*        I fell       back    to the     floor
                                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                                       S971

and two more       policemen         came up and they shouted                 to an a m b u l a n c e m a n

with a stretcher           and they        placed me o n M r e        stretcher,        it was      one with

wheels    on and they took me               off tpxCn area under              the N orth Stand.

There    they took me off the stretcher and                         laid me on the floor             w ith two

blankets       over me,     there       I remained with some St.                Jonns Ambulance

cadets,     when they took me              to the first aid           room there was          only about

seven    people    in there,         but    then    it filled up very quickly.                     I lay

there    for    between 30 and 45 minutes,                  on my     left was a Liverpool

s u pporter     lying     down,     he had      injured his         ribs and on my         right was

another     Liverpool       supporter who was              sitting      on a chair,        he had pains

in his stomach.            whilst       I was    lying     there a Police          officer with         pips

on his shoulder           came    between myself and the                lad on left,         he was     crying

and   put his arms         round us.         He told us that            everything would

be alright and went              of f to hsip some^p^rher             peop 1 e ._____________

After    a b ou t 43 mx n a t e s




In a d d i t i o n to my" ticket         stub,     I h a v s/'a 1 s o g o t m y o f f i c ia 1 p r o g ra rnm e

of the    game which        is impregnated with               blue    paint,     where     it was      in

contact     with the       barrier as        it^flrtuck out of my            right hand        pocket and         i.

ha v e also handed t h i s          t                           along wit h copies of t p ^ u a i ly

Hi rror and      the Suptf&y        Echo whi c:h         show p hotographs           of ist€in pen 4 and

being as s i s j ^ t by two         Policemen, the two P o l ices^n shown,                 are     not the

two w h Q^jti s t s p o k e t o     m e but      the two      who    cal led for’ the stretc h e r and

h e 1 p e d m e t o Ihe    first     aid    room.

Prior    to the game        I did not        visit any        licenced       premises and          I do not

drink alcoholic           drink at all,            I did not        see any     fans who were          drum:;

and   I did not witness any fighting.

The   feeling     I got whilst           at H i l l s b o r o u g h on the    lb April       was    that

there a p p eared to be far              fewer Police Officers               there    than there was at
                                                                                                                PAGE           8
                                                                                                                89 7 1

             the semi       final     on the     previous     year.

             X do    not    know why there were            too many fans       in pen 4 but at 2 . 3 0 p m           it

             was already        too    packed to be safe and a l t h o u g h all            of us who were

             being     crushed tried to get             the   police who were        patrolling       the    track        to

             do something           nothing at all       was done     until    it was      too   late.

             As far as        I am    concerned      1 did everything         correctly,,        I a r r i v e d at the

             ground and took up my               position     in plenty of time*           and the events          that

             f o l l o w e d were    completely      beyond my     control.

             I have also        indicated        on a map of the H i l l s b o r o u g h    ground my       position

             at the     time    I entered        pen 4 and the        position   I ended up in prior               to

             1os i n g c o n s c i o u s ness.

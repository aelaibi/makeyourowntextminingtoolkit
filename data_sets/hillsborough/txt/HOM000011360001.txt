HILLSBOROUGH REPORT

Last Saturday the Daily Mirror in a leader (P6) suggested that
the Home Office had given clubs extra time to comply with the
recommendations in the Taylor interim report and that a recent
circular had said that they must be completed "before the start
of the season or immediately thereafter".

This is inaccurate.

The circular of 4 August urged recipients (in paragraph 2) "to
take required action without delay in order to implement, as
necessary, the Inquiry's recommendations to improve safety at
sportsgrounds."

In paragraph 5, the circular draws attention to the 2 categories
of recommendations:   the 28 requiring implementation before the
start of the new football season and those which would take
longer to put into effect.      It went on "The Home Secretary
nevertheless urges recipients to take urgent action on both
categories   so   as  to put    into  effect   as  many   of the
recommendations as possible before the start of the season."

In other words - to put into not only those which Taylor
recommended should be complied with before the start of the
season, but as many of the others as possible too.

The Press Notice was consistent with the circular.

I shall be glad if the Press Office will ensure that the correct
position is presented in response to enquiries, and consider
whether any remedial action is necessary.

                                     Chief Constable
     ?f Sheffield.

Deai’ Chief Constable Wells,

I am writing to offer to help you to resolve the Hillsborough Disaster problem that
you have inherited from your predecessor Peter Wright; W.W. Jackson; Wil
Lander and others, who caused it to be brought upon South Yorkshire Police.,
because of their disbelief and the evil that they did to me and my human family.

What. I am going to tell you is going to sound utterly fantastic and will probably
cause you to laugh, initially, but I advise you, like I advised Peter Wright, etc. in
1985, to take me extremely seriously. He didn't; was arrogant and paid for it.
What I told him would happen to him has happened, so you now have his job.

Maggie Thatcher rewarded, that arrogant man with an Q.B.E., for what, he did to
the miners. God rewarded him with disgrace and a fall, for what he did to me.

I suggest, that you sit down, suspend all calls, and read this letter very carefully and
in an extremely respectful; humble and friendly manner, as I am offering to
HELP you in a way that NO-ONE else on Zarth can because I am the ONLY
person who knows the red reason why the Hillsborough Disaster happened and
why it keeps coming back to haunt South Yorkshire Police. Everyone knows HOW
it happened but that is NOT what 1 said. I said. WHY it happened.

It will NOT go away until SYP make amends to me for what Peter Wright; W.W.
Jackson; Wil Lander and others did to me, because my Boss; obviously from what
is happening; is not going to LET it go away

I told these evil, arrogant men; whilst I was fighting against, a Mafia on the Costa
del Sol; that I work for and fight evil for God (not a joke and not funny) and that
what they were doing to me and. others was. wrong and that I would have them
disgraced and kicked out of the police-force for fighting against me and The Ruler
of The Universe (God), unless they did an about-turn; changed their attitude;
listened to; learned from me and helped me with my fight/s, as policemen should.

Jesus, who was a soldier of God and not a wimp in a white frock, said:-
Luke 11:21 When a strong' mm ARMED keepeth his castle, his goods are in peace:
11:22 But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he
taketh from him ail his weapons wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils. *
11:23 He that is not WITH me is AGAINST me: and he that gathereth not. with
me scattereth. *7That, is exactly what SYP haw done to me).
Matthew 2 1 :^ And whosoever shall fall on this "Stone" shall be broken: but on
whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to povder.

God, through king David, wrote Psalm 2 about this ; I suggest you read it.

In their stupidity, arrogance and disbelief, instead of helping me as they should
have, they mocked, and. attacked me, and God; actually helped the Mafia by their
actions; caused my body's dad to die from a hsart-attack, ruining my body's
mother's life and health and have caused me a great deal of trouble, for which they
and South Yorkshire Police have been and. still are being punished, by God, and
will be until you put it right. He does not like being disobeyed or mocked:-

Galatians 6:7 Be not deceived, God. is NOT mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth,
THAT shall he also reap.
6:8 For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that
soweth [according] to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap Life everlasting.

The Hillsborough Disaster was NOT an accident. It was "an Act of God" just like
the Fiper Alpha melt-down in 1988, which was intended to and caused incalculable
damage to the British economy due to the subsequent lack of oil-revenue. The death
of Robert Maxwell likewise was also an "Act of God" because the evil hypocrite
refused to help me to help the poor people of Britain, whom he lyingly claimed to
support with his newspaper, making millions from them buying his newspapers.

Before you take this the wrong way and think that sounds sick, I had better put
things into TRUE perspective for you by explaining to you that all of the Beings
(souls not bodies) on this prison-plane!, including you, were condemned, to death
before being sent here 6,000 years ago; have been, like you, continually re­
incarnated; and the 99.97 % who have refused to repent and serve God and His
Lavs are going to be executed in “The Fire" soon, so a few human organic-
computer bodies that we created (as consumables) being destroyed (not the Beings)
prior to that, in order to help my mission, which is to gather together and save the
other 0.03% who have repented and will be reprieved, is irrelevant. I sincerely
hope that you will turn out to be one of that 0.03%. From your reaction to rne and
this letter and your subsequent conduct I will know whether you could be, or not.

I told you that you ought to sit down to real this letter very slowly and carefully.

I have enclosed a copy of a Booklet, that I have written which will explain to you
why the British and American people are soon to fight and lose Armageddon fa
real war) and become slaves, yes SLAVES (not a joke and certainly not funny).
Their choice not mine. I wanted to help them all to have a better life here and. to
learn how to be reprieved but they haw chosen, instead, slavery and death.
So your few dganic-computer bodies, who were sacrificed, as martyrs for God's
purpose, at Hillsborough and will be rewarded by Him for that service, will then
pale into insignificance compared to Armageddon and the subsqequent "Reaping of
the Earth", with 6,000,000,000 criminals (sinners), including all your self-deluded,
selfish and evil, "so-called" royalty, etc., who have made themselves rich at
everyone else's expense, creating mass poverty and thereby causing crime, being
executed, for their (your?) treason and. crimes against each other, me and. God.

However, that does not help you with your immediate problem, which is the
Hillsborough Disaster and the blame and claims, so I will return to i! :d subject.

South Yorkshire Police's only legal defence for the Hillsborough Disaster; in
court, against the claims that it v ill face for compensation; is the Truth. The Truth
is that it was not negligence or an accident but was an "Act of God", against which
there can be no insurance and no claims. I am prepared, as an act of clemency on
my part, to prepare; fight and win the case for you, and resolve the situation to
everyone's satisfaction.

I am the only person on Earth, who, with God's help can get SYP out of the mess
that you are in because I am the only person who knovs and can EXPLAIN
WHY it happened. Before, you leap to silly human vrong-conclusions that I, in
some way, organised the disaster on a human level, let me tell you that I did not
and it would have been impossible for any human to do so, besides which I was
abroad for a long time prior to, during, and after the event.

The only way you can get. SYP out of this mess, and not have, to payanabsolute
fortune (millions) in compensation and haw it keep coming back to haunt you, is by
putting right what it can, and making up to the Nth degree for what it can't.; that
South Yorkshire Police did to me, which (although some of it will be difficult) will
be the easiest way-out for South Yorkshire Police because it is the only way-out
that God will accept and help you with, whereupon, with my help and His,
tilings will be resolved in the fairest and most just way for everyone concerned.

I have been still, and refrained myself for a long time, until now that the disaster
has raised its head again, to show me that now is the time that I haveto act to
help you, if you will accept that help, before tilings get worse for you.

It has been made clear to me that if you don't make it up to me then things will get
worse and worse for South Yorkshire Police until you do, or your successor
does. This message is from God and so is not in any way coercion; just good
friendly advice and an offer of His clemency and help. Peter Wright refused. His
advice. Don't be foolish, like he was and make the same mistake
Once you have made things right with, and for me, to the Nth degree which is the
only TRUE Justice (Deuteronomy 16:20), The Rider of The Universe will either
make your problem go away for you, Himself, or He will instruct me and show me
the best way to sort it out, for you, most, of which I know already.

I won't say any more until I know whether you are going to be sensible and take me
seriously and accept my help, or whether I am wasting my time and will have to
deal with your successor. My offer is to you and I will talk to no-one but you
personally, so don’t get anyone else to write to me, contact me or visit me.

The people of Gibraltar also have not taken me seriously, as a result of which, their
economy is in a bad way and getting' worse because of their attitude. I have enclosed
a copy of a letter that I have recently written to them.

You will no doubt come to one of the following two conclusions from this letter

(i)         that I am a crackpot,
       or
(ii)        that I am telling you the Truth, even though it is w ry hard to believe.

You are a policeman. Look at the evidence. The FACTS speak for themselves.
Has the Hillsborough Disaster gone away or has it come back to haunt you? Is Peter
Wright still chief constable or are you? Shall I go on? No. You are a policeman and
should be quite capable of working it out for yourself.

Considering' the trouble that SYP is already in because o f i^hat it did to me, I
advise you not to do anything else that may cause me any more trouble and take this
letter the right ^ ay , which is, as a genuine and sincere offer of help;
reconciliation and. friendship, from the very best friend you could EVER have.

Hoping we ^ i l l become friends and help each other, to God's; our and everyone's
mutual benefit, and that I shall hear from you at your earliest convenience, for
which I thank you in anticipation.

                                        Yours Sincerely




P.S. Also enclosed is a copy of a Booklet that I wrote for and to help the Prison
Service. I hope you will like it and want to use it in Sheffield.
                                           *4XJdi&            o                  f          11
I have told you repeatedly; in my leaflets and recently in my “Message for G ibraltar from G od” and other
Booklets; that your troubles are because God ia PUNISHING you for NOT keeping The Covenant and for
your idolatry; blasphemy and insults, in calling Virgin Maiy, who is buried in England, "the mother of God”,
Your fate is N O T in the hands of priests or politicians, local or abroad. It IS in God’s hands and His alone.
He will continue to punish you UNTIL you listen to ME and Him and return to and keep The Covenant
God sent me to w arn you and to help you but you are ungrateful* and keep ignoring me and the message (tike
in Noahs time) that He has given me for you. So your troubles will increase and keep closing in on you.
Koran Sura 16:112- “I AM” (God) sets forth a Parable: a CITY enjoying security and quiet, abundantly supplied
with sustenance from every place (like Gibraltar used to be): yet was it ^ungrateful for the favours of “I AM”
(was stiff-necked and refused to listen to and obey His Prophet/Elect): so “I AM” made it taste of hunger and
terror (in extremes) (closing in on it) like a garment (from every side), because of the (evil) which (its people)
wrought (Covenant breaking; rebellion/anarchy; idolatry; blasphemy in calling the pope Holy Father; etc.).
I told you years ago that the dockyard would close and it did; was re-opened and has closed again. It will not be
successful until you obey me and God and keep The Covenant. The cruise-liners have also stopped coming.
Spain and others are being used by G od to bring you to your knees. I told you in 1989 that He would do so,
CEPSA is crippling the fuel industry, having already had bunkering in Gibraltar done away with and, being the
closest to the border, is best placed to grab the visitors. There are none so blind as those who refuse to see.
The Spanish ready-mixed concrete company undercut the local one and recently put it out of business like other
businesses have done/are doing too; with the loss of more jobs. The incinerator has been incinerated (sabotage?).
Food is cheaper in Spain, so people take their money out of Gibraltar to Spain, draining the Gibraltarian economy
whilst reinforcing the Spanish economy. If a bucket has holes in it, it W ILL become EMPTY.
Almost everything that used to be more expensive in Spain is now cheaper than in Gibraltar, so people do
not need to suffer the border queues to spend their money here anymore and your shops are going bankrupt,
 causing more unemployment; poverty; crime and violence. WAKE UP and OPEN YOUR EYES!
The spanish marinas are undercutting local ones by about 50% in some cases, including free water and electric­
 ity. The cost of electonics etc. for boats is now as cheap or cheaper in Spain, along with the cheaper food costs,
 so there is no reason for boats to come here anymore and they don’t. Your economy will DIE without them.
The local marinas have agreed not to compete with each other on prices and to work together to encourage boats
 to come to Gibraltar; fine. No disrespect intended to them but in the REAL world they have to compete with and
 UNDERCUT spanish prices because food is more expensive here, or the marinas will continue to empty, causing
 more unemployment in the town, because every boat spends money in the town, not only in the marinas.
 Spain will buy up businesses and property as Gibraltar goes down until they own it and raise the Spanish Flag,
 as I told you they would, if you chose to ignore me and the Ruler of The Universe (God) Who sent me here.
 Gibraltarians, and other British people, are being driven-out of Gibraltar as it is dying, just as I told you,
 from God, that it would, if you listened to politicians and priests etc. Your ONLY chance to SURVIVE, be
 healthy and prosper is to listen to ME; learn the “New Song”; study The Covenant and return to it Then and
 only THEN will God and I sort out Spain foryou and DESTROY their FALSE sovereignty claim FOREVER.
 I am the ONLY person who knows how to and can do it, with G od’s help, just as I told you years ago.
 Spain will not allow Gibraltar to be a successful financial centre and neither will God, nomatter who you employ
 and how clever they are. A financial centre would only employ university graduates. What will everyone else do?
 The Amsterdam summit has brought you more troubles regarding the land-frontier. Britain has a “conflict of
 interests” and you will always come third or lower. So you NEED boats to come here. As many as possible.
 Since then, like most of the Empire, Hong Kong has now gone; giving Spain even more leverage with the
 U.N., which had already agreed to help Joseph M aty Aznar, against you, according to spanish press reports.
 The U.N. is historically Britain’s enemy. The “Sun” (Brit Throne) is being darkened by the sun setting on the
 British Empire and “Oh, how the mighty are fallen”, as Britain too is being punished for breaking The Covenant
 Even if they really wanted to help you they will be unable to do so because they too are on “the slippery slope”
 and are going to be defeated, along with the U.S.A., at Armageddon and will become slaves, as I told you.
 Britannia does not rule the waves and soon shall be SLAVES (Deut 28:68; Rev./Apoc. 11:7). They can sing “Rule
 Britannia” as much as they like. It won’t save them. The ONLY song that would is the “New Song”.

I only pass this way once, so I will strive to ensure that
this place will be better for my having been here.

Do unto others as you would like to have them do unto
you and In so doing set them a good example and a
precedent for them to return the favour.

The Root Cause of YOUR Problem:-

The British are Israel to whom God gave His Commandments,
HIS LAWS, Statutes and Judgements by which breakers of His
laws were to be judged by HIM and not by evil men who couid
be bribed and/or persuaded to turn a blind eye etc.

So that there would not be one law for the rich and another for
the poor, He gave His judgements, under which everyone was
to be treated EXACTLY the same with NO favouritism.

Along with the COMMANDments, HIS laws, statutes and
JUDGEMENTS, He gave a complete and PERFECT economic
policy, an agricultural policy which did not need to use any
chemical fertilizers and a healthy balanced diet etc.

He gave the British people (Israel)
EVERYTHING necessary for their
guidance and well-being, so that they
couid live happily together in harmony
with each other and with nature, so that
they would want for nothing, and
therefore there would be no need for
                                             riflPp
                                             t §§ iff if
crime caused by deprivation.
The word BRiT-ISH is Hebrew:-

BRiT means "the COVENANT"

iSH means exactly the same in Hebrew as it does in English -
that is:- "the people of.”

A COVENANT is a solemnly binding CONTRACT.

Therefore the British are ’’the people of the COVENANT" or "the
people Israel of the Covenant.”

There has only EVER been one people with whom God has
made a covenant and that is Israel - the British.

As part of this contract God gave the British His
Commandments, HIS laws, statutes and JUDGEMENTS,
economic policy, agricultural policy etc for their well-being.

God’s PERFECT laws are called the "Laws of LIBERTY"
because they are designed to leave people perfectly free to do
whatever they like, providing that they keep HIS laws.

They are not OPPRESSIVE like man made laws which selfish
men made up to suit themselves and their own greedy desires
and to force others into submission and slavery to themselves
and their home-made rules.

 God’s laws are also the laws of TRUE justice, not man's
 distorted opinions of what is justice to them. Each man's idea
 of justice is only what seems just to himself and as men are
 unjust themselves, so is their idea of justice. So therefore there
 can NEVER be TRUE justice under man's rule. Only God is
 impartial, unbiased and just and therefore His justice, IS
 JUSTICE.

 Under God’s laws everyone is equal and His justice can NOT be
 bought, bent, twisted or ignored.

 His laws guarantee freedom from OPPRESSION by selfish
 powerful people.


                              Page 2
In God's Book - the Bible, are written HiS laws, statutes,
JUDGEMENTS, economic policy, agricultural policy etc.
contained in the Books of Moses - the first 5 Books of the Old
Testament - covenant or contract and which are called

Genesis, Exodus - from slavery under man’s rule, to freedom
under God's rule, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy.

These were given to Moses in Horeb, Mt. Sinai for His people -
the British to live by tor EVER, along with the two tablets of
stone on which God wrote His COMMANDments with His finger
(like a lazer), during the 40 days Moses was up the mountain
speaking to God and the other occupants of the spaceship,
which was recorded as being a "fire in the sky by night" etc.

The people followed it for months and when it moved they
followed it and when It stopped they stopped and camped (read
about it in Exodus).

You ail know about the 10 - COMMANDments because you were
taught about it in school. They left out the part about the laws
and economic policy to keep you in the dark, so that you would
not rebel against their laws and economic policies under which
they rob and oppress you. You are here because you did.

They knew that, if you read God's laws and economic policy,
you would throw man made laws out of the window and set
yourselves free from their oppression.

So they have purposely kept you in the dark from birth so they
can oppress and manipulate you and steal from you under their
own laws and make themselves rich and keep you poor and
drive you to crime or slavery. An employee is only a polite word
for slave.

When Moses came down the mountain with the 5 scroll Books
containing the laws, economic policy and the history and
lineage of the British people back to Abraham their father and
also carrying the two (2) tablets of stone on which were the
COMMANDments, the ENTIRE Israel - British nation swore a
solemnly binding oath and contract that they would keep and
DO, ALL that God had commanded to Moses for EVER.

                            Page 3
God warned the people (through Isaiah the prophet * read it)
that if they did not keep HiS laws etc. and allowed selfish,
greedy, evil people to alter His PERFECT laws, In any way, or
make up their own laws, then gradually these people would
become rich and others would be made poor. Then these now
rich and therefore now powerful people would make up more
and more laws and make the poor poorer and poorer and
themselves richer and richer. He said that they would grind the
faces of the poor (nose to the grindstone) and oppress and
steal (under their iiiegaiiy made laws) ail their (the poor's) share
of the earth's blessings. He said that because of this there
would come violence, stealing and times of trouble such as
never were trom the beginning up until this time, as the poor
tried to take back their lost share of the world's resources, from
the rich who had become rich by robbing them with false laws
and economic policies and taxes.

Under God's economic policy no-one couid become FILTHY
rich and no-one could become very poor. There was provision
that those who wanted to work harder couid earn more and
could enjoy the rewards of their labour, but after 50 years they
had to share out everything with everyone else, thereby
redistributing the wealth but not destroying it, and EVERYONE
would benefit.

There has to be incentive otherwise, like the communist
system, everything grinds to a halt and collapses.

Today, under selfish, filthy rich, powerful, evil men's laws
EVERYONE else is oppressed, EXACTLY as God said would
happen - prophesied. We now have people who rightfully claim
to be products of this selfish, sick and evil society and who feei
that they have been driven to crime to survive - exactly as God
predicted.

Crime is NEVER the answer. The answer is to get rid of the
iiiegaiiy made, oppressive laws that made you and keep you
poor. Just as God said (Maiachi ch. 4).

Prisoners must iearn many things whilst in prison, in order to
be able to put things right and to stay out of prison, once
released.

The first thing they must iearn is that the prison officers are not
their enemy but their helpers - IF they LET themselves be
helped.

Prison officers did not put you in prison either "bang to rights"
or wrongly and the officers are mostly from working-class
families just like the inmates and they also suffer under the
same oppressive laws themselves, as tax paying, wage earning
slaves/employees of the same evil system.

Prison officers and inmates should work together and help
each other to get rid of oppressive illegal laws and taxes that
oppress them ail and their families and friends.

The inmates have to iearn to convert all their negative,
destructive energy - resentment, hate and aggression into
positive, constructive energy i.e. DETERMINATION and
peacefully use it to change the system that oppresses them.

This would make prison life better for both inmates and officers
and society in general.

instead of beating up and mugging old people and burgling
other working people, who themselves are also victims of the
rich and powerful people's laws, taxes and oppression, they
should be helping each other by talking together about how to
get rid of these oppressive laws and the systems that maintain
them.

You can NOT do that if you are resentful, full of hate and
aggression because people will be afraid to talk to you or to
employ you and therefore you will never achieve your aims, and
will have to return to crime again and again.




                              Page 5
You MUST, therefore, firstly change yourselves and become
better and friendlier people and educate yourselves about
God's laws and economics etc. so that you can tell and teach
others, by mail until your release and then face to face to get
the Illegal laws abolished and return to God's laws, before It's
too late (Malachl ch. 4).

If you want to change the world you will find it IMPOSSIBLE,
UNLESS you change yourself first because, If not, no-one will
listen to you. As you are a part of the world, If you change
yourself you will already have changed the world a little bit
because you are part of It and you have changed. Then, like a
pebble (Rock) thrown Into a pond and the ripples reach to the
edge of it, you will affect everyone you meet and they will affect
others, until, like the pond, everyone will feel the effect.

If everyone became a pebble the world would be better
overnight.

The Bible is NOT a religious book In the way that you
understand religions with churches and ceremonies.

It is a Book sent by God - the King and Ruler of the Universe
and in it are the answers to ALL the ills of the world and to your
own personal problems.

It teaches you unselfishness; love; the right way to live; how to
relate and behave towards your neighbours; how to teach your
children the right values and bring them up correctly and
everything you need to know In order to live In harmony with
your surroundings, both people and nature.

If you know all of those things you will find that people will like
you and want you to be with them and/or work for/with them,
Instead of rejecting you as they do now. That means you will be
able to stay out of trouble, earn a decent living and have a good
life with a happy family.




                              Page 6
God has a job for each and every one of you. That job Is to let
Him teach you how to fight evil and become the very best
person that you can become, so that you can help Him to put
the world right - His way. You can do this best by helping Him
to abolish all the false, illegal man-made laws, rules,
regulations, taxes and political and religious systems that are
used to oppress you and everyone else.

The Solution to YOUR Problems:-

Rld yourself of resentment, anger, hate, fear and aggression
because they are ALL negative forms of energy and therefore
destructive of good. They ALL come from the dark negative
power of this world - Satan, the devil and destroyer.

The word Satan means the opposer because he opposes good
i.e. God (Go-d). The word devil means the liar because he
Invented it. Lies are evil - D/evil.

He is the destroyer because he is full of hate and supplies the
world with It through each person, if you don't stop him. His Is
the evil voice in your head when he talks to you telepathically
and tries to get you to do what he wants you to do, which is to
do evil for him. He controls people, almost everyone on earth,
by telling them telepathically in their minds, to do what he
wants them to do. He supplies them with the energy to do this,
and that energy comes In the form of negative, destructive
energy e.g. anger, hate, fear and aggression.

As he Is the destroyer, you can NEVER use his negative,
destructive weapons - fear, anger and aggression to build a
better world. You would, if you use them, only be adding to his
destructive force. Destroying ANYTHING, except evil, will only
keep you In prison longer and keep sending you back, over and
over again.




                             Page 7
You must NEVER let Satan make you lose your temper or self-
control because, If you do, he will take you over ("like a man
possessed") and use you to do or say what he wants and later,
when he has let go of you, you will be sorry and wonder what
made you do or say such a terrible thing that you never meant
to do. Satan did, because you lost your self-control and gave
control of yourself and your mouth over to him to cause
trouble. Then, when he has done it, he leaves you to take the
blame and pay for it. Nice friend to have, huh??

If you want to stop him from getting YOU into trouble NEVER
lose your temper.

You can NOT overcome darkness and evil by using darkness
and evil, you just add to it and make it worse.

The ONLY way to overcome darkness and evil is by using the
light and good. Just like when the sun rises in the East and
lightens even to the West and it destroys the darkness easily
and painlessly, so good (the light) destroys evil (the darkness)
easily and painlessly. Darkness is afraid of and can't move into
the light because it would destroy itself and become light.

You must, as you rid yourself of the dark energy, replace it with
positive, light constructive energy - God's energy (the Force)
and fill yourself with love, unselfishness, compassion, peace of
mind, understanding, wisdom, knowledge and
DETERMINATION. Determination is the MOST important.
Determination not to slip back and lose your self-control so that
Satan can’t get you Into trouble again.Determination to rid the
world of mountains of evil and oppression and replace it with
love, justice and compassion etc.

Every normal human+being has two telepathic voices in their
head - a good one and an evil one, both of whom try to
Influence that human+being to do their will.

If you put a letter d on the word evil (devil) you will see whose
voice that is.

If you remove a letter o from the word good (God) you will see
whose voice that is.

                             Page 8
When the devil talks to you and tells you to do bad things and
tries to make you lose your temper to do worse things, God
tells you NOT to do those things and tells you that you KNOW it
would be wrong of you.

As this happens you must tell Satan to go away and ask God to
help you not to give In to Satan's wishes.

You will NEVER defeat Satan alone (on your own) you NEED
God's help.

Satan talks to approx. 6,000,000,000 people, all day, every day,
Individually and all at the same time and controls them and
their actions, words and thoughts, unless they stop him. That Is
why the world is in such a mess.

He is far more powerful than you can possibly imagine and you
will NEVER be able to DEFEAT him and break his hold over you,
on your OWN.

The ONLY way to defeat Satan is to get someone far more
powerful than he Is to HELP you. The ONLY person who can
help you is GOD. Ask Him to!

Learn to communicate with the good (God's) voice inside your
head (Matthew 6v6) and ask Him to help you to rid yourself of
Satan and ask Him to teach you how to be good - like God.

God Is the only person (being) who can teach you to be good
because He Is the ONLY one that knows what good (God) Is. No
father, mother, priest, politician or other human can teach you
to be good because they do not know what good is, or they
would not be a sinner (and they ALL are) and they would not be
here, on this prison planet.

Yes, this entire planet Is a prison, where EVERYONE Is bad.
People call themselves sinners because their egoes don’t like
the word bad, but a sinner IS a bad person. It Is derived from
SATAN 1M US - (S./ IN./123) - Sinners.




                            Page 9
Everyone on earth is a sinner and bad and the only places
where everyone is bad is a prison and this planet is the
universe’s prison planet.

Remember that you start changing the world by changing
yourself first, NOT last. You do that by getting God to help you
to drive Satan out of you and by being determined to KEEP him
out.

To win, overcome and endure to the end, you will need
tremendous faith, which is only another word for trust, in God
and will need to get to know Him. God has NEVER wanted
anyone to believe in Him, He has only EVER wanted YOU to get
to KNOW Him. You do that by talking to Him telepathically
(mentally) 24 hours a day EVERY day of your life, and becoming
His son and learning how to be like Him (good). Get His help
and advice on EVERYTHING that you do, say and think.

If you break your contact with God, even for a moment, you will
let Satan back in and Satan will drive you crazy, with what you
think Is your imagination running riot but it is NOT, it is Satan
talking to you, trying to frighten you into serving him again,
instead of God.

Remember he is the liar and his threats are ALL bluffs • LIES.
You must CALL his bluffs. If you don't you will LOSE. God will
always defend you, IF you are doing His will, and He Is FAR
more powerful than Satan.

YOU have to iearn to do God’s will on Earth as It Is done in
heaven, already. His will for you is that you talk to Him and get
to know Him, so He can teach you how to be good and
overcome evil. I don't think that that is a lot to ask of anyone.

Remember, if you want to live in a better world, you start by
Improving yourself, and setting a good example to others.

The prison staff are not your enemies. They did not create the
laws and evil system that sent you here, they are victims of the
system, just like you.



                            Page 10
Work together with them to make your stay here as productive
and as pleasant as possible and to change and destroy,
peacefully, that evil system that made you poor and sent you
here.

You couid NEVER meet a greater rebel and revolutionary
against the evil of this world, than Christ himself.

It was the jewish government (Sanhedrin) and their rich friends
that crucified Jesus the Nazarite because he was considered to
be a threat to their great wealth and power. He never broke any
law. All he did was tell the TRUTH and enlighten people from
the darkness and lies that the government had kept them under,
to keep them poor and make themselves rich. Some things
never change.

The rich are the REAL criminals because they have stolen the
share of the poor people by fraud (James 5 v4) under their own
illegally made (fraudulent) laws. The problem is that because of
Ignorance of God’s laws, and being kept in the dark, the poor
are in prison instead of the REAL criminals - the rich.

The governments and their rich friends and judges call you
anarchists but it is they themselves that are the anarchists
because they refuse to keep God's laws and be governed by
Him. Choosing, rather, to govern themselves and you by their
Illegal laws and taxes (Psalm 2).

People usually accuse others, of doing what they themselves
have done, to try to hide their own guilt.

The politicians and priests have worked together (Revelations
18 v9) to create the false Impression that Christ was a wimp In a
white frock and sandals and that he was very poor. He was, in
fact, a revolutionary, otherwise the rich would not have
crucified him, after firstly putting him in prison, just like they
have done to you.

Jesus the Nazarite needed no gun or other weapon to fight evil.
The only weapon he used was the greatest and most powerful
weapon on Earth, which Is far more powerful than any gun or
even nuclear weapon, the TRUTH.

                            Page 11
The truth will remove any mountain of evil. Learn what it is,
how to find It and recognise it, where it comes from • from God.
Then iearn to love it, and how to use it, and then use it to
destroy evil. Shine the light of truth on lies and darkness and
you will always win. It may be difficult to learn but once you
have learned to use |t properly, you will be invincible.

You can learn all this by following EXACTLY, and to the letter,
the teachings of the greatest revolutionary • Christ.

Don't let anyone try to tell you what he said or what it means -
read it for yourself. Priests will tell you it doesn't mean what it
says and often that it means the opposite. They call Christ a
liar and claim to work for him. Don't believe them, read what
Christ actually did say. Christ IS and always tells the TRUTH.
Believe him and not the opposers. It means EXACTLY what it
says.

Read what he says about the SCRIBES and about the
PHARISEES. The SCRIBES are the judiciary (lawyers, judges
etc.). The PHARISEES are the politicians.

Read Matthew 23 N.B. verse 8 • Rabbi means priest • all of them
of EVERY religion.

Some things have never changed because you have never
learned the teachings and the truth and how to use it to change
the world. Learn it now! You have lots of time on your hands •
use It well!

The world is only the way it is today because everyone has
been kept in the dark. Use the truth to enlighten and free
everyone and make the worid a better place for everyone and to
set yourself free, FREE, not only from prison but also from
oppression.

Enlighten people to who they REALLY are - Israel and to the
PERFECT laws and economics of God, as opposed to the dark,
evil laws made up by selfish men who are serving their father
the lord of darkness • Satan.



                              Page 12
Then, as easily and painlessly as light vanquishes darkness, so
will come, with the light, justice, love (not sex) and peace of
mind and peace on earth.

Just to destroy another lie, forever, I will point out that Jesus
the Nazarite was not a poor man. There Is absolutely no
Biblical evidence to support this LIE. The MISquote they use to
support this lie is that there was "no room at the Inn." it says
that there was no ROOM at the Inn, not that they had no money
to stay there.

Joseph was a carpenter and In those days, everything that was
made was made by the local carpenter. Therefore he would
never be without work or short of money.

At the nativity, the three kings came to pay homage to the "King
of kings.” They brought gifts to show their respect and they
brought the three most expensive things on earth at that timer-
gold, frankincense and myrrh.

They came to pay homage and show respect and so did not
bring a little bit, for fear of offending or Insulting the "King of
kings." They brought a lot of gold, frankincense and myrrh •
the three most expensive things on earth.

Also, Joseph of Arimathea, the rich man who put the crucified
body into his own tomb, was Jesus the Nazarlte's great-uncle,
the uncle of Mary the mother of Jesus. He was a devoted great-
uncie and disciple and was one of the three richest men in
Israel.

You have just been given three very good reasons why Jesus
the Nazarite was NEVER poor. He was not rich either, but
always had enough.

The lie that Jesus was poor was started by the rich people who
formed the parliament and they got the churches to pass on the
lie, In order to keep the people poor and quiet, and stop them
rebelling.




                              Page 13
By saying that Jesus was poor and that the people, by being
poor, were following in his footsteps, they have kept the people
down and poor for centuries (Revelations 18 v9). They have
also made themselves and the churches richer and richer.

The church of England is the biggest and richest iand-owner in
Britain and yet there are hundreds of thousands of poor who
have no houses, some of whom live in cardboard boxes. The
Vatican Is the richest business on earth and sits on 7 hills •
read Revelations 17 v9.

Stay away from ALL political parties and religions and talk
ONLY to God In private, in your head, not in a church, as you
were TOLD to do in Matthew 6 v1-8 N.B. verses 5 and 6 - by
Christ • HIMSELF. (Synagogue means church).




                            Page 14
                     Conclusion.
Use your time in prison to study and learn the beauty and
justice of God’s laws and economics, so that you can teach
others and change the world.                           i

if you iearn, by following Christ's teachings, how to become like
Christ, you will eventually even be released from this prison
planet and to go home to your REAL home where you originally
came from, back out in the universe, and to live there with God,
your new found loving Father.

The reason that God gave Moses the 10- COMMANDments is
because they are the laws of the Universe and you have to
PROVE that you can keep them here , under ALL
circumstances, amongst all of this evil and temptation In this
world, before He can release you from this prison planet and let
you go HOME to your REAL families In heaven (the universe).

Now you can see that God has told you the TRUTH because His
prophecies have come TRUE, about the times of oppression
and the poor having their faces ground and having to steal and
become violent to survive, because you are part of it, you can
believe aii - ALL that He has told you.

He has toid you, on the last page of the Old Testament, that at
the end, just before the last day comes, His people MUST
remember and return to the laws that He gave to Moses In
Horeb, In order to put the world right, or else He will come and
burn you ALL up.

Read Maiachi chapter 4 and you will see for yourself. Do it NOW
before it is TOO iate. You will NOT get another chance.

      Officers & Governors.

I only pass this way once, so I will strive to ensure that
this place will be better for my having been here.

Do unto others as you would like to have them do unto
you and in so doing set them a good example and a
precedent for them to return the favour.

The Root Cause of YOUR Problem:-

The British are Israel to whom God gave His Commandments,
HIS LAWS, Statutes and Judgements by which breakers of His
laws were to be judged by HIM and not by evil men who could
be bribed and/or persuaded to turn a blind eye etc.

So that there would not be one law for the rich and another for
the poor, He gave His judgements, under which everyone was
to be treated EXACTLY the same with NO favouritism.

Along with the COMMANDments, HIS laws, statutes and
JUDGEMENTS, He gave a complete and PERFECT economic
policy, an agricultural policy which did not need to use any
chemical fertilizers and a healthy balanced diet etc.

He gave the British people (Israel)
EVERYTHING necessary for their
guidance and well-being, so that they
could live happily together In harmony
with each other and with nature, so that
they would want for nothing, and
therefore there would be no need for
crime caused by deprivation.
The word BRIT-ISH Is Hebrew:-

BRIT means "the COVENANT"

ISH means exactly the same in Hebrew as it does In English -
that Is:- "the people of."

A COVENANT Is a solemnly binding CONTRACT.

Therefore the British are "the people of the COVENANT" or "the
people Israel of the Covenant."

There has only EVER been one people with whom God has
made a covenant and that is Israel • the British.

As part of this contract God gave the British His
Commandments, HIS laws, statutes and JUDGEMENTS,
economic policy, agricultural policy etc for their well-being.

God’s PERFECT laws are called the "Laws of LIBERTY"
because they are designed to leave people perfectly free to do
whatever they like, providing that they keep HIS laws.

They are not OPPRESSIVE like man made laws which selfish
men made up to suit themselves and their own greedy desires
and to force others Into submission and slavery to themselves
and their home-made rules.

 God's laws are also the laws of TRUE justice, not man's
 distorted opinions of what Is justice to them. Each man's Idea
 of justice is only what seems just to himself and as men are
 unjust themselves, 30 Is their Idea of justice. So therefore there
 can NEVER be TRUE justice under man’s rule. Only God is
 Impartial, unbiased and just and therefore His justice, IS
 JUSTICE.

 Under God's laws everyone Is equal and His justice can NOT be
 bought, bent, twisted or ignored.

 His laws guarantee freedom from OPPRESSION by selfish
 powerful people.


                              Page 2
In God's Book - the Bible, are written HIS laws, statutes,
JUDGEMENTS, economic policy, agricultural policy etc.
contained In the Books of Moses - the first 5 Books of the Old
Testament - covenant or contract and which are called:-

Genesls, Exodus - from slavery under man's rule, to freedom
under God's rule, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy.

These were given to Moses In Horeb, Mt. Slnal for His people -
the British to live by for EVER, along with the two tablets of
stone on which God wrote His COMMANDments with His finger
(like a lazer), during the 40 days Moses was up the mountain
speaking to God and the other occupants of the spaceship,
which was recorded as being a "fire In the sky by night” etc.

The people followed It for months and when It moved they
followed It and when It stopped they stopped and camped (read
about It In Exodus).

You all know about the 10 - COMMANDments because you were
taught about It In school. They left out the part about the laws
and economic policy to keep you In the dark, so that you would
not rebel against their laws and economic policies under which
they rob and oppress you. You are here because you did.

They knew that, If you read God's laws and economic policy,
you would throw man made laws out of the window and set
yourselves free from their oppression.

So they have purposely kept you In the dark from birth so they
can oppress and manipulate you and steal from you under their
own laws and make themselves rich and keep you poor and
drive you to crime or slavery. An employee Is only a polite word
for slave.

When Moses came down the mountain with the 5 scroll Books
containing the laws, economic policy and the history and
lineage of the British people back to Abraham their father and
also carrying the two (2) tablets of stone on which were the
COMMANDments, the ENTIRE Israel • British nation swore a
solemnly binding oath and contract that they would keep and
DO, ALL that God had commanded to Moses for EVER.

                            Page 3
God warned the people (through Isaiah the prophet • read it)
that If they did not keep HIS laws etc. and allowed selfish,
greedy, evil people to alter His PERFECT laws, In any way, or
make up their own laws, then gradually these people would
become rich and others would be made poor. Then these now
rich and therefore now powerful people would make up more
and more laws and make the poor poorer and poorer and
themselves richer and richer. He said that they would grind the
faces of the poor (nose to the grindstone) and oppress and
steal (under their Illegally made laws) all their (the poor's) share
of the earth's blessings. He said that because of this there
would come violence, stealing and times of trouble such as
never were from the beginning up until this time, as the poor
tried to take back their lost share of the world's resources, from
the rich who had become rich by robbing them with false laws
and economic policies and taxes.

Under God's economic policy no-one could become FILTHY
rich and no-one could become very poor. There was provision
that those who wanted to work harder could earn more and
could enjoy the rewards of their labour, but after 50 years they
had to share out everything with everyone else, thereby
redistributing the wealth but not destroying It, and EVERYONE
would benefit.

There has to be Incentive otherwise, like the communist
system, everything grinds to a halt and collapses.

Today, under selfish, filthy rich, powerful, evil men's laws
EVERYONE else Is oppressed, EXACTLY as God said would
happen - prophesied. We now have people who rightfully claim
to be products of this selfish, sick and evil society and who feel
that they have been driven to crime to survive - exactly as God
predicted.

Crime Is NEVER the answer. The answer Is to get rid of the
Illegally made, oppressive laws that made you and keep you
poor. Just as God said (Malachl ch. 4).




                              Page 4
Prisoners must learn many things whilst In prison, In order to
be able to put things right and to stay out of prison, once
released.

The first thing they must learn Is that the prison officers are not
their enemy but their helpers - IF they LET themselves be
helped.

Prison officers did not put you In prison either "bang to rights"
or wrongly and the officers are mostly from working-class
families just like the Inmates and they also suffer under the
same oppressive laws themselves, as tax paying, wage earning
slaves/employees of the same evil system.

Prison officers and Inmates should work together and help
each other to get rid of oppressive illegal laws and taxes that
oppress them all and their families and friends.

The inmates have to learn to convert all their negative,
destructive energy - resentment, hate and aggression into
positive, constructive energy I.e. DETERMINATION and
peacefully use It to change the system that oppresses them.

This would make prison life better for both Inmates and officers
and society in general.

Instead of beating up and mugging old people and burgling
other working people, who themselves are also victims of the
rich and powerful people’s laws, taxes and oppression, they
should be helping each other by talking together about how to
get rid of these oppressive laws and the systems that maintain
them.

You can NOT do that if you are resentful, full of hate and
aggression because people will be afraid to talk to you or to
employ you and therefore you will never achieve your alms, and
will have to return to crime again and again.




                              Page 5
You MUST, therefore, firstly change yourselves and become
better and friendlier people and educate yourselves about
God's laws and economics etc. so that you can tell and teach
others, by mail until your release and then face to face to get
the Illegal laws abolished and return to God's laws, before It's
too late (Malachl ch. 4).

If you want to change the world you will find it IMPOSSIBLE,
UNLESS you change yourself first because, If not, no-one will
listen to you. As you are a part of the world, If you change
yourself you will already have changed the world a little bit
because you are part of It and you have changed. Then, like a
pebble (Rock) thrown Into a pond and the ripples reach to the
edge of it, you will affect everyone you meet and they will affect
others, until, like the pond, everyone will feel the effect.

If everyone became a pebble the world would be better
overnight.

The Bible is NOT a religious book in the way that you
understand religions with churches and ceremonies.

It is a Book sent by God - the King and Ruler of the Universe
and In it are the answers to ALL the ills of the world and to your
own personal problems.

It teaches you unselfishness; love; the right way to live; how to
relate and behave towards your neighbours; how to teach your
children the right values and bring them up correctly and
everything you need to know In order to live In harmony with
your surroundings, both people and nature.

If you know all of those things you will find that people will like
you and want you to be with them and/or work for/with them,
Instead of rejecting you as they do now. That means you will be
able to stay out of trouble, earn a decent living and have a good
life with a happy family.




                              Page 6
God has a Job for each and every one of you. That job Is to let
Him teach you how to fight evil and become the very best
person that you can become, so that you can help Him to put
the world right - His way. You can do this best by helping Him
to abolish all the false, Illegal man-made laws, rules,
regulations, taxes and political and religious systems that are
used to oppress you and everyone else.

The Solution to YOUR Problems:-

Rld yourself of resentment, anger, hate, fear and aggression
because they are ALL negative forms of energy and therefore
destructive of good. They ALL come from the dark negative
power of this world - Satan, the devil and destroyer.

The word Satan means the opposer because he opposes good
I.e. God (Go-d). The word devil means the liar because he
Invented it. Lies are evil - D/evil.

He Is the destroyer because he is full of hate and supplies the
world with It through each person, if you don't stop him. His Is
the evil voice In your head when he talks to you telepathlcally
and tries to get you to do what he wants you to do, which Is to
do evil for him. He controls people, almost everyone on earth,
by telling them telepathically in their minds, to do what he
wants them to do. He supplies them with the energy to do this,
and that energy comes In the form of negative, destructive
energy e.g. anger, hate, fear and aggression.

As he Is the destroyer, you can NEVER use his negative,
destructive weapons - fear, anger and aggression to build a
better world. You would, If you use them, only be adding to his
destructive force. Destroying ANYTHING, except evil, will only
keep you In prison longer and keep sending you back, over and
over again.




                             Page 7
You must NEVER let Satan make you lose your temper or self-
control because, If you do, he will take you over ("like a man
possessed") and use you to do or say what he wants and later,
when he has let go of you, you will be sorry and wonder what
made you do or say such a terrible thing that you never meant
to do. Satan did, because you lost your self-control and gave
control of yourself and your mouth over to him to cause
trouble. Then, when he has done It, he leaves you to take the
blame and pay for it. Nice friend to have, huh??

if you want to stop him from getting YOU into trouble NEVER
lose your temper.

You can NOT overcome darkness and evil by using darkness
and evil, you just add to it and make it worse.

The ONLY way to overcome darkness and evil is by using the
light and good. Just like when the sun rises in the East and
lightens even to the West and it destroys the darkness easily
and painlessly, so good (the light) destroys evil (the darkness)
easily and painlessly. Darkness is afraid of and can't move into
the light because it would destroy itself and become light.

You must, as you rid yourself of the dark energy, replace it with
positive, light constructive energy - God's energy (the Force)
and fill yourself with love, unselfishness, compassion, peace of
mind, understanding, wisdom, knowledge and
DETERMINATION. Determination is the MOST important.
Determination not to slip back and lose your self-control so that
Satan can’t get you into trouble again.Determlnation to rid the
world of mountains of evil and oppression and replace it with
love, justice and compassion etc.

Every normal human+being has two telepathic voices in their
head - a good one and an evil one, both of whom try to
Influence that human+being to do their will.

If you put a letter d on the word evil (devil) you will see whose
voice that is.

If you remove a letter o from the word good (God) you will see
whose voice that is.

                             Page 8
        When the devil talks to you and tells you to do bad things and
        tries to make you lose your temper to do worse things, God
        tells you NOT to do those things and tells you that you KNOW it
        would be wrong of you.

        As this happens you must tell Satan to go away and ask God to
        help you not to give In to Satan's wishes.

        You will NEVER defeat Satan alone (on your own) you NEED
        God's help.

        Satan talks to approx. 6,000,000,000 people, all day, every day,
        individually and all at the same time and controls them and
        their actions, words and thoughts, unless they stop him. That Is
j       why the world is in such a mess.

        He is far more powerful than you can possibly imagine and you
        will NEVER be able to DEFEAT him and break his hold over you,
        on your OWN.

        The ONLY way to defeat Satan is to get someone far more
        powerful than he Is to HELP you. The ONLY person who can
        help you is GOD. Ask Him to!

        Learn to communicate with the good (God's) voice inside your
        head (Matthew 6v6) and ask Him to help you to rid yourself of
        Satan and ask Him to teach you how to be good - like God.

        God is the only person (being) who can teach you to be good
        because He Is the ONLY one that knows what good (God) Is. No
        father, mother, priest, politician or other human can teach you
        to be good because they do not know what good is, or they
        would not be a sinner (and they ALL are) and they would not be
        here, on this prison planet.

        Yes, this entire planet Is a prison, where EVERYONE Is bad.
    j   People call themselves sinners because their egoes don't like
        the word bad, but a sinner IS a bad person. It Is derived from
        SATAN IU US -(S ./IM /U S )-S in n e rs .




                                    Page 9
Everyone on earth Is a sinner and bad and the only places
where everyone is bad is a prison and this planet is the
universe’s prison planet.

Remember that you start changing the world by changing
yourself first, NOT last. You do that by getting God to help you
to drive Satan out of you and by being determined to KEEP him
out.

To win, overcome and endure to the end, you will need
tremendous faith, which is only another word for trust, in God
and will need to get to know Him. God has NEVER wanted
anyone to believe in Him, He has only EVER wanted YOU to get
to KNOW Him. You do that by talking to Him telepathically
(mentally) 24 hours a day EVERY day of your life, and becoming
His son and learning how to be like Him (good). Get His help
and advice on EVERYTHING that you do, say and think.

if you break your contact with God, even for a moment, you will
let Satan back in and Satan will drive you crazy, with what you
think is your imagination running riot but it is NOT, It is Satan
talking to you, trying to frighten you into serving him again,
instead of God.

Remember he is the liar and his threats are ALL bluffs - LIES.
You must CALL his bluffs. If you don't you will LOSE. God will
always defend you, IF you are doing His will, and He Is FAR
more powerful than Satan.

YOU have to learn to do God's will on Earth as It Is done in
heaven, already. His will for you is that you talk to Him and get
to know Him, so He can teach you how to be good and
overcome evil. I don't think that that is a lot to ask of anyone.

Remember, if you want to live in a better world, you start by
Improving yourself, and setting a good example to others.

The prison staff are not your enemies. They did not create the
laws and evil system that sent you here, they are victims of the
system, just like you.



                            Page 10
Work together with them to make your stay here as productive
and as pleasant as possible and to change and destroy,
peacefully, that evil system that made you poor and sent you
here.

You could NEVER meet a greater rebel and revolutionary
against the evil of this world, than Christ himself.

It was the jewlsh government (Sanhedrin) and their rich friends
that crucified Jesus the Nazarite because he was considered to
be a threat to their great wealth and power. He never broke any
law. All he did was tell the TRUTH and enlighten people from
the darkness and lies that the government had kept them under,
to keep them poor and make themselves rich. Some things
never change.

The rich are the REAL criminals because they have stolen the
share of the poor people by fraud (James 5 v4) under their own
illegally made (fraudulent) laws. The problem Is that because of
ignorance of God's laws, and being kept in the dark, the poor
are in prison instead of the REAL criminals - the rich.

The governments and their rich friends and judges call you
anarchists but it is they themselves that are the anarchists
because they refuse to keep God's laws and be governed by
Him. Choosing, rather, to govern themselves and you by their
Illegal laws and taxes (Psalm 2).

People usually accuse others, of doing what they themselves
have done, to try to hide their own guilt.

The politicians and priests have worked together (Revelations
18 v9) to create the false impression that Christ was a wimp In a
white frock and sandals and that he was very poor. He was, In
fact, a revolutionary, otherwise the rich would not have
crucified him, after firstly putting him in prison, just like they
have done to you.

Jesus the Nazarite needed no gun or other weapon to fight evil.
The only weapon he used was the greatest and most powerful
weapon on Earth, which Is far more powerful than any gun or
even nuclear weapon, the TRUTH.

                            Page 11
The truth will remove any mountain of evil. Learn what It Is,
how to find It and recognise It, where It comes from - from God.
Then learn to love It, and how to use It, and then use it to
destroy evil. Shine the light of truth on lies and darkness and
you will always win. It may be difficult to learn but once you
have learned to use jt properly, you will be invincible.

You can learn all this by following EXACTLY, and to the letter,
the teachings of the greatest revolutionary - Christ.

Don't let anyone try to tell you what he said or what it means -
read it for yourself. Priests will tell you It doesn't mean what it
says and often that it means the opposite. They call Christ a
liar and claim to work for him. Don't believe them, read what
Christ actually did say. Christ IS and always tells the TRUTH.
Believe him and not the opposers. It means EXACTLY what it
says.

Read what he says about the SCRIBES and about the
PHARISEES. The SCRIBES are the judiciary (lawyers, judges
etc.). The PHARISEES are the politicians.

Read Matthew 23 N.B. verse 8 - Rabbi means priest - all of them
of EVERY religion.

Some things have never changed because you have never
learned the teachings and the truth and how to use it to change
the world. Learn it now! You have lots of time on your hands -
useitw eii!

The world Is only the way it Is today because everyone has
been kept in the dark. Use the truth to enlighten and free
everyone and make the world a better place for everyone and to
set yourself free, FREE, not only from prison but also from
oppression.

Enlighten people to who they REALLY are - Israel and to the
PERFECT laws and economics of God, as opposed to the dark,
evil laws made up by selfish men who are serving their father
the lord of darkness - Satan.

Then, as easily and painlessly as light vanquishes darkness, so
wlil come, with the light, justice, love (not sex) and peace of
mind and peace on earth.

Just to destroy another lie, forever, I will point out that Jesus
the Nazarite wa3 not a poor man. There Is absolutely no
Biblical evidence to support this LiE. The MISquote they use to
support this iie is that there was "no room at the inn." It says
that there wa3 no ROOM at the inn, not that they had no money
to stay there.

Joseph was a carpenter and in those days, everything that was
made was made by the local carpenter. Therefore he would
never be without work or short of money.

At the nativity, the three kings came to pay homage to the "King
of kings.” They brought gifts to show their respect and they
brought the three most expensive things on earth at that tlme:-
gold, frankincense and myrrh.

They came to pay homage and show respect and so did not
bring a little bit, for fear of offending or insulting the "King of
kings." They brought a lot of gold, frankincense and myrrh -
the three most expensive things on earth.

Also, Joseph of Arimathea, the rich man who put the crucified
body Into his own tomb, was Jesus the Nazarite's great-uncle,
the uncle of Mary the mother of Jesus. He was a devoted great-
uncle and disciple and was one of the three richest men in
Israel.

You have just been given three very good reasons why Jesus
the Nazarite wa3 NEVER poor. He was not rich either, but
always had enough.

The lie that Jesus was poor was started by the rich people who
formed the parliament and they got the churches to pass on the
lie, In order to keep the people poor and quiet, and stop them
rebelling.




                              Page 13
By saying that Jesus was poor and that the people, by being
poor, were following in his footsteps, they have kept the people
down and poor for centuries (Revelations 18 v9). They have
also made themselves and the churches richer and richer.

The church of England Is the biggest and richest land-owner In
Britain and yet there are hundreds of thousands of poor who
have no houses, some of whom live in cardboard boxes. The
Vatican is the richest business on earth and sits on 7 hills -
read Revelations 17 v9.

Stay away from ALL political parties and religions and talk
ONLY to God In private, In your head, not in a church, as you
were TOLD to do in Matthew 6 v1-8 N.B. verses 5 and 6 - by
Christ - HIMSELF. (Synagogue means church).




                            Page 14
                     Conclusion.
Use your time In prison to study and learn the beauty and
justice of God's laws and economics, so that you can teach
others and change the worid.

if you learn, by following Christ's teachings, how to become like
Christ, you will eventually even be released from this prison
planet and to go home to your REAL home where you originally
came from, back out in the universe, and to live there with God,
your new found loving Father.

The reason that God gave Moses the 10- COMMANDments is
because they are the laws of the Universe and you have to
PROVE that you can keep them here , under ALL
circumstances, amongst all of this evil and temptation in this
worid, before He can release you from this prison planet and let
you go HOME to your REAL families in heaven (the universe).

Now you can see that God has told you the TRUTH because His
prophecies have come TRUE, about the times of oppression
and the poor having their faces ground and having to steal and
become violent to survive, because you are part of It, you can
believe all - ALL that He has told you.

He has told you, on the last page of the Old Testament, that at
the end, just before the last day comes, His people MUST
remember and return to the laws that He gave to Moses In
Horeb, In order to put the world right, or else He wiil come and
burn you ALL up.

Read Malachi chapter 4 and you will see for yourself. Do it NOW
before it Is TOO late. You will NOT get another chance.




                             Page 15
PLEASE take my advice with the love that goes with i t Use it to
heal yourselves and this my poor sick worid of ALL its Ills.




On remand for fighting for the poor by telling the truth because
I am the only one doing it. I want your help. YOU certainly NEED
mine.

             On The Wav to Emmaus Again
                (at the end of the 20th Century-)

God states in Genesis 49:22-24 (k.J.A.V. of the Bible) that from
Joseph will come The Shepherd - The Stone of Israel NOT from
the Jews, as is clearly stated in Genesis chapter 49:-
49:10 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah [to Joseph], nor a
(God’s) Law-giver from between his feet, UNTIL Shiloh comes
[from Joseph-Ephraim verses 22-24]; and unto him [shall] the
gathering of the people [be].
49:22 Joseph [is] a fruitful bough, [even] a fruitful bough by a
well; [whose] branches run over the wall:
49:23 The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot [at him], and
hated him:
49:24 But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands
were made strong by the hands of the mighty [God] of Jacob; (from
there [is] The Shepherd, The [Comer] Stone of Israel:)(Daniel 2:34-
35; 45)

         The "Stone" has a twofold interpretation, meaning Jacob’s
Pillar-Stone which is the Throne of Israel but also meaning The
King of Israel himself as well as the Throne.
         The King of Israel, the Good Shepherd, the Corner-stone,
Shiloh, the Messiah, the Christ is referred to throughout Scripture
as the" Stone".
         In the Book of Daniel in the Bible, the Stone, that is cut
out (shaped) without (human) hands, which smites the statue seen
by Nebuchadnezzar in his dream, knocks it down and grinds it
into powder and it then blows away in the wind, that same “Stone”
(Christ) then grows into a huge “Mountain” (Government) that
fills the whole earth.
Daniel 2:31 Thou, O king, (Nebuchadnezzar) sawest, and behold
a great image. This great image, whose brightness [was] excellent,



                               n
stood before thee; and the form thereof [was] terrible.
2:32 This image’s head [was] of fine gold, his breast and his arms
of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,
2:33 His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.
2:34 Thou sawest till that a Stone was cut out without hands, which
smote the image upon his feet [that were] of iron and clay, and
brake them to pieces.
2:35 Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold,
broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the sum­
mer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place
was found for them: and the “Stone” that smote the image became
a great “mountain”, and filled the whole earth.
         The “Stone” is a Diamond - no other stone is indistructable
and can grind metal to powder or reflect and give out Light of
great beauty and intensity like Christ.
         So there we have it. God says in verses 10 and 22-24 of
Genesis chapter 49 that the Messiah will come from Joseph not
Judah/Jew-dah (the Jews).
         However, to be technically correct, it should say from
Ephraim because Jacob-Israel gave his birthright (the birthright of
Israel) to Joseph’s son Ephraim, not to Joseph; as recorded in
Genesis 48:16:-
48:16 The Angel which redeemed me (Jacob-Israel) from all evil,
bless the lads; and let my name [Israel] be named on them (let
Ephraim and Manasseh be called Israel), and the name of my fa­
 thers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the
 midst of the earth.
48:17 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand
 upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his
 father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head unto Manasseh’s
 head.
 48:18 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this
 [is] the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.



                                  2
48:19 And his father refused, and said, I know [it], my son, I know
[it]: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but
truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed
shall become a multitude (Commonwealth) of nations.
48:20 And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee [Joseph] shall
Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh:
and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.

So why did God use the word Joseph instead of the word Ephraim?

It was to give a clue to the exact location that the body used by the
Christ would be born.
        The descendants of Joseph’s son Ephraim are the English
so we now know in which country the body to be used by the
Spirit-Being known as the Christ would be bom but that is not
precise enough for God. He therefore gave the clue to the exact
location by using the word Joseph. The descendants of Ephraim’s
brother, Manasseh, are the English’s brother nation, the Ameri­
cans.

How does the word Joseph tell us exactly where the body would
be bom?

Joseph was famous for his dreams and his ability to interpret the
dreams of others, which included the dreams of the Pharaoh (king)
of Egypt. It was due to Joseph’s interpretation of the Pharaoh’s
dream that he became Pharaoh’s second in command. Pharaoh ruled
the world at that time, so Joseph was the second most powerful
man on earth.

But how does this help us to locate the birthplace of the body that
is to be used by the Christ today?




                                  3
Joseph’s own most famous dream; which was the reason that his
brothers, who fathered the other eleven tribes of Israel, including
his brother Judah, progenitor of the Jews, sold him into slavery in
Egypt; was his dream about his brother’s sheaves of com bowing
down to his sheaf of com in his Sheaf-Field.
        As a punishment, for having sold Joseph into slavery in
Egypt, his brother’s children went into slavery in Egypt for 400
years, until set free in the Exodus with Moses. God says, through
Paul’s letter to the Galatians 6:7 “Be not deceived; God is not
mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, THAT shall he also reap.”

But that is another important story and lesson.

Joseph was famous for his dream of the Sheaf-Field, so what does
that tell us about where the body to be used by the Christ or Shiloh,
as he is called in Genesis 49:10, is to be bom?

There is, today, a city in the land of Ephraim (England) that bears
the name Sheaf-Field which has been, over the centuries, shortened
to Sheffield.
       The Scriptures do not leave things there. That would not
be accurate enough for God. We are told, by Jesus himself, in what
year the birth would be.
        The disciples asked Christ, the Being within the human
body called Jesus, when he (Christ) would come again and what
would be the sign?
        Christ replied that when they saw the Fig Tree put forth
new shoots, and begin to grow again, they would know that “Summer”
(the new age - Sabbath Millennium) was near, after 6 millennia -
(6,000 years) of Satan’s mis-rule, known as “Winter”.

How does this tell us what year?




                                □
The Fig Tree that was cursed and withered before the disciples
eyes because it brought forth no fruit, unto God, was the Jews.
The “Fig Tree” is the emblem of the Jews in Scripture. Jesus cursed
the Fig Tree and it withered and died, symbolizing what was go­
ing to happen to the Jews for rejecting their rightful King.
        The Jews were kicked out of Palestine, had no homeland
and were persecuted for 2000 years, as God’s punishment for re­
jecting, persecuting and killing their rightful King and rejecting
the New Covenant referred to in Ezekiel 34, culminating in the
Holocaust under Adolf Hitler (the anti-christ).
         The Fig Tree then began to awaken from its withered state
 and began to put forth new shoots in Palestine when David Ben-
 Gurion announced in the Museum Hall in Tel-Aviv to the world,
 under the umbrella of the United Nations, that the Jews had estab­
 lished a Jewish State in the land of Israel on 14th May 1948.
 From that year the desolate, cursed land began, through irrigation,
 to flourish and put forth new shoots, with immigration of Jews
 from all over the world, the "Fig Tree" revived and put forth new
 shoots, but still has bom no fruit.

So now we have the country of birth, the city of birth and the
year of the birth of the new body to be used by the Christ.

Jesus told us also that Christ would not for a generation (40 years
according to the Holy Scriptures), claim his rightful throne - the
Throne of David upon which would be sitting a descendant of
king David, as promised to David by God, testified to in the Bible
in 2 Samuel 7:16 and 1 kings 2:4 and 9:5 and again in Jeremiah
33:17 “For thus saith the “I AM”; David shall never want a man
(descendant) to sit upon the throne of the House of Israel.”

The word Brit-ish is Hebrew and means “the man or People of
The Covenant” in other words “the True People Israel” and the



                                  5
“House of Israel”.
         Elizabeth the. Second is a direct descendant of David as
have been all of the British-Israel monarchs since David himself,
backwards in time through all of the English kings, preceded by
the Scottish kings, preceded by the Irish kings, preceded by king
Zedekiah of Jerusalem and all the kings back to David himself.
They have all been crowned sitting upon the Throne of David,
which is the “Stone of Destiny” - Jacob’s Pillar-Stone now wrongly
called the “Stone of Scone”, except for Elizabeth the Second be­
cause she became the monarch after 1948, when Christ had
already returned. God would not allow her or anyone, except for
Christ himself, to be crowned upon that Stone; whilst His oldest
Son, Prince (St.) Michael, the rightful King, is upon the Earth,
incarnated inside a human body.
Daniel 12:1 And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince
which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a
time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation........
Matthew 24:21 For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not
since the beginning of the world to this time......................
Daniel 10:21 But I will show thee that which is noted in the
Scripture of Truth (Prophecy): and there is NONE (no-one) that
holdeth with Me in these things, but Michael your prince.
         To prevent anyone, other than Christ, from being crowned
upon the Stone of Destiny, God got some Scottish Nationalists to
 steal the Stone from Westminster Abbey and take it back to Scot­
 land, on 25th of December (Christ-mas Day) in 1950.
         When George the Sixth died and Elizabeth was to be
 crowned in June of 1953, the Scottish Nationalists sent a stone to
 England for her to be crowned upon but, according to a death-bed
 confession reported in the press, it was not the real Stone.
         The original had a crack in it and whilst making a forgery
 which also had to have a crack in it, in order to look genuine, the
 stone broke in two.




                                Q
        Many years later it was reported in the press that, upon his
death-bed, one of the Scottish Nationalists who had stolen the real
Stone confessed to having taken the Stone from Westminster Abbey
and that they had sent Elizabeth a fake stone. People on their death­
bed have no reason to lie and every reason to tell the Truth.

Christ said not for a generation (40 years) would he claim his right­
ful Throne, the British-Israel Throne of David.
         In June of 1988, 40 years from the Fig Tree putting forth
its new shoots in 1948, Christ served a High Court Writ upon the
British Parliament, at court in the City of Sheffield, where his new
body had been bom in 1948, demanding that he be acknowledged
by Parliament as the Rightful British-Israel King.
         Just as happened 2000 years before, when he was rejected
by the “House of Judah”, Christ was again rejected but this time
by the other branch of Jacob-Israel’s children - the “House of Israel”.
         This then condemned the “House of Israel” ; who had by
their rejection of Christ declared themselves to be Christ’s enemies,
like the “House of Judah”; to be punished by God and turned into
Christ’s footstool. That punishment involves defeat and slaughter
of both “Houses” at Armageddon and their return to slavery again
as they were in Egypt and later in Assyria because they rejected
The Covenant and God’s Laws.
         Christ said that this generation who were bom in 1948
would see all things come to pass and the setting up o f his
 “Kingdom without end”, which would fill the whole earth.

Christ said, “A Prophet is NEVER accepted in his own land and
by his own people.”

       The Scriptures tell us where Christ would go, in Isaiah, in
chapter 33:-
33:15 He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that




                                 D
despiseth the gain by oppressions, that shaketh his hands from
taking of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of bloodshed,
and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil;
33:16 He shall dwell on high: his place of defence [shall be] the
Fortress of Rock: bread shall be given him; his waters [shall be]
sure.
33:17 Thine eyes shall see the King in his beauty: they shall be­
hold the land that is very far off (Israel).

this same location is confirmed by Sura 52 of the True Koran:-
1. By the M ount of Revelation (of Christ) - the Rock;
2. By a Decree inscribed [in Prophecy]
3. In a Scroll opened-up [Isaiah 33:16-17; 42:11-12];
4. By the much-frequented house;
5. By the Canopy Raised High [the Levanter-cloud];
6. And by the Ocean filled with Swell [the Atlantic];
7. Verily, the Doom from thy Lord will indeed come to pass;-
8. There is none can avert it;-

        The Scriptures tell us that the rejected King will go to the
Fortress of Rock (Gibraltar) and offer his life for his sheep to try
to get them to recognise him and to follow him to the Fortress of
Rock, so that he could then teach its inhabitants about True Justice
and freedom from poverty under God’s Laws and Economics; how
to “Sing the New Song”; overcome and survive:-

Isaiah 42:10 Sing unto the “I AM” the “New Song”, [and] His
praise from the “end of the earth”, ye that go down to the sea, and
all that is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.
42:11 Let the “wilderness” and the cities thereof lift up [their voice],
the villages [that] darkness doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of
the Rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.
42:12 Let them give glory unto the “I AM”, and declare His praise



                                   8
in the islands.

The New Song is the “Song of Moses” and the “Song of The Lamb”
combined into one “New Song”.

The "Song of Moses" and the "Song of The Lamb" are the Old and
the New Covenants, respectively, making the “New Song” that no
man can learn except the 144,000 that are redeemed, by the King
personally, from the Earth. “NO man (not one man) can come to
the Father except by me.”
        The Scriptures confirm that Christ’s new body will have a
NEW name that he alone would know, until his TRUE followers
numbering only 144,000 out of a total of 6,000,000,000 people
would recognise his voice, accept his new name and follow him -
“As the Times of Noah will it be, when the Son of Man is re­
vealed” and only a handful of people believed Noah, everyone
else died.

Revelation 19:12 His eyes [were] as a flame of fire, and on his
head [were] many crowns (King of kings); and he had a NAME
written, that NO man knew, but HE himself (ch. 2:17; 3:12).
2:17 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden
manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a NEW
name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth
[it].
3:12 Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the Temple of my
God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the
name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, [which is]
New Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven (a spaceship)
from my God: and [I will write upon him] my NEW name.

John 10:2 But he that entereth in by the door (tells the Truth) is the



                                  9
Shepherd of the sheep.
10:3 To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and
he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.
10:4 And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before
them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.
10:5 And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him:
for they know not the voice of strangers.
10:6 This parable spoke Jesus unto them: but they understood not
what things they were which he spoke unto them.
10:7 Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto
you, I am the door of the sheep.
 10:8 ALL that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but
the sheep did not hear them (but the goats did).
 10:9 I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved,
and shall go in and out, and find pasture.
 10:10 The thief cometh not, except to steal, and to kill, and to
destroy: I am come that they might have Life, and that they might
have [it] more abundantly.
 10:111 am the Good Shepherd: the Good Shepherd giveth his life
for the sheep.
 10:12 But he that is an hireling, and not the Shepherd, whose own
the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep,
 and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.
 10:13 The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not
 for the sheep.
 10:14 I am the Good Shepherd, and know my [sheep], and am
 known by mine.
 10:15 As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I
 lay down my life for the sheep.
 10:16 And other sheep I have (the “House of Israel”), which are
 not of this fold (the “House of Judah”): them also I must bring,
 and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, [and]
 one Shepherd (Ezekiel 37:22 and Genesis 48:10).




                                m
“And he had a new name that no man knew but he himself.” And
no man could receive his new name except those who hear and
recognise his voice, accept his new name and identity and upon
whom he writes his new name personally and whom he then teaches
to overcome and survive, whilst the rest of mankind is executed.

Matthew 25:32 And before him shall be gathered all nations: and
he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth
[his] sheep from the goats:
25:33 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on
the left.
25:34 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come,
ye blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you
from the foundation of the world:
25:35 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty,
and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:
25:36 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I
was in prison, and ye came unto me.
25:37 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when
saw we thee an hungred, and fed [thee]? or thirsty, and gave [thee]
drink?
25:38 When saw we thee a stranger, and took [thee] in? or naked,
and clothed [thee]?
25:39 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?
25:40 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say
unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done [it] unto one of the least of
these my brethren, ye have done [it] unto me.
25:41 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart
from me, ye cursed, into Everlasting Fire, prepared for the devil
and his angels (YOU that do not DO God’s Will):
25:42 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty,
and ye gave me no drink:
25:431 was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed




                                n
me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.
25:44 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw
we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or
in prison, and did not minister unto thee?
25:45 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you,
Inasmuch as ye did [it] not to one of the least of these, ye did [it]
not to me.
25:46 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but
the righteous into Life Eternal.

Zechariah 12:10 “And they (Jerusalem) shall look upon M E whom
they pierced (whilst inside of the son of Mary body) and they (the
Jews) shall MOURN for HIM (Jesus) as one moumeth for His
only SON, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in
bitterness for HIS firstborn."

12:11 In that Day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as
the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the Valley of Megiddon (as they
too are EXECUTED).

The Valley of Megiddon is below the mountains of Megiddo -
Har-Megiddo or in English - Armageddon - ARMAGEDDON.

TWO 2 comings NOT one. ME and H IM . The Lord God says so.
Same SPIRIT (God is SPIRIT not flesh) TWO bodies (ME and
HIM)

I could easily go into much more detail, if necessary, but perhaps
you have already arrived at Emmaus, by taking this short-cut, and
have found your Rabboni and King? NO-ONE else could possi­
bly break the seals, understand and fulfill the Prophecies, because
Father told Daniel exactly that in Daniel 10:21, which I have al­
ready quoted, previously, and I also said so myself, in chapter 5,
of my Revelation to John.

   West Midlands Police




HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY


         Part V
The Interim Report by LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR was highly

critical of the Police Operation at Hillsborough and

of certain individual senior officers.    This next

part of the submission will deal specifically with

police evidence in relation to events leading up to

and immediately following the disaster.



Before proceeding further, it is perhaps pertinent to

mention that by far the largest portion of this

evidence is contained in either recollections, or in

the case of some of the very senior officers, written

submissions which were originally provided for the

Judicial Inquiry.   This means that they were subject

to scrutiny by solicitors on behalf of South

Yorkshire Police and in some instances were edited,

before they were handed to Liaison Officers for the

West Midlands Police.   It also means that the

officers were not interviewed and that recollections

w;ere not made under the provisions of the Criminal

Justice Act 1967.



That explained, basically this part of the submission

will be split into four for ease of reference.    The

first section will deal with South Yorkshire Police

experience at Hillsborough, pre match planning which
will include a comparison of both the 1988 and 1989

Football Association Cup Semi-Final police orders,

mutual aid arrangements, the involvement of the

British Transport Police and details of briefing.

This will be followed by a section on communications

which will deal with the police control box and its

relationship to the ground control room, Hammerton

Road Police Station and the South Yorkshire Police

Headquarters at Snig Hill.



The penultimate section will consider police evidence

leading up to the disaster which will start away from

the ground with reception/parking of coaches and

trains and then gradually work closer to deal with

Leppings Lane area, the perimeter gates courtyard,

turnstiles and exit gates ’A ’, ’B ’ and ’C ’.   Inside

the ground the report will progress with evidence on

the concourse, tunnel, West Stand terraces and

seating area and the perimeter track being considered

and then the police detention room.    The last part

will examine the police emergency planning and their

reaction post disaster.



PLANNING



The South Yorkshire Police (and the local forces

preceeding) have considerable experience in dealing
                       with major events including cup semi finals at

                       Hillsborough going back to 1912.     That experience

                       including previous incidents of crushing at Leppings

                       Lane turnstiles and terraces has already been

Doc.No(s) 192          documented.   Their Standing Instructions for the

Doc.Page(s) 998-1044   Policing of Football Hatches    deal with all policy

                       and procedures for the force area.



St.Page(s) 846-859     Chief Superintendent Brian Leonard MOLE was the

                       Divisional Commander of ’F ’ Division where the

                       Hillsborough Stadium is located, from October 1985

                       until 27 March 1989.    As such he was responsible for

                       planning and commanding a number of cup semi finals

                       including the one in 1988 between Liverpool and

                       Nottingham Forest.     He was involved in the early

                       stages of planning arrangements for the 1989 semi­

                       final, using the same planning team and appointing

                       the sector commanders before handing over to his

                       successor, Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD.      On 15

                       April 1989 he relieved Chief Superintendent

                       DUCKENFIELD at the ground.



St.Paee(s) 2457-2469   Chief Superintendent David Godfrey DUCKENFIELD and

                       Chief Superintendent MOLE attended a number of

                       meetings together before the event.     Chief

                       Superintendent DUCKENFIELD then supervised members of

                       the planning team in the completion of arrangements,




                                                                                 121
                       including preparation of the ’F ’ Division Police

                       Order for the match, and on the 15 April 1989 he was

                       in overall command in the Police Control Box,

                       initially of the operation in regard to the semi

                       final and later in dealing with the disaster.    It is

                       the role he played which has incurred the most

                       criticism.



Part II                Walter JACKSON. Assistant Chief Constable

St.Page(s) 860-869     (Operations) acting in a supervisory capacity, as he

                       had in previous years, overviewed the initial

                       arrangements by Chief Superintendent MOLE and ensured

                       the continuity of hand over to Chief Superintendent

                       DUCKENFIELD.   On 15 April 1989 he attended the match

                       in an informal role, reverting to a formal role as

                       the disaster unfolded.



St.Page(s) 2470-2488   Superintendent Bernard Dean   MURRAY is the local (FI)

                       Sub Divisional Commander at Hammerton Road Police

                       Station responsible for day to day policing of the

                       area including the Hillsborough Stadium.    He was

                       involved in the planning for the 1988 game with Chief

                       Superintendent MOLE and at that match commanded the

                       Police Control Box.   He was similarly engaged with

                       the planning for the 1989 semi final first with Chief

                       Superintendent MOLE and then with Chief

                       Superintendent DUCKENFIELD.   On 15 April 1989 he was




                                                                             122
                        with Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD in the Police

Doc.No 207              Control Box, during which time he kept a handwritten

Doc.Page(s) 1445-1447   log.



                        Members of the planning team were:



St.Page(s) 2489-2501    Chief Inspector David John BEAL - Deputy to the Ground

                        Sector Commander on 15 April 1989 working in Spion Kop

                        area - Sector 1A.



St.Page(s) 2502-2514    Inspector Steven Robert SEWELL - ’F ’Division Football

                        Liaison Officer since October 1987 - Engaged on

                        general duties on 15 April 1989.



Part II                 Inspector Clive William CALVERT, previously ’F ’

St.Page(s) 1123-1128    Division Football Liaison’s Officer 1979-1987

                        inclusive - Responsible for serials on Spion Kop on 15

                        April 1989.



Doc.No 193              Copies of the Police Orders for the Football

Doc.Page(s) 1045-1127   Association Cup Semi-Finals in both 1988 and 1989

Doc.No 194              prepared by the planning team are included.     Separate

Doc.Page(s) 1128-1210   police orders for 1989 - ’D ’ Division, (Sheffield City

                        Centre) and the Traffic Division are available but are

                        not included in the papers because they are

                        subordinate to the main order and do not materially

                        effect the overall picture.
                        Because there has been criticism of the police

                        planning in 1989 compared with none in 1988, a

                        comparison of the two match orders has been made.

                        This concludes that the 1989 order basically was a

                        repetition of the 1988, although there were

                        significant reductions in manpower.    Details are as

                        follows:



                        DUTIES                 1988     1989    Variation

                        A redudction of 128 officers.   No significant

                        reductions were made to the number of officers in the

                        Leppings Lane area.   Details of how specific

Doc.No 195              reductions were made are set out in Appendix *A* to

Doc.Page(s) 1211-1235   the statement by Assistant Chief Constable

                        (Operations) Walter JACKSON.



                        Other minor variations between the two orders relate

                        to gate opening times, 12 noon in 1988 and 11 am in




                                                                                124
                        1989, the use of a fixed wing aircraft in 1988 and the

                        use of adhesive stickers on searched vehicles also in

                        1988.   No fixed wing aircraft was used in 1989 and

                        although vehicles were searched no stickers were used.



                        There is no mention in the 1988 order of barriers to

                        act as filters being placed across Leppings Lane on

                        the approach to the Stadium entrance to prevent non

                        ticket holders approaching the turnstiles.   Nor is

                        there any reference in the order to a serial of

                        manpower on the concourse behind the West Stand

                        blocking off the tunnel under the Stand, as was

                        alleged by some supporters following the disaster.

                        There is evidence from police officers that this

                        action was taken and relevant statements are included.



                        Recollections made by Chief Superintendent MOLE,

                        Superintendent MURRAY and Inspector SEWELL all deal

                        with the proposed reduction in manpower which it is

                        suggested was to be of the order of 10 per cent.

                        Obviously in considering this sort of reduction in

                        1989, there would be some regard to the experience of

                        1988 and to current intelligence on both teams’

                        supporters and their behaviour.



Doc. No 196             A separate Operations Department Police Order which is

Doc.Page(s) 1236-1256   complimentary to the ’F ’ Division Order for 1989




                                                                               125
                       refers to Police, Mounted and Dog Sections from both

                       South Yorkshire Police and other forces including West

                       Yorkshire, Merseyside and Nottingham who provided

                       mutual aid.



                       BRIEFINGS



                       Briefings were conducted on the 14 and 15 April 1989,

                       prior to the commencement of the police operation, by

                       Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD, Superintendent

Part IV                MURRAY and Inspector SEWELL.     An intelligence briefing

Doc.No 179             from Detective Sergeant George CHARLESWORTH was also

Doc.Page(s) 867-872    included.     Further briefings then followed by the

                       Sector Commanders with their respective staffs.

                       Officers of Inspector rank and above were provided

                       with a complete copy of the police order, Sergeants

                       were given a copy of their serial order extracted from

                       the parent order.



St.Page(s) 2515-2526   Superintendent Roger GREENWOOD was the Football Ground

                       Sector Commander, Sector 1.     (He performed Liverpool

                       (Sector 2) duties in 1988).     In addition to briefing

                       his staff, he took command of the inside of the ground

                       during the police operation on 15 April 1989.     He is

                       the Senior Officer seen on video running onto the

                       pitch at 1505 hrs to ask the referee to stop the

                       game.   He was then involved in the rescue operation.




                                                                              126
St.Page(s) 2527-2547        Superintendent Roger MARSHALL was the Liverpool Sector

                            Commander (Sector 2) responsible for the area in and

                            around Leppings Lane.    In 1988 he performed duties as

                            Ground Sector Commander (Sector 1).    He also briefed

                            subordinates before taking up command of his area and

                            he witnessed the behaviour and build up of Liverpool

                            supporters at the turnstiles.    It was he who asked for

                            Leppings Lane to be closed to traffic.    He also sought

                            the assistance of a police Land Rover carrying a

                            public address system.   Later he asked for authority

                            from Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD to open exit

                            gates A, B, C to relieve crushing at the turnstiles.

                            He also can be seen at various times on video amongst

                            the Liverpool supporters.

                            COMMUNICATIONS



Doc.No 202                  A paper fully detailing the police communications

Doc.Page(s) 1290-1303       network, including Ultra High Frequency (UHF), Very

                            High Frequency (VHF) radio channels and the telephone

                            system for the cup semi final on 15 April 1989 has

                            been prepared by South Yorkshire Police.    This should




                                                                                127
be read in conjunction with paragraph 4.11 of the ’F ’

Division police order.



Communications with South Yorkshire Metropolitan

Ambulance and the Fire Service were by direct

telephone links from the South Yorkshire Police

Control Room.




Other means of communications not already mentioned

are the independently operated Sheffield Wednesday

Football Club radio system directed from the Club

control room and used by senior members of staff.      One

of these radios was available in the Police Control

Box to allow communication with the Club control room

and with club employees.   The ground public address

system can be regarded as another means of

communication.   This is normally used by the disc

jockey but can be over-ridden by a police officer in

the Police Control Box.



There are a number of recollections of officers

responsible for the issue of personal radios to police

officers on duty at the ground.
                       POLICE CONTROL BOX



                       Both Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD and

                       Superintendent MURRAY were in the Police Control Box

                       on 15 April 1989.     Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD

                       was in overall command of the police operation.    Mr

                       DUCKENFIELD positioned himself in the Police Control

                       Box and Superintendent MURRAY was in charge of the

                       Control.    They both detail a series of relevant events

                       leading up to and immediately following the disaster,

                       including the difficulties over radio communication.

                       They also deal with the crucial opening of exit gates

                       ’A ’ ’B ’ and ’C ’.



                       Also present in the Police Control Box were:-



St.Page(s) 2554-2565   Chief Inspector Robert Ian McROBBIE who had recently

                       joined the ’F ’ Division and was originally there to

                       observe.    He describes the situation in the Police

                       Control Box with difficulties over radio

                       communications and details a series of relevant events

                       including the decision to open the exit gates ’A ’ ’B ’

                       and ’C ’.    Chief Inspector McROBBIE also mentions

                       The location and function of the Club control room and

                       its civilian occupants have previously been discussed

                       in Part II.



Part II                Police Constable Harold GUEST has worked in the Club

St.Page(s) 1057-1062   control room at Hillsborough for four years.     He

                       describes the computerised monitoring system on the

                       turnstiles and his function of checking it at regular

                       intervals to ensure authorised crowd capacities are

                       not exceeded.   He also mentions the Club radio

                       network.

St.Page(s)   2600-2605   Chief Inspector Malcolm EDMUNDSON was the officer in

                         charge of the Police Control Room.    He deals with the

                         Extended Incident Log for the police operation and

                         confirms the difficulty over radio reception prior to

                         the disaster.     Post disaster he describes mobilising

                         the force Operation Support and Major Incident Plans.

                         These plans are dealt with later.



St.Page(s)   2606-2607   Inspector Arthur William JACKSON was duty Inspector in

                         the force control room working 1400 - 2200 hours on 15

                         April 1989.     He first became involved with events at

                         Hillsborough at 1506 hours when on Chief Inspector

                         EDMUNDSON’s authority, he implemented "Operation

                         Support."



St.Page(s)   2608-2610   Police Constable Brian WAUGH was on duty in the Force

                         Control Room, operating on VHF channel 1 and

                         controlling traffic mobiles.     At the same time he

                         dealing with the semi final.     He describes hearing

                         much of the conversation in the lead up to the

                         disaster detailing a series of relevant events both

                         before and after.



                         Other recollections from personnel on duty in the

                         Force Control Room are included.
THE DISASTER



This next section deals with police evidence of events

leading up to and immediately following the disaster.

It is discussed from the approach to Leppings Lane and

deals with the parking and reception of coaches and

trains.   It then details events closer to the ground

and outside around Leppings Lane.    Next it deals with

Leppings Lane, the perimeter gates, courtyard,

turnstiles, inside and out and the exit gates A, B and

C.



Inside the ground the concourse area behind the West

Stand, the tunnel under the stand, terraces and

seating areas will be discussed.     Thereafter the

situation on the perimeter track and in the police

detention room are considered.     A cross section of

statements are also provided specifically dealing with

the disaster and the scenes in pens 3 and 4 and

adjoining on the pitch.



TRAFFIC. TRAINS AND COACHES



Before proceeding with this section, it should be

remembered that the Liverpool Sector (Sector 2)

covered most of the areas outside the ground designed

to accommodate these supporters.     The Sector

Commander was Superintendent MARSHALL and he was
                       assisted by two Chief Inspectors who each had

                       responsibility to him for their sectors 2A and 2B.



St.Page(s) 2616-2619   Chief Inspector Roger PURDY was in charge of Sector 2B

                       with responsibility for the area from Leppings Lane

                       roundabout to the top of Halifax Road, Claywheels Lane

                       and Wandsend Road.   This included train and coach

                       reception at Wadsley Bridge and Halifax Road

                       respectively together with public order patrols in

                       those areas.   He describes the behaviour of some

                       Liverpool fans who had been drinking and with his

                       officers instigated a series of body searches.      He

                       later responded to the disaster in the ground.



                       A selection of recollections from supervisors in

                       charge of serials under Chief Inspector PURDY’S

                       command, dealing with coach, mini bus and train

                       reception, together with public order patrols in

                       Halifax Road, Parsons Cross and Grenoside areas is

                       included.   Also included are recollections from three

                       Sergeants not under Chief Inspector PURDY’S control,

                       but who dealt with reception and escort of Liverpool

                       fans from the Midland Railway Station to Leppings

                       Lane.   These describe their observations on the

                       behaviour of both Liverpool and Nottingham Forest

                       fans.




                                                                                134
LEPPINGS LANE - APPROACHES



Chief Inspector WARING was in charge of Sector 2A with

responsibility for the Leppings Lane approach and side

roads between it and Penistone Road, Catchbar Lane and

Middlewood Road from the Hillsborough Shopping

precinct.    These included public order patrols and

those officers maintaining segregation at Penistone

Road island and in side roads off Leppings

Lane/Penistone Road, as well as the carriageway

outside Leppings Lane entrance to the ground.     He

describes the behaviour of Liverpool Supporters, some

of whom were boisterous caused by drink.     He recounts

the build up at the turnstiles back into Leppings

Lane.     He recalls the Land Rover with a public address

system requesting the crowd to move back and the

opening of exit gate ’A ’.    Post disaster he remained

in Leppings Lane and ensured the free flow of traffic

including emergency vehicles into and out of the

ground.



A cross section of recollections from supervisors

under Chief Inspector WARING’S command responsible for

public order patrols, manning barriers across side

roads on the approach to Leppings Lane and for

maintaining segregation at the traffic island at

Leppings Lane and Penistone Road are included.     These

confirm the behaviour of the fans and describe the

general situation.
                       T.KPPTMRS T.AME - COURTYARD (OUTSIDE GROUND)



                       Superintendent GREENWOOD in charge of the ground

                       sector (Sector 1) was also assisted by two Chief

                       Inspectors responsible to him for sectors 1A and IB.



St.Page(s) 2792-2800   Chief Inspector Robert Wallace CREASER has performed

                       duties as the Sector Commander of IB at Cup Semi

                       Finals for the two years prior to the disaster.    He

                       was in charge of this sector in 1989.    Part of his

                       responsibilities was for serials at the Leppings Lane

                       turnstiles entrance (both sides), ensuring that

                       orderly queues were formed and that supporters

                       entering via turnstiles 1-16 and A-G were searched for

                       items prohibited under the ground rules including

                       alcohol.   He describes the behaviour of Liverpool

                       supporters mentioning that a minority had been

                       drinking, others were confused by ticket marking and

                       that many had no tickets, or, tickets for the Spion

                       Kop at the other end of the ground.     He deals with the

                       crowd build up, the pushing at the turnstiles and the

                       efforts he made to prevent this, including closing off

                       Leppings Lane to traffic, the closing of the outer

                       perimeter gates and the deployment of mounted officers

                       across those gates with horses nose to tail to try and

                       relieve the pressure.




                                                                               136
                       Recollections from officers under Chief Inspector

                       CREASER’S command in this part of the sector

                       describe the build-up and the behaviour of supporters

                       at the turnstiles waiting to enter the ground, closing

                       off Leppings Lane to traffic and the way in which the

                       crowd’s mood seemed to change.    They also refer to

                       some turnstiles jamming, seeing the opening of the

                       exit gates, ’A ’ ’B ’ and ’C ’ and the actions of mounted

                       officers in closing the perimeter gates.



                       PERIMETER GATES



                       The forcing of these gates is important to the

                       disaster because it allowed supporters through to join

                       others already entering via the opened exit gates ’A ’

                       ’B ’ and ’C ’.   Many of those who entered through gate

                       ’C ’ went along the tunnel and into pens 3 and 4 of the

                       West Terrace causing or adding to the overcrowding.

                       Recollections by the following officers all deal with

                       the closing of those perimeter gates




Part II                Police Constable D SCHOLEY.
St.Paee(s) 958-960
St.Paee(s) 2821-2828   Police Constable Graham WRIGHT


                       Sergeant PROCTOR and Police Constable SCHOLEY in

                       particular were the officers on the gate nearest to




                                                                              137
                       the River Don, which was the first to be forced by the

                       sheer weight of supporters.   They describe damage to

                       the bolt on this gate caused by it being forced.



St.Paee(s) 2830-2835   Police Constable Michael BUXTON was the driver of the

                       police Land Rover who responded to a request from the

                       Police Control Box.   He was asked to attend the

                       Leppings Lane entrance and use the public address on

                       the vehicle to ask the crowd to stop pushing and move

                       back.   He asked Senior Officers in the Police Control

                       Box to delay the kick-off because of the crowd

                       situation.   He encouraged mounted officers to form a

                       line across the outside of the closed perimeter gates

                       in order to reinforce the barrier created.



                       MOUNTED SECTION



                       Many of the mounted officers on duty at Hillsborough

                       on 15 April 1989 were not from South Yorkshire Police,

                       but were provided under mutual aid arrangements from

                       Merseyside and Nottinghamshire.   Those officers mainly

                       performing duties in relation to their own supporters.




St.Page(s) 2836-2842   Inspector Paul HAND-DAVIS was the Mounted Section

                       commander and he deployed officers around the ground.

                       Initially there were six in Leppings Lane under the

                       supervision of a Sergeant.    He later joined officers

                       at that location and with other mounted officers



                                                                                138
increased the total to thirteen.     He describes the

build-up and behaviour of supporters at the turnstiles

and the forming of the line of horsemen across the

front of the perimeter gates.



A selection of recollections from other mounted

officers which corroborate and expand the evidence

presented by Inspector HAND-DAV1S in relation to the

build-up and behaviour of supporters are included.



T.BPPTWCS LANE - CONCOURSE - (INSIDE TURNSTILES)



This is the area between the turnstiles and the rear

of the West Stand.   It is still part of Sector IB and

was under the command of Chief Inspector CREASER.



Serials of police personnel in this part of the sector

were responsible for searching fans after they entered

through turnstiles 1-16 and A-G to ensure they were

not in possession of alcohol or items prohibited under

ground regulations; patrolling the concourse area

assisting stewards to prevent unauthorised entry and

maintaining order on the terraces.     These officers

describe in their recollection, the situation at the

turnstiles, some jamming, the behaviour of some of the

 fans and their condition relative to the effects of

 either alcohol or crushing, together with the change

 of mood as kick off time approched.    Post disaster

 many assisted in dealing with the dead and injured.
                       OPENING OF EXIT GATES A B AND C



                       There are a number of openings of these gates but it

                       is those between 1452 and 1455 hours on the

                       instructions of Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD which

                       are most relevant to the disaster.    Many of the

                       supporters entering unchecked went through gate ’C*

                       down the tunnel and into pens 3 and 4.      Some of those

                       died.   Mention has already been given to

                       Superintendent MARSHALL and others requesting that

                       those gates be opened to relieve crowd pressure at the

                       turnstiles. Police officers in the Police Control Box

                       describe the events leading up to Chief Superintendent

                       DUCKENFIELD’Sdecision.



                       Recollections by the following officers deal with the

                       actual opening of the gates in reverse alphabetical

                       order which is the sequence in which we have learned

                       they were opened.

                       These officers all describe the situation outside the

                       gates prior to the order to open being given.     They

                       are unanimous in saying that serious injury or death

                       would have occurred if the gates had not been opened

                       when they were.   Sergeant HIGGINS specifically

                       requested that gate ’A* be opened.



                       TUNNEL/TTraKAr.KS - WEST STAND



                       It is relevant that whilst a number of officers in

                       this sector were posted to the turnstiles or terracing

                       area in the time prior to kick off, no officers were

                       specifically posted to supervise the tunnel.      It

                       appears that officers had a dual responsibility for

                       searching supporters at the turnstiles and ensuring

                       order on the terraces and responsibility for the

                       tunnel fell between.   However, because of their

                       commitments at the turnstiles they were unable to

                       comply with their instructions in relation to the

                       terraces.   During the match two serials were posted to

                       the tunnel to maintain order as required.



                       This is mentioned because the police failure to close

                       off the tunnel prior to authorising the opening of



                                                                                141
gate ’C ’ to prevent supporters going into pens 3 and

4   had a direct bearing on the disaster.   It incurred

considerable criticism from Liverpool supporters which

was identified in Lord Justice TAYLOR’S Interim

Report.



Because of this dual role, the recollections of

officers posted to the terraces before kick off are

incorporated in this report towards the end of the

section headed Leppings Lane - Concourse (Inside

Turnstiles).



VEST STAND - SEATING



Part of one serial of the police manpower was

responsible for policing the stand; two officers were

to patrol the concourse and bar area and six to locate

themselves at the front of the stand to prevent

missiles being thrown, stand tickets being dropped

onto the terraces and supporters being pulled up into

the stand from the terraces.   Recollections from these

officers describe the crowd volume in pens 3 and 4 and

the behaviour of supporters as kick off approached.

The supporters’ actions in pulling fellow supporters

up from the terraces is also mentioned.
                       PERIMETER TRACK



                       Chief Inspector BEAL was in command of Sector 1A with

                       responsibility to Superintendent GREENWOOD for amongst

                       other things, the supervision of the officers policing

                       the perimeter track.   He describes the build up of

                       supporters within the ground and overhearing on the

                       radio the request for gates to be opened.   At the time

                       the disaster started to become apparent he was dealing

                       with an incident involving Liverpool supporters in the

                       Spion Kop.   The first he knew of any problem was when

                       he saw spectators climbing out of the West Stand

                       terraces and onto the pitch.   Initially he thought it

                       was a pitch invasion but because he was pre-occupied

                       with the behaviour of fans in the Kop he was unable to

                       take any action.   He then saw Superintendent GREENWOOD

                       go to the referee to stop to the game.   Later

                       realising there were dead and injured he went to the

                       gymnasium and started to prepare to receive them.



St.Paee(s) 3305-3311   Inspector Peter Colin DARLING was in charge of the

                       serial policing the perimeter track which consisted of

                       a Sergeant and twenty Constables.   At 1440 hours he

                       walked from the players’ tunnel entrance along the

                       front of the South and West Stands and noted that the

                       central two pens (3 and 4) were almost full, but were

                       ’not posing any undue problems or concern.’      He noted

                       that officers posted to the area were in position and



                                                                               143
he continued his journey around the track and back to

the players’ tunnel entrance.    There he joined

Superintendent GREENWOOD and assisted clearing

photographers off the pitch who were waiting to

photograph Mr CLOUGH the Nottingham Manager.       He noted

there was a problem in front of the West Stand and

responded with Superintendent GREENWOOD to what

transpired to be the disaster.



Police Constable Peter Edward SMITH was posted to the

perimeter track in front of the West Stand terraces

with responsibility for preventing supporters climbing

the perimeter fence to gain access to the ground and

ensuring that perimeter gates remain bolted except

when required to be used.   He describes the build up

of spectators to 1400 hours when he went for

refreshments.   On his return at 1450 hours he noted

the increase in the centre pens (3 and 4) which he

says were not full.   He also noted that there was

still room in the outer pens (1, 2, 6 and 7).



Police Constable SMITH then describes the crowd

behaviour in Pen 3 and that the perimeter gate was

opened twice from the inside.    With assistance from

other officers on the second occasion he closed the

gate but then realised people were being injured.       He

radioed for permission to open gate 3 but got no reply

and so he took it upon himself to open the gate and
tried to pull people out.   Unable to do so he stood on

hoardings in front of the fence and tried to lift

people over, at the same time indicating that those

toward the rear of the pen should move back.     This

failed and he was then joined by other officers and

became involved in the rescue.



Police Constable Alfred ILLINGWORTH was another

officer posted to the perimeter track with similar

responsibilities to Police Constable SMITH.    He also

describes the build up of fans up to 1400 hours.        He

accompanied Police Constable SMITH for refreshments

returning at 1450 hours.    At this time he says the

centre pens were very full but the outer pens were

only about half full.   Initially there was no problem

in pen 4 but fans were swaying backwards and forward

and pushing and the situation deteriorated to the

point where he realised they were being crushed.        He

radioed a message to this effect to the Police Control

Box but cannot say whether it was received because of

the noise.   He then opened gate 4 and assisted people

out, directing the uninjured off the pitch i^to pens 5

and 6 through the gates which he had opened.     He was

then heavily involved in the rescue operation.



Both Police Constable SMITH and Police Constable

ILLINGWORTH have regularly performed duties in this

area of the perimeter track over a period of two years
                        prior to the disaster, including at earlier

                        semi-finals.    They are also subject of separate

                        criminal allegations arising from complaints against

                        the police relating to their actions on this

                        occasion.



St.Paee(s) 3329-3336    Police Constable Hedlev HELLIWELL was originally

                        posted to the track in front of the South Stand.     At

                        1425 hours he was instructed to perform duty at the

                        front of the West Stand until the return of Police

                        Constable’s SMITH and ILLINGWORTH.     This he did noting

                        on his arrival at pen 4 that there was three or four

                        steps clear at the front of the pen.    He describes the

                        activities of the crowd up until the return of

                        Constables SMITH and ILLINGWORTH.    He then went back

                        to the South Stand position.



St.Paee(s) 3337-3340    Woman Police Constable Fiona RICHARDSON was posted to

                        the perimeter track in front of pens 1 and 2 and she

                        confirms the build up of supporters and their

                        behaviour.     She describes a series of events in pens

                        1, 2 and 3 in the lead up to the disaster.     She took

                        her refreshment break between 1410 and 1435 hours.



St.Page( s) 3341-3345   Police Constable Roger CUCKSON was posted to the

                        opposite side of the track in front of pens 6 and 7,

                        taking his refreshment break between 1300 and 1330

                        hours.   Again he describes a number of incidents in



                                                                                  146
this area, some involving fans the worse for drink.

He witnessed spectators coming on to the pitch in

front of the West Stand.     He attempted to direct them

into pen 6 until he realised the situation.



Recollections from other officers on the basis of

their proximity to the West Stand terraces are

included.      Immediately following these are the

recollections of officers who assisted Police

Constables SMITH and ILLINGWORTH to close the

perimeter gates.



At this point it is perhaps pertinent to refer the

reader to Appendix ’B ’ of the Police Order relating to

the duties of officers on the perimeter track.       This

order instructs *NO ONE IS TO BE ALLOWED ACCESS TO THE

TRACK FROM THE TERRACES WITHOUT CONSENT OF A SENIOR

OFFICER (EXCEPT TO RECEIVE MEDICAL ATTENTION).       The

officers mentioned would be expected to follow this

order unless they were unable to get such authority

over the radio to open the perimeter gates.



A plan showing the posting of officers on the

perimeter track, together with a chart indicating the

disposition of officers on refreshment break is

produced.      These illustrate that between 1410 - 1425

hours there was no officer on duty in the area between

pens 1 - 5 .     Only Police Constable HELLIWELL was there
                         between 1425 - 1435 hours when Woman Police Constable

                         RICHARDSON returned to her post.     Full cover was not

                         restored until 1450 hours with the return of Police

                         Constable’s SMITH and ILLINGWORTH.



                         POLICE DETENTION ROOM



                         The location of this room has previously been

                         described and its function is self explanatory.

                         Recollections from officers performing duty in the

                         room and on the prisoner escort vehicles have been

                         provided.



Doc.No 204               Records show that in the period prior to the disaster

Doc. Paee(s) 1306-1314   occurring there were a total of 44 arrests in and

                         around the ground.   Offences and disposal are

                         indicated.



                         EMERGENCY PLANNING - POLICE



                         South Yorkshire Police emergency planning is

                         formulated on the basis of the type of emergency to

                         which they are responding, that is, either public

                         disorder or a major disaster situation.     Police orders

                         or plans for both types of situation lay down the

                         actions and procedures that need to be implemented or

                         considered by the officer in charge.     It should be

                         emphasised at this point that every situation is




                                                                                   148
                          different and these orders or plans can only be

                          intended as a guide, not only for the person in

                          charge, but for those officers working under his

Doc.No 205                command during the incident.   The police orders

Doc.Page(s) 13 15 -1351   dealing with disorder are given the code names

                          "Operation Support" and "Operation Maine."



                          "Operation Support" is intended to ensure the

                          immediate availability and response of additional

                          manpower within the force area in dealing with

                          outbreaks of spontaneous disorder.    "Operation Maine"

                          is designed for a response of additional manpower to

                          support other police forces under police mutual aid

                          agreements.    For the purposes of this investigation

                          the "Operation Maine" section of the order can be

                          disregarded.



Doc.No 206                The Maior Incident Plan contains a basic format on

Doc.Paee(s) 1352-1444     which all major incidents within the South Yorkshire

                          Police area can be based.    It includes a series of

                           action plans for specific types of disaster, ie an

                           air crash, colliery or motorway disaster.   There is no

                           separate plan for dealing with a potential disaster at

                           a football stadium.



                           "Operation Support" is put in motion by the Senior

                           Divisional Officer on duty obtaining authority to
implement from the Assistant Chief Constable

Operations, or in his absence the duty Chief Officer.

The major incident plan is activated by the Chief

Inspector in charge of the Force Control Room acting

on information supplied about the location, size and

nature of the incident.



Relating to the Hillsborough disaster, Chief

Superintendent DUCKENFIELD initially activated

Operation Support to deal with what was thought to be

a pitch invasion.   This was authorised by the

Assistant Chief Constable Mr JACKSON and it was not

until a short time later that the true nature of the

disaster became apparent.     As it did, procedures

reverted almost automatically from Operation Support

to the Major Incident Plan.     There was however, some

delays in mobilising the other emergency services

probably caused by the initial recognition that it was

a pitch invasion and not a disaster.



Once the disaster was recognised and the major

incident plan put into force, the gymnasium at the

stadium was turned into a temporary mortuary and also

as a casualty clearing station for the injured.       Other

senior officers with specific emergency

responsibilities were called out.     The Casualty Bureau

was set up at Ecclesfield Police Station with officers

from the Bureau attending the two main hospitals, the
                       Royal Hallam and Northern General.    Emergency

                       telephone numbers were released to the media and the

                       difficult process of identification of the dead and

                       injured was begun.    Road diversions were implemented

                       to assist the free flow of emergency vehicles to and

                       from the scene.



                       The cohesion between the police and other emergency

                       services will be examined in Part VI of this

                       submission.



St.Paeefs) 3458-3475   Mr James SHARPLES. the Chief Constable of Merseyside

St.Paeefs) 3476-3480   was present at Hillsborough as was Mr Ronald HADFIELD,

                       the Chief Constable of Nottingham Constabulary.       These

                       two accounts make reference to important issues.




                       CONCLUSION



                       South Yorkshire Police and its members have

                       considerable experience in dealing with major

                       functions including those at the Hillsborough

                       Stadium.     The 1988 and 1989 Cup Semi-Finals were

                       between the same teams and as the arrangements in 1988

                       seemed to have worked efficiently they implemented

                       much the same arrangements for 1989.     The only

                       significant difference was the reduction in manpower

                       by 128 officers.

               At 10am (1000) Wednesday 22 March 1989 (220389), I attended a

               planning meeting at Hairmerton Road Police Station, chaired by Chief

               Suparintendent MOLE to discuss the organisation of the F.A Cup Send.

               Final tie between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest Football Clubs.

               On Monday 27 March 1989 (270389), I was promoted Chief Superintendent

               of 'F' Division and assumed responsibilities for the forthcoming

               football match.

               In the period which followed leading to the semi final I liaised with

               Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) Mr JACKSON regarding the

               arrangements.

               At 10am (1000) Wednesday 29 March 1989 (290389), I had a meeting with

               Superintendent MURRAY, Chief Inspector BEAL and Inspector SEWELL in

               my office to discuss the operational order and our arrangements for

               the day and to ensure these were progressing satisfactorily.

At 2.30pm (1430) on 10 April 1989 (104089) I had a meeting with the

Sector Superintendents, representatives from 'D' Division, Road

Traffic and British Transport Police to discuss our arrangements.

At 2pm (1400) Wednesday 12 April 1989 (120489), I held a press

conference at Hairmerton Road Police Station and met with media

representatives.

At 10am (1000) Friday 14 April 1989 (140489), I held a pre match

briefing in the North Stand at the Hillsborough Football Stadium for

officers of Inspector and above.     See Appendix 'A'.

The purpose of this was to give a full briefing to supervisory

officers and then for them to have the opportunity to examine their

respective areas of responsibility and familiarise themselves with

the ground.

I conducted the main briefing with Superintendent MURRAY, and then

the respective area Superintendents held their own briefings, in and

around the ground, dealing more specifically with their needs, and

requirements of their areas of responsibility.

At 10am (1000) Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489), I briefed the

officers on duty for the semi final tie in the North Stand of the

Hillsborough Football Stadium.     See Appendix 'B'.

It was a shortened version of the previous day's briefing.

Superintendent MURRAY, Detective Sergeant CHARLESWORTH and Inspector

SEWELL also dealt with matters such as Emergency Evacuation

Procedure, Crime Intelligence, and Administration.

On completion of the briefing I spoke with officers in the ground and

toured the area.

I re-entered the ground about 1.15pm (1315) and in due course made my

way to the Police control Box about 1.50pm (1350) and liaised with

Superintendent MURRAY.

We left a short time later to see the referee and linesmen to advise



                                                                         2458

then of our emergency procedures.

They were on the pitch and eventually they left and we followed them

to the official's room.

On leaving there about 2pm (1400) we returned to the Police Control

Box and met with Mr JACKSON, Assistant Chief Constable (Operations).

In the Control Box were the regular operators -    PS GODDARD, PC

RYAN and PC BICHARD.

I had a general discussion with Mr JACKSON about the operation, which

was progressing satisfactorily at this stage.   He left a little while

latar.

About 2.30pm (1430), when examining the ground situation, I noted

that the Spion Kop was almost full with the Nottingham Forest fans,

and that was the general view in respect of their other areas of the

ground.

A number of Liverpool supporters had obtained tickets for the Spion

Kop and were accomodated in the North East part of this section of

the ground.   They were segregated from the Nottingham Forest

supporters by a line of police officers.

The North Stand for Liverpool supporters was possibly half full at

this time, the West Stand was filling, but there was space at the

front and sides of the Leppings Lane Terrace.   I asked for a tannoy

message to be relayed for fans to move forward and spread along the

terrace.

I can recall about this time Superintendent MARSHALL asked for

Leppings Lane to be closed and saw on the CCTV monitor the crowd

situation and a SYPTE double decker bus passing.

I was aware of a crowd build up but traffic was still able to flow

and I questioned in my mind the need for the closure.

At this time there must have been same difficulty in closing the road

because I remember more than one request for this to be done as


                                                                               2459
                                                                  PAGE   4
                                                                  S213

though the first had not been implemented.

I was aware from the CCTV monitor of the increasing number of

supporters in Leppings Lane and in those waiting to enter the ground.

Whilst examining the situation outside I visually made an assessment

from the Control Box of the way in which the ground was filling and

askad Superintendent MURRAY for his assessment of the situation,

bearing in mind the crowd outside and the space inside at this time.

This was about 2.30pm (1430) and he said that with half an hour to

kick off we should get them all in on time.

About this time I asked Superintendent MURRAY to clarify with me the

circumstances under which we would consider delaying the kick off.

We had previously agreed that if there was an identifiable problem,

e.g. a serious incident, accident on the motorway or fog on the

Pennines which would prevent large numbers of fans arriving on time

we should consider a delay as opposed to those who had been brought

to the area within a reasonable time but had chosen not to enter the

ground as soon as possible.

I took the view that at this time, with all the information

available, there were no grounds to delay the kick off.

Between 2.30pm (1430) and 2.40pm (1440) the crowd continued to

increase and I monitored the Liverpool fans on the Spion Kop and

actions being taken by officers there.

I examined the situation at the Leppings Lane End of the ground from

the CCTV monitor and saw the increasing crowd situation.

I was aware that action was being taken to increase the number of

officers at this location as horses and reserve serials were being

directed to assist by Control Rocm personnel.

In addition, a tannoy message was being relayed to the crowd outside

at the Leppings Lane end to ease back and not to push forward against

the turnstiles.



                                                                             2460
                                                                    PAGE   5
                                                                    S213

About 2.40pm (1440) the radio developed a fault and there were

obvious comnunication difficulties.

A request was made for a Coninunications Officer to attend and repair

the fault and he arrived almost imnediately.

He restored coninunications and we were able to contact officers once

more.

The crowd was continuing to increase at the Leppings Lane end

turnstiles, and Superintendent MARSHALL asked for    PC BUXTON to

attend with the Land Rover which is equipped with a public address

facility.

In addition, at 2.44pm (1444), I requested a traffic mobile to assist

and for continued tannoy messages to the crowds outside to relieve

the pressure upon the turnstiles.

The crowd had by now increased considerably and fans were beginning

to climb over the walls into the ground.

The crowd situation was changing rapidly, it had increased in

numbers, Superintendent MARSHALL had asked for a vehicle with a P.A.

facility, tannoy messages were being relayed to ease pressure, Mounted

officers were having difficulty and extra resources had been sent to

assist.

I looked at the situation on the Leppings Lane terrace and saw there

was room for supporters, and considered because of the deteriorating

situation whether or not to delay the kick off to ease the

difficulties.     I looked through the Control Box window to my right

and saw a half circle of press photographers on the pitch at the

players' tunnel, obviously waiting for the teams to appear, and at

that point, whilst considering the position, the first team ran out

onto the pitch.

I considered this option had been removed.

I looked at the CCTV camera trained on the service road at the



                                                                               2461

                                                                 S213

lappings Lane end showing Gate C, and a Mounted officer was in some

difficulty as his horse was being jostled by the crowd.

It >vas about this time, 14.47pm (1447) that the first message came

over the radio from Superintendent MARSHALL with a request to open

the gates. I again looked at the CCTV monitor showing Gate C and my

immediate reaction was not to do this.   We had supporters outside the

ground who may not have tickets, some may be drunk or worse for drink,

they were not co-operating with the police nor responding to our

requests,    lb open the gates and allow them into the ground would

defeat our objective that no one would get in without a ticket, who

was drunk or may be carrying weapons.

The crowd situation was extremely difficult and this was an unusual

request, and whilst I was considering the position, assessing the

space in the ground and looking at the CCTV monitor, I saw Gate C

burst open and supporters enter the concourse area at the rear of the

Leppings Lane stand and terrace.

I ramember thinking, 'the gates's open anyway's    I had not given

permssion, but at that point a Mounted Officer retrieved the

situation and closed the gate.

A further message came over the radio from Superintendent MARSHALL to

open the gates and he used words to the effect that if the gates were

not opened someone was going to be killed.

This was an urgent message which conveyed to me by the tone of his

voice that this was a serious situation and was a demand rather than

a request.

The previous thoughts crossed my mind once again about monitoring and

control of supporters entering the ground.

It was a serious step to take.    I looked at the CCTV monitor - there

was crushing outside, supporters were climbing over the turnstile

walls, officers were under pressure.



                                                                             2462
                                                                 PAGE
                                                                 S213

On the inside of the ground there was space in the terrace, there was

space on the inside of the turnstiles in the concourse, and room to

easa the situation.

If the gates were opened there m y be crushing and injury on the

inside but the message I was receiving from the outside was that

uni ass I opened the gates and eased the pressure people would be

seriously injured or killed.

Superintendent MARSHALL is a very experienced police officer and if

he wanted the gates opened, which is not normally a consideration,

then the situation must be very serious indeed.

Whilst I am considering the position and considering the options

Superintendent MURRAY said to me,

"Mr DUCKENFIELD, are you going to open the gates?"

I rananber standing there and saying my thoughts aloud so that

others, if they heard it, would realise it was a considered

decision.   I said,

"If there's likely to be serious injury or death I've no option but

to open the gates - open the gates".

Superintendent MURRAY passed this message.

About this time I heard another radio message fron someone who said

words to the effect,

"It does not matter whether you open the gates or not, this gate's

going in anyway".

I was advised this was 'A' Gate.

I took this to mean that crowd pressure on a particular gate was such

that it was in danger of collapsing and people being injured.

My immediate reaction to that was that if a gate collapsed due to

crowd pressure those immediately in front of the gate would fall and

no doubt be injured.   In addition, those falling may be trampled upon.

The gate to the North Stand was opened and I immediately issued



                                                                          2463

instructions for extra resources to be deployed into that area to

provide cover on the landings and prevent a pitch invasion from non

ticket holders.

I also asked for manpower for the perimeter track to monitor the

position.

I watched the Leppings Lane terrace intently for any developments as a

result of the gates opening.

In taking stock of the situation I looked at the West Stand and it

appeared full.    The centre two pens of the terrace appeared to be

almost full, but there was still seme room at the front of the two

wing pens.

I saw a PC opening either Gates 3 or 4 from the Leppings Lane terrace

onto the perimeter track and a handful of people were coining out on

to the track and walking towards Gate 1.     They seemed to be calm and

appeared to stand aimlessly on the track without any direction.        The

policewoman standing at Gate 1, who was only a few yards away, was

totally unaware of their presence.     There was room at the front of

this pen and there was a need to open this gate and allow these

people into this part of the ground.     Chief Inspector MCROBBIE who

was in the Control Room in civilian clothing went down on to the track

to assist her and draw her attention to what was happening.

There was an increasing number of people caning onto the track from

Gat as 3 and 4 area.   No radio traffic was being received and I was

still unable to assess the situation but considered there may have

been a pitch invasion or that people were being taken out for re­

location in the two wing pens.

I asked for Superintendent GREENWOOD to go to Leppings Lane end and

find out what was happening.     I saw him coining from the players'

tunnel, walking along the perimeter track towards the Police Control

Box and the incident behind the Leppings Lane end goal.     An increasing


                                                                                 2464

number of people were now being helped on to the track through the

gates and some were climbing over the perimeter fencing on to the

track.

The supporters from this location were now spilling on to the track

and were standing on the grass behind the touch line.   I was not

aware of any radio messages but then saw Superintendent GREENWOOD

standing head and shoulders above the people at the back of the goal,

presumably standing on an advertising hoarding and waving his arms.

He was waving his arms and crossing them as he did so, which

indicated to me he wanted the game to be stopped.   I agreed the game

should be stopped and I sent Superintendent MURRAY from the Control

Room on to the track to stop the game.   I then saw Superintendent

GREENWOD running onto the pitch to stop the game.   Superintendent

MURRAY then returned to the Control Room.

I saw officers trying to indicate to fans in the rear of the pens to

move back.

People were spilling onto the pitch ad were moving further across and

towards the centre line.   I was still unaware of any radio traffic

and exactly what the problem was, but some people were now sitting on

the pitch.

The Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) Mr JACKSON joined me in

the Control Box and asked for an appraisal of the situation.   I was

unable to give an accurate account of what the situation was other

than a possible pitch invasion which had resulted in us stepping the

game.

The Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) went to the pitch and a

short while later returned.

Superintendent MURRAY was asked to return to the pitch and try and

get it cleared so that from the Control Box we could assess the

situation, especially as now people appeared to be on the pitch who



                                                                             2465

wera injured.

An ambulance was requested but I was unaware of any radio message

asking for this and was still relying on my visual assessment of the

situation.

It stas difficult to assess as the crowd was flowing onto the pitch in

increasing numbers, police officers were present, and there was a

movament of supporters towards the centre line.

I was concerned about the crowd situation: a difficult situation was

developing and we could not control the pitch.    It was necessary to

form a cordon to continue segregation and further assistance was

requested to help with the increasing injuries I could see in front

of me from the Control Box.

I called for 'Operation Support'. In turn I was aware of a request

for a fleet of ambulances, and as a result of that message I became

aware of the gravity of the situation.

I then began to give instructions to the Control Room staff in

conjunction with Mr JACKSON for the implementation of the Major

Disaster Plan.

I asked for the Casualty Bureau to be set up, to warn hospitals of

the large number of injuries, any doctors in the ground to Leppings

Lana goal for deployment, off duty police officers to be called to

duty and rendezvous at Hammerton Road Police Station.

Mr JACKSON supplemented my requests, asking Superintendent TORR to

attand in respect of the Casualty Bureau; Detective Chief

Superintendent ADDIS to attend to co-ordinate the investigation side

of the enquiry.   I asked for a Counselling Service and Victims

Support Staff.

I was aware of a request for wire cutters and following on fron that

the attendance of the Fire Service.

Whilst all this was taking place I asked PC BRYAN to continue



                                                                              2466

broadcasting for calm among the supporters and for them to clear the

pitch so we could determine what people were injured and where

because the fans were milling around and obstructing the view.

Advertising hoardings were by now being broken up for use as

stretchers and injured people were being removed across the pitch

towards the exit by the police room.

Fans were distressed and a single ambulance was in position behind

the Leppings Lane goal.

The Fire Service cleared a gangway near the Police Control Box in

front of the South Stand to remove casualties from the ground by a

more expedient route.

Superintendent MURRAY returned to the Police Control Box and told me

that there were many injuries and possibly seme fatalities.

I was later requested to attend the Board Room with Mr JACKSON, the

ACC (Operations) and left Superintendent MURRAY in charge of the

operation in Police Control.

We attended the Board Room within the Directors Lounge at the

football club and saw officials of both clubs and the F.A.

I was asked for an assessment of the situation and I told than there

had been a serious incident and a large number of casualties.

I was told by one gentleman that he had seen two dead supporters on

the pitch.

I related the situation as I saw it at that time, and that in my view

the game would have to be postponed but that I did not want this

communicating to the crowd.

The reasons for this were that they may create an additional public

order problem - at this state I did not have the manpower to deal

with this - and it was essential that all the casualties and dead

were removed from the area before any announcements were made.

It was agreed the game would be postponed but that no one in the



                                                                             246 7

crowd would be told until I gave permission.   Mr JACKSON reinforced

this, and we very quickly left.

I returned to the Police Control Box with ACC (Operations) and

continued to monitor the situation.   The rescue was progressing, we

now had fatalities and a tanporary mortuary had been arranged in the

gymnasium.

I was approached in the Police Control Box by Mr CLOUGH and Mr

DALGLEISH.

They asked for an assessment of the situation and whether or not the

game was postponed.   I told them it was my intention to postpone the

game but asked them not to tell anyone and gave my reasons for this.

Mr CLOUGH left but I asked Mr DALGLEISH to make an announcement to

the Liverpool fans for calm and to bear with us for the time being.

It is my view that this was beneficial to the operation.

The rescue operation progressed and eventually, about 4pm (1600) that

afternoon, there was only one casualty awaiting transportation to

hospital and the point had arrived where the crowd could be told of

the situation.

I asked for an assurance that all trains and buses were available to

transport the supporters away fron the ground, all available officers

were patrolling the streets and that we were ready for the crowd

dispersal.

The final ambulance left the ground and an announcement was made by

Superintendent MURRAY to the crowd that the match had been postponed

and they were asked to leave.

The crowd applauded the decision and left without any major difficulty.

After the ground and the surrounding area had cleared Chief

Superintendent MOLE arrived and took over responsibility for the

ground.

I left the Police Control Box with Mr JACKSON and walked across the


                                                                             2468

        pitch to the Police Room.   We met with Mr BARRON, a Director of

        Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, and passed comment about the

        disaster - he was in tears but praised the police operation.

        I laft the football ground for Force Headquarters about 5.15pm

        (1715), together with the Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) Mr

        JACKSON and Superintendent MARSHALL.

        On arrival at Force Headquarters, about 5.45pm (1745), I met with the

        Deputy Chief Constable, Mr HAYES, and in due course the Chief

        Constable.

        About 9pm (2100) that evening I left Force Headquarters for Niagara

        Police Sports Ground to meet the Minister for Sport who was due to

        arrive by helicopter to meet with the Chief Constable.

        He arrived about 10.20pm (2220) and I escorted him to the football

        ground where he met with Mr WRIGHT, the Chief Constable.

        I was present whilst he toured the ground and met with the press.

        When he concluded his visit to the football stadium, I escorted him

        to Force Headquarters to see Mr HAYES, the Deputy Chief Constable.

        I returned to the Police Sports & Social Club at Niagara and

        counselled oficers who had been involved in the events that afternoon

       who had just retired from duty.

        I eventually returned to Hammerton Road Police Station and went off

        duty at 1.30am (0130).

           I am a Superintendent of the South Yorkshire Police, stationed at

           Hammerton Road Police Station and sub-divisional conmander of the FI

           sub-division, which includes Sheffield Wednesday Football ground at

           Hillsborough.     I was posted to this sub-division on 14 March 1988

           (140388).     Since then I have regularly carried out duties in connection

           with football matches at Hillsborough, including the 1988 (000088) F A

           Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.       On all these

           occasions I have worked frcm the environment of the ground control

           room.   I have 23 years police experience and have worked regularly at

           football matches as a constable at Huddersfield Town, as a sergeant

           at Barnsley and as a Chief Inspector at Barnsley.       I have worked

           occasionally as a sergeant at Hillsborough, Rotherham and Doncaster.

           On or about 20 March 1989 (200389), I was informed by Chief

           Superintendent MOLE that the 1989 (000089) F A Cup semi-final between
                                                                  PAGE    2
                                                                  S207

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest wDUld be played at Hillsborough on

either the 15 or 16 April 1989 (150489-160489).    I was later informed

that this match would be played on Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489),

with the traditional 3 pn (1500) kick-off.    At 3 p   (1500) that day, I

met with Chief Superintendent MOLE and Inspector SEWELL and as this

was a repeat of the same fixture the previous year, which had passed

without serious incident we decided to base the order on the previous

year's event. The order was to be prepared by Chief Inspector BEAL

and Inspector SEWELL.   I was asked by Chief Superintendent MDLE to aim

for a manpower reduction on 1988 (000088) of 10 per cent in the

interest of most effective and efficient utilisation of resources as

it was to my knowledge that the previous year, some officers had

been under employed.    I communicated this to the planning team, with

the suggestion that this could be achieved in the main, by reducing

the public order serials from one sergeant and 10 constables to one

sergeant and eight constables.    As a result of the previous year's

experience there were a number of areas where I considered

arrangements could be improved.    Some were to be included in the

operational order and others by contingency or instruction.    The

following were to be included in the order; reinforcement of 'flash­

point' at Leppings Lane roundabout at junction with Penistone Road

with 4 serials, 4 horses, 4 dogs and 2 vans; reinforcement of the

track to prevent a pitch invasion as occurred the previous year by

introducing a further 4 serials at the end of the game; west stand

serial to be particular vigilant in preventing climbing into that

stand from the terraces below; any Liverpool supporters on the Kop to

be contained in the segregated area on the Kop especially identified

and cordoned for this purpose; buses to be parked immediately

outside the ground at Leppings Lane end and Penistone Road end to hold

5 serials each during the match of officers who were previously on



                                                                              2471

stand-by at Claywheels Lane and too far away to be deployed quickly;

thrae prisoner vans to be available to respond to requests for

transport for prisoners arrested outside the ground and avoid having

to utilise mobile serials for this purpose; all officers to be

provided with at least one hot meal; call-signs for Chief Inspectors

and above to be by way of their names to avoid confusion.     By

instruction; one officer to be identifed to deal with any VIP's to

avoid others being taken away from recognised roles; the CCTV link

utilised the previous year from Wadsley Bridge station to be cancelled

as this took up considerable radio space when being set up and the

monitor took up valuable space in the control room; a communications

officer to be available at the ground to deal with any cemmunication

problems.   By negotiation; buses for transport of Kop and south stand

supporters to be positioned nearer to city to assist Segregation.

By arrangement with the club; signs to the ground to be provided and

erected by the AA.   By contingency; any excesses of private vehicles

for Liverpool supporters to be directed to the Wisewood/Winn Gardens

area; if large numbers of supporters without tickets, mobile serials

to attempt to locate and remove to, Nottingham Forrest supporters to

Hillsborough Park, Liverpool supporters to Cole Road.

At 10 am (1000) on 22 March 1989 (220389) I attended a meeting at

Hamirterton Road Police Station, chaired by Chief Superintendent MOLE

and which was attended by all interested parties, who had been

invited.    I recall that at the meeting it was mentioned that

Livarpool were unhappy with the allocation of tickets and being given

the Leppings Lane end and north stand.   There was a strong

representation from officials of British Rail to alter these

arrangements as well in order that Nottingham Forrest fans could use

Wadsley Bridge railway station as early indications were that many more

Nottingham fans would be travelling by special train, than



                                                                              2472

Liverpool.    As a result of this, I later discussed with Chief

Suparintendent MOLE, whether we could re-appraise the allocation of

the ground.   We discussed and agreed that in view of it meaning all

supporters would have to cross and that as it was an exact replica of

the previous year's fixture and fairly fresh in travelling supporters

minds and they would no doubt park and resort to the same areas as last

year, that the probability of public order situations arising in many

areas would be too high and it was not possible to re-arrange

accommodation in the ground.

On 29 March 1989 (290389) with Chief Inspector BEAL and Inspector

SEWELL, I attended a meeting with Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD

when we discussed the draft operational order and current state of

planning and decided to go ahead with the order with seme minor

amendments.

At 12.30 pn (1230) on 5 April 1989 (050489), I visited Sheffield

Wednesday football ground with Inspector SEWELL and saw the Force

catering officer, regarding the siting of a mobile canteen and prison

busas.

At 2.30 pn (1430) on 10 April 1989 (100489), I attended a meeting at

Hanmerton Road Police Station, chaired by Chief Superintendent

DUCKENFIELD and attended by the Sector Superintendents and officer

from 'D' Division, Operations and Traffic and British Transport

Police and discussed arrangements for the event.

At 2 pn (1400) on 12 April 1989 (120489), I was present when Chief

Suparintendent DUCKENFIELD gave a press conference in the conference

room at Hairmerton Road Police Station.

At 10.30 am (1030) on 13 April 1989 (130489) with Inspector SEWELL, I

attended Sheffield Wednesday football Club and met with the club

Secretary, Mr Graham MACKERELL and discussed arrangments for the

event.   At the conclusion of this meeting with Inspector SEWELL, I


                                                                             2473

mad a a full inspection of the ground.

At 9.15 am (0915) on Friday 14 April 1989 (140489), I travelled to

Hillsborough and at 10 am (1000) officers of the rank of Inspector and

above, were briefed by Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD.     I then gave

a fall briefing from my briefing notes, followed by a briefing by

Inspector SEWELL.   The sector Superintendent then took officers under

their command to different parts of the ground to brief them on their

specific responsibilities.   The briefing by Mr DUCKENFIELD, myself

and Inspector SEWELL, lasted for approximately 45 minutes.    On return

to Hanmerton Road Police Station, I discussed with Chief

Suparintendent DUCKENFIELD, cutting down my input on briefing, as

we could not hold officers' attention for so long.   I would merely

confine my briefing to the important aspects and let sector

Superintendents and Inspectors, cover all other aspects. This was

agreed.

On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) at 0800 hours, I ccnmenced duty at

Hamnrterton Road Police Station and carried out general office duties.

Checked the incident that had been created on Corrmand and Control and

found that it had been closed.   Incident re-opened with instructions

that all matters in relation to the semi-final should be entered on

it.   The only other information available at this time, was that

there was a large amount of rubble in Parkside Road area from

excavations and this was to be cleared before 10 am (1000).

At 0915 hours I went to Hillsborough, arriving at about 0930 hours.

At 0945 hours I was checking that everything OK for briefing and

arranging at request of one of the sector Superintendents for copies

of the public house check-list to be obtained for distribution to all

serial sergeants and Inspectors on duty outside the ground.

Suparintendent DUCKENFIELD opening brief, followed by myself as per

my briefing notes. Followed by Detective Sergeant CHARLESWORTH on

Critte Intelligence, followed by Inspector SEWELL on administrative

matters in relation to issue of radios and meals.     This briefing took

approximately 20 minutes.   After the briefing I spoke to the mobile

camera crew and informed them that they had a 'roving commission'

before the match.   During the match they were to take up a position

in front of the north stand, close to the Kop end and maintain a low

profile, only filming any incidents that were of note and where video

evidence would be beneficial.

At about 1035 hours, I took up position in ground control.    Police

Sergeant GODDARD, Police Constable RYAN and Police Constable BICHARD

already on duty in control room.   Informed them that Police Sergeant

GODDARD would be responsible for radio reception and transmission,

Police Constable RYAN for the public address system and the

telephones and Police Constable BICHARD for the CCTV operation and

operation of the VHF pack-set to Force Operations Room, channel 1.

Besides being responsible for overall command of the control room, I

would attempt to keep my own personal log of events.     (A log had

never been kept in previous years, due to the limited space in the

control room and there being insufficient room for a log writer.      My

experience from the previous semi-final was that at de-brief it was

difficult to remember all events of significance and this log would

serve as a memory-jogger). At this time, a    civilian member of the

carnmunications department was in the control room.    I informed him

that he was welcome to stay for the time being in case we had any

communication problems, but that he would have to leave and base

himself in the gymnasium once the Chief Superintendent took up his

position in control, due to limited space.   At this time serials were

taking their meals in the north stand and had been instructed to be

briefed and on their points by 11.15 am (1115).

By 1230 hours reports had been received of supporters drinking at the



                                                                               2475

following pubs; Five Arches, Devonshire, Freemasons and The Royal and

at the Horse and Jockey.   The mobile units were asked to monitor the

situation and also in the Nottingham Forrest Sector additional radios

had been requested in order that Officers, who would not normally be

issued with radios, could be left in the proximity of these pubs and

have additional cormiunication.

At 1300 hours, reports had been received of urinators in the Wadsley

Lane area, shoplifters on the Halifax Road side of the ground and the

usual nuisance calls that are associated with this type of event.

By 1340 hours there had been problems at the Victoria and Royal,

public houses and the Royal had, in fact, closed.

At about 1350 hours I was joined in the control room     by Chief

Superintendent DUCKENFIELD.   I informed him that there were no real

problems apparent, apart from the usual, with this type of event.      We

then went together onto the Track, with the intention of seeing the

referee.   I identified the referee who was on the pitch, talking with

other people and we waited about 5 minutes for him to leave the

field and then followed him to the referee's room.   With the

linesmen, he was informed that in general, the field     of play      washis

res pons ibilty, but we reserved the right at any time   to cane      ontothe

field if circumstances merited this.   He was informed of the

emergency evacuation procedure and the coded message and also

informed of the procedure for stopping the match by way of the south

stand lines-man.   He was informed that there would be a further brief

after the event.

At about 1405 hours I returned to the control roan and saw that ACC

(Ops) Mr JACKSON, was in attendance, Mr DUCKENFIELD appraised him of

the current situation.

At about 1415 hours, looking around the stadium, I noticed that the

Kop was filling up nicely.    It was difficult to assess the south



                                                                                2476

stand, but this also appeared to be filling.    My impression was that

the north stand was probably not a quarter full and the same with the

west stand and the Leppings Lane terraces.

At 1417 hours a message was received from Superintendent MARSHALL,

asking for Leppings Lane to be closed to traffic.    From the CCTV

pictures there did not seem to be a particular problem, but the

serial identified at the roundabout end of Leppings Lane (S30) was

contacted and asked to close that end.    We were unable to contact the

serial at the Catchbar Lane end (S26) and either Superintendent MARSHALL

or Inspector SYKES were told this and requested to deploy an

officer to close this end.

At about 1422 hours a message was received from Superintendent

MARSHALL that Leppings Lane had not yet been closed and traffic was

still coming through.    Further messages were sent asking for the

road to be closed.   Superintendent MARSHALL then asked for Mr

MIDDLETON of Sheffield Transport to be informed in order that he

could make arragaments for bus routes to be altered to cater for the

closure.   This was arranged.

At about 1430 hours the north stand appeared to be about half full.

The west stand was filling, as were the centre pens and the north west

terrace.   There were large clear sections in the pen, under the

control box and the pen on the north side of the double railings.

There was a large crowd outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles, but I

was convinced that the turnstiles could cope with these numbers and

remarked to Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD that there was a good

crowd outside, but we still had half an hour to kick off and we would

get them in by three o'clock (1500) . About this time, Chief

Suparintendent DUCKENFIELD asked me to remind him of what we had

decided about delaying the kick off.     I informed him that we had

agreed that if there was an identifiable problem, such as a serious



                                                                              2477

accident on the motorway, or bad weather over the Pennines, which

prevented people arriving on time, that we would delay - but if it was

merely that people had arrived in time, but decided to go elsewhere,

rather than the ground and arrived at the last minute, then we would

not normally delay it.

By 1435 hours the control room was busy.   A number of reports had

been received, including a possible public order problem in the

Middlewood Road area with youths congregating.   A number of arrests or

ejections had occurred at the 'spur' on the Kop, which had been

isolated for Liverpool supporters, who found their way onto the Kop.

A report had been received of a 'tout' selling Kqp tickets at the

Leppings Lane end of the ground to Liverpool Supporters.    This was

circulated by radio and he was arrested.   Superintendent GREENWOOD

was asked to consider a contingency for other Liverpool supporters on

the Kop, in view of this, as the Kop was becoming full.    A unit at

Rawson Spring Road was requesting the present position with regard to

a Draegar to carry out a breath test.   The crowd around the

turnstiles in Leppings Lane appeared to be about the same as 5

minutes earier.

At about 1440 hours a request was received from the mounted

Inspector (Mil), for any spare mounted Officers to be sent to the

Leppings Lane end to assist.   Police Sergeant GODDARD asked Police

Sergeant SORSBY (Mounted) to deploy all available mounted    officers to

the Leppings Lane end.   There were two reserve serials (S20 and S21).

S21 had earlier been despatched to Penistone Road end to assist with

turnstile searches.   As a precaution and as 'back-up' S20 was deployed

from the gymnasium to the Leppings Lane end of the ground, to

assist.   Messages were being received from the Leppings Lane end to

use the tannoy system to ask people outside the turnstiles to stop

pushing as piecple were going to be injured.   Police Constable RYAN



                                                                              2478

immediately started to pass these messages over the public address

system.    I instructed him to keep talking and passing on the message.

At about 1442 hours, someone was trying to pass a message to control,

which was unreadable and Police Sergeant GODDARD replied that the

message was unreadable.   A further message was then received that our

transmissions were breaking up badly and very difficult to

understand.   Police Constable RYAN was requested to raise the

communication officer from the gymnasium.     Before he could make the

call the comnunications officer appeared in the control room and said

that he had realised we were having radio problems and an officer had

brought him to the control room.   He described the fault as the

'Norman Collier' type fault of messages breaking up.    The base

stations are situated under the control roan desk and he set to work

on them.   We were operating fran a 'tulip' type microphone and I

gained the impression that he disconnected this microphone and

substituted a telephone hand-set type microphone for it.

Radio messages were caning in and the telephone microphone was handed

to Police Sergeant GODDARD.   He passed out a radio message and the

reply was grossly distorted and unreadable.     Police Sergeant

GODDARD tried a second time and the result was the same.     He put the

handset on the desk and looked exasperated.     I said to the

communications officer, "We must have communications - at least give

us talk-through and we will use a personal radio."     Radio messages

were still being received and Superintendent MARSHALL was calling.        I

had my own personal radio and tried to acknowledge Superintendent

MARSHALL on two or three occasions, but he was not receiving.

Superintendent MARSHALL was still requesting that tannoy messages be

passed about pushing and crushing in Leppings Lane and asked for the

assistance of the PA Landrover in the possession of Police Constable

BUXTON.    Police Sergeant GODDARD tried to contact Police Constable


                                                                               2479

BUXTON and Police Constable BICHARD and was asking Operations Room to

send a traffic car with PA to assist.     The radio suddenly started to

function properly, although this was on talk-through by way of a hand

held personal radio.

By about 1445 hours I could see from the CCTV that the crowd outside

the Leppings Lane turnstiles    was    now compacting and there appeared to

be a crush.      A radio request was   received from Superintendent

Marshall to open the gates at the Leppings Lane end to allow the crowd

in.     I estimated the crowd outside the turnstiles to be about two to

two a a half thousand.    He was asked to standby.     Looking at the

CCTV I could see that the mounted officers were being jostled and

appeared to be working singly and were totally surrounded by people.

Within a very short space of time, the crowd outside Leppings Lane

seemed to have changed from a large crowd of people to a compacted

mass.    Superintendent MARSHALL passed another radio message, asking

for the gates at Leppings Lane end to be opened saying that if we

didn't open them, people would be crushed.     At this time, I could see

that peoplewere climbing over the turnstiles and there seemed to be

very little     movement through the   A to G turnstiles.   InspectorBENNET

carre over the air, asking for assistance to Leppings Lane.     Police

Constable RYAN informed me that Inspector SEWELL had 8 or 10 serials

from 'D' Division at the gymnasium.     I immediately asked him to

despatch 5 sergeants and 50 men to the Leppings Lane end and keep

the rest on standby.     I was attempting at this stage, to raise Mr

LOCKE on the steward's radio to inform him that there were problems at

the Leppings Lane end turnstiles, but received no reply.

At about 1447 hours a further request was received from Superintendent

MARSHALL, to open the gates and this was followed by Police Constable

BICHARD, telling me that the 'gate's gone' or 'gate's burst.' I

I looked at the CCTV and saw that 'C' gate was open and all who were



                                                                                2480

immediately outside this gate - about one hundred - gained access. A

mounted officer recovered the situation and the gate was closed. This

was followed by a further message from Superintendent MARSHALL, asking

for the gates to be opened, followed almost immediately by a further

message saying, "Open the gates, open the gates." I turned to Chief

Suparintendent DUCKENFIELD who was standing on the raised area and

said, "Mr DUCKENFIELD, are we going to open those gates?" He replied,

"Opan the gates."    Police Sergeant GODDARD then sent out a message

to serials at Leppings Lane end to open the gates. At about 1449

hours on the CCTV I saw 'C' gate opened.    I was unable to see 'A'

or 'B' gates.   I saw a mounted officer controlling the flow through

'C' gate, but he was either pushed aside or withdrew and a heavy

flow then went into the area behind the west stand.

At about 1450 hours, an urgent request was then received from a unit

behind 'A' gate, which is the exit gate for the north stand (S20

Police Sergeant HIGGINS?) for that gate to be opened, followed

immediately by a request from the same officer, "The gate is going to

go if we don't open it and people will be killed."    Chief

Suparintendent DUCKENFIELD immediately authorised the gate to be

opened and Police Sergeant GODDARD sent out the radio message to that

effact.

At about 1452 hours the west stand appeared full.     The centre two

pens of the terrace appeared to be almost full, but there was still

soma room at the front of the two wing pens and in the northern

corner of the north west standing area.

At about 1458 hours I became aware of something happening behind the

west stand goal.     I was unable to see what it was but the Police

constable   was opening either gates 3 or 4 or both and a handful of

people were coining out onto the track and walking calmly and slowly

towards gate 1.     They then appeared to stand rather aimlessly on the



                                                                               2481

track and the police woman standing at gate 1, who was only a few

yards away, was totally unaware of their presence.   There was room

at die front of this pen and it seemed obvious to open this gate and

allow these people in.   Chief Inspector MCROBBIE was present in the

control room in civilian clothing and went down onto the track to

assist her and draw her attention to what was happening.

At about 1459 hours I became aware of people climbing from the west

terrace into the west stand.    (This had been a feature of the

previous soni-final when large numbers had climbed from the terrace

into the stand, but mainly at half-time).

By about 1500 hours more people were now being helped from the gates

at 3 and 4, onto the track.    No radio traffic was being received and

I was still unaware of the problem, but considered that there may be

soma pushing and crushing near to the wall and that people in that

location were being taken out for re-location in the two wing pens.

At about 1501 hours, the Chief Superintendent asked for Superintendent

GREENWOOD to go to Leppings Lane end and find out what was happening.

Mora people were now being helped onto the track through the gates

and seme were climbing over the perimeter fencing onto the track.

By about 1503 hours more and more people were now spilling onto the

track and were standing on the grass behind the touchline. Sane were

caning over the fence.   People were still climbing from the terrace,

into the stand.   Superintendent GREENWOOD arrived at the back of the

goal.   I could not hear any radio messages, but saw Superintendent

GREENWOOD, standing head and shoulders above the people at the back

of the goal, gesticulating, by waving his arms.    The message that he

was gesticulating, clearly conferred to me that he wanted the game to

be stopped and more and more people were now spilling onto the grass

and over the touch-line onto the field of play.    I heard Police

Sergeant GODDARD say, "Stop the game, stop the game."    I looted



                                                                              2482

towards the tunnel and saw no movement.     I hastily grabbed my hat and

coat and Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD said, "Yes stop it."       I went

down from the control room onto the track and approached the linesman.

He was running down towards the Leppings Lane end, and as he

approached me I took hold of his arm and said, "Stop the game."      He

ran straight past and obviously had not heard me and was intent on his

duties.   As I turned to follow him, I saw Superintendent GREENWOOD

running onto the pitch and stopping the game.     I then returned

immediately to the control room.

On returning to the control room, at about 1505 hours I could see

that more and more people were spilling onto the pitch and were now

scattering over the field, towards the edge of the penalty area.       I

was unaware of any radio messages being received and of what the

problem was, but seme people were sitting on the field.

At about 1506 hours, Police Constable RYAN was passing messages over

the public address system and people on the field of play were just

milling around.   Some were lying down and it was becoming apparent

that there were seme injuries.     Superintendent DUCKENFIELD asked me

to go down onto the field and try and clear people from the goal area

towards the wings.   As I left the control room, I was aware of Police

Constable BICHARD requesting an ambulance to stand by.

On arrival on the field, at about 1507 hours, I saw that people

appeared shocked and dazed - seme were lying on the ground and were

obviously injured.

As I approached the goal I could not see the gates onto the track as

these were surrounded by Police Officers, but I could see that people

were apparently jammed hard against the wire fence and their faces

were starting to discolour.   I was aware that we had a serious problem

and that many people may be injured.     I was not in possession of a

radio and realised that one or two ambulances would be insufficient.



                                                                                2483

I approached two police constables, neither of whom had radios and

then saw a sergeant and took his radio from him.     I could now see

that seme Officers were giving mouth to mouth resuscitation to people

lying on the grass and that officers and spectators were trying to get

people over the fence but with little success.     There was no apparent

movement at the rear of the two centre pens and these people in this

area seemed to be merely standing and looking out onto the field.

At about 1508 hours I called control and was acknowledged.       I asked

for a 'fleet of ambulances' as many people appeared to be injured.          I

requested continuous tannoy messages to the Leppings Lane end to ask

people to move back.     I may also have requested cutting equipment for

the fences.   With other officers, I attempted to clear other people

from the field, who appeared to be just standing around and getting in

the way of injured people.     Some of these people were in an

agitated state.

At 1510 hours there was still no apparent movement at the back of the

centre pens and people were still spilling onto the pitch.       I made a

further radio request for tannoy messages for people at Leppings Lane

terraces to move back.    There was still no movement and I could see

that marry police officers were engaged in the rescue operation

along the fence.

At about 1514 hours, I made my way to the rear of Leppings Lane

terraces and into the central tunnel.    The tunnel was almost clear,

with about 50 persons in it.     I saw an Inspector and with him and

othar officers moved people out of the tunnel and on to the concourse

at the rear of the stand.

At about 1522 hours I made my way back to the pitch.     Spectators were

encroaching up to the half way line, seme in angry and threatening

mood, saying it was a 'shitty ground' and gesticulating with their

antis towards Forrest supporters. A man attempted to climb on top of



                                                                                     2484

the goal posts at the Leppings Lane end, but before he could stand on

top of the posts he was pulled down by police officers.     This

invoked adverse reaction from the crowd.   This man was very drunk but

I instructed officers not to arrest him and he was allowed to go.         I

saw that serials were deployed along the track at the north stand and

to a lesser degree along the Kop, but not along the south stand.      I

took one serial from the north stand (Police Sergeant DYSON) and

asked them to re-deploy on the south stand side, near to the half way

line to prevent supporters encroaching over the half way line and

causing problems which would hinder the rescue operation.    A full

scale rescue operation was being carried out.   Advertising hoardings

were being used to carry injured people away and Police Officers were

still giving mouth to mouth resuscitation to seme injured people.

People were being carried towards the gymnasium exit and some towards

the players' tunnel by Liverpool supporters and Police Officers.

At about 1525 hours, I was contacted by a senior fire service officer

and asked if I could maintain a clear gangway in the south stand for

the removal of casualties.   This was arrangedwith two or three

police officers and the help of members of the public in that area,

who offered assistance.

At about 1530 hours I spoke to Superintendent CHAPMAN on the pitch,

who said he would look after the Kop end and the officers deployed

there and then spoke to Inspector WALLACE, who said he would look after

the north stand and officers deployed in that area.

At about 1535 hours, I returned to ground control and appraised the

Chief Superintendent of the situation as best I could.    I told him

that there were many injuries and possibly sane fatalities.    At this

time there was an ambulance on the perimeter track    and there were

still hundreds of people on the Leppings Lane half of the field.       I

saw that some Police Officers were beginning to deploy towards the


                                                                                   2485

halfway line.   A number of ambulances had taken up position in the

road from the south stand towards Leppings Lane.    Police control

contained the Chief Superintendent and ACC (Operations).     The Chief

Suparintendent left control followed by ACC to visit Directors and

appraise them of the situation.   The control room was arranging for off-

duty police constables to attend at Hairmerton Road Police Station and

Casualty Bureau staff at the ground to attend Ecclesfield.

Assistance was offered to me by officers of Humberside mounted

department, who had been at the Barnsley football match and I

accepted this and asked him to attend the ground.

At about 1545 hours I spoke with a senior fire officer, who requested

that all ambulances from the south stand/I^ppings Lane side, be

transferred to the Penistone Road end - this was arranged.     About

this time, a cordon was being arranged across the pitch at the

halfway line.

A short time later, ground control was visited by Mr Brian CLOUQI and

Mr fenny DALGLIESH. Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD spoke to them

and advised them that the game would be abandoned and they may tell

the players but he did not wish to tell the supporters at this stage,

as if they left the ground, they would seriously hamper the rescue

operation by blocking the lines of communication between the ground

and the hospitals.   Both agreed to this course of action and Mr

DALGLIESH spoke to the Liverpool fans by the public address system and

askad them to keep calm and this was well received.

Chiaf Superintendent NESBIT requested that dog handlers be deployed

and this was arranged and they were asked to go to the Penistone Road

end of the ground for deployment.

About 1610 hours a message was received frcrn ACC (Operations) Mr

JACKSON that people in the stadium could be told that the event was to

be abandoned.   Messages were passed to Operations Rocm and Hairmerton



                                                                              2486

Road for routes to be monitored, and arrangments had been made for

the early dispersal of the coaches, public transport and special

trains.    All officers were instructed by radio to exercise sympathy

and understanding with people leaving the stadium.

I passed a full public address message informing the whole stadium

that the event had been abandoned and requested that they retained

their tickets and informed than that there had been a serious

incident with many casualties    and requested that people remain in

their places for a short while, until we were sure that all the injured

had been carried to hospital.    This message was repeated twice.

This was well-received and it was not until about ten minutes later

that people started to leave the stadium.    The stadium slowly

emptied.   About 1630 hours the Chief Constable contacted ground

control and was appraised of the situation by ACC (Operations) Mr

JACKSON.

Ground Control was visited at different times to my knowledge by Mr

MACKRELL, the Club Secretary, the Deputy Chief Constable of

Merseyside, Senior Fire Officers, the Production Manager of the BBC

team, who offered to put out the Casualty Enquiry Bureau number.

As the crowd dispersed, reports of fighting were received at several

locations, including Wadsley Lane, Parkside Road and 'Bassetts'

public house on Cowper Avenue and Penistone Road and mobile serials

were dispatched to deal with each problem.

Liaison was maintained with the Coroner and the Coroner's Officer.

Initially, authority was given to call out the firm of Kenyons to

deal with the deceased, but this was later amended to indicate that

no bodies should be moved until they had been photographed and

identified at the ground and then this was to be carried out by the

ambulance service.    All messages were relayed to the gymnasium.

The two centre pens of the Leppings Lane terraces were searched by a


                                                                                2487

          team of Criminal Investigation Department Officers under the control

          of Detective Sergeant LINDLEY.    The terraces were later searched on

          a second occasion by officers of 'D' Division support group whom I had

          deployed to contain this area.    After the second search the area was

           'taped off.'

          About 6.30 pm (1830) units were deployed to assist in the area of the

          Northern General Hospital after reports had been received that large

          numbers of Liverpool supporters were gathering and problems were

          feared.    At about 8 pm (2000) officers on reserve duty at Hanmerton

          Road were detailed to contain the gymnasium after reports that members

          of the press were causing problems and trying to gain access to this

          area.

          About 9 pm (2100) I took up duties in the temporary mortuary,

          counselling officers and liaising with welfare and clerical workers.

          About 10.40 pm (2240) I visited Niagara Sports club, where I had been

          infDimed a large number of officers had been taken suffering from

          shock, associated with the incident and assisted in a counselling

          rola.

          About 11.30 pm (2330) I returned to Hanmerton Road Police Station to

          check that arrangements had been made for visits by VIP's who were

          scheduled to visit later that day and continued to counsel officers

          on duty at that station.

          At 0100 hours I retired from duty.

           I am a Superintendent in the South Yorkshire Police and

           currently hold the post of Sub-Divisional Commander at F2 Sub-

           Division,     Ecclesfield.

           I have completed ten years in the rank of Superintendent,                 two of

           w hich    (1981/2)   (000081)    (000082) were at FI Sub-Division,        Hammerton

           Rd, where I was responsible for policing Hillsborough Football

           Ground.      I have also undertaken command responsibilities in respect

           of previous FA Cup semi-finals held at Hillsborough in 1987                 (000087)

           and 1988     (000088).

           In connection wit h the 1989         (000089) FA Cup Semi-Final,        scheduled to

           take place on the 15th April 1989             (150489)   at Hillsborough,   I was

           designated Sector 3 Command - Nottingham Forest - The same area of

           command I held in 1987          (000087)   and 1988     (000088).   Operational Order

           Fl/89     (produced)    describes in full my area of command.
                                                                         PAGE 2

In preparation for the 1989    (000089) FA Cup Semi-Final,        I attended

pre-match meetings on the 22nd March (220389) and 10th April 1989

(100489) held at Hammerton Rd Police Station, and a pre-match

briefing held on the 14th April 1989      (140489)   at Hillsborough

Stadium.

At the pre-match briefing I spoke collectively and individually to

all Chief Inspectors and Inspectors under m y command and also

Inspector DAVIS   (Mounted Branch)   advising them of their specific

responsibilities,    highlighting potential difficulties,        and clarifying

any areas of doubt.     I then toured those areas of Sector 3

immediately around the stadium with my officers to familiarise them

with the locality and reinforce the instructions previously given

(Briefing notes produced).

On Saturday the 15th April 1989      (150489),   I commenced duty at 8.15 am

(0815) at Ecclesfield Police Station and then with Chief Inspector

SUMNER I was conveyed to the Hillsborough ground in a Police Land

Rover driven by POL PC1863 BUXTON      (Fl).

At 10 am (1000)   I attended the main briefing in the North Stand which

was addressed by Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD (Overall Command),

Superintendent MURRAY    (Ground Control),     Detective Superintendent

MACKAY   (CID) and Detective Sergeant CHARLESWORTH      (DIO).

At approximately 10.45/10.50 am (1045/1050)        I left Hillsborough Stadia

in a Police Land Rover driven by PC BUXTON,        and travelled the main

routes into the ground for Nottingham Forest Supporters,          visiting Fir

Vale and Neepsend.    I then visited the Chief Inspectors and Serial

Inspectors under m y command to ensure that all were in place and

aware of their duties and responsibilities.

I remained operational, visiting different locations and monitoring

the build up of supporters on route to the ground, paying particular

attention to Licensed Premises.




                                                                      248SB
                                                                          PAGE 3
                                                                          S203

On three occasions between 11.00 am and 2.00 pm,      (1100 and 1400)       I

attended at the Five Arches public house,      Southey, where there was a

heavy concentration of Nottingham Forest Supporters.          I advised

ground control of the situation and requested passing attention by

the Southey mobile    (Tango 8).   I also instructed Inspector BATEMAN

(C), the Sub-Sector Commander,     to maintain a police presence at the

premises to monitor events and prevent any disorder.

At approximately 2.10 pm,    (1410)   I attended the Royal public house at

Owlerton in response to radio transmissions indicating that public

order problems were being experienced.       The premises had, however,

been closed prior to m y arrival and Chief Inspector PRICE was present

and in control of the situation.

At approximately 2.30 pm,    (1430)   I went to Herries Rd,    following

reports that private coaches containing Nottingham Forest supporters

were de-busing in the road and not at the Bus Depot.          I remained in

that locality whe n at approximately 2.45/2.50,     (1445/1450) POL PC

BUXTON indicated he had received a radio message instructing him to

take the Land Rover and use the P.A.      system to alleviate congestion m

Leppings Ln.    The officer was released to undertake that task.

I remained in Herries Rd and subsequently heard a number of radio

transmissions   (perhaps two or three)   concerning problems with fans in

Leppings Ln.    The radio reception was poor and broken and there was

no clear indication of what the problem was.       There was then one or

possibly 2 further transmissions from an officer      'on the ground'

making a plea for a gate or gates      (Reception was not clear enough to

determine which)   to be opened.

I made my w a y towards the ground along Herries Rd and Herries Rd

South, monitoring the flow of Nottingham Forest fans which had

thinned considerably.    There was little evidence of congestion in

Penistone Rd North.




                                                                    2488C
                                                                         PAGE 4
                                                                         S203

At approximately 3.05 pm,    (1505)   I was in Herries Rd South near to tfe

junction with Penistone Rd North,      listening to radio transmissions.

The transmissions were badly distorted,      but I heard mention of

Leppings Ln and background noises which suggested that there were

possible problems of disorder at the Leppings Ln end of the ground.

At 3.08/3.10 pm,    (1508/1510)   I received a radio transmission directig

all officers to enter the ground.       I made m y w a y towards   '0' Gate,

Penistone Rd North, and saw a number of serials entering           '0' Gate as

I approached.     I also saw Inspector BOOTH (E Div) making his way to

'0' Gate.

From   '0' Gate I went to the access area between the North Stand and

the Spion Kop and then onto the perimeter track.         I looked towards

the Leppings Ln end and saw a heavy contingent of Police Officers

containing what appeared to be some form of pitch invasion and

disorder.    M a n y more Police Officers were converging at that

location.

I observed the Nottingham Forest supporters on the Spion Kop and it

was immediately apparent that their mood was hostile with supporters

chanting,    clapping and making violent gestures directed toward the

Leppings Ln end.     There was only a handful of officers at the far end

of the perimeter track (South Stand end)        and I concluded that it was

necessary to retain a contingent of officers at the Spion Kop end to

defuse the situation and prevent any possibility of a pitch

invasion.     I signalled officers on to the perimeter track and formed

a line in front of the Kop facing the fans in order to contain the

situation.    The atmosphere was   'electric'   and the noise levels such

that I could not hear any clear radio messages other than

intermittent and distorted transmissions.

Two or three spectators    (presumably Liverpool) made their way from

the Leppings Ln end toward the Spion Kop gesticulating and provoking




                                                                      2488D
                                                                             PAGE 5
                                                                             S203
 a similar and very hostile response from supporters on the Kop.               I

 detailed officers to usher them back towards the Leppings Lane end.

 I was joined by a person who identified himself as the              'Commercial

Agent'    for Nottingham Forest and together we walked up and down the

perimeter track signalling to spectators in the Kop in an attempt to

calm the siutation.           Our actions had no effect.

I became aware of persons, obviously injured, being carried on

stretchers to the corner of the pitch near to the access route

between the North Stand and Spion Kop.             I went to that location and

saw three or four persons obviously in trauma on the ground with the

'carriers'      rendering first aid and attempting resuscitation.           Other

stretchers carriers were making their w a y towards the same location

and attempts were made to channel them out of the ground toward the

gymnasium behind the North Stand.             I also recall an ambulance making

its w a y on to the pitch from the access area between the North Stand

and Spion Kop.

Whilst these activities were ongoing fans in the Spion Kop were

clapping and cheering, but I cannot say whether their actions were

intended to be derisory or an expression of appreciation for those

engaged with c a s u a l t i e s .   Nevertheless their actions seemed to

provoke a surge of Liverpool supporters from the Leppings Ln end and

large numbers advanced towards the Spion Kop with Police Officers

from the Leppings Ln end moving to contain the surge.

The Liverpool supporters were gradually ushered back toward the

centre of he ground where I saw Chief Superintendent NESBITT

organising a cordon of officers across the breadth of the pitch.               I

joined in that task to prevent any further movement of fans and

reduce the potential for disorder.

I conferred wit h Chief Superintendent NESBITT,          advised him about the

steps taken to contain the Spion Kop end and,           as further




                                                                          2488E
                                                                      PAGE 6
                                                                      S203

 reinforcements,   called for dog handlers to come on to the pitch at

 the Spion Kop end to prevent any possible pitch invasion.

 At this time a number of casualties were being funnelled through the

 cordon and I was becoming more and more aware of the scale of the

 incident and the fact that their were several fatalities.        It was

equally clear that the majority of people in the lower ends of the

North and South Stands and presumably the whole of the Spion Kop had

little true perception of what had happened.

I saw the ACC Operations, Mr JACKSON, on the pitch and conferred with

him and Chief Superintendent NESBITT,       in the centre of the field.    I

was told by Mr JACKSON that there were major casualties in and around

the Leppings Ln end including a number of fatalities and he stressed

the need to preserve order and allow casualties to be removed from

the ground.     I was detailed by M r JACKSON to maintain the central

cordon, prevent disorder and attempt to calm the situation.

It was either at this stage or shortly after,        following consultation

between myself and Chief Superintendent NESBITT, a radio message was

passed to Ground Control requesting a public announcement to assist

the crowd's understanding of the incident and appealing for calm.

The scene at the Leppings Ln end was one of confusion with hundreds

of people spread across the breadth of the pitch completely obscuring

the terraces.    Civilians,   Police Officers and St. Johns Ambulance

officers were assisting and resuscitating injured persons.         Groups of

Liverpool supporters were milling around amongst the casualties many

approaching the cordon obviously in trauma and displaying a mixture

°f grief and anger.     I approached several groups attempting to calm

the situation and requesting that they move to the outer perimeter

tracks. Most were receptive, but certain individuals proved

vociferous and made abusive comments about the Police,        Sheffield

W edn e s d a y Club and Nottingham Forest fans.   I particularly recall one




                                                                    248SF

                                                                             S203

group of four young men, one of whom repeatedly directed abuse at me

s h o u y i n g , "It's you bastards, you caused t h i s ”.   He was physically

restrained by two of his friends who indicated that he was               'talking

in drink'.       (Comments which confirmed m y own observations of the

individuals c o n d i t i o n ) .    They then helped to defuse the situation by

ushering him away toward the perimiter track.

The atmosphere gradually calmed after public announcements were made

to the crowd, one of which declared the match abandoned.                Shortly

after this announcement there was a noticeable drift away from the

Spion Kop end as Nottingham Forest fans left the ground.

Chief Superintendent NESBITT gave an instruction that the cordon of

Police Officers in the centre of the pitch should be reduced by half,

one half remaining as a cordon and the other half exiting into

Penistone Road North to supervise the dispersal of Nottingham Forest

fans.    Chief Superintendent NESBITT remained with the cordon and I

left the ground to supervise the dispersal of Nottingham Forest

fans.    I was joined in that task by Chief Inspector B E A L (F I ) and

Inspector WALLACE        (E).       The Nottingham Forest fans dispersed orderly

by service buses and private coaches and once it was clear that there

was no risk of disorder I returned to the ground and sought further

instructions      from Ground Control.         I was requested to   'stand by' at

the rear of the North Stand.

I visited the gymnasium where I saw rows of bodies laid out on the

floor, each supervised by a Police Officer.              This was the first time

I fully realised the extent and magnitude of what had happened.               A

number of officers who were with the bodies were clearly distressed

(some of them m y own F2 officers - POL PC's 2963 SINGH,             2902 ROBERTS

and 1124 PRATT)      and I spent time counselling them and enquiring

about their welfare.            I then went into the North Stand where in

conjunction with Superintendent GREENWOOD and Inspector SYKES I spoke




                                                                          2488G
                                                                               PAGE 8
                                                                               S203

          with m a n y other officers who were clearly in a state of shock, again

          counselling the officers and ensuring their needs were met.

         At a later stage in response to a radio message I met other Senior

          Officers at Ground Control.     Chief Superintendent MOLE   (B) was preset

         and he requested that I, together with Superintendent GREENWOOD and

          Inspector SYKES should go to Claywheels Ln    (The   'stand down' and

         Departure Point)   and the Niagara Social Club to look after the welfaE

         of any officers still at those locations.      I remained engaged in that

         task until    11.45pm (2345) when instructions were received to    'stand

         d o w n '.

         From entering the Hillsborough Stadium at 3.08/3.10pm (1508/1510))          to

         leaving and supervising the dispersal of Nottingham Forest fans at

         3.50/4.00pm (1550/1600)     I have no precise recollection of times

         associated with the sequences described.

            S t a t e s :-

            Further to m y previous recollection and statements,           on 10 April 1989

               (100489)      I attended a pre match briefing at Hammerton Rd Police Statm

            in connection with the Cup Semi Final at Hillsborough Stadium to be

            held on 15 April         1989   (150489).   The meeting was also attended by Su£

            MURRAY,       GREENWOOD,   BROUGHTON (OPS/Traffic)    and also present were Insp

            SEWELL,       an Inspector from Road Traffic,      a representative from 'D'

            Division and a number of others who's details I can not now recall.

            The initial discussions were concerned with matters effecting traffic

            and traffic logistics,          then those officers involved left.

            Thereafter the discussions were led by C/Supt DUCKENFIELD who dealt

            with the overall strategy and invited sector commanders to comment or

            raise any matters relating to their areas of command.             For m y own pafc

            I raised a number of issues effecting m y area of responsibility.              The

            Operational Order for the match which was published at this time was

            used as a basis for the discussion.

            During the course of the meeting I can not specifically recall any

            discussion taking place regarding the movement of Liverpool fans from




                                                                                    24801

off the   "Spion Kop" to other areas of the ground.        That said, this wa

not part of m y area of responsibility and so I would not necessarily

have reason to remember it.        I have been told that Supt GREENWOOD may

have raised this during these discussions and I have no reason to dob

that he would have given that it was his particular responsibility ad

knowing the problems that can arise in implementing the movement of

fans, at an all ticket match, where all tickets have been sold and

displacement from one part of the ground to another can bring about fe

authorised capacities being exceeded.

I know that in 1981     (000081) when I was a Superintendent at Hammerton

Rd, Supt GREENWOOD was an Inspector under m y command at the Cup Semi

Final between Spurs and Wolves.        As such he was on duty inside the

ground at the Leppings Lane end whe n an incident involving a number d>

fans on the terraces took place and the perimeter gates had to be

opened by him to relieve that situation.         Consequently he is perhaps

more aware than most, of the problems that can occurr with the movemfe

of fans causing authorised levels of capacity to be exceeded.            AgainI

can not remember Supt GREENWOOD mentioning this incident at the

meetings although I have no reason to doubt that he m a y have.

On 14 April   1989   (140489)   I attended a Sub Sector Commanders briefing

at Hillsborough Stadium which was conducted by C/Supt D U C K E N F I E L D .

Also present was Supt MURRAY,      Supt MARSHALL,   Supt GREENWOOD and

p ossibly D/Supt McKAY as well as C/lnspectors and Inspectors in charg

of Sub Sectors.      C/Supt DUCKENFIELD dealt with the overall strategy d

identified the areas of responsibility to the various commanders,           aga

referring to the Police Order.       At the end of his address he then

passed to Sub Sector Commanders out to their various commanders who

conducted their own briefings for their areas of command.

The following day 15 April 1989       (150489) at 10 am (1000), there was a




                                                                       2488 J

mass briefing in the North Stand for all officers engaged on the

operation.        This was addressed by C/Supt DUCKENFIELD re overall

command,     Supt MURRAY re ground control and communications D/Supt McKS

re CID involvement and D/Sgt C H A R L E S W O R T H , re intelligence as I have

previously mentioned in m y recollection.           C/Supt DUCKENFIELD worked

from a prepared briefing note stressing the importance of the occasio

and the need for all officers to behave in a manner which would reflfe

credit on the South Yorkshire Police.

Whilst C/Supt DUCKENFIELD dealt with the issues of public order withm

a crowd context,        ie the use of banners,    flags, climbing of fencing, st

turn making reference to the ground regulations and what was and was

not permitted.         I do not recall him making a specific issue of crowd

safety in a distinct and separate sense.            However,   the whole tone of

the briefing was geared towards preventing disorder to allow the

majority of the supporters to enjoy a major sporting event and I see

the public order/public safety elements as being intrinsically linked

This was reinforced by Supt MURRAY addressing the crowd emergency

evacuation p r o c e d u r e s .

As I have mentioned in m y previous recollection,          I have been dealing

with football matches in the South Yorkshire Police area since 1981

(000081)    and I have personally briefed at several major matches.           I

consider that C/Supt DUCKENFIELD'S briefings were thorough but

succinct, dealt with the main principles and strategies involved, qufe

properly leaving the fine detail of briefing to his sector and sub

sector commanders.          His orchestration of the various briefing should

have left no officer in any doubt about what his/her responsibilities

were on the day.

            I am a Chief Inspector in the South Yorkshire Police, at present

            stationed at Hanmerton Road Police Station.

            On 29 March 1989 (290389), together with Superintendent MURRAY and

            Inspector SEWELL, I attended a meeting at Divisional Headquarters with

            Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD in his office, where we discussed

            the Operational Order and how arrangements were firming up.      Minor

            amendments were made to the Order but otherwise it was all right.        The

            Operational Order was completed, approved and subsequently circulated

            on the evening of 5 April 1989 (050489).

            At 9.00am (0900) on Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489), I paraded for

            duty at Haitmerton Road Police Station.    The weather was fine and sunny.

            I travelled with Superintendent MURRAY to Sheffield Wednesday

            Football Stadium where my duties were in the areas of the Spion Kop

            and the South Stand, my Sector Commander being Superintendent


                                                                                           2489
                                                                 PAGE    2
                                                                 S964A

GREENWOOD. Together with all other officers involved in policing the

Semi Final, I took a seat in the North Stand where Chief

Superintendent DUCKENFIELD briefed all concerned using a public

address system. During his briefing, he identified all Sector

Commanders, Superintendent MURRAY and Detective Superintendent MCKAY.

Superintendent MURRAY then briefed all officers as to communications

and emergency evacuation procedures, informing everyone that the two

tests carried out previously had been successful, in fact I believe

the word 'excellent' was used.   Mr MURRAY was followed by Detective

Sergeant CHARLESWORTH who appraised everyone as to the current

intelligence concerning both Liverpool and Nottingham supporters.

Finally, Inspector SEWELL informed all officers regarding issue of

radios, meals and not to 'stand down' without authority of Police

Control.

The main briefing ended and I subsequently joined Superintendent

GREENWOOD on the Spion Kop where we spoke with Inspectors CALVERT and

BOOTH and their respective Serials.   During this briefing,

Superintendent GREENWOOD informed the officers of the fact that the

taped off area at the North Wing of the Spion Kop would be used for

Liverpool supporters who purchased tickets for that area.     This

segregation area would, of necessity, require containment by police

officers and Mr GREENWOOD recounted his experience of last years Semi

Final and public disorder which occurred on the Spion Kop at this

location.

Together with Superintendent GREENWOOD, I then went to an area behind

the Spion Kop as this area is barren and there are loose stones which

could be used as amnunition. We found that there were stones in that

area but neither of us were unduly concerned.

I then left Superintendent GREENWOOD and walked over to the South

Stand where Inspector DARLING was in the process of briefing stewards
                                                                 PAGE      3
                                                                 S964A

for that area.    One steward was walking away whilst the briefing was

in progress and I therefore spoke to him.    He told me that he had

heard it all before but I reminded him that it was important he paid

attantion as 'sods law' dictated that if he did not something would go

wrong in his particular area.

I then proceeded to patrol the perimeter track, South Stand, South

Stand car park, sterile area, Penistone Road North and returned

eventually to the Spion Kop.    During my tour I spoke with all officers

on their respective duties to ensure that all officers were performing

their allocated duties and that none of them had any problems.      I

repeated this procedure at regular intervals.

At 12 noon (1200) as spectators began to enter the Stadium, Liverpool

supporters were identified on the Spion Kop and the segregation plan

at the North Wing was implemented using officers from the Spion Kop

Terrace Serial.

I recall seeing Police Constable GREEN apprehend a youth in the Spion

Kop whilst I was stood near to the segregated area.    The youth was

wearing a green rugby jersey and was struggling.    I went to his

assistance and ascertained that the youth had made rude gestures

(masturbating) to the Nottingham Forest supporters. I helped Police

Constable GREEN take the youth to the Police Room at the rear of the

North Stand where I left them.    I returned to the Spion Kop for a

short while to monitor the mood of the crowd and it appeared good

humoured.

I continued to tour the Serials under my supervision at regular

intervals but no problems were being experienced.

As the crowds increased on the Spion Kop and the numbers of Liverpool

supporters in the segregated area on the Kop increased, then I found

it necessary to increase the number of officers in that area.       The

number of Liverpool supporters on the Kop eventually reached well in
                                                                 PAGE    4
                                                                 S964A

excess of 500 and Inspector CALVERT and an entire Serial were

eventually utilized.

Throughout my tour of duties I maintained personal contact with

Superintendent GREENWOOD and gave that officer regular updates

regarding the areas under my direct supervision.

At one particular stage I believe around 2.15pm (1415) I became

aware that my radio was transmitting intermittently.   By that I mean

I could only hear approximately every other word.   I informed Police

Control and stated I intended to change my radio battery at the

Gymnasium at the rear of the North Stand.

I made my way via the South Stand car park where I spoke to a Mounted

Officer who informed me he was experiencing similar difficulties with

his radio.   I walked up Penistone Road North where I was struck by the

lack of traffic and comparative small number of Nottingham Forest

supporters queuing outside the turnstiles.    In fact I saw Chief

Superintendent NESBIT in the Range Rover and recall passing comment on

the self same subject.   I then went to the gymnasium and exchanged my

radio battery but a test transmission revealed no improvement.      I

therefore walked onto the perimeter track via the access route between

the Spion Kop and the North Stand, the time would be approximately

2.30pm (1430).   I noticed that the Spion Kop was approximately two

thirds full whilst the North Stand was only half full.    The West Stand

was filling nicely but plenty of empty seats were visible and whilst

the two centre pens were filling up there was plenty of room at both

North and South ends of the terraces.   I remarked on this to Police

Constable LAMB who was the first officer I met on the track.

I was then joined by the Cormunications officer who stated he

understood that radio problems were being experienced. I informed him

of the trouble I had experienced and elected to walk him around the

perimeter track to the Police Control Room.    This I did, the time
                                                                  PAGE        5
                                                                  S964A

being approximately 2.40pm (1440).   I left the Comnumcations Officer

at the foot of the stairs leading to the Police Control Box and I

again walked around the external perimeter of the Stadium; all was in

order; traffic was light and the number of pedestrians manageable.

I returned to the perimeter track via the access route between the

Spion Kop and the North Stand and this time noted that the Spion Kop

had filled up as had the South Stand.   There was still seating

available in the North Stand (approximately three quarters full), the

West Stand had filled up, the centre pens appeared full but there was

still room visible at the North and South wings of the terracing.

I turned to face the Spion Kop, looked at the segregated area which by

now contained well in excess of 500 Liverpool supporters.   Recognising

the potential public disorder problem which could arise and already

mentioned by Superintendent GREENWOOD at briefing, I signalled to

Inspector Calvert who was with a Serial at the side of the segregated

area that I wished to speak with him at the rear of the North Stand in

five minutes; the time would be approximately 2.50pm (1450).

I then spoke with five Liverpool supporters who were on the Spion Kop

behind Gate 6.   As I did so I saw Police Constable Holmes escorting

some Liverpool supporters to the segregated area in the Spion Kop.        I

advised the five youths I was speaking to, to join them but they

ignored me.   (These youths were later taken out of the Spion Kop and

removed from the Stadium for their own safety).

 I recall at this time hearing radio transmissions but I was unable

to decipher the exact content due to the noise in the ground and

what I took to be background interference.    This was despite the fact

 that my radio was fitted with an earpiece.   I did, however, hear the

 word 'gate' or 'gates' mentioned and I therefore went to the rear of

 the North Stand with a view to listening to the transmission as well

 as discussing segregation problems on the Spion Kop with Inspector
                                                                 PAGE      6
                                                                 S964A

Calvert.

On reaching the quieter area behind the North Stand, I distinctively

heard the voice of a male officer.    I would describe the tone as

excited and urgent and was asking for authority to open the 'gate'

or 'gates'.   Terminology was used to the effect that if this was not

dona, then deaths would result.    The request was made more than once

but I am unable to say on how many occasions or whether by one or more

officers.

At this time I was joined by Inspector CALVERT.    We agreed to double

man the cordon on the segregation area on the Spion Kop fifteen

minutes after kick off.

I then returned to the Spion Kop as I was aware the game had started,

my attention being drawn by the roar of the crowd.    Simultaneously, I

saw the Nottingham Forest supporters pointing towards the West Stand

and terracing and appeared angry and abusive.     I did not know at that

stage what had caused this reaction but on looking towards the West

Stand and terracing from the Spion Kop end I saw what appeared to

be a mass of press officers in between the Leppings Lane end goal and

the terraces.     This bank of people obscured my view of the terracing

but I could see people climbing over the top of the perimeter fencing

onto the track.     I could not see police officers because of the people

behind the goal obscuring my view and I recall my immediate impression

was that a pitch invasion was taking place.

Radio transmissions were still poor and this, coupled with the noise

of the crowd, made any signals inaudible.

I immediately instructed all officers on the perimeter track to

monitor the crowd on the Spion Kop as their mood was angry and

violent.    I also saw Police Sergeant BATTY on the South Wing of the

Spion Kop terraces and I signalled to him to go over to the segregated

area to assist Inspector CALVERT and his Serial, the public disorder
                                                                  PAGE    7
                                                                  S964A

potential in that area now being great.

At this juncture police officers came running down the access point

froii the direction of the gymnasium and I directed them down the

perimeter track in front of the North Stand, towards the Leppings Lane

terraces.

The Spion Kop was now bubbling, the crowd were booing, shouting abuse

and making violent gestures towards the Liverpool supporters.    The

fiva Liverpool supporters were removed via Gate 6 at this point.

A minor skirmish occurred but this was quickly brought tinder control.

Additional officers came via the South Wing of the Spion Kop and these

wera allowed onto the perimeter track via Gate 1 and directed in

front of the South Stand to the Leppings Lane end.

I could see that the number of supporters on the perimeter track was

swelling behind the goal mouth and then was aware that Superintendent

GREENWOOD had run onto the pitch and stopped the game.

I recall Liverpool supporters running over to the Spion Kop end,

singularly at first, and police officers moving forward to deal with

then.

The crowd behind the goal quickly swelled onto the pitch and into the

penalty area.   A St John's Ambulance came down the access road frcm

the direction of the gymnasium and advertising hoardings were broken

and removed to allow free access onto the pitch.     It was then driven

to the Leppings Lane end.

Police officers and supporters were together carrying persons on

stretchers, on advertising hoardings and by hand to the North Stand/

Spion Kop c o m e r of the pitch and were administering mouth to mouth

resuscitation to some.   It was apparent at that stage that there had

been deaths, although I am unable to say how many.    Supporters were

also ripping down advertising hoardings at the Spion Kop end of the

Stadium and these in turn were being taken to the Leppings Lane end.
                                                                  PAGE       8
                                                                  S964A

On realising the potential enormity of the problem I ran to the

gymnasium and told the officers there to clear the area for use as a

temporary mortuary.

I raturned to the playing area and there I saw Police Sergeant

ROBINSON en route to the Leppings Lane end, called him over to assist

with First Aid as I knew he was a First Aid Instructor.      I then turned

to another group in time to see them covering a youth's face and

stating he was dead.     They attempted to lift the advertising hoarding

he was on but one man was so distressed, he walked away and I took

hold of the temporary stretcher.    Together we carried the body to the

gymnasium, however, manoeuverability was limited due to the number of

people carrying the injured and dead and therefore the dead man's booty

was carried by four of us into the gymnasium.    As we carried the dead

man to the gymnasium I remember urine flowing frcm the area of the

North Stand Upper Level concourse onto us and officers were sent to

deal with the problem.    Once inside the gymnasium I was aware that a

number of people (exact number not known) were laid on the floor,

apparently dead.   A number of relatives and friends as well as police

officers were in the area, many were distressed, some were angry and

directing insults at the police.    Detective Sergeant SMITH approached

me and stated that officers were not realising the importance of

remaining with bodies and I assigned him the duty of ensuring at least

one officer remained with each booty to ensure continuity.

A number of officers were persuading none police personnel to leave

the gymnasium and I returned to the pitch to rejoin officers there.

On Tty return I noticed that the number of police officers on the

perimeter track had been increased and I spoke with some of them

reminding them of the need for vigilance in respect of the Nottingham

Forest supporters on the Spion Kop.    Their mood was still angry and

abusive and I formed the opinion that the majority of them did not
                                                                   PAGE    9

realise the enormity of what had occurred.

I saw Superintendent CHAPMAN at this end of the ground and I spoke

with him.   He told me to monitor the Nottingham supporters in the

South Stand to ensure a pitch invasion did not take place.     Extra men

had already been deployed in this area.

A cordon of police officers had been formed across the halfway line to

contain the Liverpool supporters. On satisfying self that all was in

order, I went to the halfway line cordon.    There were a large number

of Liverpool supporters in this area of the pitch, many were

distressed, many bewildered, a large number smelled heavily of drink

and a considerable amount of abuse was being hurled both at the police

as well as derogatory remarks being made about the Football

Association.

Slowly the mood of the crowd calmed down and Chief Superintendent

NESBIT approached me and asked me to take half of the halfway line

cordon outside to supervise Nottingham supporters as they left the

Stadium as an announcement was shortly to be made telling the crowd

that the match had been abandoned.

I took these officers into Penistone Road North, together with

Superintendent CHAPMAN.   That officer organized a cordon across the

dual carriageway to filter Nottingham supporters away frcm the

Liverpool sector whilst I instructed Police Constable BUXTON to park

his Land Rover on the Central Reservation and I used that vehicle's

public address system to advise supporters to turn right on leaving

the ground for transport back to Midland Railway Station.    The

supporters were formed into orderly queues, buses were sent in batches

to the Catchbar Lane side of the junction of Penistone Road North and

Herries Road South and were loaded.

When this task was completed, I returned to the rear of the North

Stand and heard a radio transmission regarding fighting in the
                                                                 PAGE 10

Hillsborough Park area.   I therefore gathered ad hoc Tango units

together and instructed them to ask Ground Control for a call sign

before being deployed to whatever incident arose.

It was then apparent that there were a number of officers without

specific duties and these were instructed to take seats in the North

Stand and await further instructions.    Officers with keys to vehicles

wera identified and were seated separate for deployment if necessary.

The officers were retained in this area until I received instructions,

via Superintendents MQRDEW and BROOKFIELD to obtain debrief sheets

from supervisors in respect of their Serials and stand the officers

down.   I would describe the officers in the North Stand as shocked,

saddened, some were distressed and several openly wept.

On completion of this duty, I attended the gymnasium where I found it

had been divided into three areas.    The first contained I believe over

80 bodies and officers were in the process of recording details of

saroa and taking photographs for identification purposes under the

diraction of Inspector CHARLES.   I deputed other Inspectors to assist

him in this task.

The middle section of the gymnasium contained CID officers whose duty

it was to see relatives, accompany them during identification and then

taka statements regarding the same.

The third section had been kept separate for relatives, members of the

Social Services and clergy.

I assisted in the arrangements regarding the identification process

and also counselled/comforted a number of officers.

At 11.00pm (2300) I attended Niagara Social Club and again counselled

sevaral officers before returning to Hammerton Road Police Station to

ensure that Sub Divisional policing requirements were being catered

for.

At 2.30am (0230) on Sunday 16 April 1989 (160489), I went off

           The Operational Order for the 1989 (000089) Semi Final like all Orders

           for league games compromises general instructions to all Police

           personnel and specific instructions to individual officers. Dependant

           upon the duty which is required to be performed, Officers are grouped

           into Serials of 1 Sergeant and either 5, 8 or 10 Constables. Each

           Serial is allocated a number and, in the case of the 1989 (000089)

           Semi-Final, these were numbered 1-64 inclusive. Details of

           individual Officers making up a Serial are typed alongside

           instructions regarding the duties to be performed by than during the

           three phases of the operation and this is termed a' Serial Order'.

           Again, dependant on the nature of the duties to be performed by a

           particular Serial, the Serials are grouped together and an Inspector

           put in overall command of that group of Serials. Once the Operational

           Order has been approved, the information contained therein is

         (a) Chief Inspector and above receive a copy of the entire order.

         (b) Inspectors in charge of Serials receive a copy of the Serial

         precis of the important points contained in the general instructions.

        A copy of such a document is attached hereto.

         (c) Sergeants receive a copy of their respective Serial Order with an

         instruction to contact each Officer individually, meet them

        collectively prior to briefing and take up seats in the North Stand as

        a Sarial ready for pre-match briefing.

           Since October 1987, (001087) I have been the fifth Inspector at 'FI'

           Sub-Division and from that time I have had responsibility for the

           preparation of the 'FI' Football orders at 'FI'.    I took over from

           Inspector CALVERT who had been doing the football orders at Hanmerton

           Road for a number of years and the systems of organising the manpower

           etc. are largely based on systems he introduced.

           I was involved with the organisation of the 1988 (000088) Semi-Final

           for Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.   This was done together with

           Chief Inspector BEAL and Inspector CALVERT in consultation with

           Superintendent MURRAY and Chief Superintendent MOLE.

           As the semi-finals for 1989 (000089) were drawing near I was watching

           which teams were likely to be in the semi-finals.   During the week

           carmencing 13 March 1989 (130389), it looked as if a semi-final could

           be staged at Hillsborough and at that stage I started addressing my
                                                                  PAGE    2
                                                                  S1806

mind to a possible semi-final at Hillsborough.

On Saturday, 18 March 1989 (180389), the F.A. Cup 6th rounds took

place.   On 20 March 1989 (200389), the draws for the semi-final took

place and again, Liverpool and Nottingham Forest were drawn to play.

I believe it was later on that day that Chief Superintendent MOLE

informed me that the semi-final between those two teams was due to

be staged at Hillsborough.   Easter Bank Holiday weekend was due on 24,

25, 26 and 27 March 1989 (270389) and together with Chief

Superintendent MOLE, a meeting was arranged for Wednesday, 22 March

1989 (220389), of all persons involved with the semi-final.     Chief

Superintendent MOLE, Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD, who was to be

the Divisional Commander from 27 March 1989 (270389), Superintendent

made with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Nottingham Forest Club,

Liverpool Football Club, Merseyside Police and Nottinghamshire

Constabulary.   Through Operations Room, liaison was kept with South

Yorkshire Ambulance Service and South Yorkshire Fire Service.     After

the formal meeting on 22 March 1989, (220389) close liaison was kept

with all parties until the semi-final on 15 April 1989 (150489).
                                                                  PAGE    3

Close co-operation was maintained throughout.

Togather with Chief Inspector BEAL, the previous natch order for the

1988 (000088) semi-final was studied and as this was a successful

operation, it formed the basis of the 1989 (000089) semi-final.

Briefs were prepared with Chief Inspector BEAL, these were all

discussed in detail with Superintendent MURRAY and approved by

Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD.

Basically, the serials were the same as for the 1988 (000088) semi­

final with the following main changes.   I will deal with these

briefly as I am aware that Chief Inspector BEAL will be dealing with

the changes in minute detail in his report.

Three Inspectors who acted as liaison officers to sector commanders

were dispensed with as they were under employed.   One reserve serial

stationed at South Stand/Spion Kop was dispensed with as it was

superfluous to requirements.   Supervision of mobile units was reduced

by two Inspectors as in practice they could only be with one unit at

a time.   Serials 1 and 2 were increased by two Police Constables and

one Police Sergeant respectively.

Serials 11 and 12 (North Stand) were decreased as their main tasks for

ensuring that supporters did not use the Penistone Road North egress

did not require the manning afforded in 1988 (000088).   Serial 15 was

decreased by one Sergeant, leaving one Sergeant supervising one serial.

Further serials on the outskirts of the ground patrols were reduced

from one Sergeant and 10 Police Constables to one Sergeant and eight

Constables.   None of these serials were directly involved with access

or egress from the football stadium and it was considered by all that

these extra two Police Constables per serial were additional to

requirements.

Better use was made of resources and at Phase III, four serials from

within the ground, that was serials 2, 8, 20 and 21 were to assist the
                                                                  PAGE    4
                                                                  S1806

track serial to prevent any pitch invasion at the end of the match.

Also, during the 1988 (000088), semi-final, all serials deployed

outside the ground were on standby for refreshments at Claywheels Lane

through the duration of the match.   They were some quarter of a mile

away from the ground and were too far away to deploy in the ground at

short notice.   This year, following an idea put forward by

Superintendent Murray, from 2.45 p.m. (1445) on the day of the semi­

final, a Police coach was stationed in Leppings Lane, near to the

ground and a further Police coach was stationed in Penistone Road near

to Gate 'O'. Of the men who were due to meal at Claywheels Lane

Police Station throughout the match, five serials, i.e. five

Sergeants and forty Police Constables, were detailed to get on EACH

coach at the two locations at 3.00 p.m. (1500).   They would remain on

standby until 3.30 pn (1530) when the coach would drop them off at

Claywheels Lane Police Station for a meal and then pick up five

further serials on EACH coach to return to the ground for deployment.

This would make better use of 20 serials throughout Phase II of the

game.   In actual fact, the five serials which were making their way to

EACH of the two coaches for 3.00 p.m. (1500) brought them to the

ground for that time instead of the men being a quarter of a mile away

at Claywheels Lane Police Station.   These 10 Serials being in the

vicinity of the two coaches at 3.00 p.m. (1500) were all in addition

to nianpower resources to the 1988 (000088) semi-final, as all these

men would have been at Claywheels Lane Police Station.   The serials

around the turnstiles at Leppings Lane and Penistone Road and in the

enclosure to the same were the same as for 1988 (000088) which had

proved adequate.   The intelligence supplied by Footbal Liaison and

Detective Sergeant Charlesworth local intelligence, did not throw up

any different problems from the 1988 (000088) semi-final which proved

to be a success. However, even though the 1988 (000088) semi-final had
                                                                  PAGE    5
                                                                  S1806

been a success earnest considerations was made when preparing the

1989 (000089) semi-final and every effort was made to improve on an

already successful operation from the previous year.

The Operational Order was approved and circulated on 6 April 1989

(060489), to all Senior Officers of Chief Inspector and above involved

in the operation.   A pre-briefing was arranged for sub-sector

Inspectors and above on Friday, 14 April 1989 (140489) in the North

Stand of the Wednesday Ground.   All Inspectors involved in the

operation attended or a Sergeant deputing for the few Inspectors who

wera unable to attend.   This Sergeant then liaised with the respective

Inspectors prior to the match.

On that pre-brief, Inspectors were handed an Operational Order and

details of serials under their command and their duties.   They were

also given serial orders for their respective Sergeants under

their command.

At the pre-brief, these officers were briefed by Chief Superintendent

DUCKENFIELD on policy, by Superintendent MURRAY on what was required

at the match and by myself on admin procedures which included

reporting on and off duty, overtime claims, the issue of radios

including all ground serials to have an earpiece, the issue of meals

and the issue of vehicle keys for those on transits.   The individual

sector commanders then briefed their men taking them to all relevant

parts of the grounds to examine locations pertinent to their duties.

A personnel carrier was made available for Inspectors on out-lying

parts of the order to view their duties.   Whilst placing the

individual manpower on the Operational Order, every consideration was

mad a to using the best resources available and in particular

supervisory officers with extensive experience of the ground used in

locations familiar to them.   With this in mind, key Inspectors were

placed in the following locations:-
                                                                  PAGE

                                   (relief at FI).

The serials picked to work in the ground were mainly 'F' Division

Officers, all have good knowledge of the ground assisted by Spion Kop,

'E' Division Officers, regularly work that area.     West Stand 'E'

Division Officers under Sergeant BURMAN, worked that duty before.

Leppings Lane, terraces 'B' Division Officers worked at Sheffield

Wednesday Football Club before on several occasions.     Leppings Lane

turnstiles three serials, 'F2' Officers and one 'E' Division Officer

all worked these duties before.   The Sergeants in particular have

extensive knowledge of this particular day.

Other duties were considered when the manpower was placed on the

serials and great thought was used when identifying officers to

particular duties so as to make the best use of resources.      Also, I

personally made arrangements for the stewards to be briefed in their

respective stands at 11.15 a.m. (1115) on 15 April 1989 (150489).
                                                                PAGE     7

Kop                   Inspector CALVERT

North Stand           Inspector WOODWARD

West Stand            Inspector WHITE

In addition I have close liaison with the senior stewards on all match

days and with Mr MACRELL, Secretary SWFC and Mr LOCK, Security Officer.

During August 1988 (000888), I had attended a steward's meeting at

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and briefed all the stewards re

emergency evacuation and other problems and the gate men had been

briefed by my deputy, Police Sergeant GODDARD, during August 1988

(000888), whilst I was on leave. Liaison had been made with senior

officers frcm the Fire Service and the Ambulance Service and

Superintendent MURRAY and myself during this present season re any

major disaster.

On 15 April 1989, (150489) I comnenced duty at 'FI' at 7.00 a.m.

(0700). At 7.30 a.m. (0730) I patrolled the ground area and

surrounding roads with Police Sergeant HODKINSQN who was detailed as a

driver for the day.   At 7.50 a.m. (0750) that morning, I located seme

rubble near to Parkside Section Station and a message was raised on

the computer to have this removed, it was from a gas Board excavation

the previous day.

At 8.00 am (0800) that morning, at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground,

I liaised with Inspector BENNETT, Admin and Police Sergeant FIDLER,

I then liaised with civilian staff regarding hot drinks to be served

to approximately 700 officers attending briefing. Checked with

Inspector BENNETT, all in hand assisting officers into North Stand

At approximately 10.30 a.m. (1030) the briefing finished and

everything was going to plan.

At 10.45 a.m. (1045) that day, with Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD

and Police Sergeant HODKINSON, we patrolled around area of ground and

coach routes in 'F' Division.

At 11.15 a.m. (1115) that day, officers out on ground, general patrol

of area with Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD on foot walked down

Leppings Lane, barriers in position.      Near to leppings Lane traffic

island, a minor road traffic accident had taken place.      Officers under

ccnrcnand of Inspector MILLETT dealing.

At 12.30 a.m. (1230) approximately, liaising with Mr. lock, Security

Officer in club video room and general patrol of ground with Chief

Superintendent DUCKENFIELD - no problems, there were not a lot of fans

about.   Fans spoken to in vicinity of the ground all in good spirits,

no problems, no evidence of alcohol at that stage.

At 1.30 p.m. (1330) with Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD we went to
                                                                    PAGE

the gymnasium for a hot meal, outside CID officers and track serials

also mealing.

At 1.45 pm (1345) approximately to Control Room, left Chief

Superintendent DUCKENFIELD, Superintendent MURRAY, Police Sergeant

GODDARD, Police Constable RYAN, Police Constable BICHARD in Control

Box.   I believe Assistant Chief Constable, Mr. JACKSON, in civilian

clothing also present.

Between 1.50 p.m. (1350) and 2.30 p.m. (1430) general patrol of North

Stand and South Stand area upper concourses checking on betting booths

no problems noticed and that South Stand concourse were busy, quite a

lot of Nottingham Forest fans arriving early.   No evidence of alcohol

in South Stand.   Checking North Stand betting booths - not so busy in

Livarpool side, still no visible evidence of alcohol.

At 2.45 p.m. (1445) in the vicinity of the gymnasium and Police Rocm

area I was aware that there were a number of prisoners on the cell

bus as and that the Police Reran were busy but I spoke with Inspector

Barker, who, did not report any problems other than busy, but this

was to be expected.   Everything was still going to plan.   About this

time I was aware of a message from Control that there were problems

at Leppings La end that further manpower was required.   About this

time problems with radio reception.   I recall Police Sergeant

Goddard's (Control) voice was having a 'warbling' effect.     I

thought my radio battery was faulty, other officers were experiencing

difficulty, obvious a radio fault, not my particular radio.       I got the

impression that Control were receiving calls, but officers outside

wera having difficulty in receiving Control.

It was apparent by the tone of Police Sergeant GODDARD'S voice that

urgent assistance was required at Leppings Lane.   I returned to the

gymnasium and informed Control that there were a large number of 'D'

Division officers on standby who were available for deployment.      I got
                                                                      PAGE 10
                                                                      S1806

from Control that officers were required at the track, Leppings Lane

end, west Stand and 'A' gate.

I grouped the serials together and as the Sergeant in charge left the

gymnasium, I got Police Sergeant 467 Sewell on logistics in the

gymnasium to record who was being deployed and where to.        The

following Sergeants and serials of approximately eight men in each

wera deployed as follows:-

(All 'D' Division)

Police Sergeant 2916            Track

Police Sergeant 1055            West Stand

Police Sergeant      915        Track

Police Sergeant     2379        West Stand

Police Sergeant      916        'A' Gate

Police Sergeant      993        'A' Gate

I radioed to Control where these officers were being deployed, but I

am unable to say if Control received my messages.        All the above

officers were deployed at 2.50 pin (1450).    It was obvious from

Control that they required further manpower to the LeppingsLane end.

I do recall seme radio message about the gates being opened andthat

people were on the track.      I then regrouped 'E' Division Crime and

Vandal from Penistone Road turnstiles, who were a reserve serial and

deployed them through Control to Leppings Lane track at 3.00 pn

(1500). Further serials frcm 'D' Division arrived in the region of 3.

00 pm (1500), these were deployed as follows

Police Sergeant 690        )      and serial to

Police Sergeant 628        )      Leppings Lane track.

Followed by Police Sergeant 1379, PoliceSergeant 593,        Police Sergeant

7, Police Sergeant 1415 and a number of'D' DivisionPolice Constables

to the track.     Some few minutes later, I saw Chief Superintendent

NESBIT who I think came into the ground frcm Penistone Road end.         I
                                                                  PAGE 11
                                                                  S1806

spoke to him and he went onto the track.    At this stage which was now

approximately 3.10 pm (1510) as I recall, it just still seemed as

though there had been trouble at the Leppings Lane end and that there

had been a pitch invasion.

I then went down onto the track between the North Stand and the Kop.

There were a lot of officers in front of the Leppings Lane terraces

and obviously a number of fans in front of them.    The Nottingham

Forest fans on the Kop were chanting and I got the impression at that

stage that a large number of fans were going onto the pitch at

Leppings Lane end and that there was going to be severe public

disorder.    At that stage I feared that fans may get to the Police Room

and attempt to release the prisoners.    At this stage also I could

hear over the radio that fans were trapped at the Leppings Lane end

and that medical care was required.     Ambulancemen were arriving and I

assisted with getting medical care and ambulances down onto the track.

The crowd was continually hostile and I was aware of about ten to

twelve Police dogs and handlers being on standby near to the rear of

the Kop/North Stand entrance.     Then a number of injured and dead were

brought from the track up to the Kop/North Stand exit on the

stretchers and hoarding boards.

At first it seemed as if there were just a few, six or so, dead or

injured and then people came running off the track with dozens.      At

this stage which was probably about 3.20 p.m. (1520) Superintendent

BATES arrived, he came into the gymnasium with me, the tables and

chairs for the meals were cleared and bodies were placed on the floor

in the gymnasium.    Injured people were taken to the far end of the

gymnasium.    Many Police Officers were bewildered and seme were crying.

As bodies were being placed on the floor, friends were with seme and

they were hysterical.    Two Liverpool males, one with a dark moustache

was drunk and shouting at the Police, he was restrained by Detective
                                                                 PAGE 12
                                                                 S1806

Sergeant SMITH and another CID Officer.     He was wanting to fight and

was obviously in drink and shock.     The bodies kept being brought in

fast and I was asking Control for a doctor to ensure that they were

dead.   There was nothing to suggest that any of the bodies were alive,

but I was conscious they had not been certified as dead.    The bodies

wera covered with the table cloths previously laid out for the meals.

A doctor with a beard attended after about 30 minutes and certified

the dead.   I recall Detective Superintendent MCKAY in the gymnasium

and arrangements were getting in hand for the bodies to be numbered

and an officer allocated to each of them.    Outside the gymnasium there

wera numerous bodies and injured people lying on the ground near to

the cell buses.   St. John's Ambulance personnel, Police Officers and

civilians were in attendance.   There were about six young St. John's

personnel who were all under 14 or 15 years of age, who were very

distressed near to the Police rocm.     I got these sat in the cab part

of a cell bus and a Policeman frcm 'B2' was detailed to look after

them.

I remained in the vicinity of the gymnasium for the next hour or so.

Inspector Charles was detailed to start making records of the bodies

and several CID Officers came to assist.

About 4.30 p.m. (1630) I saw Chief Inspector BEAL and together we

grouped all the remaining officers who were not involved with bodies

or other duties together in the North Stand.     A short de-brief took

place telling Sergeants to hand their de-brief sheets in at that

location before being stood down by Control frcm the ground.

Arrangements were made via message switch for a message to be relayed

to all Police Station and over local radio that no Police Officers had

been injured in the incident.

About 4.30 p.m. (1630) I saw Chief Superintendent MOLE in uniform

at the ground.    At 6.00 p.m. (1800) I returned to the gymnasium and
                                                                         PAGE 13
                                                                         S1806

         assisted with supervision of the Casualty Bureau fonts.

         Throughout the evening I was involved with liaising with the relatives

         and social workers and arrangements for extra telephones to be placed

         in the gymnasium for the use of relatives.

        General liaison of events re-busing of relatives from Forbes Road.

        Casualty Bureau duties were completed and seeing that the ancillary

        admin staff and civilian staff were supervised and accounted for.

        At 5.30 a.m. (0530) on Sunday, 16 April 1989, (160489) I left the

        gymnasium after the last body had been removed and returned to duty at

         11.00 a.m. (1100) the same day.

        The Chief Constable, Colin MDYNAHAN the Minister for Sport, Councillor

        Irvine PATNICK, Detective Chief Superintendent ADDIS, Chief

        Superintendent NESBIT, Chief Superintendent MDLE, Professor USHER,

        Doctor POPPER and numerous social workers and clergy attended the

        gymnasium, this boosted the morale and efforts of the 150 plus

        Police Officers involved in the gymnasium.    Many Police Officers have

        been in deep shock since the event and in particular, six of my Area

        Officers who were in the front line on the track in front of Leppings

        Lana terraces, went off sick due to shock and stress related

        illnesses.    All the Police Officers I saw involved in the event, acted

        in a professional manner and are a total credit to the South Yorkshire

        Police.

           I am a Superintendent in the South Yorkshire Police presently the Sub-

           divisional commander for Woodseats Sub Division (E2).

           I presently have twenty five years service having joined the then

           West Riding Constabulary in 1963 (000063).

           My experience of policing football crowds dates back to 1975 (000075)

           when I was an Inspector stationed at Rotherham.      My experience of

           policing Hillsborough ranges from 1980/81 (000080/000081) and 1983/86

           (000083/000086) in the rank of Inspector and Chief Inspector

           respectively.     I have also policed the previous semi finals in the

           rank of Superintendent. In connection with the FA Cup Semi Final to be

           held at Hillsborough on the 15th April,(150489) I was allocated

           responsibility for the Football Stadium.

           Prior to the event I attended two planning meetings and a briefing

           for Inspectors and above which was held at Hillsborough on Friday
                                                                 PAGE
                                                                 S421

14th April 1989 (140489).   After this briefing I briefed Inspectors

under my ccnmand, details of which are contained in the briefing

rotas which are attached.

On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489) I arrived at the ground at about

9.45 am (0945) and was present at the main briefing which was held at

approximately 10.00 am (1000). After this I went with Chief Inspector

BEAL, Inspectors BOOTH and CALVERT and the Serials concerned with

policing the Spion Kop to the Spion Kop, where with the Inspectors

concerned I examined the area which had been taped off and set aside

for Liverpool supporters.   At last year's Semi Final a few hundred

Liverpool supporters had obtained tickets for the Spion Kop, which

was allocated to Notts Forest supporters, by whatsoever means and had

had to be segregated from the Nottingham supporters by a cordon of

Police Officers.   There was friction between both sets of supporters

particularly when Liverpool scored and Police Officers had come under

threat to their personal safety.   Officers had had to draw their

truncheons to control the situation.   I anticipated that such a

situation was likely to occur at the 1989 (000089) Semi Final.     After

discussion I then briefed the Serials as is reflected in my briefing

notas.   I then went with Chief Inspector BEAL, whilst the Serials

were being further briefed by their Inspectors, to the rear of the

Spion Kop as there was a concern about loose stones being present.

There was evidence of some stones on an undeveloped area but this

gave no major cause for concern.

I then made a tour of the ground particularly looking at the upper

level of the North Stand as I was apprehensive about the location of

a betting booth.   I spoke with some officers from my own Sub Division

who pointed the betting booth out and arrangements were agreed for

its supervision.   I then went from the North Stand via Leppings Lane

past the Director's entrance and into the Sheffield Wednesday Control



                                                                           2516

                                                                   S421

Room, where I liaised with staff.    Present at that time was

Superintendent MARSH who I took around the ground.     I also liaised

with Inspector DARLING and Sergeant CHAPMAN    who were the

Supervisory Officers responsible for the Constables who sit on the

perimeter track.

I was present outside the players entrance to supervise and monitor

the arrival of the Liverpool and Notts Forest team coaches, after

that I again liaised with the staff in the Sheffield Wednesday

Control Room.    I learned from the Sheffield Wednesday staff that

Brian CLOUGH, the Notts Forest manager would be sitting immediately

behind the Notts Forest team bench as he was banned from the touch

line.   The seat was pointed out to me and I was told that so as to

evade the press he would come out, not with the teams as is normal

practice, but after the teams, the officials and coaching staff.

I estimate that it would be about 2.35 pn (1435) when I went on a

tour of the perimeter track.    I walked from the central tunnel area

passing the South stand to the West end of the ground.    The perimeter

track Constables were in position and I spoke to most of them on

passing.   When I reached the area behind the goal of the Leppings

Lane terraces I remember talking to PC HELLIWELL and together we stood

and faced the terracing and the West stand.    There was a carnival

atmosphere in the central pens, a light weight beachball was being

flipped about in the crowd.    I saw a young supporter in a green and

beige striped rugby shirt being hoisted from the central pens by

supporters in the West stand up into the West stand.     Once in the

West stand I saw him move first to the left and then to the right and

I thought to myself, because I'd seen this happen many times before

at half-time, when was he going to go to the back and disappear into

the crowd but he didn't and I believe that he realised he had been

seen by us.     I had attempted to attract the attention of seme


                                                                              2517
                                                                   PAGE       4
                                                                   S421

Officers in the stand to what was going on but suddenly the supporter

cams back to the front of the West stand and without no more ado

dropped back into the terracing.    After a few moments I then walked

along the perimeter track in front of the North stand to the front of

the Spion Kop.   I recall looking up to the area at the back which

contained Liverpool supporters.     I contemplated going into the Spion

Kop to talk to the Officers that were segregating approximately 800/

1000 Liverpool supporters but I looked at ray watch and saw that it

was about 2.50 pm (1450) and that as the teams would be caning out

onto the pitch before very long, it was time for me to take up a

position in the central tunnel.     I therefore made my way to that

location.

I do recall a youth being arrested/ejected from the Spion Kop

although I think that it was during the earlier tour of the ground.

It was on that occasion that I actually went into the Spion Kop

because I thought that the arresting/ejecting officers had fallen as

a result of the youth struggling.     I remember some minutes after this

I saw what I believe to be the same youth reappear on the Spion

Kop.   I believe he was spotted by Officers and was again removed.        A

Police Officer, at sane stage told me that the youth admitted giving

a turnstile operator   20.00 to get back into the ground.

On returning to the central tunnel I was confronted by a large number

of press photographers awaiting the arrival of the teams.     After a

short time the teams ran onto the pitch followed by the referee and 2

linesmen and trainers/coaches.     Mr CI/DUGH did not appear at this

stage and the press photographers remained.     I recall asking one of

them what they were awaiting for and he said "You know damn well -

CLOUGH."    I heard, with my back to the pitch at this time, the

whistle go for the kick-off.     The press photographers remained and

some of them were on the playing area.     It was necessary they move



                                                                                  2518
                                                                    PAGE   5
                                                                    S421

and they were told to do so by the Police Officers present.       Mr

CLOUGH came out and took up his seat but still some of the press

photographers had remained to photograph him.     In front of the Notts

Forest dug-out was scroe television camera equipment and the Notts

staff complained that it was obstructing their view.     This was moved

by r.V. Personnel.     The match having kicked off and the press

photographers gone from the front of the tunnel I then surveyed the

scene in the ground.     I looked to my left and saw one or two

spectators climbing over the perimeter fence at the Leppings Lane end

behind the goal.     Two or three Police Officers were with them.      I

immediately realised that there must be a crowd problem, not fighting

or a pitch invasion because that would not happen so early in a

match, and so I inmediately went to the Leppings Lane terracing where

I saw two or three Police Officers by the track gate which I believe

was open.   From ground level I looked at the crowd in the pen (Pen 3)

behind the goal and saw quite clearly that supporters were being

squashed against the fencing.     The area behind the gate was heavily

congested preventing persons from exiting.     I should mention that the

perimeter fence gate is not wide enough to allow a mass exit of

persons being in the order of a normal doors width.     The actual

terracing is at a lower level them the perimeter track and one has to

mount one or more steps so as to exit from the terracing through the

gate onto the pitch.     Police Officers were trying to get supporters

out.   I then mounted the advertising hoarding and frcm above fence

level surveyed the whole of the crowd in the pen.     I could see that

there were also people behind the front row who were squeezed and

being pushed towards the fencing.     As one looked further back, the

crowd probably more than two thirds were watching the match quite

unaware of what was happening at the front.     One or two supporters

were clambering along the top of the crowd and were trying to get out



                                                                               2519
                                                                    PAGE        6
                                                                    S421

over the perimeter fencing.   There were a few supporters on the pitch

at that stage.   My immediate assessment was that there was a chance

the problem could be alleviated if the crowd at the middle and back

of the terracing moved back so as to ease the pressure at the front.

There was room to do so and the central tunnel was clear.      I

therefore gestured to the crowd in the middle and towards the back

with both hands in a pushing motion shouting at them to move back and

also with both index fingers pointing down to the front of the crowd

so as to indicate to them there was a problem at the front.        I gained

no reaction to this and more people started to climb towards the

fencing.    It was apparent at that   stage that the match could         not

continue.    I therefore determined   that the match should stop         andafter

broadcasting by personal radio to the effect that there were potential

casualties and that the game be stopped, from the top of the fencing

waved both ray arms towards the Control Box in a signalling motion to

the effect that the game must be stopped.    I then ran onto the pitch

past the Liverpool goalkeeper who I recall was still facing down the

field of play, seemingly unaware of what was going on around him.          It

took me a little while to attract the referee's attention by shouting

but I recall play then cane to a halt as he had awarded a free

kick.   I told him that we had a serious incident     and that he        muststop

the game and take the players off     the pitch.    He agreed to do so

without argument.

I then returned to the fencing and could see no improvement in the

situations more supporters were clambering along the top of the crowd

and attempting to get over the fence where they were being helped over

by Police Officers standing on the hoarding.       The crowd towards the

back was still not responding by moving back.       I moved towards the

South pen nearer the Police Control Box to attract the attention of the

staff so as to appraise them to the extent of the problems. I believe



                                                                                    2520

it was at this stage that I saw Assistant Chief Constable Mr JACKSON

who came to the pitch and told him that we had casualties.

I then immediately returned to the fencing behind the goal.       I

believe it was at this stage that an Officer told me of a fatality.

I recall looking at the people on the front row immediately behind

the fencing and as ray eyes skirted to ray right along the line I saw a

female who in ray view was clearly dead.    The colour had drained from

her face and her pallor was grey.     I then broadcasted that there was

a potential fatality.     By this time more supporters had come over the

fence.     Officers were attempting to get into the crowd down the side

fencing.

I was concerned as to medical support and ambulances and I recall

discussing with seme officers the presence of an ambulance.

Ambulances had been requested and I believe a further broadcast was

mada at that specific time; communications were extremely difficult

because of the noise.     However it was within ray knowledge that there

was an ambulance located at the end of the tunnel in between the

North stand and the Spion Kop.     An Officer was dispatched to get that

ambulance to the scene.     I recall that the presence of press

photographers was many and that they were hindering the operation of

getting people out of the pen.     I had to depute an Officer to keep

then at bay.     I had previously deputed an officer to bring St Johns

Ambulance staff to the fence.

I believe it was at this time that I saw Chief Superintendent NESBIT

arrive.

Because of the crush of people adjacent to the fencing it was

impossible to get people through the gate and I specifically recall a

large well built man who was trapped by other people on the steps

inside the terracing.     Together with other officers I struggled to

pull this man free.     Other persons including a young boy were quickly



                                                                             2521

                                                                    S421

pulled out.   Officers by this time had managed to go down the side

railings into the crowd.     I acquired a loudhailer.    I then

broadcasted to the crowd to ease off at the back to allow the

casualties to be evacuated.     It was at one stage whilst doing this

that the advertising hoarding that I was standing on broke and I fell

to the ground.     By this time officers were in the terracing and were

attempting to take casualties through the gate and there was clearly

insufficient room for two officers with a casualty to get through the

gata.   It was therefore arranged that a channel of Officers

comprising two lines be formed outside the gates and that Officers

would pass casualties through the gates to the Officers on the

outside where they could be further attended to.        I think it was at

this stage that I heard a roar from supporters who were on the pitch

and ray immediate impression was that they were making their way

towards the Notts Forest supporters in the Spion Kop, however, I was

not in a position to do anything about this.     It was sometime prior

to this that I recall an ambulance, I believe St Johns, had arrived

from the Spion Kop and it was necessary to clear seme of the

advertising hoardings in order it could gain access.        In order that

casualties be removed as soon as possible from the terracing I

instructed the Officers by loudhailer to bring the casualties to the

gata not to go through it but to pass the casualty through the gate

releasing it to Officers on the outside; then instructing those

Officers to go and get another casualty and then instructed other

Officers to come forward with a casualty and pass it through the

gates and so on.     I had also directed other Officers who had entered

from the rear of the terracing to evacuate casualties through the

central tunnel at the rear.     By this means the casualties were very

quickly cleared from the area.     Once this was achieved and the area

cleared I saw a crowd barrier that was crumpled and twisted.        (I re­

visited the Stadium on Sunday 16th April (160489) and surveyed the

terraced area on Pen 3.    I again saw the crumpled and twisted crowd

barrier and noted rust on a stanchion which was still fixed in the

ground and as I recall on one of the poles.     I don't know whether this

was surface rust or otherwise. I also saw a deflated beachball in

the well of the terracing). I arranged that officers remain to

protect the scene.    I then reflected as to the question of crowd

safety of all those supporters in the ground.     I had been conscious at

one stage during the rescue operation of a broadcast from the public

tannoy system I believe requesting supporters not to push in the

central pen but it then struck me that panic or supporters leaving

the ground may result in further problems.    I think it was at this

stage and round about 3.30 pm (1530) that I instructed PC GOODWILL of

'FI' who was present in the area of the goal to accompany me so as to

ensure better communication with other Senior Officers and Police

Ground Control and that he must never leave me unless it was on my

direct instruction.   Firstly I requested that he try and get those

officers back into Serials that were not engaged because throughout

the rescue operation and particularly at this stage I and other

Police Officers were subjected to vehement abuse in the strongest

terms from the Liverpool supporters on the pitch who accused the

Police as murderers who had killed Liverpool supporters.     I recall

one supporter with a Merseyside accent saying to me "You've fucking

killed them" and another saying "The fucking police have murdered

them." Others were saying, 'The fucking Police and Kelly have

done this'.   Having made their points they would not go away and were

obstructing me from continuing with my duties.     Many smelled of drink.

I recall at one stage having to push two or three supporters aside so I

could continue supervising the rescue op)eration.    Similarly, I had to

push press photographers away who were taking photographs of people



                                                                                2523

trapped against the fencing.   They were obstructing the rescue

operation.   The loudhailer at this point became faulty and PC GOODWILL

obtained a replacement.I had been requesting by personal radio that I

meet with Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD as I wanted to discuss the

situation as far as the rest of the crowd was concerned.   I was told he

was in the club's boardroom and so I set off to meet him there.      I

turned towards the central tunnel and saw that both managers, DALGLESH

and CLOUGH had walked onto the pitch and were making their way

towards the goal.   I immediately feared as to what would be the

reaction of supporters towards Mr CLOUGH and that it to be likely that

Mr DALGLESH be totally surrounded by Liverpool supporters. Therefore

I spoke to Messrs DALGLESH and CLOUGH and told than that it would be

more appropriate if they left the pitch and could assist by

broadcasting over the tannoy systan and asking for calm.   The two

managers agreed and I escorted them down the central tunnel on my way

to the boardrocm.   Messrs CLOUGH and DALGLESH were then escorted to

Police Control by other officers and I went into the boardrocm where

I was met by several directors of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

They asked me if there were fatalities and I said potentially that

may be so, and they said that if there were fatalities the match

should be abandoned with their full support but recognising that it

would be a Police decision.    I then went to the Police Control Box

and gave an update of the situation.   After a short time I returned

to the pitch at the West end where I saw a Police Scenes of Crime

photographer in civilian clothes being attacked by supporters.     I

instructed that he be told to put his camera away.

On looking down the pitch I saw that there was seme disruption in the

crowd in the uncovered South stand seats at the Spion Kop end, either

people were arguing or fighting.    I was on my way there when as I

passed the central tunnel I heard abuse being directed into the



                                                                              2524

                                                                    S421

tunnel by supporters.   I saw Mr Kelly (FA Secretary) was in the

course of doing a television interview with Desmond LYNAM.     It seemed

likely that   he may come under physical attack from the supporters who

were blaming him for what had transpired.    I immediately shouted from

the entrance to the tunnel that they must stop the interview and get

out of the way around the back.    I then went to the uncovered seats

where I directed that two or three Officers should go into the crowd

and sort the problan out; it was evident that there were sane

Liverpool supporters in there amongst Notts Forest supporters.      To

supplement this I broadcasted by loudhailer to the crowd and asked for

calm and their co-operation so that matters be resolved.     The

broadcast had the immediate effect of quietening things down and so I

determined that I would broadcast to the Spion Kop and spectators in

the rest of the ground because I believe at this stage nothing had

been said about the match being abandoned and I had a fear of panic

and potential problems resulting from people leaving the ground.         I

therefore broadcasted to spectators along the Spion Kop and North

stand at roughly 15 yard intervals to the effect that there had

clearly been casualties and that we were working under extremely

difficult circumstances and requesting the co-operation of spectators

to remain where they were.     I also advised that there would be

spectators who would not be able to hear this message clearly

because of the limitations of the loudhailer and requested that

supporters who had heard it relay the message to those behind who

would not have heard it.     Every broadcast was followed by applause

both from Notts Forest supporters in the Spion Kop and Liverpool

supporters in the North stand.     I recall that in the course of

passing this message a group of supporters on the Spion Kop were

chanting and singing and the rest of the crowd turned on them and

silenced them.   I believe that when I reached the West end of the



                                                                                  2525

        North stand the formal announcement was made that the game had been

        abandoned.    I believe that persons at that stage were advised to

        leave the ground slowly and not hurry.

        I then started to receive enquiries about the casualties from

       Liverpool supporters on the pitch and they were directed to an area

       by the central tunnel where I arranged that Officers could attend to

       their needs.    It was at this stage that I obtained the telephone

       number for the Casualty Enquiry Bureau and informed the Police Ground

       Control.    After that I went to the Leppings Lane end of the ground

       where I saw outside the River Gate (Gate C) a number of bodies

       covered in green sheets and liaised with Inspector SYKES.     I

       ascertained these bodies had been removed from the terracing and

       taken by officers to the rear of the West stand.

        I then went to Police Ground Control where I liaised with officers as

       to the updated position.      Following this I went to the North stand

       where Officers had been gathered for de-briefing instructions.

        I then went to the gymnasium which was being used as a temporary

       mortuary and after surveying the scene checked as to the condition of

       the Officers who were with bodies.     Some were particularly distraught

       and I attempted to reassure them.      I then returned to the North stand

       where further liaison took place about de-briefing and then to

       Claywheels Lane to check on the welfare of Officers and to the Sports

       and Social Club at Niagara for the same purpose, where I remained in

       anticipation of de-briefing.      Prior to visiting the gymnasium I had

       been informed that there was a Police Officer who had been working in

       the terracing area who could not be accounted for and I was told at

        the gymnasium that a Police Officer had been taken to hospital.

           I have 27 years experience as a police officer.          I have held a

           supervisory position for 21 years.          I have policed football matches

           at Sheffield Wednesday F.C., Sheffield United F.C. and Barnsley F.C.

           for a total of 9 or 10 years on and off.          I policed most major

           marches and demonstrations in the City Centre of Sheffield between

           1983 and 1987 (000083 and 000087).          I have policed 4 semi-finals -

           all at Hillsborough.       I have policed all disputes involving the

           National Union of Mineworkers, and sundry other disputes.            I enjoy

           big occasions and believe that firm but fair policing is the key to

           successfully managing big crowds.

           In April 1988 (000488) I was a Ground Commander at Hillsborough

           Football Ground, Sheffield, when Nottingham Forest F.C. played

           Liverpool F.C.

           I worked inside the ground and apart from minor problems of
drunkenness, theft, and the discharge of a pyrotechnic during the

match, the game passed off without serious incident.

The earlier rounds of the 1988-89 (000088-000089) F.A. Cup competition

produced the identical fixture and it was learned in March 1989

(000389) that this would, once again, be played at Sheffield

Wednesday's football ground at Hillsborough:   the match to take place

on Saturday, 15 April 1989 (150489) KO 3.00pm (ISOOhrs).

As a Deputy Divisional Commander I expected to play a key supervisory

role on the day, and my then Divisional Ccurmander, Chief

Superintendent B L Mole, discussed with me at a fairly early stage

the question of my duties.    I had worked mostly inside the ground in

1988 (000088) and therefore I agreed this year to perform an outside

duty, taking charge of the policing of the Liverpool fans.

In due course meetings were set up which were attended by police

officers from 'F' Division and elsewhere, along with representatives

of the Local Authority, Public Transport, Ambulance, and the like.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, who was to take over the Division

on Chief Superintendent Male's transfer, was also present.

A planning/logistic's team was set up, headed by Chief Inspector Beal

and Inspector Sewell:   they ccjtmenced to prepare a detailed

Operational Order to cater for the match.

Shortly after 6 April 1989 (060489) I received from Inspector Sewell

a detailed Operational Order, setting out the minutiae of detail

associated with the game.

During the ensuing week I read the order through and noted my own

role and responsibilities.

I noted that I was to be in charge of Sector 2 (Liverpool) and that I

would be assisted by Chief Inspector Roy Waring, Sector 2A;     and

Chief Inspector Roger Purdy, Sector 2B.

I have known both officers many years and worked closely during the
                                                                   PAGE   3
                                                                   S219

lata 1970s with Chief Inspector Purdy.     Both officers have police

experience of working in the Hillsborough area and had performed duty

at the ground before.      Both officers had, to my knowledge, good and

valid experience at major public order events.

Both officers had my full confidence.

Sector 2 was split into two other Sectors, 2A and 2B.     Sector 2A was

the area to the South of the Leppings Lane area (for which Chief

Inspector Waring was responsible); Sector 2B for the North West

area (for which Chief Inspector Purdy was responsible).

The chain of ccurmand devolved to Inspectors, of which there were 3 in

Sector 2A and 4 in Sector 2B.

Additionally, I was responsible for coach searching in two locations,

i.e. in Oughtibridge Village, about two miles from the ground

(Inspector Wardle);     and Tankersley, about six miles from the ground

(Inspector Morton).     Also, 6 mobile "Tango" units under the direct

control of Inspector Walker and Inspector Robinson.

I was not actually in charge of the serials of police officers

employed on turnstile duties at Leppings Lane.     These were part of

the Ground Conmander's - Superintendent Greenwood - responsibilities,

but it was always my intention to be in the area of the Leppings Lane

turnstiles as the crowds built up.      I noted that Chief Inspector

Creaser was in charge of this particular area, aided mostly by 'F'

Division Inspectors, Sergeants and Constables.      The officers

involved have a wealth of experience in handling football crowds and

most officers were known to me personally.

I had thus no qualms that given a normal situation the number of

officers involved was right and struck the correct balance between the

maintenance of law and order - the necessity to search fans for

offensive weapons and detect crime without an oppressive police

presence - at what should have been a pleasant afternoon of sport.

At 10am (1000) Friday 14 April 1989,(140489) I attended a Senior

Officers' briefing at the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.     All

Inspectors and the two Chief Inspectors working with roe in Sector 2

wera present.   Chief Superintendent Duckenfield gave a detailed

briafing from a prepared brief, and this was complemented by a briefing

by Superintendent Murray, who was to be in charge of the police

control post.    Inspector Sewell then gave details of administration,

roeals, etc.

When these officers had concluded their address I took ray Chief

Inspectors and Inspectors to an area off the North Stand where I

personally briefed them in detail as to what I required from them.

I had earlier prepared notes of what was required of us collectively

and what I required from them personally, and I spoke to these

notas.    I have kept these notes and they are available for inspection.

I provided an opportunity for questions and asked Chief Inspectors

Waring and Purdy if they had anything to add.    Some questions were

askad.

Soma of ray Inspectors were from 'A' Division and 'C' Division and

wera not totally familiar with the area.    I therefore took them to a

transit van and with PS Fidler took these officers on a guided tour

of the locality and pointed out certain areas of concern, such as

Leppings Lane roundabout, coach and minibus parking, pubs and off

licances.

I asked all the officers to ensure that they read the Operational

Ordar and were familiar with its contents prior to attending at

Hillsborough the next day.

Latar that day I received from Inspector Sewell a miniaturised Order,

which I condensed so that I had a pocket sized overview of the duties

involved in ray sector of the operation.

I added to this the colour coding of the tickets for the various


                                                                             2530

sections of the ground.      I have retained this document.

At 8.10am (0810) Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489), I cane on duty

at Hammerton Road Police Station.     The day was fine and sunny.      Hie

weather was warm and ideal for a major sporting event.

At 9.20am (0920) I left Hammerton Road Police Station with Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield and Mr             a Force Press Officer.

We went to the entrance to the police area at the rear of the North

Stand.   Other officers were congregating there and were, in due

course, moved into pre-arranged seating in the North Stand.

At 10am (1000) Chief Superintendent Duckenfield gave a briefing.

He was followed by Superintendent Murray, DS Charlesworth and

Inspector Sewell.   Each officer spoke about particular aspects of

the policing of the event.

At the conclusion of the general briefing Serial Inspectors were

invited to brief their Serials in accordance with their general and

specific instructions contained in their orders.

I spoke to Chief Inspectors Waring and Purdy and re-affirmed what I

considered to be the salient points of our duty i.e. searching, coach

recaption and general standards of behaviour.      I told the officers

that I would patrol on foot throughout the Sector and they could

expact to see me out and about right up to kick-off.      I distributed a

one-sheet overview of Serial deployment, along with a list of pubs in

the locality where the landlord had been seen and asked his

intentions, i.e. either to close or operate a selective door.

About 10.15am (1015) I went into the gym where I consumed a snack

meal and took the opportunity of speaking to most of ray Sector

Inspectors individually.      I distributed copies of the document

mentioned above.    Manpower at ray command was 2 Chief Inspectors, 11

Inspectors, 30 Sergeants and 227 Constables.      This did not include

the Ifounted Officers, Dog Handlers; or the Chief Inspector, 2



                                                                             2531
Inspectors, 4 Sergeants and 40 Constables who would be working

outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles prior to kick-off.

About 10.45am (1045) I commenced foot patrol in the Leppings Lane

area, checking that barriers had been placed at the ends of streets

opening on to Leppings Lane.      Hie purpose of the barriers is to

prevent access by fans and minimise the nuisance to local residents

caused by fans (a) using the back gardens and gennels as toilets;       and

(b) trying to climb over walls and fences to gain free access into the

ground.   Mast of the barriers were in place and each set was manned
                                                   r

by 2 Constables.     I met and spoke to all these officers and asked

then if they knew what their duties were.     All appeared to know what

was expected of them.

Inspector Selwood was in charge of this area and we met briefly and

discussed what to do about an Audi car which was causing an

obstruction in the mouth of Vere Road.

I then continued to Leppings Lane roundabout and on into Penistone

Road North and Claywheels Lanes     all the time meeting and speaking to

policemen and women but checking that they had been briefed as to

their duties.      I paid particular attention to the Claywheels Lane

coach reception Serials (Serials 34 and 35 - PS Sherratt and PS

Lindop respectively) as a key role was required in respect of them so

far as ticket checking and standards of behaviour were concerned.

Soma fans were already moving about at this time and going frcm

public house to public house looking for those which were open.

I remember sharing a joke with the manager of the newly refurbished

Travellers Inn in Penistone Road North.      Hie pub was closed and the

car park was thus available for use.      Our joke concerned how much he

could charge to allow fans to park on it.      All this area was well

policed and I was happy that everyone seemed to know what they were

doing.
                                                                      pact:
                                                                      S219

I then patrolled back towards the ground and into the Middlewood Road

area.     I continued as far as the main stopping area, all the time

meeting and speaking to police officers about their duties.       In the

shopping arcade I met and spoke to two officers and the security

manager of the precinct.      We discussed possible problems involving

stealing from shops, as had occurred in 1988 (000088). I then popped

ray head round the door of Thresher's Off Licence in Middlewood

Road.     Two female staff were working.     Thefts had occurred there in

1988 (000088) and I therefore assured them that the police were not

far away if there was trouble.

There were already substantial numbers of fans wandering about the

streets and I was saddened to see that most were openly drinking

alcohol from cans and litre bottles.       Many were carrying four packs

and I was asked by a group of fans where they could find pubs that

wera open.     All the fans I encountered were Liverpool supporters.

I spoke to one man who was drinking from a can of strong lager and

had another 3 cans in his possession.       I expressed the view that

wera he to drink all the lager he had in his possession he might

latar have difficulty getting into the match.

I patrolled back towards Wadsley Lane, arriving there about 12 noon

(1200). Crowds were now starting to build up.       Marty Liverpool

fans were wandering about and I was being asked where open pubs could

be found.     Again, many fans were openly drinking cans of beer and

lagar.      Feist food outlets were very busy indeed.

About this time I heard some radio traffic concerning two public

houses.      The first was the Fox Inn in Foxhill which was said to be

very busy indeed.       This was not surprising as the landlord had

publicly expressed his intention in the Sheffield Star that he had

obtained an extra 10 barrels of beer for consumption by Liverpool

fans.     The pub had apparently been drunk dry in 1988 (000088). I



                                                                              2533
                                                                      PAGE       8
                                                                      S219

radioed control and asked that officers visit and see the landlord and

warn him about serving drunks.

The second pub was the Horse and Jockey in Dykes Hall Road, Where 100-

200 persons were said to be drinking outside.      Again this concerned

me.   I contacted a Dog Van at the junction of Middlewood Road and

Wadsley Lane.      PC Roger Pearce was a passenger in this van, which

was being driven by a Dog Handler from Nottinghamshire Constabulary.

I spoke to PC Pearce and directed them to go to the Horse and Jockey

and monitor developments.

I then continued patrol along Middlewood Road out of city as far as

Barnett's Off Licence.      This was closed and was being guarded by a

male constable and a female constable.      I spoke to both officers.

I then crossed the road where I saw the manager of Willis'

Supermarket.      These premises also have an off licence facility.          I

spoke to the manager who gave me the erroneous impression that drink

was not being sold.

I continued my patrol, walking down Leppings Lane, past the

turnstiles and into Penistone Road North.      The time was now about

lpm (1300).     A lot more fans were wandering about.      I adjusted

the points of two groups of officers, firstly to prevent coaches

entering Leppings Lane for unloading purposes;     and secondly to

prevent obstruction outside a fast food outlet near Leppings Lane

roundabout.

I met Inspector Millett at the end of Claywheels        Lane and we

arranged for a policewoman, who was directing coaches into that road,

to be given a fluorescent waistcoat to increase her visibility and

personal safety.

I continued towards the Wadsley Bridge railway station and en route I

met Chief Inspector Purdy.      There was some radio traffic that

Mounted officers had stopped a transit van full of fans and this was



                                                                                     2534
                                                                   PAGE      9
                                                                   S219

parked on the Comet car park of Kilner Way.      The Mounted officers

suspected drink was on board and required assistance.     There were a

lot of police officers about but as we were not far away ourselves I

decided to go to the scene.      On arrival at the car park I saw a non­

descript minibus which was filled to capacity with mostly male

fans.      They were truculent and all appeared to have been drinking.

They were not drunk.      I took charge of this situation and with other

officers invited each of the passengers out of the van one by one.

With the exception of the female all were searched, as was the van.

I rsmanber one of the males claiming to be an ex-policeman from

Cheshire and he provided his service number.      The search was

negative and I gave the people some advice about their behaviour and

diracted them towards the ground.      I permitted than to leave their

van in Kilner Way rather than remove it to Wardsend Road.

With Chief Inspector Purdy we returned back along Kilner Way.          The

Gataway Supermarket was doing a roaring trade at its 'off licence'

section with a queue of fans buying drink through a door.      There is

a large grass verge outside Halfords at the junction of Kilner Way

and Halifax Road and I estimated that 100-150 persons, mostly male,

wera lying or sitting on the grass drinking from cans and bottles in

the bright sunshine.      At this time there was no trouble, and despite

what seemed to me to be far too much drinking going on fans were well

behaved.

I continued back down Halifax Road towards Claywheels Lane.        I

remamber seeing a coach stopping in Halifax Road and fans

disambarking.      I went across to this coach with Chief Inspector

Purdy and spoke to the driver.      He assured me that his passengers

knew where they could rejoin the coach after the match as they had all

been before in 1988 (000088).      There was not much I could do about

this situation at that stage so I let it go at that.



                                                                                 2535
                                                                       PAGE   10
                                                                       S219

I returned to the Claywheels Lane area and by radio checked with the

Serial Sergeants that coach parking was going to plan.         There were

no problems and room for another 15-16 coaches at this stage.

I continued into Middlewood Road where I met Inspector Humphries.

We discussed the progress of the operation to date.        There was then

scn>a radio traffic that youths were causing a nuisance in Wadsley

Lane by urinating in gardens.      Again I was near to Wadsley Lane so I

decided to patrol in that area, and with Inspector Humphries I walked

up the road.

There were now very many Liverpool fans about.        Many were

drinking.      They were mostly male.      Seme fans were picnicking in

their cars.     We encountered two youths walking down Wadsley Lane.

One had a half full pint glass, the other had a half-full half-pint

glass.      I asked them what they thought they were doing.       Both

mumbled a reply to the effect that they had had a drink at the pub.

I suggested they return the glasses to the pub and after a little

hesitation they accepted this advice and turned about, ostensibly to

return to the Horse and Jockey.         We followed them for a short

distance.

On arrival at the end of Marlcliffe Road I saw the off licence was

very busy indeed.      About 30 males were standing or sitting on the

pavament outside.      All were drinking a variety of intoxicating

liquor.      I saw some drinking wine.     The majority were drinking beer,

lager and cider.      Seme of these persons were clearly intoxicated and

I spoke to two or three youths about their behaviour.         At this point

a 'Tango' van drew up, under the command of Police Sergeant Miller.

I told him to keep an eye on these youths and also the crowd drinking

outside the Horse and Jockey.

With Inspector Humphries I returned back down Wadsley Lane towards

Middlewood Road.      As I passed the Park Hotel (which had closed for



                                                                                   2536

                                                                    S219

the day) I saw groups of fans.      They were drinking on the pub

forecourt and were chanting football slogans.      I told than to shut

up and save their shouting for inside the ground.     There were five

constables nearby and I told these officers to keep an eye on them.

I returned once again back along Middlewood Road to the top of

Parkside Road.      It was now busy with fans, and cars very much in

evidence.      I saw a large group of skinheads moving along Middlewood

Road and I followed this group for a time.

Shortly before 2pm (1400) I heard some radio traffic that the

special train had arrived at Wadsley Bridge Station and that the

passengers and escorting Serials (Serials 36 and 37) plus Chief

Inspector Purdy and Mounted officers were en route to the Penistone

Road turnstiles.

I patrolled towards the turnstiles, pausing en route to clear youths

from the roadway outside the Four Lanes Cafe.      I instructed two

constables to prevent the overflow of fans into the road.

Leppings Lane was now becoming increasingly congested.         Crowds were

building up.     There was considerable open drinking going on and the

fast food outlets were very busy.      There were no problems at this

stage and in my view there were ample police officers in the area to

help and assist fans to find the right entrance and carry out the

preventive role described earlier.

Fans were entering the ground.      A lot were stood around.      I saw

four or five 'F' Division CID officers, all dressed in casual

clothing.      Their brief was to keep an eye open for criminal

activity, i.e. pick-pocketing, and I was pleased to see them in that

area although I did not acknowledge their presence.

I was now effectively the most senior officer in the vicinity of the

turnstiles, although Chief Inspector Creaser was in charge up to the

point, assisted by Inspectors Sykes and Purdy.



                                                                                  2537
                                                                 PAGE     12

Serials 16, 17, 18, 19, 4 Sergeants and 40 Constables were on duty,

along with Mounted officers from South Yorkshire and Merseyside.

The area was busy, noisy and colourful.    The crowds were not a lot

different from a normal match day at that stage, although there were

many more people about.     The majority seaned to be from the

Merseyside area.

It seemed that many fans had come without tickets to get in.     I

heard many passing to and fro asking other fans for 'spares'.      This

toing and froing was constant and there seaned no desire or urgency

on the part of fans to gain entry to the ground.

Foot officers, in accordance with our usual practice, were stationed

outside each turnstile chatting to and searching fans as they queued

to pass through the stiles.    Other officers were actively

encouraging fans to enter the ground.

Mounted officers were actively shepherding people into the turnstiles

area to get them into the ground.     I was not anxious at this stage

and as I surveyed the scene I considered events were proceeding to

plan.   I remember discussing with Inspector Sykes, the most senior

and experienced of the Inspectors, how we would handle the non-ticket

holders post kick off, and we agreed that we would try to contain

then in Leppings Lane and, as has happened in the past, they would

probably find someone with a radio on which they could listen to the

gama.   I did not wish fans to roam the roads around the perimeter of

the ground at will or unsupervised as this has caused problems in the

past for local residents.

By 2.15pm (1415) Leppings Lane was full of fans moving in both

diractions.   I estimate the numbers at about 6-8 thousand.      They

wera spilling off footpaths into the roadway and making movements of

vehicles difficult.   Many fans continued to drink from cans and I

continued to hear people asking others for spares.



                                                                               2538
                                                                    PAGE   13
                                                                    S219

My own position was in Leppings Lane roadway itself at ground level,

where I continued to monitor events, talking to policonen and fans.

The traffic situation gradually deteriorated and by 2.25pm (1425) it

became apparent that we would have to close Leppings Lane to motor

vehicles.    Inspector Sykes and I discussed this and I contacted

match control asking that the road be closed at Leppings Lane

roundabout and at Catch Bar Lane.     My request was acknowledged but

for some reason was not iitmediately effective.    Traffic continued to

core along Leppings Lane from the direction of the roundabout and

sore service buses came down from Middlewood Road.      I walked up

Leppings Lane to the traffic lights at the junction with Catch Bar

Lana where there was a queue of 3 service buses being held up by a

constable.   The constable asked what he was to do and I told him to

let the buses go through.      I then radioed match control and repeated

my request that Leppings Lane should be closed but added that they

should contact Mrl                  of South Yorkshire Transport and

advise him that buses would need to be diverted away from Leppings

Lane.   These measures are not usually necessary on normal match days.

I left a constable on duty at the junction and walked back towards

the turnstiles.      Most officers were now actively suggesting to fans

to enter the ground.      The time was about 2.30pm (1430).

I continued to actively involve myself in crowd control, especially

in the vicinity of turnstiles A-G.      These consist of 3 double

turnstiles and one single turnstile and feed spectators directly into

a large concourse at the rear of the West Stand and Terrace.        All

the turnstiles were open and were admitting a steady stream of fans

into the ground.      I saw Inspector Purdy to the right of the

turnstiles and he was keeping an eye on the queues.      The Stand area

turnstiles 1 to 16 were all working and again a steady stream of

spectators were moving through.


                                                                                2539
                                                                     PAGE   14
                                                                     S219

The crowd outside the turnstiles at this stage appeared reasonably

good humoured and I was neither frightened nor anxious for anyone's

safety.     I heard nothing from match control other than continuous

radio traffic describing relatively minor problems here and there

inside and outside the ground.      However, as time progressed the

situation at the turnstiles began to deteriorate.

At one stage I remember moving on the outskirts of the crowd outside

turnstiles A to G to the relatively free area beside Gate C.         The

crowd were contained by an open, chest height, steel barrier and Gate

B.   This is a fairly narrow area.      I saw Inspector Purdy watching

movament and also Detective Superintendent McKay and PC Booking, who

wera observing the crowd for pickpockets.     There was a lot of

pushing and shoving going on which was causing discomfort within the

press, and four or five Mounted officers were within this part of the

crowd, trying to maintain order.      I recollect that I entered the

crowd myself and shouted loudly to people to stop pushing and shoving

as this was hurting people at the front.      I used phrases like,

"Don't worry, you'll all get in";     "Don't push", etc. etc.   Sadly this

had very little effect and I pushed my way back out through the press

to the rear of the crowd.     I believe that my actions were filmed by

a BBC TV cameraman who had been standing on the parapet of the river

bridge, for as I forced my way out of the press the camera team

passed me walking down the road towards the rear of the South

Stand.     The taller of the two men, who I do not know but have seen

regularly at incidents in Sheffield previously, said words to the

effact that I would have a better view if I went to the position he

had occupied on the parapet of the bridge.

I took his advice and went to the bridge and climbed onto the

parapet.     From this position I could see over the heads of the crowd

and the only area which was obscured in part was the aperture of Gate


                                                                                 2540
                                                                 PAGE        15
                                                                 S219

B.      The time was about 2.40pm (1440).

A vast and progressively more unruly crowd was now assembling.      It

was a volatile and seething mass of people.     They were pushing and

shoving as more and more people continued to arrive in the area.        At

one point I saw a youth of perhaps 11 or 12 years start to scale the

facade above the West Stand turnstiles.      He reached the top and a

great cheer went up but he clearly did not enjoy what he saw on the

other side and returned back to the crowd.

My attention returned to the area in front of turnstiles A-G.      I saw

Inspector Purdy standing on top of the steel barrier between the

queuing area and the road to the South Stand.      He was balanced like a

tight rope walker and was shouting and clearly doing his level best

to maintain a semblance of order.      The Mounted officers were in the

thick of this press and were clearly having the most difficult

time.      Their horses were struggling and I saw anxiety written on the

faca of more than one officer.

The crowd build up continued to increase and it seemed to me that

tempers were becoming frayed.

I tried to radio control that I needed assistance quickly and a

tannoyed announcement over the turnstiles loudspeakers to urge people

to queue in orderly fashion and also that PC Buxton, who normally

drives a Landrover equipped with a public address facility, to ccme

diractly to Leppings Lane to assist me.      I did not get an

acknowledgement from control, although I heard PC Buxton ccme over

loudly and clearly saying, "I'm on my way".      I cannot now say with

certainty how long it took for PC Buxton to arrive but I recollect

looking over my shoulder at some stage and seeing PC Buxton speaking

into the microphone in the Landrover which was in the road in

Leppings Lane:     I could not hear what he was saying due to the noise

of the crowd.



                                                                                  2541
                                                                      PAGE   16
                                                                      S219

Having no acknowldegement of my request for a tannoy I guessed that

soma technical fault had affected the radio system.       I therefore

changed my multi channel set from Channel 25 (the match channel) to

Channel 35, which is Hammerton Road Channel, and asked the controller

to pass on my request for a tannoyed announcement on ground control

by telephone.     I subsequently learned that this was passed at

2.44pm (1444) and actioned, but I cannot remember ever hearing what

was broadcast.

Over the next few minutes the scenes outside the turnstiles

detariorated very rapidly indeed.     An enormous crowd continued to

converge on the turnstiles.     There was total confusion as many did

not know which area they had to queue in to gain entrance, and the

signs above the turnstiles are rather poorly marked.       Very many

seemed to be under the influence of drink.      Fans at the rear pressed

forward with total irresponsibility and disregard for the safety of

othars.    The best efforts of Foot and Mounted officers failed to

detsr them.      There did not seem to be much movement through the

turnstiles and it seemed that people were fighting each other to go

through.      Some started to climb over turnstiles.    I saw one fan

actually traverse a ledge over the river on the outside of the bridge

to bring him nearer to the turnstiles.      Seme scrambled on the river

bank itself.

As I watched I felt someone pushing at my ankles and I interpreted

this as an attempt to push me off the bridge into the river.          I

jumped down and remonstrated with a man.      He appeared drunk.       I

remamber he was wearing sunglasses and these fell off his face, only

to be crushed underfoot by others in the crowd.        I could only

remonstrate with this man and he was soon swallowed up in the crush.

By about 2.45pm (1445) the crowd was jammed against the turnstiles

in all areas but the press was worst against turnstiles A-G.          Fans



                                                                                  2542

wera swarming over the gates, parapets and facade of the

turnstiles.    I recollect seeing Inspector Bennett on the roof above

turnstiles 1-16.     He did not send the fans back down into the

crowd.    The turnstiles and gates were effectively under seige.

There was absolute bedlam.     People were kicking and fighting each

other and clearly many were absolutely terrified.     The Mounted

officers were absolutely valiant but their work was of little avail.

Inspector Purdy gesticulated to me and I climbed frcm the parapet of

the bridge and forced my way to the right hand of the blue heavy

steal perimeter gates.     He joined me and we spoke to each other

through the gates.

Inspector Purdy told me that people at the front of the crowd by

turnstiles A-G were being crushed and asked me to open gates.       He

was not specific as to which gates he thought should be opened but

his anxiety was apparent.     It confirmed my perception, unprecedented

in my experience, that this was no ordinary crowd of fans but an

enormous press of people determined to enter the stadium cctne what

may.     I was, nevertheless, unhappy to agree to the request: to

implement it would lead to uncontrolled access to the stadium and

negate all our efforts to prevent hooliganism inside.      I told him

that we would have to hang on.     He responded by saying that unless

gates were opened people would be crushed.     The look of extreme

anxiety remained on his face.     I took account of the fact that this

was an Inspector speaking to me and I made my mind up immediately

that the only practical way to prevent deaths outside would be to

open the gates.      I nodded to Mr Purdy and told him I would contact

ground control.    He returned to his position by the steel barrier and

 I pushed my way back to my vantage point on the bridge parapet.

 The situation was unchanged and was worsening by the minute.       It had

 outgrown our capacity to manage it effectively.     The situation was



                                                                               2543

unprecedented in my experience.

I saw a beer can thrown from within the crowd jammed in front of

turnstiles A-G.     It hit a Mounted officer and the contents ran down

his coat.

I radioed ground control and asked for the gates at the lappings Lane

end of the ground to be opened.     There was no acknowledgment.

Initially I thought my own radio was defective so I jumped down from

the bridge and pushed my way across to Inspector Ellis.     I asked him

for his radio, which I remember was an old Burndept type.     I called

ground control in Inspector Ellis' presence and repeated my request

for gates to be opened at the Leppings Lane end.     There was no

acknowledgement.

I again returned to my vantage point and scrambled onto the bridge

parapet.      Once again I believe I changed channels to 35 and asked

the staff at Hammerton Road Control Room to pass on my request to

open gates.      I believe my message was acknowledged but as I changed

back to the match control, radio cover had clearly resumed.        I

repeated my request that the gates at leppings Lane should be opened

and said that unless it was done quickly someone would be killed.

It is difficult to put into words now the scene of Which I and other

police officers were a part.      Radio messages were almost inaudible

due to the noise.      The situation at the turnstiles was obviously

frightening as more and more fans pushed to gain entrance.      There

was no semblance of queues, neither was there any self-discipline or

order.

About 2.48pm (1448) I saw C Gate opened slightly from within the

ground.     This was not immediately apparent to the crowd in the

 turnstiles area A-G as the gate was .invisible to them frcm where they

wera standing.      A trickle of people passed through the gate.       I saw

 Ins actor Purdy physically pulling pieople frcm the press under the



                                                                               2544

barrier and thrusting them bodily through the gate.

A Mounted officer was by the gate, as were numerous foot officers,

and it seemed to me that the action of opening C Gate brought a

little respite to the area in front of the turnstiles, but this

lasted only seconds as the crowd was topped up by others still

pushing in Leppings Lane.

After a short period C Gate was closed.     Large numbers of persons

wera still flooding into the area.     The crowd now spilled out over

the road to the South Stand.

Mounted officers then, of their own volition, succeeded in closing

the heavy blue steel perimeter gates, clearly with the plan in mind

of relieving the crush on the turnstiles.     These officers stationed

themselves behind the gate.     Fans continued to climb over the walls

and parapets of the turnstiles in large numbers, but whether this was

to prevent their being crushed or to gain free entrance to the

ground, I cannot say.

The heavy steel perimeter gate was being shaken and was clearly

coming under enormous pressure.      I believed that it would only be a

matter of time before it was knocked down completely and the thought

crossed my mind that our horses would be impaled on the points of the

metal rails of which the gate was constructed.

About 2.52pm (1452) the gate burst open and the Mounted officers

wera brushed aside.     A crowd of people surged through into the

turnstile area and service road.

I ramember looking across at Gate A Which provides access to the

North Stand.   I had not earlier seen this gate opened.      It was under

pressure and was being shaken by a large press of people.      I radioed

ground control and asked for the North Stand gate to be opened, and

aftar a short time this was done.      Fans entered but I cannot say now

in what numbers.      I noted there were police officers on both sides of


                                                                               2545

the gate and they seemed to be quickly in control of the situation.

The desperate push to enter the ground continued in the front of

turnstiles A-G.    The Mounted officers were still trying to control

the situation.    About the same time Gate C opened again and

simultaneously there was a roar frcm inside the ground.      This

excited the atmosphere even more.     A large number of fans - I cannot

say how many - entered through the gate.      I cannot say to what area

of the ground they went.

Soma still went in through the turnstiles but the crush visibly

diminished.

I did not see Gate B opened at any stage.

Shortly after 3pm (1500) there was a radio message passed that

there was trouble inside the ground and a general request was made

for every available officer to assist.

There were still large numbers of people in Leppings Lane so I sent

about 30 men inside:   the remainder stayed in the vicinity of the

turnstiles.

There was further radio traffic that there were injured people inside

the ground.

It quickly became apparent that there had been a serious incident on

the Leppings Lane Terrace and soon the concourse at the rear of the

West Stand was thronged with fans coining from the tunnel.     Some were

carrying injured comrades.      These persons had the appearance of

having been crushed.

Soma casualties appeared dead, although I could not say how many or

from what area they had come.

All police officers present responded immediately and we tried to

bring order to a scene of pandemonium and chaos.     Many officers

wera trying to resuscitate   people, using mouth to mouth

resuscitation and cardiac massage.



                                                                                2546

        Whilst officers were trying to save lives of fans the conduct of

        other fans was deplorable.      A drunken man swore obscenely at me and

         I was spat upon.

        We were joined at the back of the West Stand by many other police

        officers, then, by first one, then a growing fleet of ambulances.

        Ambulances could not enter through Gate C so as best we could we

        tried to get casualites down through the concourse to the roadway by

        the gate.     They were there separated into three groups - those

        apparently dead, those seriously injured, and those less seriously

        hurt.     At some stage I spoke to a senior fireman and asked him for

        soma sheets to screen bodies Which were being placed in the road.         I

        recollect asking for the major incident boxes to be brought fran

        Hairrnerton Road Police Station to the ground.

        All officers present were employed attempting to bring some order to

        the very difficult situation.

        I learned that the match had been abandoned and when this became

        public knowledge fans started to drift out of the ground.

        I was directed to report to match control, and about 5.15pm (1715)

        I was transported to Headquarters where I briefed the Chief Constable

        and the Deputy Chief Constable regarding these events.

           BENJAMIN ARTHUR FIDLER

           POLICE SERGEANT 102

           On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489), I commenced duty at 5.30am (0530)

           I was working in connection with the semi-final between Liverpool and

           Nottingham Forest.    My duties were the supervision of civilian

           staff regarding the placing of cones, barriers and the preparation of

           the gymnasium for the issue of radios and snack meals.     In overall

           charge was Inspector BENNETT.

           I worked with Police Constable 3018 SHELTON, Police Constable 3082

           FLETCHER, Police Constable Martin HORN and Police Sergeant SEWELL.         In

           practice 3018 SHELTON and myself worked this particular duty on all

           large matches and we instructed the others in what to do.

           The issue of radios in the gym was to all supervisory ranks.     At the

           tiire of the radio issue, meals tickets were given out to each
                                                                  PAGE      2
                                                                  S1855

Inspector and to each serial Sergeant for his serial.     He also had

to collect snack meals for his serial.

Police Constable SHELTON and myself issued radios to Serials 1-21 as

they were to hand in the radios at the gymnasium on completion of

duty and Police Constable 3082 FLETCHER and Police Constable 538 HORN

issued radios to Serials 22-64 as they would be finishing at

Claywheels Lane. A number of earpieces had been provided which were to

be issued to Senior Officers and to officers working in the ground

after the Senior Officers had received theirs.     I did not have a great

deal to     do with the issue of the radios as I was issuing meal tickets

and snack meals.     I did assist but I cannot be sure as to who I issued

radios to, or to be exact to whan I handed them to whilst

Police Constable 3018 recorded them.     I know that all the ear pieces

were issued as we had one or two requests for them after we had issued

them all.    All this took place up to about 10.30 to 10.45 (1030 to

1045).    Things seemed to go very smoothly, one or two radios

exchanged. The gym was prepared for meals about 20 tables were set up.

The catering staff came and cooked meals.    They started to serve hot

meals fron about 1.00pm (1300) and several people had them.

Police Sergeant SEWELL was listening to radio traffic and said that it

sounded as if there was trouble at Leppings Lane . Before this at

about 2.00pm (1400) Chief Inspector BEAL returned his radio for a

change of battery as he said the radio traffic sounded as if it was

underwater. We changed the battery, but the sound was the same.     I saw

a carmunications man called Andy and he listened and said that there

was a possible fault on the base transmitter.    Chief Inspector BEAL

took him out to go to Control.

Police Sergeant 467 SEWELL then said that there was trouble at

Leppings Lane and I donned my full uniform and went to see if I could

assist.     As I approached the entrance to the playing area near to the
                                                                     pact :   3
                                                                     S1855

disabled section of the ground I saw several officers run into the

ground.   They asked me for instructions, I told than to go onto the

track and report to a track Inspector for deployment.      I saw Inspector

WALLACE standing by with a serial of men and I saw 6 Mounted Officers

ride   in and stand by at the    entrance to the track.   At this time

Inspector SEWELL saw me    and   instructed me to return to the gymnasium.

When   I returned several officers came in from bus escort duties. They

went   in and sat waiting for    their meals. They were mostly 'D'

Divisional Officers.

Inspector SEWELL came in and instructed the Sergeants to report to the

Admin desk and report how many men they had.     Police Sergeant SEWELL

listed them.     Inspector SEWELL informed control and we were instructed

to deploy all the men in the gymnasium onto the track.      This we did.

A faw minutes later Chief Inspector BEAL came to me and insturcted me

to prepare the gym to receive bodies.     This we did by moving the

tables and chairs out of the way.

Minutes later a policeman came in carrying the body of a child

obviously dead.     Inspector BENNETT, myself and Detective Constable

DYNES took the child and we eventually placed him at the back of the

gym.   As we put him down other bodies were arriving carried by Police

and by civilians.    Police Constable SHELTON and I started to number

the bodies and take down a description.     We used sticky labels and the

property book.    I searched the bodies in a cursory manner for items of

identification.

Police Constable 3253 CAMPBELL came into the gym and she started to

help in recording the details of the dead.     Detective Constables ASKEW

and LILLEY came and they started to lay the bodies out in rows of 12.

Police Sergeant 467 SEWELL joined us and by this time the body count

was quite high so Police Sergeant SEWELL took bodies 13-24, the CID

took details of the next row and Police Constable SHELTON and myself
                                                                           pact :   4
                                                                           S1855

         took the next row and so on.

         Inspector CHARLES had arrived and took charge. Inspector TINGLE was

         also there.    The first bodies I searched were in some cases soaked in

         urine on the upper body which I found so unusual that I commented that

         they must have been lying strangely.     A Police Constable said " No

         Sarge they were peeing on us as we     were pulling them out".   I took

         him to mean other fans.

         I worked in the gymnasium throughout the night and went off duty when

         the last body was taken to the Medico-Legal Centre at 5.30am (0530).

        Because the gymnasium had been taken over as a temporary mortuary, I

        believe that the radios were handed in at the Police Room under the

        North Stand.

           At 8 am (0800) on Saturday 15th April, 1989 (150489) I commenced

           duty at the Gymnasium, Sheffield Wednesday football ground, in

           connection with the FA cup semi final between Liverpool and Nottingham

           Forest.    I was responsible for issue of personal radios to officers

           engaged on duties in connection with the football match, and each

           radio was recorded in a book with the Officer's collar number.

           I can say that radios 81 and 82 (multi-channel) were issued to PC2264

           and the remainder (Bumdept B470 3 channels 19 - 25 - 29) were issued

           to the following -

           500 - 518 inclusive, 520 - 523 inclusive, and 525 - 541 inclusive

           were all issued to Serial Sergeants.

           Radios no. 543 - 548, 550 -556, 558, 559 were issued to Serial

           Inspectors, and 561 - 570, 514, 571 were issued to the Special

         After completing this duty I conveyed the radio boxes and the radio

         issued book to Claywheels Lane, Road Traffic Department, where the

         officers had been informed to return their radios on the completion of

         their duty.

         The radio book is now in possession of the West Midlands Police and I

         can identify it if required to do so.

        All the radios issued by myself were checked, given charged batteries

         and set to channel 25, which gives a direct link to Ground Control.

         In total there were 68 radios issued, and to my knowledge none were

         returned as faulty.

           I transferred to 'F' Division on Monday 3 April 1989 (030489) as the

           Chief Inspector (Admin).

           The Operational Order for the FA cup semi-final was drafted and I was

           not included on the order.

           As a new member of the Division I made a request to the Chief

           Superintendent to be able to attend the event in order to observe the

           Police operation.

           As a preliminary to the event I received an overview of the planning

           and rationale from Inspector SEWELL at 2.30 pm (1430) on Wednesday

           12 April 1989 (120489).

           I did not attend the Commander's brief on Friday 14 April, 1989

           (140489).

           On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) I attended Sheffield Wednesday

           football ground at 9.45 am (0945) I was off duty attending in my

                                                                                        2554
                                                                PACT     2
                                                                S1852

own time, in civilian clothing in order to watch, listen and learn.

I took up a place at the rear of the North Stand, behind CID Officers,

but in front of the Special Constables.

It appeared to me that attention to detail was evident in the way

serials were ordered, Officers wore headgear and professionalism

prevailed.

Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD imparted a factual briefing

identifying the various Section Senior Commanders by name and in

person.   He impressed that Officers must act in a professional manner

which would reflect credit on South Yorkshire Police.

This brief was clear, concise and audible at the rear by use of a

microphone and amplifier.

This part was followed by Superintendent MURRAY.

I was again impressed with the standard of briefing, again attention

to detail such as the evacuation procedures and Officers being aware

of their individual requirement in the event of such eventuality.

I particularly recall him saying "We have fully tried the evacuation

procedures twice this season, the first time was good, the second time

was excellence; if we are required to implement evacuation today, it

must be excellent".

This briefing was followed by an up to date intelligence report from

Detective Sergeant CHARLESWORTH.

Finally, Inspector SEWELL gave general information about radios, issue

and mealing arranganents.

It was stressed that all Officers must be on their respective points

by 11.15 am (1115).

After the briefing it was evident that little of value would be gained

until later into the operation so I left the stadium to return to my

private vehicle. I was approached on three separate occasions in

Penistone Road and asked if I had any tickets to sell.
                                                                PAGE     3
                                                                S1852

There were a lot of people around first sitting on walls in groups.

I want to my vehicle and drove to Hanmerton Road Police Station where

I carried out sane outstanding clerical work.

I bagan to walk back to the stadium, leaving my car at Hanrnerton Road

Police Station, when a police car offered me a lift to the ground.

This I accepted.

I saw Policewoman SMITH and another Officer outside Threshers near

HoLne Lane and was pleased to see Officers doing what was expected of

then.

I asked to be dropped a little away from the stadium as I wanted to

observe Officers on their respective areas and see how they were

performing.   I was really anonymous to them or many of them as I was

new to the Division and not in uniform.

All Police Officers were acting properly, but I was a little surprised

that at 1.00 pn (1300) there were so few cars and pedestrians in

the area.

By Hillsborough Park I saw a group of people sitting around, there was

a white plastic carrier bag with them and the outline of cans could be

seen.   The visible cans were of Heineken lager in the green can.

There were six men and they were joking about having to drink the lot

as they would not be allowed to take them into the ground.

Approx 1.15 pn (1315).

By Leppings Lane gates were few supporters, road clear, plenty of

Police Officers evident.

I want to the barrier at Leppings Lane / Vere Road where I spoke to '

A' Division Officers, Police Constables PARKIN and DRURY.    A few

people passing and we spoke about running and 'A' Divisional work.

I then walked past Leppings Lane gates and came to barriers and Police

Officers - Police Sergeant NORBURN and others I do not know.   There

wera no other people near this area.   I knew from my preliminary
                                                                  PAffi   4
                                                                  S1852

discussions with Inspector SEWFn~.Ii the necessity to provide a sterile

area to keep opposing fans separate.

I continued along the road being the South Stand past the TV unit vans

where I was met with another barrier of metal barriers and Police

Officers.   I produced my warrant card, but I was known to one Officer

who I did not know.

I want down and along Penistone Road which was busy.

I walked towards Parkside Road and I was against the flow of people,

it was very busy.

I stopped and spoke to Police Constable VALLANCE from 'A' Division and

Police Constable HALTMAN from 'A' Division at separate points but due

to enquiries and sheer numbers of persons it was prudent to move on,

as they needed all their attention to deal with the volume of people.

I returned to rear of South Stand.

About 11.45 am (1145), the Liverpool team coach arrived.

There was a motorcycle lead and Police horses controlling a large

crowd awaiting the trains arrival.

I noticed the horse near me was displaying a Merseyside Police Badge

on the saddle.

There were no incidents.

Sergeant SORSBY of South Yorkshire Police Mounted said to the other

Officers - "Exactly the same for the Notts Forest Coach".

About 1.55 pn (1355), the Nottingham Forest team coach arrived.

The procedure was as for Liverpool, no problems, crowd good humoured.

I left this area and returned to Penistone Road as I intended to vise

the entrance to the ground by the Police Room.

Penistone Road was quite busy but there was no queuing at the

turnstiles as I would have expected.   At that time about one hour to

kick off.

I knew there was a Liverpool train due at Wadsley Bridge around 2.05
                                                                   PAGE     5
                                                                   S1852

pn (1405) but decided to go into the ground.

I went to the main sliding gate and produced my warrant card and a

special card issued to me by Superintendent MURRAY.       Both were fully

checked and examined by the stewards which I thought was excellent.

I was assured no unauthorised person would gain entry at that gate.

I went down onto the perimeter track and was immediately surprised by

how full the Spion Kop was.     I turned and saw the North Stand was not

very full.     I made my way to the Police Control box.

Inspector SEWELL had alerted me to the fact that inside there was only

limited space.     I intended to visit, see it operated and leave if I

was in the way.

I wanted to see the Control point as I was at Doncaster Rovers when

the camera equipment was first installed and operated at the beginning

of the present season.    The engineer was always quoting The Sheffield

Wednesday system as being excellent and holding the system as the way

all grounds should operate.

On entering the Police box there was Sergeant GODDARD, Police

Constable RYAN at the front and Police Constable BICHARD at the rear

by the camera operating controls.

I was informed by Police Sergeant GODDARD that Superintendent MURRAY

had gone to speak to the referee so I sat on his seat and was offered

a hot drink.     It didn't appear particularly busy and quite clearly

everything was under control.

Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) Mr JACKSON came to the control

point, he was in civilian clothing.

I saw through the control room window Superintendent MURRAY and Chief

Superintendent DUCKENFIELD, in uniform, walking along the track.       They

came through the uncovered seats in the South Stand and entered the

control room.

I went to the far end of the room and stood by the camera control
                                                                   PAGE    6
                                                                   S1852

area.    I was prepared to leave, but did not appear to be hindering

anyone and felt I would gain onset benefit from staying and observing

froin this point.

On looking into the ground the Liverpool areas had a lot of space, the

Notts Forest parts I could see on the South Stand and the Spion Kop

were quite full.

I recall Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD conmenting about there being

no entertainment being provided to encourage the supporters to cone

early.

I remember when I was a child there always being a band playing by the

players tunnel at every game at Hillsborough.

Whilst I didn't see it, Assistant Chief Constable Operations ccrrmented

that a person just below the Police control had just dropped his

trousers.     When I looked the person was jiggling around.   I remember

thinking how empty the area around this youth was.     Police Constable

BICHARD operated the camera and I watched him be able to zoom onto

him which I thought was a super facility for spotting troublemakers in

the crowd.

I was aware the area in Leppings Lane behind the goal was filling up

but this was to be expected.

I was then aware that both teams came onto the pitch for a pre-match

warn up.     As there was nothing special happening on the screen or in

the ground I looked onto the playing area.

I was aware that Alan HANSON of Liverpool was on the pitch and was

surprised as I didn't think he would be playing.     The Liverpool fans

were shouting his name and he acknowledged them by raising his hand.

All was good humoured.
                  /
The area behind the goal at Leppings Lane was getting full but there

was space at the front.     People seemed reluctant to move forward,

probably all wanting to maintain their best view of the playing area.
                                                                PAGE     7
                                                                S1852

Approx 2.30 pm (1430).

I looked on the left monitor and was aware there seemed a build up of

supporters.

I ramember asking Superintendent MURRAY about this, he explained that

due to necessary segregation of fans, access to the North Stand, which

had been allocated to Liverpool supporters, could only be done by

Leppings Lane entrances, this meant that the entrances on Penistone

Road to the stand which would normally be used were unavailable.

This explained at that time in my mind the crowds on the screen.

I recall a suggestion that the loud hailer / tannoy should be used to

request fans to move forward to create room at the rear to prevent

crowding.

People began advising control that radio reception was poor.

An engineer came into the room to try and improve transmission and

recaption.

I ramember him in blue under the control room bench, I thought it was

crowded as Police Sergeant GODDARD was walking round / over him.

I thought of leaving but was unable to get past and was better staying

where I was.

I was aware Superintendent MARSHALL requested the closure of Leppings

Lana to traffic.

I looked to the screen and whilst there seemed a lot of people this

was to be expected and this had been the situation for quite a time.

It was not extraordinary.    I recall seeing a cream double decker bus

travelling slowly through the crowd which indicated the road was not

blocked and free movement was possible.

The situation remained like this, poor reception, the ground slowly

filling up and everything progressing as one would expect for such an

occasion.    The crowd seemed good humoured in the ground.

Approx 2.45 pm (1445)
                                                                   PAGE    8
                                                                   S1852

The crowd outside appears denser on the camera but I can see a Police

horse on the screen.   Having seen them at close hand control the crowd

when the team coaches arrived, I sensed they were well in control.

Officers were deployed to assist, including a land rover with PA

equipment to assist Officers outside.

Around this time a radio message was relayed requesting the gates to

be opened as persons were trapped up against the gates.

I ramember thinking, you can't open the gates or you lose control over

who is admitted, you are unable to search or check persons admitted
                                                   «r


for weapons and may create a difficult public order situation for

Police inside the ground.

The gates were not authorised to be opened by Chief Superintendent

DUCKENFIELD at this time.

I am aware that the teams are no longer on the pitch so the start

could not be far off and there was still a lot of space on the terrace

undar the Police Control.

It occurred that some Liverpool supporters were leaving it late but

people often enter after the start of marry games.

About this time I can see people climbing over the wall and point this

out to the controllers.     I then saw the gates displayed on the camera

which I believe are the concertina gates on the service road to the

rear of the South Stand open and a surge of people rush into the

ground.   I said, "The gates have been forced".

It was difficult to estimate how many entered the ground but the gates

wera quickly closed again.     It seemed control was regained with help

of a mounted Officer who put his horse across the gap in the gate.

People however are still being able to climb over the wall into the

ground.   Superintendent MARSHALL again requests the gates to be

opened.   This is a general request.

It is getting close to kick off time.
                                                                 PAGE    9
                                                                 S1852

I can see by the players tunnel a semi circle of photographers

awaiting the arrival of the two teams.

It seems the Superintendent will have to try and prevent the start of

the game as the fans will not all get in but I thought there is no way

anyone can get to the referee or team managers to do this at this late

stage.   As I was thinking this the crowd errupted as a team ran on.

I'va no idea which team as the sound inside the ground transmitted

itsalf outside and frcm what I saw on the monitor control was

difficult outside now.

At this point Superintendent MARSHALL requested the gates to be opened

as there was going to be serious injury or someone killed outside in

the crush if they were not opened.

There was still room on the terrace under the control.    The South

Stand was much fuller but not full.

Superintendent MURRAY was standing with a personal radio in his hand

asking Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD for a decision.

It was evident there existed a tremendous problem for Officers outside

the Leppings Lane entrance.

Chiaf Superintendent DUCKENFIELD was deeply considering the situation.

I recall him thinking aloud words to the effect - if there's likely to

be serious injury or death outside I have no option than to open the

gates - He told Superintendent MURRAY, "Open the Gates".

Superintendent MURRAY gave the general instruction over the radio to

open the gates.

On the monitor I saw the concertina gates open and fans come flooding

in.

The game had started when I looked back onto the playing area.    The

play was at the Penistone Road end.

I became aware of a perimeter track gate being opened and people being

let onto the track out of the pen behind the goal and ushered and
                                                                PAGE 10
                                                                S1852

pointed in the direction of the part where there was still plenty of

space.

The movement seemed orderly but the numbers were building up.

Fans were going onto the track starting to move in the direction as

diracted but then stopping and standing watching the game.

A Policewoman was in control of the gate into the area where there was

space but did not open it.

I thought she probably didn't have a radio or hadn't sensed that she

must open it to let fans into the open areas behind her.

I bagan to sense youths would run onto the playing area so ran out of

the control point, through the uncovered seats onto the perimeter

track and got the gate by the Policewoman open and began directing

fans to the area.   More and more were coming onto the track.   I was

usharing them to the open gate and the Policewoman assisted.

I want behind advertising hoardings to prevent persons encroaching

onto the playing area.

I could see people pushed up against the fence but not aware of any

particular problems or injuries as there is a steady stream of people

onto the perimeter track.

Mora and more people on the track and beginning to move onto the grass

by the goal line.

I sae Superintendent GREENWOOD on top of the fence, having climbed up

and he is gesturing by waving his arms and asking for the game to be

stopped.

It seems by his frantic waves Control are not understanding his

request.   I run to control but by the uncovered seats I meet

Superintendent MURRAY with his hat on running the opposite way.     We

run together to a linesman to get his attention to stop the game.

The linesman ran straight past Superintendent MURRAY.

I chase the linesman shouting him to get the referee's attention to
                                                               PAGE 11

stop the game.

I then see Superintendent GREENWOOD running towards the referee.

There are lots of fans in the Liverpool goalmouth in front of Leppings

Lana Terrace.

I think it is a public order situation.

As they are Liverpool supporters, I run onto the playing area and

protect Nigel CLOUGH in case any Liverpool supporters try to attack

him.

When I am satisfied there is no danger to players I look and see

hundreds of people spilling onto the playing area.   There is quite

clearly in my mind a major public order situation which will need a

large uniform presence to control.

I an in the centre of the playing area, in plain clothes.

There is nothing I can usefully do in a public order context so I

decide to return to the Police Control point.

En route I am passed by uniformed reinforcements as I pass through the

uncovered seating.

On re-entering control roan I learn that persons are suspected of

being injured.

An ambulance is called for and quickly arrives behind the Leppings

Lana goal.

A massage is relayed to Police control that marry people are injured.

As they are not local people, Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD decides

to call out Casualty Bureau staff.

I am directed by Assistant Chief Constable, Mr JACKSON, to call for

Chiaf Superintendent ADDIS and request he cones to Hillsborough.

I fnake the request by telephone to Force Operations Roan as instructed.

I've no accurate assessment of time, but this call should be recorded

on tape in Force Control.   Coins or other items are being thrown at

Police Control in large numbers. In view of the situation


                                                                           2564

         unfolding, 'Operation Support' is authorised.

        All available personnel are deployed in area.

         I suggest I go to Hanmerton Road Police Station and receive Operation

        Support personnel and deploy them from there as directed by Ground

        Control.

        I go to Hairmerton Road Police Station.

        I laave the ground by Leppings Lane and am able to stop Chief

        Inspector SHAW in a marked Police car.    He conveys me to Hammerton

        Road Police Station.

        I change into uniform and act at this location as Incident Comnander.

        Officers are deployed as requested from Ground Control to specific

        areas in makeshift serials.

        I ramain to organise Social Services who have arrived and set up an

        incident enquiry room.

        Relatives and calls are all being dealt with from Harrmerton Road.

        At this stage there is little further which is of benefit regarding

        the series of events under review.

        Subsequent actions by myself involve reception and sympathetic welfare

        of distressed relatives.

        Liaison with Social Services and other support agencies.

        All non contentious but essential facilities to assist Officers at

        I did not directly handle any injured or dead bodies.

           I have been a member of FI Sub Division, for some eight years and

           throughout that time have worked football duties as a Serial Sergeant,

           the Police Room Sergeant and for the last four years have worked as

           the Police Control Sergeant at the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground

           at Hillsborough under the ccmnand of Superintendent FREEMAN (now

           retired) and Superintendent MURRAY.

           I performed this duty for the 1987 (000087) Semi-Final Coventry v

           Leeds, the 1988 (000088) Semi-Final Liverpool v Notts Forest and was

           again in the Control Box for the 1989 Semi Final betoreen Liverpool

           and Notts Forest.   In addition to the three above mentioned games I

           have performed the same duties at ALL the big matches held at

           Hillsborough over the past four years.

           My duties at FI Sub Division are as supervision of Community

           Constables and I share an office with Inspector Sewell.   Therefore I
                                                                    PAGE    2
                                                                    S1743

am very aware of the planning and requirements necessary to Police

matches at Hillsborough.     I have also performed serial duties at all

the other League grounds in South Yorkshire.

On Saturday 15 April 1989, (150489) I commenced duty at 8.00am

(0800) in Ground Control which is situated in an elevated box between

the South and West Stands and which overlooks the Leppings Lane

terraces.

Present at this time was PC1035 RYAN with whom I have worked

this duty for the last four years.    The two other members of the

Control Box team are PC1370 BICHARD and Superintendent MURRAY and the

four of us have worked together for the full season.    There are

specific duties allotted to the members of the Control Box, I control

all the radio messages.    PC RYAN has the tannoy and telephones of

which there are three viz.    Internal club phone, Police phone for

internal and external use and a private phone for external use only.

PC BICHARD is assigned to the video recorders and cameras within the

ground and to the use of a VHF hand set which has direct access to

Force Operations Room.

All the tasks mentioned are interchangeable.

During the early morning Roger Holdsworth tested camera 5 which is on

the West Stand/Leppings Lane terraces due to a fault on the camera.

The picture quality he obtained although was not of normal standard

was acceptable.    Work was also going on on a Tannoy which is situated

on the boundary wall at the rear of the north side of the West Stand.

A test on the tannoy was carried out and it was found to be working

satis factorily.

Othar tannoy tests were made by PC RYAN within the ground and were

found to be in order, one of which was to                the groundsman

He is in the centre circle and the words used to him were to the

effact "      I thought you would have cut the grass by now"
                                                                 PAGE     3
                                                                 S1743

       acknowledged receipt of the tannoy message.   Also in use in the

Control Box is a message book in which any incident during a game

would be noted.

However on Friday 14 April 1989, (140489) I had seen Superintendent

MURRAY who informed me that the Chief Superintendent, Mr DUCKENFIELD

required a specific message book.   I discussed this with

Superintendent MURRAY re an additional officer being present in the

book to log such messages but we came to the joint conclusion that

this was not feasible due to the size of the box and that we would do

the log between us.

On the morning of the 15th I opened the log but it was later taken

over solely by Superintendent MURRAY because of individual duties by

myself and the two others.   All this was very quiet and officers began

to assemble for the briefing at 10.00am (1000).   I believe that I

timad the opening at 0959 hours and ending at 1018 hours.

At 10.00am (1000) PC BICHARD came to the box and at the conclusion

of the briefing Superintendent MURRAY arrived.    I was informed by

Superintendent Murray that many serials were having their meal break

but all would be out on their respective points by 11.15am    (1115).

With that in mind I delayed the test calls to all the Serial Sergeants

and Inspectors.

Prior to 11.00am (1100) a Tango mobile came through stating that

Liverpool supporters were outside the Fox pub in Foxhill Road waiting

for it to open.   I was aware that in the 1988 (000088) Semi Final the

Fox had run out of drink and there was quite a lot of publicity in

local papers about it. Similar with Middlewood Tavern.

At 11.20am (1120) I began radio checks to Serial Sergeants and

Inspectors.   I remember being constantly interrupted during this

check and didn't finish it until approximately 11.45am (1145).

It became apparent that many spectators had arrived early but were in
                                                                 PAGE    4
                                                                 S1743

public houses.   I am aware that the gates at Leppings Lane opened at

11.45am (1145) and there was a trickle of spectators on to the

terrraces, all being behind the Leppings Lane goal in the central pens

with the large majority of these spectators being young persons.

Between approximately 12 noon (1200) and 2pn (1400) there were many

radio messages received and transmitted, most of them being in

relation to fans at public houses and the ones that stand out include

the Royal Hotel on Penistone Road/Bradford Road where Notts Forest

supporters had gathered up to a point where the pub closed because of

the damage being done by supporters.   I believed that Serial 60 had a

lot of contact re this and a number of Tango mobiles attended because

of things getting out of hand.   Traffic was received that the Special

Constables were having difficulty in Neepsend Lane with Forest fans.

Tangos despatched and the matter was resolved.

There was an ambulance call to the White House pub, Halifax Road where

a Liverpool fan had sat on a broken bottle or glass.    Reports were

also received from the Tango mobile to the Wisewood/Wadsley area re

large numbers of Liverpool fans in the Horse and Jockey, Beehive and

Wadsely Jack pubs.

At this stage things were no different to the previous years semi

final.

At an unknown time but certainly after the gates had been opened Chief

Inspector CREASER came into the Control Box and asked Superintendent

MURRAY about the Leppings Lane terraces and it was stated by

Superintendent MURRAY that the standing fans would find their own

levels in the pens rather than trying to fill one pen at a time.

At approximately 2pm (1400) Superintendent MURRAY left the Control Box

in order to see the referee which is normal practice.

He returned around 2.15pm (1415) and was followed into the box by

Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD and the ACC, Mr JACKS®!.
                                                                    PAGE    5
                                                                    S1743

I noticed that the Notts Forest end (Spion Kop and South Stand) were

filling well and coming to capacity but the Liverpool and North, West

Stands on Leppings Lane terraces were COMPARATIVELY empty and I

assumed there should have probably been more people in those areas at

that time.

I did see that the centre pens directly behind the Leppings Lane goal

wera filling quite well but there was ample room in them.    This

observation was mentioned in the box because I believe we all felt

that in comparison to the Forest end, Liverpool seemed empty.

By 2.30pm (1430) PC BICHARD I believe made mention of large crowds in

Leppings Lane outside the ground and on looking upwards at the TV

scraen I saw large numbers of Liverpool supporters outside the ground

which I would estimate at 3-4,000.

Only once before have I seen such numbers and that was when Sheffield

Wednesday played Coventry City in an FA Cup 6th Round match in 1987

(000087) when the Coventry fans came to Sheffield in their thousands.

Around this time radio messages were coming thick and fast and any

timas from this point can only be estimated approximately.

A raquest came from the Leppings Lane end asking for Leppings Lane to

be closed to traffic due to the volume of persons in the road.

The radio system was operating on talk through and at around 2.35 -

2.40pm (1435 - 1440) I received calls that my radio transmissions were

poor and breaking up.    Within seconds of hearing this a civilian

communications officer was at the control and began looking at the

equipment.   He changed the Tulip Microphone for a telephone handset

but the fault remained. After a very short time the back-up set with

the telephone handset with central depression was taken into use by

mysalf. The fixed ariel lead meant that the base station had to be

placed under the desk.    As a result the base station had to remain

under the desk and this meant that the microphone lead would not reach
                                                                   PAGE     6
                                                                   S1743

above the level of the desk top making it difficult to use.      After

only two or three calls with the handset, which were not acknowledged,

I believed that it was faulty and I remember throwing the handset on

to the control desk.     I took a normal hand held radio and from that

time all transmissions were relayed in that fashion.     We were on talk

through so the use of a hand held radio provided the same service.

In view of the above difficulties I asked the Comnunications man to

arrange for the Home Office Engineer to test the equipment on Monday.

2.40pm. (1440)     A call came from Superintendent MARSHALL requesting

that the Leppings Lane gates be opened because of the volume of

persons outside.

Further call from Superintendent MARSHALL asking for gates to be

opened (means Gate C). Stated that people were being crushed against

turnstiles and if gates were not opened someone would be killed.

I rsmember something being said about large numbers of non ticket

holders who would get in and cause serious problems for legitimate

ticket holders.     Mr MARSHALL again came through asking for gates to be

opened.     This was not a request but an order.

Mr MURRAY asked Mr DUCKENFIELD for his decision and he okayed the

gates to be opened.     'C' gate was opened but believed at this time it

had been forced and someone said "They've broke through" I cannot

remember if this was a radio message or said in box.

Mounted officers retrieved the situation and only a few persons got

through.     More manpower deputed to Leppings Lane including mounted.

Mr MARSHALL again asked for gate to be re-opened a second time.

Gates were opened and many more people went through than the first

time.     Would estimate many hundreds went through this time.

Radio traffic heavy and much distortion.

At approximately 2.52pm (1452) Sergeant HIGGINS of 'F' C and V came

through saying "The gates at 'A' have got to be opened as if not
                                                                   PAGE     7
                                                                   S1743

somebody will be killed".     On receipt of that I said words over the

radio,   "If that is the case we have no option open the gates".

The 'A' gate was opened and access to North Stand only was gained.         By

the time 'A' gate opened the gates at 'C' had been closed.

During this time I am unable to say whether it was before or after the

gatas being opened PC1863 BUXTON came through asking for the kick off

to be delayed.     As he said this the Liverpool team took to the field

and I replied    "It's too late one team is already on the field."

I saw that in the Leppings Lane end there was ample room in the pen

nearest the control box and the centre pens appeared full but not out

of the ordinary for a big match of this kind.     I did see swaying in

those pens but again this is a regular occurrence on big match days.

I was not aware that the game had started when a track officer on the

Leppings Lane end came through with an unreadable message.     I then saw

a faw people climbing the fencing in the central pens area to get on

to the pitch and at that time my first thought was     "Christ there's a

pitch invasion".

Within seconds people started coining on to the track via a perimeter

gata, although there was not a large flood.     Even at this stage I

did not realise the enormity of the problem and made comment about a

Policewoman who was on the track serial by Gate 1.     I would have

anticipated that she would have opened this gate to put the persons on

the track back into the outer pen.    Chief Inspector MCROBBIE was in

the Control Box at this time and said words to the effect     "I'll go

and sort it out".

It was about this time that I saw Superintendent GREENWOOD behind the

Leppings Lane goal.     It was obvious he was trying to transmit but

without success.     I saw then he was waving his arms in a cross, across

his body.   Many officers were now on the perimeter track helping

people from the central pens.
                                                                    PAGE    8
                                                                    S1743

It was approximately 3.05pm (1505) when Superintendent GREENWOOD came

through     "Stop the match, Stop the match" and I saw Superintendent

GREENWOOD run on to the field of play.     I didn't see the match stopped

nor the players leave the field.

All personnel were directed to the perimeter track at the Leppings

Lana end.    I recall PC BICHARD going via VHF to Force Control

requesting ambulances - a fleet of ambulances.

Inspector CHARLES 'C' came through requesting deployment of 5 and 50

at his disposal.     I directed him to the tunnel Leppings Lane end to

entar the rear of the terraces.

A request came through for bolt croppers.     I phoned Claywheels Lane

asking for some, to be told there was none.    On completion of the call

I said,     "No bolt croppers," and PC BICHARD said "Shall I get the Fire

Brigade" I didn't answer but just stuck my thumbs up.

Operation Support was requested and I remember a telephone call from

Operations saying "Is it you that's requested Operation Support" to

which I replied, "Yes".

By now there were many hundreds of people on the playing area and it

appeared to be total mayhem.     I saw Chief Superintendent NESBIT by the

goal at Leppings Lane and it was obvious he was in the midst of

organising things in that a tunnel was formed and persons were being

brought on to the pitch.

I saw Police helmets in the rear of central pens making their way to

the front and my thought was     "John CHARLES and his teams".    People

were still climbing the perimeter fencing and many were being lifted

up into the West Stand and my thoughts re the access to the stands was

not one of being rescued from the crowd but getting up there so they

could have a seat.

A Tango mobile which I believe was T.G. came through stating manpower

was required in Leppings Lane outside the ground because of the
                                                                  PAGE    9
                                                                  S1743

numbers of hostile Liverpool supporters and he assisted fire and

ambulance personnel with injured persons.

Throughout this time PC RYAN had been on the tannoy at the Liverpool

end requesting repeatedly that the supporters in the central pens move

back to allow injured persons to be brought from the terraces.    His

pleas appeared to be ignored.

I ramember a sole supporter dressed in a black 'T' shirt run down the

length of the pitch towards the Notts Forest end.   He stopjpjed on the

edge of the 18 yard area and appeared to be gesturing to the Forest

Supporters.   A Police Officer appeared and brought the youth down.

A cordon of Police formed across the central line and was only broken

to allow injured and dead spectators being carried on hoardings

through to the Spion Kop end.   I remember PC2988 BURKINSHAW coming

through on two occasions asking if control had any ideas where a

temporary mortuary could be set up.   In the second occasion I believe

Chief Inspector BEAL came through saying that the gymnasium would be

used.

I would estimate that many hundreds of people were on the pitch most

of whom were being attended to by Police and St John's Ambulance

Personnel and I saw a number being given mouth to mouth resuscitation.

At some stage Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD and ACC Mr JACKSON left

the control, Mr DUCKENFIELD saying words to the effect   "I've got

to go to the boardrocm".

He did return some time later because the announcement that the match

was abandoned had to be made and it had been decided not to say

anything to the crowd so as to enable ambulances carrying the injured

to have a clear run.   I remember Mr NESBIT coming through stating "You

have got to tell the crowd that the match is abandoned and to go” and

it was Superintendent MURRAY who went on tannoy and announced to the

crowd that the match was abandoned.   I cannot remember his exact words
                                                                  PAGE 10
                                                                  S1743

but it started "Please retain your tickets..."     At the end of the

announcement I heard an applause throughout the ground.

Prior to this both Brian CLOUGH and Kenny DAGLISH had been in the

Control and Mr CLOUGH asked certain questions of Chief

Superintendent DUCKENFIELD and stated if there was anything you

want, you know where I am.     Kenny DALGLISH attempted to talk to the

Livarpool fans via tannoy but was unsuccessful and PC RYAN took him

down to the DJ's box where he made an announcement.

The front areas of the centre pens were cleared and I saw what I

thought was part of a barrier having been broken and was lying on the

track.

However, this could have been a piece of hoarding.    The pitch was

finally cleared of the dead and injured and the crowds left the

stadium.

There were isolated reports of fighting between rival supporters in

the Hillsborough Park area but nothing untoward and supporters went

quickly heme.    A message had earlier been passed that the Liverpool

supporters were to be treated with sympathy and understanding.

I remained in the Police Control until approximately 10.30pm (2230)

that evening attempting for much of the time to relay messages to the

Northern General Hospital (officer on duty there PC3082 FLETCHER). I

was then informed I was required to attend a meeting at Headquarters.

On leaving the box I went to the gymnasium where I saw a number of

Senior Officers including the Chief Constable, Mr WRIGHT, plus many,

many officers dealing with the lines of deceased on the gymnasium

floor.     I then saw Chief Superintendent NESBIT and informed him that I

would be going to Headquarters.    He stated that a meeting at that time

of night after such a day was pointless.     I am aware that he sought

the advice of the Chief Constable on this matter and he informed me

the meeting would not go ahead.
                                                                    PAGE 11
                                                                    S1743

I have always held the belief and still do that the SWFC stadium is as

WELL POLICED as any ground in the country and is MUCH BETTER POT.Tran

than most with consideration given to away supporters who on normal

matches are not shepherded into a quiet co me r of the ground nor are

they detained after the match as is the case in many football grounds

throughout the country.

The question therefore is why did such a disaster occur and I can only

put it down to three causes :



a)   Overcrowding in the central pens.

b)   The collapse of a barrier.

c)   The late arrival of the Liverpool supporters.



It will be seen that I have not included the openingofthe gates

because I believe that Superintendent MARSHALL had no alternative

other than to ask than to be opened and the Chief Superintendent who

gava the order obviously and rightly believed that the gates required

to be opened.

One thing does come to mind here and that is stewardsorshould        I say

lack of stewards in the standing areas of SWFC.

From the Control Box it is easy to see around the ground and the

South, North and West Stands are more than adequately stewarded with

the stewards being easily identifiable by their yellow tabards.

Howaver, on the Spion Kop and Leppings Lane terraces there are no

stewards or should I say I have never seen a steward.      Iknow   this

matter has been brought up with the Club inearlier years      and attached

to this report is a typewritten agenda prepared I believe by Inspector

CALVERT when he organised the football duties at Hillsborough.

Certain points on that agenda have been implemented by the Club.

In relation to (a) it is obvious that the supporters used the centre
                                                                          PAGE 12
                                                                          S1743

        tunnel to gain access.     I do not even remember the tunnel gates being

        closed before and the only times a serial manned the tunnel was a few

        years ago when both home and away supporters were allowed to use the

        Leppings Lane terraces and West Stand.     The reason for the Police

        presence was segregation of fans and had nothing to do with safety.

        In relation to (b) and (c) there is nothing I can say except hopefully

        the public inquiry will make their findings known.    When one talks

        about feelings, it is only after the event can one realise the scale

        yet whilst it was happening I felt a feeling of total disbelief

        witnessing the events before my eyes - that this can't happen at

        Hillsborough but with things going on at such a pace I do not believe

        that I had the time to take it all in and the events and incidents I

        have outlined form only a small portion of what took place that

        aftamoon when a minute seemed an eternity and an hour a split second.

        One thing that does remain vividly in my mind is the actions of the

        Police Officers, the Special Constables and the St John's Ambulance

        plus all unknown persons who ferried the dead and injured away from

        the perimeter track.

        I have always been proud of being a member of the South Yorkshire

        Police and I feel humble that I could be associated with those persons

        who performed heroics not just on the field but in the gymnasium, the

        hospitals and the centres for the relatives throughout the night of

        Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489).

           I an a Police Constable with South Yorkshire Police at present

           stationed at Hairmerton Police Station, Sheffield. I am at the present

           tima working beat duties on'B' group but also have responsibility

           operating the static video system which is installed at Hillsborough

           Football Stadium, Sheffield.

           On a personal level I have visited Hillsborough Stadium on many

           occasions as a spectator standing on the terrace at the Spion Kop

           end of the ground and the Leppings Lane terrace.       I have also worked

           in all parts of the ground as a Police Officer during my past 8 years

           service.

           In September 1987(000987) I took over duties relating to the video

           system working from the Police Control Box and since that time I have

           attended a 3 day course in relation to the use of video systems for

           Corrmand and Control and as a method of evidence gathering.      The
                                                                 PAGE     2
                                                                 S822A

original system installed at Hillsborough was laid out as a Command

and Control System giving a basic all round view both inside and

outside the ground.   Whilst I have been involved with the duties that

emphasis has shifted from Command and Control to evidence gathering

and with that end in mind several improvements have been made the most

recant being a survey of the Leppings Lane end camera, the intention

being to move the camera from its present position attached to the

roof of the West Stand and bringing it down to a position just above

the turnstiles. The survey was carried out using a hand held video

camara mounted on the platform of a hydraulic lift.   Two positions

were considered, the first mounted on a pole at the far most com e r of

the Leppings Lane turnstiles the second position just above gate 'B'.

It was decided that the best position would be above 'B' gate.    This

position giving good all around views along Leppings Lane, to the

turnstiles below and the courtyard at the rear of the Leppings Lane

terrace.   The system installer Roger HOLDSWORTH agreed to complete a

costing for the improvements and if the cash was available from

the football trust, he would attempt to install the camera in it's new

position in time for the Semi Final.

Unfortunately the clerical side of this operation could not be

completed quick enough and the planned move for the camera was

suspended until the sumner break. On Saturday 15 April 1989(150489), I

conrmenced duty at 10am(1000) attending at the Police rocm at

Hillsborough, collecting the hand held VHS radio which I used to

to .monitor transmissions via Operations Room. On this particular day

channel 1 had been designated for all VHF transmission relating to the

Semi Final.

Aftar collecting the radio I made my way to the leppings Lane terrace

where I saw that Roger HOLDSWORTH was working on camera number 5

which overlooks the Leppings Lane terrace pens.   The picture quality
                                                                  PAGE    3
                                                                  S822A

had been substandard for a number of weeks and Mr HOLDSWORTH was

carrying out seme last minute alterations to upgrade the picture.

After he had completed the work the picture was indeed better than it

had been although, not up to the correct standard.   I then made my way

to the Control box where I met with Sergeant GODDARD and PC RYAN.

After a brief conversation I began to check the video system operating

each of the five cameras in turn.    We were later joined by

Superintendent MURRAY and it was agreed between us that Sergeant

GODDARD would operate the personal radio, PC RYAN the tannoy and

telephone and I in addition to my duties as camera operator would

monitor the VHF set using it if necessary.   These duties were no

different to what would be carried out on a normal match day.

Around 10.55am (1055) that date, Superintendent CHAPMAN contact

control regarding a group of Liverpool supporters who were waiting

outside the 5 Arches Public House.   There was at this time no trouble

but the information was passed just so that Officer could be aware

that groups of supporters had arrived and were intent on getting a

drink before the match.   Several other personal radio messages were

then received regarding the same topic. About 11.20am (1120) Sergeant

GODDARD carried out radio checks seme personal radios did not reply

and the sector Inspectors were asked to make checks where

appropriate.   Throughout this time various messages were caning in

regarding traffic problems the city side of the ground, Ml motorway,

Parkway, etc, diversions were in force.   This indicated that the

Nottingham supporters were en route in numbers and could be expected

at the ground for the turnstile opening time of 12 noon (1200).

Just after noon(1200) I inserted the 2 VHS video tapes in the two

video recorders.   The time and date system was checked and set

possibly using the ground clock mounted above the North Stand or by a

time check with other Officers in the control box.   The tapes were set
                                                                  PAGE      4
                                                                  S822A

to run at normal speed, ray intention being that around 2.30pm (1430)

the same date I would inset 2 new tapes which would then include the

build up to the match throughout the game and the supporters leaving

the ground.     Around this time it was noticed that persons had entered

the ground.

A short time later it was discovered that seme of the Penistone Road

turnstiles were not manned due to an administrative error this was

corrected by deploying one of the spare serials.     Seme time between

1.00pm (1300) and 2.30pm (1430) there was concern expressed regarding

the Liverpool fans purchasing Kop tickets from touts at Leppings Lane

turnstiles.     This would mean of course that a mixture of fans would

have to be supervised within the Kop terrace.

During this same period problems began arising in various public

houses near to the ground ones that spring to mind were the Horse and

Jockey and the Royal.     The complaints were that fans were drinking

heavily out on the street, urinating in gardens and being a general

nuisance.     Seme time between 1.30pm (1330) and 2.00pm (1400) I began

to notice that on the Kop several Liverpool fans had been placed in

the triangle area near to the North Stand end supervised by several

Police Officers.     I set camera 4 to monitor the situation noticing

that several arrests were made and that manpower was getting low.       I

remembered that there had been seme trouble at last years match in the

same location and I questioned Superintendent MURRAY re the number of

Officers available for deployment on the Kop.

Superintendent MURRAY then contacted Inspector SEWELL regarding the

manpower situation and he confirmed that 2 coaches each containing 40

men would be on standby in Penistone Road.

Around 2.00pm (1400) Superintendent MURRAY and Chief Superintendent

DUCKENFIELD went to speak to the match referee.    Through the afternoon

complaints had expressed regarding the quality of personal radio
                                                                  PAGE       5
                                                                  S822A

transmissions to the control staff.

Around 2.00pm (1400) I overheard on VHF that Liverpool supporters had

been spoken to on a coach which had displayed a Nottingham Forest

supporters parking ticket.   The coach and supporters were spoken to by

traffic officers and advised.

About the same time there was a report of troublesome Liverpool fans

on a coach registered number            This number was circulated and

the coach was checked by one of the mobile serials.     Around 2.20pm

(1420) the ACC JACKSON was in the control box when he noticed a man on

the Leppings Lane terrace south pen.    He dropped his trousers and

began fooling about.   His behaviour was such that it was believed that

he was drunk and the ACC asked for something to be done about him.       I

set the camera to monitor his behaviour.     About 2.15pm (1415) all the

control room staff discussed that it was apparent the Liverpool fans

had not begun to arrive as yet.    The North Stand had vast spaces

although the Leppings Lane terrace was filling up at a normal rate.

Just after this the personal radio transmissions became worse and the

civilian radio repair man came into the control box to attempt a

repair.

About 2.30pm (1430) my attention was drawn to     the   large crowdoutside

the Leppings Lane turnstiles.     I would estimate around 3,000 people

and it was apparent that the number was increasing by the volume of

foot passengers in Leppings Lane itself.                      '

Chiaf Superintendent DUCRENFIELD asked about the large crowd and it’

was said that although it was more than normal, it was no more than

was expected for such a football match.

About 2.35pm (1435) the civilian radio repairman stated that he could

not fix the personal radio system and it was necessary to resort to

using the radios on a back to back system.

About the same time Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD came to the back
                                                                    PAGE    6
                                                                    S822A

of the control box and asked me if the crowd scenes at the Leppings

Lana were being recorded and I replied 'Yes'.

A personal radio on Leppings Lane requested more manpower to Leppings

Lana turnstiles.     Sergeant SORSBY despatched 2 horses frcm the South

Stand car park.

A personal radio message then came in stating that the gates were

being forced, they were bending and buckling.     In my mind I believed

that the gates referred to were 'C' gate and I kept the Leppings Lane

camara set to that sort of area.

About 2.40pm (1440) Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD and

Suparintendent MURRAY requested that I contact Operations Room so that

a traffic car with a PA System could attend in Leppings Lane and

advised the crowd which were by this time becoming apparently more

hostile.     I also remember around this time that Sergeant GODDARD

picked up the personal radio telephone style handset and after trying

to use it, threw it down onto the desk because it was not working and

the personal radio transmissions were very poor.    I can remember

seeing about 5 or 6 officers stood on barrier duty just past the gate

'C' towards the South Stand.

About 2.40pm (1440) I remember seeing 'C' gate open and a number of

supporters enter the ground.    I then said words like 'They've broken

down the gate.' At the same time I indicated to the staff in the

control box to watch the Leppings Lane monitor.    After about 20

seconds I noticed that the gate was closed and it seemed that a

mounted Officer alone had prevented a big rush of people through the

open gate.    I remember seeing mounted Officers trying to clear space

in the crowd.

The request for additional Officers to be sent to Leppings Lane was

mad a to Inspector SEWELL and I remember him offering two Serials, one

of which was the 'F' Division Crime and Vandal, they were directed to
                                                                   PAGE    7
                                                                   S822A

the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

I saw Liverpool fans climbing the walls of the ground onto the

turnstile roofs and I in particular remember several being sat astride

gats 'B' with Police Officers stood below.   I think at this time a

personal radio message was sent regarding the climbers and an Officer

replied that he could not reach them.

Around 2.45pm (1445) I remember a personal radio message from

Suparintendent MARSHALL to the effect 'We must open the gates or

soroaone is going to be killed, please open the gates.'    At this time

Chief Inspector ICROBBIE is in the control box wearing civilian

clothing.

I rsmember seeing an Officer on the top of the turnstiles at Leppings

Lana end and Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD made enquiries as to the

officer's identity.   Another personal radio message was received from

Suparintendent MARSHALL, his voice was very distressed, 'You must open

the gates, open the gates.'   Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD seemed

to pause for thought and then said 'Right if lives are at risk, then

open the gates.'   Sergeant Goddard then transmitted 'Open the gates,

open the gates.'   Just prior to this I remember seeing Officers

behind 'A' gate, they were set out in two lines forming a funnel.

Sergeant HIGGINS of 'F' C&V transmitted on personal radio 'There are

people beng crushed outside 'A' gate we must open 'A' gate.'I remember

that about the time the gates were ordered to be opened mounted

Officers outside Leppings Lane turnstiles had managed to create a void

between the the turnstiles and the outer perimeter railings, in fact,

I balieved that at one time the Officers managed to close the outer

gatas, however, the crowd outside forced its way through the outer

gatas and ran into the ground via 'C' gate at least.      I remember

seeing crowds at the rear of Leppings Lane terrace just behind the

turnstiles, they were just stood about not doing anything in
                                                                  PAGE      8
                                                                  S822A

particular.About 2.55pm (1455) Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD told

control room staff to get some manpower to the North Stand to stop any

possible rush onto the pitch.     It was at this time that we began to

notice Liverpool fans climbing up into the West Stand from the terrace

area.    They were assisted by people in the stand and the same problem

had occurred the previous year.     A short time later fans were seen to

cliTib the perimeter track fence.    Officers on the track seemed to be

telling the fans to get down from the fence.    At this point the staff

in the control box and I thought that the situation was purely public

order.   No information was coming in to the effect that people were

getting hurt.

A crowd gathered on the perimeter track and Chief Superintendent

DUCKENFIELD ordered that they should be moved as quickly as possible

to the wing sections of Leppings Lane terrace where it

could be seen that there was space.     Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD

was angry about Officers stood around the track near to the Kop and

the North Stand.    A personal radio message was sent to the officers

and they were directed to the front of the North Stand. Around this

time Chief Inspector MCROBBIE was sent to the pitch to get things

sorted out.     One problem was a WPC stood on perimeter track just below

the control box.     she did not appear to be moving people off the track

and in fact at one stage opened the perimeter gate to the track then

walked off leaving the gate open.     Chief Inspector MCROBBIE took

charge of the Policewoman and began ushering people from the track.

By this time there were people on the pitch and the perimeter track

gates were open allowing people out of the centre pens.    Still at this

stage no one in the control box was aware that the problem was more

than a pitch invasion situation. Just after the match was stopped ACC

JACKSON was in the control box and he ordered me to contact Operations

Room and call operation support.     It was at this point that I decided
                                                                    PAGE       9
                                                                    S822A

to concentrate on operating the VHF radio rather than the camera

system.     Very suddenly it became apparent that there were injuries and

at that time I contacted Operations Room for ambulances to be sent to

the Leppings Lane end of the ground.       There were people all over the

pitch in front of the goal mouth, persons were laid across the floor

with persons giving mouth to mouth.        It was only then that we began to

feel that there might be deaths.     A personal radio message was sent

to control asking for bolt cutters and Sergeant GODDARD contacted

Claywheels Lane asking if they had cutters on the bri- mac

transporter.     The reply was negative.    He turned to me and I told him

that I would contact the fire service which I did via Operations Room.

I made it clear that we required cutting equipment for the metal

fences.     I remember someone instructing PC RYAN to use the tannqy

telling people to stay calm.      I can remember seeing bodies being moved

towards the tunnel on the Leppings Lane terrace from the centre pens.

I balieve that it was Police Officers who were moving the bodies from

the area.     Liverpool fans who were on the pitch started to run towards

the Kop.     Officers managed to stop the charge and split up several

groups of fans who were fighting.     A line of Officers were then formed

across the pitch just the Kop side of the centre line.       I recall the

firs service arriving at Leppings Lane and their men running onto the

pitch.     I then sent a message to Operations that we did have

fatalities at the ground although when I sent this message no details

had been passed by personal radio.      It was all done from observation.

Further contact from Operations Room regarding the number of

ambulance required and they said would it be more than 20 and I said

something to the effect that we need as many as possible. Traffic

motor cycles were ordered to cover the routes to both hospitals and I

made a request for the senior ambulance officer to attend the control

box.     He did not arrive.   The senior fire officer attended at the
                                                                   PAGE 10
                                                                   S822A

control box and liaised with senior officers and he too asked to speak

to the senior ambulance officer.   Another request was made for that

officer to attend the control box via Operations roan.     About 3.35pm

(1535) I checked the video tapes and discovered that one had stopped

and the second had been switched to operate in the 18 hour mode which

in affect speeds up the action of the scene being recorded, this I

can only think was caught by me whilst standing at the rear of the

vidao control area.   The videos are set at knee height and I believe

that as I leant forward this is how I altered the time mode setting.

I installed two new tapes and set them running at normal speed.

Mr ZL/OUGH and Mr DALGLEISH entered the control box and offered their

services once they had established that the match was off.    Mr

DALGLEISH wanted to speak to the fans and he was asked to use the

tan nay system in the DJs control box below the Police control.

Superintendent MURRAY then later asked for details of transport so

that preparations could be made for emptying the ground.     I remember

seme time after this Superintendent MURRAY saying to PC RYAN that he

wanted a message passing over the tannoy telling the Liverpool fans to

stay calm and remain where they were until the ambulances had left the

stadium. Sanetime later the ground was emptied and around 5.30pm (1730)

I ramoved the video tapes and made my way to the gym to offer

assistance.   I was later sent to HQ with the video tapes and I there

saw Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD, Sergeant BOOTH, ACC JACKSON and

Chief Superintendent DENTON.

About 11.00 (2300) Detective Superintendent MCKAY attended and he

instructed me to return to Hammerton Road, book the video tapes into

the property store and await the arrival of AVA, Sergeant POSTER, was

to attend so that copies of the video tapes could be made.

About 11.30pn (2330) Sergeant FOSTER arrived at Hammerton Road

Police station and I explained the faults on the video tapes.      He
                                                                           PAGE 11

         ask ad if I could get hold of the video recorder used with the 18 hour

        moda setting so that he could transfer the tape action at the correct

         spead.    I then went back to the ground and removed one of the video

        recorders from the Police Control box taking it to Ecclesfield

        Training School where I handed it to Sergeant FOSTER.    My immediate

         suparvisor would be Superintendent MURRAY.    I had no contact with the

         fans before/ during or after the incident.    I cannot relate any

         information regarding the stewarding of the ground and I had no

        contact with the bodies.These 4 pages are not complete but are just a

        resume of the main points of the day.

           I am a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police stationed at 'F'

           Divisional Headquarters, The Common, Ecclesfield.      I have worked

           in this same Division since joining the Police in 1969. (000069)

           I have, during this time, been involved in the policing of

           numerous football matches of all categories at Sheffield Wednesday

           Football Club.    For about the last five seasons, I have worked in the

           ground control located between South and West Stands and have done so

           for the majority of games, including all those of a major nature.

           This control box overlooks the terraced area of the West Stand.

           At 8.00am (0800) on Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489), I commenced duty,

           with PS 616 GODDARD, at the Ground Control at Steffield Wednesday

           Football Club in relation to the Liverpool FC -v- Nottingham Forest FC

           Cup Semi Final.    At the time I carried out certain routine checks,

           including tests of the public address system.      Work was being carried
                                                                    PAGE      2
                                                                    S1754

out on one of the speakers at the rear of the Ground Control by an

engineer.    At his request I tested that speaker.   All appeared in

order.     The cameras in the Control Room were switched on.    A fault was

found on the camera to the lappings Lam/West Stand end (mounted near

electronic score board). The engineer attended and attempted to

rectify this fault.     Only a partial improvement in quality was

obtained and he informed me that this was the best he could achieve on

the day.     The work took probably in the region of an hour.

During this time       I also spoke to Operations Room and 'Dl' Control. I

I advised that we were now operational and checked with them

regarding any reported movement of supporters or any problems or

points of interest there may be.     There was no information of any

consequence. During this time I also spoke with Mr LOCK, the Club's

Security Adviser.

About 9.30am (0930) officers started to arrive in the North Stand and

at 10.00am (1000) the briefing commenced in that location.

About this time we were joined in Control by Police Constable 1370

BICHARD.

After the briefing was completed Superintendent MURRAY attended at

Control.

My duties that day were to mainly deal with the telephones and the

public address system in the Control Room.     Sergeant GODDARD was to

operate the radio, although these jobs would obviously overlap during

the day.    There are three telephones in the Control Room.     One is a

direct outside line; the second an internal SWFC telephone; the third

is an extension from Hammerton Road Police Station.     The public

address system is an extention from that operated by the DJ in the box

below Police Control.     The Police have the facility to override any

transmission.

The ground for this purpose is divided in North, South, West and the
                                                                    PAGE     3
                                                                    S1754

Kop (East).     Facility is provided to speak separately to spectators in

each of these sections or all at the same time.     There is also

facility to speak to the rear of these Stands and turnstile areas.

About 11.15am (1115) the majority of the serials were out from the

briefing/meal. A message from Mr LOCK was passed to the effect that

although turnstiles were not due to be opened until 12 noon (1200),

operators were starting to arrive and seme turnstiles could be opened

at police request.    About this time were the first reports of

supporters arriving by mini bus and cars and attending at local pubs.

The majority of reports at this stage related to the Nottingham

supporters.

At 11.20am (1120) radio checks were ccnmeneed and at this time the

majority of serials were in location.    Coaches were also starting to

arrive.     There were numerous radio and telephone messages being passed

at this stage.

In addition to the radio and Ground Control operating on Channel 25

there was a Club radio giving direct contact to Club officials.      A VHF

set monitoring channel 1 which was the designated channel for traffic

involved in this operation was monitored by PC BICHARD.     Further sets

were available to monitor channel 19, the designated channel for CID

personnel and also channel 35 which was for 'FI' Control.

As time progressed radio and telephone traffic increased and although

it became very busy it appeared about normal for this type of

occasion.    The vast majority of telephone calls received by me were

from Police Officers.     However, a number of members of the public

spoke to me regarding complaints;

Some of these were;

                                                                  S1754

These calls are related to the behaviour of football supporters at

local pubs.

The complaints related to supporters urinating in the street,

footpaths, gardens and other locations in view of residents and the

public, together with other drunken behaviour including throwing beer

glasses and bottles.

These messages were passed to police mobiles in the area for attention

where possible.

As far as I recollect the main pubs involved were;

1.   The Horse and Jockey

2.   The Middlewood Tavern

3.   The Pheasant

4.   The Fox

5.   The White Horse

The vast majority of telephone calls from the public would have been

made to Police Headquarters, Operations Room, or more probably to

local Police Stations.     Members of the public would not normally

telephone direct to the Police Control.

Spectators had been entering the ground steadily throughout this

period.   As far as I recall there had been no major problems at any

turnstiles involving delays or queues.

About 2.10/2.15pn (1420/1415) I looked around the ground and could see

that the Spion Kop and the South Stand were almost full.    These were

the areas allocated to Nottingham supporters.

The North Stand, West Stand and Leppings Lane areas allocated to

Liverpool had still not been filled and there was still room in all

sections of these areas.

From about 2.30pm (1430) number of spectators were growing outside the
                                                                  PAGE          5
                                                                  S1754

lappings Lane end of the ground.     Telephone and radio traffic was

constant at this time.     Radio transmission/reception was very poor.      A

civilian member of the Comminications Department, Andy SANDERSON

attended at Ground Control.

He informed me that he had been monitoring the radio and that there

was a fault and it was necessary to change the radio.    A 'Back Up

Set' was in position in the Control Room.    Andy disconnected the

original set and connected the spare set.     I'm not sure what he did

but throughout this procedure messages were still being received for

the majority of the time, although it was not possible to transmit.

The change over took only a few minutes, possibly three or four.        I

recall that the hand telephone set would not work when Sergeant

GODDARD tried to use it.    Andy checked the radio, there was still no

response.   I told him to switch on the talk through facility.   When

this was done radio ccnmunications were restored by the use of a

personal radio on talk through as an alternative to the hand set.

Throughout this time queues had continued to build up in Leppings

Lana.   It was then that I saw that the turnstiles, the approaches and

Leppings Lane itself were full of supporters as far as I could see on

the monitor.

In my experience I have never seen so large a crowd gather so quickly

so late outside these or any other turnstiles.

I would estimate the numbers as several thousands.     In addition to

this very few people appeared to me to be entering the ground through

the turnstiles.   Radio messages were still constant and at this stage

there were reports of crushing outside the turnstiles.     Extra serials

of officers and mounted section were deployed.    A message was passed

over the public address system for the information of Liverpool

supporters at the turnstiles. I cannot remember the exact words €

used but I asked them to stop pushing; that people were being crushed
                                                                 PAGE        6
                                                                 S1754

and that there was still room in the ground for them to be

accommodated.

This I repeated several times.     It apparently had no effect as reports

wera still being made over the radio of the seriousness of the

situation at the turnstiles.

Whilst this was taking place messages were still being passed by

telephone into the Control Room.

In addition, a number of supporters were climbing directly in front of

the Police Control from the terraces of the Leppings Lane end into the

uncovered seating area of the South Stand.    This was dealt with by

officers nearby deploying along thefront of Ground Control as best as

possible.

During this time requests were made for the turnstiles/gates to be

opened due to the crushing.

'C' gate was at this stage opened, although by whom I do not know.       A

number of supporters entered through the gate before a mounted officer

held back the crowd and the gate was then closed.    A short time later

a radio message was received, I believe from Superintendent MARSHALL,

diracted to Control with words to the effect of 'Open the gates or

someone will be killed'.   I believe that a further similar message

was also passed by a different officer to the same effect, although I

cannot be certain of this or who the officer was.

Chiaf Superintendent DUCKENFIELD, who was in control, then gave the

instruction that the gates be opened and the message subsequently

passed over the radio.

The gates were opened and a large number of the crowd entered.     The

problem at the turnstiles was then apparently eased.     I cannot be

certain of the exact time this happened but I would estimate it at

shortly before the match was due to commence.

I did not particularly notice the game start but play was under way
                                                                   PAGE      7
                                                                   S1754

when supporters started climbing the fences onto the perimeter track

at the Leppings Lane end.

Officers were on the perimeter track and were apparently trying to

prevent this.

T h e m were no more reports of any problems or any indication visible

to tie as to why this should be occurring.    The numbers climbing over

increased and large numbers were spilling onto the playing area.

Instructions were given for the match to be stopped.     This was done by

Suparintendent GREENWOOD going onto the pitch and speaking to the

refaree.

A number of officers had been deployed into the Leppings Lane end from

other parts of the ground.

The gates in the perimeter track were opened and more spectators were

coming onto the pitch.      I only became aware of the true seriousness of

the situation when a radio message was received to the effect that

t h e m were people dead.   This appeared to me to be same minutes after

the game had been stopped.

Instructions were given for operation support to be called.     All

available manpower was directed to the Leppings Lane end of the

ground.     By this stage radio/telephone messages to Control were

constant.    Large numbers of supporters were on the pitch and it was

impossible to see if any injured persons were amongst them.

On instructions from Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD, I passed

messages over the public address sytem, asking that the playing area

be cleared, that supporters move on to the perimeter track, in order

that the injured may be given assistance.

The operation to remove the dead and injured from the ground went on

for some time until, when the last ambulance had cleared the area, the

crodd were informed over the public address system by Superintendent

MURRAY that the game would obviously not continue.      The crowd slowly
                                                                          PAGE    8

         left the ground.   Throughout all this time I remained in the Control

         Root! and did so until our job was completed at 10.30pn (2230)

           My day began in Headquarters at 0800 hours.       From there we transported

           some radio equipment to Hillsborough, this being spare equipment to be

           left in the Police Control Room.    On completion of taking this

           equipment into the control room, I attended the briefing.       On

           completion of the briefing I remained in the area of the gymnasium,

           where the issue of the radios was being conducted.       My responsibility

           on the day was to make myself available in case of communication

           problems.     I was in possession of a radio with an ear receiver for the

           whole duration of the day.

           At around 1400 hours I began to hear the radio breaking up.          At first

           I assumed it to be interference but when it continued intermittently I

           made my way over to the control room accompanied by Chief Inspector

           BEAL.   This being around 1420 hours to 1430 hours.

           On arrival at the Police control room I first changed the 'tulip'

                                                                                           2597

                                                                    S1516

microphone for a 'hand phone/first mic' taken from the spare W15U

'Base Station.' The fault continued, so during a 'stop' in

can.manications I plugged in the spare W15U 'Base Station' to the mains

supply and changed over the aerial connection.

The fitted 'Base Station' had been working on 'talk through'. This is

a ground to ground radio facility, so one radio can communicate to

another radio.    Therefore I switched the spare 'Base Station' to 'talk

through', giving exactly the same communication as the fitted 'Base

Station.'

The spare 'Base Station' was situate on the floor underneath the

bench.   The box containing the spare 'Base Station' has a physical

size of 27"x 11"x 11" high by 11 inches deep, the mains lead and

and aerial lead are only of sufficient length to connect to

the spare 'Base Station' in situ and therefore I was unable to place

it on top of the Control Rocm bench.     This in turn meant that the

first mic/ hand phone, which is connected by a curly lead, only just

cams about the level of the bench    and the operator   was obliged tobend

down to use it.     The loud speaker to the spare'Base Station' is

incorporated into the set and therefore reception was at floor level.

A hand held Motorola personal radio was therefore used by the operator.

This enabled him    to stand upright to transmit, the reception wasvia

the loud speaker    in the hand held radio itself and it gave the

control room equal opportunity for transmission.

The time was now about 1448 hours.     After checking the system was

working correctly I left the control room but remained at the bottom

of the steps by the gate, where I stayed for the rest of the afternoon.

Many messages were coming over the radio, I ranember the request to

open the Leppings Lane gate.    That being around 1450 hours, I also

remanber a request to delay the game, as there was still a large crowd

outside (Leppings Lane end). Time unknown.      After 1500 hours I
                                                                           PAGE    3

         ranamber someone asking for bolt cutters and a request for a mortuary

         to be set up.   By this time I was helping in the direction of

         ambulances at the south end of the stadium, by the control room and

         the removal of casualty out of that gate.

         Surrmary

        At 1400 hours approximately commoncations began to break up.      At around

         1430 hours after the radio 'Base Station' was changed, to the best of

        my knowledge the radio system was working and remained working for the

        duration of the day and is still working today as checked by Inspector

        WOOQHEAD, 4.5.89 (040589) and Home Office Directorate of

        Telaconmunications Technicians.

           On duty Incident Room at 10.00 am re semi-final, Police Constable

           Jonas and Waugh working with me in Incident Rocm manning radio.      On my

           arrival they were busy booking traffic vehicles on duty and there were

           no problems at that stage.    On my instructions they created an

           extended incident on the Corrmand and Control so that we could put on

           any matters relating to the semi-final and analyse it afterwards.

           This was done by transferring a message put on by F Division earlier

           that week.    FI were informed the incident became EL 2 on the extended

           incident.

           By 1300 hours there was a lot of congestion on the roads and the

           motorway but by 1415 hours this was cleared and all motorway routes

           had very little football traffic.    I remember everyone commenting that

           things were going well and that traffic seemed to have arrived much

           earlier that last year.    Most of the routes to the ground were clear
                                                                  PAGE     2

by 2.30 pm there was certainly no hold up for Liverpool supporters the

only hold ups had been through Attercliffe and City where the Notts

For ast supporters had come.    I remember Superintendent Brougham coming

over the radio about 2.40 pm saying that all the routes to the ground

wera clear and motorcyclist wanting to go in for meal early.     They

wera told to stay out mainly because it was said that meals would not

be ready.   In any case they carried on checking their own sections

until about 2.55 pn.     As far as I am concerned there were no unusual

problems with traffic it went very well.     The motorcyclists and all

officers engaged in getting people to the ground did a first class

job.   There was never any suggestion that fans were held up because of

problems on the roads.

All the time we had been monitoring Hillsborough Ground Control on

channel 25 via a repeater set in the Incident Room.     I recognised

Police Sergeant Goddard as the main operator at the ground and on

occasions Superintendent Murray used the radio.     Up to 2.15 pm the

recaption was good and there were no unusual problems.     Then for the

next 20-25 minutes the radio was very poor it broke up and there was a

loud whistle.    It was obvious they were having problems with the radio

in fact I remember saying they were having problems over Force Control

radio and we asked if they needed ccnmunications people to help.

Ground control said they were present and trying to fix it.     After

that time it was much improved back to the good reception we had heard

earlier that day.   This would be about 2.40 pm and after that

the reception was clear.     I heard Superintendent Marshall saying to

match control that he had a large crowd outside the Leppings Lane end

of the ground.    I think he asked for more horses but I'm not sure

whether match control got in touch with any.     I do not know that they

askad us via Force Control for a vehicle with a PA System to go to

Leppings Lane because there was a large crowd pushing and they feared
                                                                   PAGE     3

somaone would be hurt.     We did send a car but when he got there he

radioed back that there was a car with a PA already there.       It was

mora and more apparent listening to the match control radio that the

crowd a Leppings Lane were causing extreme problems for the officers.

I remember someone asking for the kick off to be delayed.     I don't

knotf who that was but the reply from match control was that there was

no chance as one of the teams already out.     It must have been about 2.

50 pm by this time.     Superintendent Marshall then asked for the gates

to be opened as he feared for the safety of all the people at Leppings

Lana.    He said they were obviously very noisy and unruly.   I think

other persons asked for the gate opening but I can't say who.      I was

convinced by what I heard that people would be hurt so I asked my

staff to contact match control and ask then if they needed any

ambulances.    They said not at that stage but we were to keep

monitoring the radio.    This was about 3.00 pm at the time and I heard

Police Sergeant Goddard in ground control say 'open the gate we do not

want anyone killed'      I am sure these were more or less his exact

words.   This was done and after a minute Superintendent Marshall told

Match Control that the situation outside had eased and that the gate

was closed.

I could then hear the officers at the ground saying persons were

injured and I told Police Constable Rook in the Operations Rocm to

ring the ambulance service and warn them of possible major casualties.

Within a minute we were requested to get a fleet of ambulances and we

did via the ambulances service who were still on telephone to

Police Constable Rook.     I then activated the Major Incident plan and

we started to activate the casualty bureau etc.

            Further to my previous statements regarding the events on Saturday 15

            April 1989 (150489). At 1506 hrs I was in the Major Incident Room at

            Force Headquarters when a message was received over XS radio from

            Hillsborough ground control asking for Operation Support to be

            implemented.

            I haard this message and immediately PC JONES who was the radio

            operator gave out this message over the Force XS radio channel 1 to

            all available officers. I went into the main Operations Roans and

            instructed the channel 2 operator to do the same which he did.

            Various officers and groups of officers who had heard the radio

            broadcast responded giving their call signs and were told to go

            inmadiately to the ground.
                                                                         PAGE   2

        I instructed Inspector JACKSON to implement Operation Support to the

        rest of the Force and he completed a set format on the Command and

        Control Computer. He asked whether it had been authorised by the ACC

        Operations and we immediately went over the radio to ground control

        who replied that the ACC was present and had authorised it.

        The Computer message switch was sent via the command and control

        system to all Sub-Divisions of the Force at 1510 hrs. This was done on

        a priority message which generates visual and audible warning in the

        Sub-Divisional controls. This is an indication to them that their is a

        priority message which requires immediate attention.

        Aftar the message had been sent it was established from ground control

        that the rendezvous point was the Police room at the ground. This was

        sent at 1513 hrs by Inspector JACKSON on a separate message switch.

        Sub-Divisionl controls are asked on the format to enter on the

        incident log details of officers attending the rendezvous point and

        this was done by numerous controls which entered details on the

        extended incident No. 2

           ARTHUR WILLIAM JACKSON

           POLICE INSPECTOR

           FORCE OPERATIONS ROOM



           On Saturday, 15 April 1989 (150489), I was the Duty Inspector in the

           Force Operations Room, working from 2pm (1400) until lOpn (2200).       On

           coircneneing duty I was aware that the Major Incident Room situated just

           off the main Operations Room was manned and was controlling events in

           relation to the football match at Hillsborough.     Chief Inspector

           EDMUNDSON was in charge of the Incident Room and I had no duties in

           respect of the event.

           At about 1506 that day, Chief Inspector EDMUNDSON came into the

           Operations Room and instructed me to implement Operation Support in

           respect of crowd problems and injuries at the football match.     I

           imrediately brought up on the Command and Control System the pre­

           formatted message and I then asked Chief Inspector EDMUNDSON if the

           implementation had been authorised by an officer of Assistant Chief

           Constable rank as instructions require.   Whilst completing the format

           details, I heard Chief Inspector EDMUNDSON query with ground control

           who replied that the ACC (Operations) was present and had authorised

                                                                                        2606

         it.    Again, whilst completing the format, I queried the rendezvous

         point, but was unable to clarify it at that stage.   Once completed I

         despatched the Operation Support message forcewide at 1510 hours

         (1510), giving it an 'E' emergency coding which means that the message

         generates a visual and audible warning at receiving sub-divisions

         indicating the presence of an incaning priority message.

        At 1513 hours (1513) I ascertained that the rendezvous point was to be

        the police rocm at the ground and despatched another priority message

        giving that information.

           On Saturday, 15 April 1989 (150489) I was on duty re the Semi-Final in

           the Incident Room next to Operations Room.   Police Constable 1176

           JONES was with me from 0600 hours (0600) that date and we were joined

           at approximately 10.00am (1000) by Chief Inspector EDMUNDSON.

           Police Constable JONES was manning the radio controlling traffic

           mobiles engaged in overseeing the arrival of supporters via major

           roads and the motorways. On the instructions of Chief Inspector

           EDMUNDSON I was updating the extended incident log on the Conmand and

           Control System.

           Throughout the morning and dinner time period we had a lot of

           congestion on the roads but by approximately 1400 hours (1400) this

           had all but cleared and everything seaned to settle down and go

           smoothly and we had no major hold ups anywhere.    I remember several

           mobiles asking to go into meal and this was refused.
                                                                  PAGE      2
                                                                  S3862

Whilst engaged on our duties on channel 1 VHP we were also monitoring

Hillsborough Ground Control on channel 25 via a repeater set.

PS 30DDARD was the main operator at the ground.     I think that it is

important to say that this radio was not being monitored constantly by

officers in the Incident Room in fact most of the time it was turned

down low (volume) as PC JONES had difficulty hearing transmissions

from his mobiles if channel 25 was on at a normal setting.

I could hear various transmissions on channel 25 and at approximately

2.40pm (1440) I heard a supervisory officer whan I did not know

talking to PS GODDARD saying he had a large crowd outside the Lapping

Lane end of the ground.     He asked for more officers (Mounted I think)

and a vehicle with a PA sytstem to stop people pushing.     I believe one

was directed to the scene.

Transmissions on channel 25 were getting more frequent from this time

and you could hear the sound of a large crowd noisily in the

background.   I heard the same supervisory officer ask severed times

for a gate to be opened at Leppings Lane.     Each time he asked he was

more insistent and he stated finally that the gate had to be opened or

else people would be fatally injured.    The sounds of the crowd seemed

to suggest this as well.     It was apparent that this officer was in the

centre of the crowd.    I then contacted ground control over channel 25

(I think) or it may have been the telephone line to their ground

control office, to see if any ambulances were required at the scene,

it was so noisy and unruly over the radio that injuries were a

definite possibility.     I was informed by PS GODDARD that ambulances

wera not required at this time.     I cannot remember the time exactly

but it would be about 3.00pm (1500).

Various messages were being passed on channel 25 and I heard an

officer state that numerous people were injured and a request was made

for a fleet of ambulances.     I told Chief Inspector EDMUNDSON of this,
                                                                            PAGE     3
                                                                            S3862

         he was half way through the connecting door to Operations Room, and

         then I contacted ambulance control by direct line and made the sane

         request using the same words.    I was informed that the usual response

         would be sent.   On termination of that call someone at the ground

         requested Operations Support.

         Mr EDMUNDSON was informed and I was then engaged in various duties in

         relation to what we thought was a crowd disorder and were directing

         officers to the ground, motorcycles to cover hospital routes etc.      At

         seme stage we knew we had fatalities, we thought in the region of

         single figures, we even commented if the gams would continue.     We

         spoke of this because if the game was cancelled we had the job of

         seeing to the crowds leaving the ground.     We were then informed the

         game was off and the crowd leaving.     PC JONES and myself then arranged

         traffic cars to assist in this task.     This we were engaged in for the

         rest of our tour of duty along with assisting in all the other

         arrangements. My tour of duty ended at 7.30pm (1930).       I have read a

         transcript which implies that PC ROOK (2554) contacted ambulance

        control.   At that time I had no knowledge of this and I also contacted

        the ambulance control specifically requesting a fleet of ambulances

        and I received a reply from the female operator, you will get our

        normal response, one ambulance.       I do not know any person by the name

        of Alf.    I am not know by this name.    At no time as far as I can

        recollect did I contact the Fire Brigade.

           Police Constable 1176, Force Operations Room.

           On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489), I was on duty in the Major

           Incident Room at Police Headquarters, and was deputed to work the

           radio within that office to control Traffic mobiles in connection with

           the semi-final.

           At 1506 hrs I received a radio message on Channel 1 VHF from the

           Hillsborough Ground Control, for Operation Support to be implemented

           at Hillsborough.    At this time Chief Inspector EDMUNDSON was in the

           Major Incident Roan, he also heard this message and took

           action on its receipt.

           I then made a broadcast on Channel 1 to the effect that Operation

           Support had been requested, and that all available mobiles should

           attend at Hillsborough.   As mobiles answered this call I directed

                                                                                         261 1

           I am a Police Officer in the South Yorkshire Police presently

           stationed in the Force Operations Room, Headquarters.

           On Saturday, 15 April 1989 (150489) my duty was 6.00am (0600) to

           6.00pm (1800) in the Operations Room, Headquarters. As a result of an

           incident at Hillsborough Football Ground I was instructed by Chief

           Inspector EDMUNDSON to contact the Ambulance Service Control Room.

           At 1507 (1507) I contacted the Ambulance Service Control Room by use

           of the direct line in the Force Operations Room. I informed the

           Ambulance Control Room Operator that an incident had occurred at the

           Leppings Lane end at Hillsborough Football Ground, that there may be

           casualties and ambulances may be required. This was not an actual

           request but just an advance warning. At 1508 (1508) whilst still on

           the telephone I was instructed that a fleet of ambulances was required

           at Hillsborough and I conveyed this information to the Ambulance

                                                                                    2613

                                                                             S3106

          Service Control, speaking on some occasion to Superintendent CLARK.

          The conversation continued as follows

          Supt. CLARK       "We'll send an initial response and assess."

          PC ROOK           "All the ambulances you've got available they said."

          Supt. CLARK       "We can't do that - emergency response."

          At 1511 (1511) I contacted Ambulance Control via the direct line and

          again spoke to Superintendent CLARK and explained that there are

          possibly hundreds of people injured and that we, the Police, had

          initiated Operation Support to raise further manpower to the ground.

          Supt. CLARK       "We are responding."

          I then went into the Incident Room and assisted there throughout the

          afternoon, logging incidents onto the Incident Log on Command and

          Control. I retired from duty at 1930 hours (1930).

          The speech I have referred to is as direct quote from the Racal Tape

          transcript which has been produced by Chief Inspector EDMUNDSON.

           PC1374   Operations Room

           On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489), I was on duty in the Operations

           Room at South Yorkshire Police Headquarters, Sheffield.        I was deputed

           to work Force Radio Channel 2 to control Road Traffic mobiles,

           Divisional Response Cars and other departmental mobiles not involved

           with the semi final at Hillsborough.

           Just after 1506 hrs Chief Inspector EDMUNDSON came from the Major

           Incident room and advised that Operation Support had been implemented.

           I then made a broadcast on Channel 2 to the effect that Operation

           Support had been requested and directed all available mobiles to

           attend at Sheffield Wednesday F.C. Hillsborough.

              In connection with the above event I came on duty at 9.30 a.m.

             (0930). My specific area of reponsibilty was sector 2B under the

             comnand of Superintendent MARSHALL.      I was in charge of serials 34-51.

             excluding 44, 46, 47, and 48. whose Inspectors were Townend, Ellis,

             Meek, Morton and Robinson.   Serials 34-35 were performing coach

             recaption for Liverpool fans in Claywheels Lane.      Serials 36-37 were

             public order/train reception units at Wadsley Bridge Station.        Serial

             38 was involved in mini bus reception on Wardsend Road, whilst serials

             39-40 were responsible for coach reception in Halifax Road.        Serials

             41, 42 and 43 were public order patrols in Halifax Road and finally

             serials 49, 50 and 51 were mobile units operating in the Foxhill,

             Parson Cross and Grenoside areas.

             Due to the fact I was supervising these officers on foot, my basic

             area of deployment was from the Leppings Lane roundabout to the top of
                                                                  PAGE    2
                                                                  S1360

Halifax Road near to Chaucer School, including the designated streets,

Claywheels Lane and Wardsend Road.

The last semi final I worked at Hillsborough was during the season

1980-81 (000080 - 000081) when Wolves played spurs.   However since

that time I have worked numerous games at this ground.    Additionally

I have been in charge of games at Barnsley during a 2 year period in

that Division. During the last 12 months I have been responsible for

the planning and policing of matches at Brairmall Lane.   In essence

therefore I have considerable experience in the policing of football

matches. On the day in question some pubs in my sector were open but

they were adopting a back door selection policy.   Clearly these

pubs appeared full but to the best of my knowledge none of my

officers attended at any licensed premises in response to calls for

assistance. On my routine patrols in Halifax Road I saw numerous fans

who had clearly been drinking but none of whan could be described as

drunk enough to arrest.   One is bound to record that the Gateway

Supermarket at Kilner Way, Wads ley Bridge, did enormous business in

the sale of intoxicants prior to the kick off at 3.00 p.m. (1500).

The mood of some of the fans I saw was boisterous and loud, but not

unlike the vast majority of football fans every Saturday of the

season.   The only difference being their numbers were greater.

The escort of fans from Wads ley Bridge Station to the ground was

carried out efficiently and effectively with the valuable assistance

of the Mounted Branch.    I gave my officers strict instructions to

leave the Liverpool supporters under no illusions that having arrived

in Sheffield they were to behave themselves. I instigated selective

searches of certain supporters. It was evident that they were not

used to such positive policing, many of the fans asking why we were

searching them etc.   In my experience this is unusual as currently

most fans expect such actions from the Police.
                                                                  PAGE    3
                                                                  S1360

After supervising the above officers I returned to Halifax Road to

oversee the continuing arrival of Liverpool coaches.     I was,

therefore, unaware of the size of the build up of Liverpool supporters

in Lappings Lane.

At approximately 2.55pm (1455) I was in Halifax Road near to the

Wadsley Bridge Station when due to the tone of radio messages

ananating from Match Control I took all the available personnel and

attended at the Leppings Lane end of the ground where I reported

initially to Superintendent Marshall.   We were unable to contact Match

Control and so in company with Chief Inspector Waring who had by this

time joined me, we attempted to make Leppings Lane a sterile area to

enable the emergency services to enter the ground.

In the interim period in company with other officers I assisted the

injured to waiting ambulances and ensured the safety and sanctity of

about 10/12 bodies which were lying outside the turnstile area

adjacent to the river.    I did not handle any bodies.   The match was

then abandoned and our task then was to placate fans obviously in

a state of shock and make a sympathetic attempt to advise them to

leave the scene.    Officers were subjected to violent and horrific

verbal abuse from many fans, but to their credit the majority of

officers were professional and sensible in their attitude.

Radio commmication initially appeared to be satisfactory, however

shortly before 2.30pm (1430) my own set began to become distorted and

but for the events thereafter I would have certainly either

changed the radio or the batteries.

During the tragic events after 3.00pm (1500) there was seme radio

traffic but in the noise and confusion I could not distinguish what

was being said or by whom.

Due to my duties on the day I am unable to comment on the actions of

the stewards.
                                                                          PAGE

         Whilst it is evident that a large number of Liverpool fans were still

         walking down Halifax Road shortly before 3.00pm (1500) this in itself

         is not unusual.   My experience in these matters told me that this

         happens at nearly every ground in the country.    Providing they are

         sober, tolerant and in possession of tickets, problems are usually

        minimal.

           On Saturday, 15 April 1989 (150489), I was on duty in company with

           other officers involved in duties at the FA Cup Semi Final football

           match at the Hillsborough Stadium between Liverpool FC and Notts

           Forest FC.    I was responsible for Serial 34, a serial which contained

           eight Police Constables.

           At 1000 we all attended a briefing in the ground's North Stand.         At

           1100 Serial's 34 and 35 were briefed by our Serial Comnander,

           Inspector Townend.

           At 1115 our two serials took up positions on Claywheels Lane, there I

           instructed my serial in their duties which were to instruct each

           individual supporters's coach which arrived to drive to the far end

           of that lane and return and park for an easy exit facing out of

           Claywheels Lane.     Each bus was then parked in convoy along the

           nearside kerb.     My serial then met the supporters on each coach,

                                                                                          2620
                                                                    PAGE    2
                                                                    S2302

welcomed them to Sheffield, informed them that they were to leave any

prohibited articles on the bus, informing them that they would be

searched on entering the ground and requesting them to make their

way to the ground as soon as possible.     I myself carried out a

number of these warnings, they were done in a friendly manner and

responded to warmly by the supporters.     The buses which arrived

eventually filled the whole of Claywheels Lane.     In my view this

section of supporters although it was apparent that they had been

drinking, they were well behaved and in good spirits.

At 1345 Claywheels Lane was completely full of supporters buses and PC

3234 Cobb informed me she had recorded a total of fifty - two buses

and two mini buses at this location.

At 1425 we were further deployed to the junction of Claywheels Lane

with Penistone Road North/Halifax Road.

We positioned ourselves outside the public house situated on that

corner, named the Gate Public House.     Our duties were defined as

supervising the arriving fans who were walking down Halifax Road

towards us.

I instructed my serial to form a filter lane of officers along this

pavanent and the pavement on the opposite side of the carriageway and

requested them to inform any supporters arriving at their location

that alcohol drinks should be left at that location.    As I arrived at

this location and took up this point I could see a

good distance up Halifax Road and as far as the eye could see I saw

that there was a continuous flow of Liverpool supporters in groups

approx. ten abreast on both sides of the carriageway caning towards.

The majority of these were males in the lower age bracket, it was very

apparent to me that a large amount of alcohol had been consumed by the

vast majority of these men.

A large number of them were still drinking on their way towards the
                                                                 PAGE      3
                                                                 S2302

ground and a large number of them were halted and asked to leave their

intoxicants at this location.   Some of them left their drinks, others

insisted on consuming them at this location.   These drinks consisted

of a variety of canned beers and lagers, bottles of wine bottles of

sherry.   The whole of the wall outside The Gate public house became

heavily littered with these objects.

Generally these supporters were all of good behaviour, they were drunk

but not incapable or unduly disorderly.   It was apparent to me, from

the time I commenced my position at this location, how late these

thousands of drunken Liverpool supporters had left it to go to the

ground in such a mass hoping to get into the ground before the

carmencement of the game.   Having personal knowledge of the distance

to the Leppings Lane end from my location I knew that there was little

likelihood of them being there for the kick off.     I felt it hard to

understand why these persons should travel so far to allegedly support

their team and then, a) leave it far too late to get to the ground and

b) be in such a drunken condition so as to not be able to fully

appreciate the match when they obtained admission.    This heavy mass of

persons continued without any significant gaps appearing until

about 1510.

At 1455 I went with other officers to The Gate public house as a

result of a report of fighting inside.

These premises were locked and entry was gained with some difficulty.

Upon entering the lounge I saw that it was full of football supporters

supporting red and white colours.   The atmosphere was hostile and the

persons present, a lot of them were heavily drunk.    The landlord was

approached and the persons present were requested to leave the

premses and the Landlord was requested to close the bar.

I ascertained that there had been a fight inside these premises where

stools had been thrown, the fight was between different supporters
                                                                 PAGE     4
                                                                 S2302

groups.     No injuries were apparent, no complaints were received, a

number of Liverpool supporters had to be physically removed from the

area as they were wanting to return inside the Public House and

perhaps cause further disorder.

Our serial then returned to its static point and continued to marshall

the supporters.    The passage of fans had now thinned but there was

still a number of Liverpool fans still making their way to the ground.

About 1508 I was with PC 106 Goss, I returned to the lounge of The

Gat a public house, my intention was to speak to the Landlord to

request him to arrange the removal from the wall outside of all the

'empties' which were potential missiles.

Upon entering the public house a further fight commenced between rival

supporters who were in a drunken state, they were separated and the

situation remained hostile so I summoned the assistance of further

officers.    We then ensured that this public house was cleared of all

these persons.     I was able to speak to a number of these persons who

assured me that they had tickets and intended to attend at the game.

About 1515 we were able to resume from these premises, the street

outside was now relatively quiet and we liaised with our Commander,

Inspector Townend.

I can recollect during this period, prior to and whilst we were

dealing with these incidents at this public house, listening to radio

traffic on my personal radio, the messages were such that I felt that

scrrething frightening was taking place at the Leppings Lane end of the

ground.     I can recall a request being made to delay the game being

denied and an officer calling on a number of occasions to please open

the gate and this caller was obviously in fear that if the gate

ranained closed, persons would be injured.

We then proceeded along Penistone Road to the ground, entering via the

large gates adjacent to turnstiles 77-78.     It was there that I saw two
                                                                 PAGE      5
                                                                 S2302

ambulances parked in the co m er close to the comer of the Spion Kop.

T h e m were two persons being deposited beside these ambulances and I

saw that an attempt was being made at chest massage.   I observed that

this failed to revive this person.

We were then directed to the pathway into the Spion Kop and it was

t h e m that I was approached by a number of Notts. Forest supporters

who offered their services.

With members of our serial, I then went with these volunteers to the

passageway between the North stand and the Spion Kop and it was there

where I saw total chaos, a number of bodies were being carried up that

passageway towards the gymnasium area by an assortment of supporters

and emergency personnel.

At this, I instructed my officers to follow me on the playing area,

there I was confronted by the sight of the whole of the playing area

literally covered with the bodies of the dead and injured.    There were

large numbers of persons also present on the ptich who were assisting

in attempting to revive these persons.   Police Officers were

fully involved in this and in my view all of them did their duty.     We

assisted carrying a large obese young Liverpool supporter into the

area underneath the North Stand adjacent to the gymnasium.    With PC

2375 Turner, we tried in vane to revive this man.   The area around me

was total carnage, littered with the bodies of dead and dying.

Literally hundreds of non - injured supporters were cluttering the

area and making it difficult for the emergency services to operate.        I

then returned to the pitch with PC Turner and as we passed under the

corner of the North Stand, it rained human spit onto us.     Looking up,

I saw hundreds of hostile young men shouting abuse and spitting in

our direction.   I don't know how many bodies we carried past this

location but I   recall that the spitting seemed to be present

throughout. The area beneath the North Stand adjacent to the gymnasium
                                                                  PAGE     6
                                                                  S2302

soon became full of bodies and injured prsons. There was a period

where we had to remove bodies of the deceased from a spot directly

undameath the rear of the North Stand, this was due to persons in

that North stand urinating up there and large amounts of it were

flowing out of the stand onto the bodies of the deceased.

Shouts from myself and other officers merely resulted in the flow of

urine increasing,

I was then requested to assist in the removal of all deceased from

this location into the gymnasium itself,     ffost of these persons were

laid upon wooden advertisement boards, these boards were too large for

the doorway, we had to physically lift each deceased person by their

arms and legs and carry them into the gymnasium.     There was no time

for any ceremony.   The dead had to be carried like the carcases of

dead animals.

This area was still heavily congested with grieving relatives

searching for their friends and family.    The whole situation was not

progressing, difficulty was being experienced in moving injured from

this location to parked ambulances nearby.

Inspector Barker took charge of this situation, I was delegated to

arrange a cordon line across the natural gateway into the area

underneath the stand.

With difficulty, the area was send, cleared of unnecessary persons.

The sterile area we hoped to create was under constant pressure by

persons approaching our cordon, the majority of them I sensed were

truly grieving and upset and confused, looking for their friends and

family.   A lot of them were not helped in their grief by them being

drunk.    The officers on this line were placed under a tremendous

strain for a number of hours, having to cope with the physical and

mental abuse aimed at them by these relatives.

We understood their grief.   We understood their need to know if their
                                                                  PAGE     7
                                                                  S2302

lavad one was inside, we understood their frustration, it didn't help.

They expected that we would have a list of the dead and expected us to

allow everyone of than to freely wander past our cordon

to search for their loved ones.    We explained to them the position

that to allow anyone past the cordon at this time who was not there

for the purpose of saving lives could prevent such lives being saved.

This gained a mixed reaction, seme persons accepted our sound advice

but others physically fought to get through the lines and had to be

repelled.

Throughout my period on this line, constant comings and goings took

place involving the injured.     Their exit was severely hampered by the

selfish attitudes of a number of these Liverpool supporters.     I was

shocked as the day wore on by the look of horror and revulsion upon

the faces of a large number of Police officers who visited this

location.

At 1730 I was able to arrange a short break from the cordon for myself

and three members of my serial, having that short period of time out

of the view of the public gaze, allowed me private thoughts.     I was

unable to understand what had happened and for a short while my

emotions got the better of me.

At 1735 we returned to being Policemen again, our personal feelings

were put aside, and we returned to the line and continued our duty.

The constant barrage from grieving relatives continued, arrangements

were made for them to be transported via bus to Hammerton Road Police

Station, this seemed to assist the situation, relatives were at least

able to find someone who could possibly assist them.

However, it should be noted that prior to this, an Inspector had set

up a table outside our line and this had assisted us because we had

beea able to direct all such enquiries to him.     This did diffuse the

sitution to a certain extent.
                                                                         pas:    8
                                                                         S2302

        We remained in situ at this cordon until being relieved at about 1815.

        We then re-grouped at Claywheel Lane Police Garage and we were

         transported back to Doncaster and then Mexborough.

         Between 16 and 21.4.89 (160489 and 210489), with PC Turner, we have

        been deputed to carry out Welfare visits to a number of officers who

        have been unable to face work and also speak with officers on duty.

        They have all suffered not only from Saturday's events but from the

        totally biased press coverage.   Not only these officers but a number

        of their wives have been subjected to verbal criticism.

        My thoughts return to this event, I can recall that the personal

        Burndept radio I was issued with was totally unsuitable in a crowd

        situation.

        Turned on full in normal conditions I was unable to hear correctly the

        radio transmissions.

        When we went into The Gate public house, I was unable to hear any

        radio traffic.

        Upon entering the ground then the radio was useless.

        I can also now recall that during the time I spent on the playing

        area, a Liverpool supporter coming up to me and saying words to the

        effect that we had fucked up their chances of getting back into Europe

        I can also now recall assisting 2 PCs in the restraining and arrest of

        a Liverpool supporter who was trying to climb the fence into the Spion

        Kop and get at the Notts Forest supporters.

2.45pm (1445)   Fans still en route ground, but pace of fans has

                cans of beer being thrown to wall side, unable to drink

                in time.     Attitude changing to impatience when checked.

                Group of fans trying to buy tickets had now gone with

                the mass at this point.     From this point to 3.00pm (1500) the

                fans were gradually dwindling in numbers, although late

                comers were now running full haste to ground.        Aware

            I an a Police Inspector in the South Yorkshire Police at present

            stationed at Cl Sub Division, Rotheram.

            At 10.00 am (1000) on Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) I attended a

            briefing at Hillsborough Football Ground, Sheffield, together with

            othar officers, in connection with the F.A. Semi-Final to be played

            at the ground at 3 pm (1500) the same date.      The match was to involve

            the teams of Liverpool F.C. and Nottingham Forest F.C.

            I was designated sub sector 14 (call sign India 14), and detailed to

            supervise 3 serials, nos. 36, 37 and 38.      We were part of a

            contingency commanded by Supt. MARSHALL (Sector 2) and Chief

            Inspectors PURDY and WARING.     Each Serial contained 1 Sergeant and
                                                                 PAGE
                                                                 S1159

8 man and our duties were split into 3 phases.

Briefly serials 36 and 37 were responsible during Phase 1 to work in

conjunction with mounted officers and supervise Liverpool supporters

leaving the trains at Wadsley Station situated less than 1 mile from

the ground.

My original orders indicated that during this phase, serial 37 was to

remain static at the Railway station and was NOT to escort supporters

to the ground.

I established that in fact only one train was expected (ccnmonly

referred to as the service train) and this was anticipated to arrive

at 1402 hours.

Serial number 38 was responsible for the supervising and parking of

mini buses (containing Liverpool supporters) in Wardsend Road North,

which is situated near to the Railway Station.

Phase 2 referred to the period during the match which included a

refreshment period at Claywheels Lane.   Phase 3 involved similar

duties to Phase 1, ie. supervising supporters returning to the

Railway Station, with the exception of serial 38, who were to take up

a position in the ground in front of the North Stand on the perimeter

track.

Having recieved the briefing I then briefed my three serials as to

their respective duties, familiarised myself with the ground and then

with Chief Inspector PURDY at 11.00 am (1100) approximately I made my

way to the Wadsley Railway Station situated on Penistone Road North

near to its continuation with Halifax Road.   Almost immediately

supporters began to arrive in transit type vans, mini buses and

private cars.

These were all Liverpool supporters and after about 1 hour there had

been a considerable build up of supporters and the area became quite

busy with both vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
                                                                  pact :         3
                                                                  S1159

It soon became apparent that many supporters were walking 'away'

fro.n the ground uphill along Penistone Road North towards Halifax Road

and Foxhill areas apparently in search of alcohol.

Man/ visited two public houses within 50 yards (50yds) of my location

although these public houses were closed to the general public.     I

was aware that the nearest public house (apart from these two) was the

White Horse public house about 600 yards (600yds) up Halifax Road.          As

a result I walked up Halifax Road to the area of the White Horse

public house and satisfied myself that there were officers patrolling

this area also.   I then returned to the Railway Station, at Wadsley.

Supporters were still walking away from the Football ground and we

were then continually engaged advising supporters that there was no

provision for them to obtain alcohol and that the pubs were closed

and that they should make their way to the ground.   This, almost

without exception had little effect and the supporters nonetheless

continued to walk away from the ground seme returning during the next

hour carrying cans and packs of lager and beer and were similarly

advised that they wouldn't be permitted to take it into the ground.

At approximately 1.45 pm (1345) I observed a crowd of about 100

youths sat on a grass verge in Halifax Road approximately 100 yards

(100yds )frcm my location, all drinking what appeared to be alcohol in

cans. Many others were millling around.   I felt it necessary to

request a mobile serial to attend this location to supervise these

youths in the event of trouble but at this time they appeared well

behaved.   I then saw two mounted officers on their horses positioned

immediately behind these supporters and stood on the forecourt of

Halfords Store.   After approximately two minutes I heard a request

for assistance and looked immediately towards Halfords and saw that

the two officers on horses had disappeared.   Supt. MARSHALL and Ch.

Insp. PURDY were walking across the road towards the supporters.        I
                                                                    PA®     4
                                                                    S1159

sent 6 men immediately towards Halfords with the instruction to assist

the mounted officers and established that there was an off-licence

facility in the Gateway supermarket situated at the rear of these

premises.

At 2.00 pm (1400) the service train arrived as scheduled.     I

ascertained that there were 430 supporters on board.     With the

approval of Supt. MARSHALL at the scene, and in view of their being

no other trains arriving, myself and serials   36 and 37 together with

the assistance of mounted officers, marshalled the supporters into

Pen istone Road North and then escorted than without incident to the

Leppings Lane entrance of the ground arriving at 2.20 pm (1420).       I,

together with Serials 36 and 37 then remained at the Leppings Lane

entrance and again with the assistance of mounted officers we began

to marshall the supporters walking along Leppings Lane from the

direction of Penistone Road North and directed them to the turnstiles.

After a period of about 10 minutes, due to the number of supporters

attending, vehicular traffic was unable to move along Leppings Lane,

although I saw a black Capri inching its way through driven by a

von an driver.

I continually received enquiries frcm supporters for directions to

either the North Stand or Leppings Lane or West Stand.

It was at this time that I was approached by three men who produced

to me three counterfeit tickets that they stated they had purchased

from a small boy approx. 3'6" (3'6) to 4 feet(4') tall.     These were

amateurishly forged on an ordinary copying machine and had been

hastily coloured, in yellow crayon.   I showed to the men Appendix 'E'

of my order confirming the colour coding of legitimate tickets as

brown, red, purple, orange, blue and green only.   They indicated that

the boy had several of these tickets and that he hadn't been able to

sell these tickets fast enough to supporters coming frcm the
                                                                   PA®     5
                                                                   S1159

direction of Catch Bar Lane (ie. the opposite direction to where my

attention had been concentrated).     I advised the men and they walked

away in an attempt to find the boy.

I was then aware that I had become overwhelmed by the sheer volume of

supporters though I was stood in the middle of the road.     I then

simultaneously began to receive several reports frcm members of the

public that people were getting crushed at the turnstiles.     The

latter of these reports were frcm people who were obviously frantic

with worry and concern and they were having to shout, though only a

few feet away frcm me.    Immediately I began to seek the attention of

the mounted Police Inspector on his horse nearby.     I could see there

were horses in the crowd of people irrmediately outside the main gates

in Leppings Lane.    The mounted officers were having great difficulty

controlling their horses and they were likewise individually

surrounded by a huge crowd of supporters.    It was difficult to

corrmunicate verbally and by radio due to the general noise and the

lack of radio air space, however I was able to make my way to and

shout to the Mounted Inspector (whose name I did not know). He was

attempting to re-group his men and I requested he form a barrier

across the front of the gates.    People were continually arriving frcm

both directions in their hundreds and although I was still in the

centre of Leppings Lane and I was still surrounded by supporters there

was no discernible movement of the crowd.    The turnstiles were

diractly in front of me though about 40 yards (40yds) away and the

masses of people were continually attempting to filter slowly towards

the turnstiles.     I heard repeated requests over the tannoy system

froTi the area of the turnstiles for people to stop pushing.

At 2.50 pm (1450) a Landrover arrived driven by PC1863 Michael

BUXTON and he positioned his vehicle at an angle directly in front of

the turnstiles in Leppings Lane with the roof mounted public address
                                                                PA®     6
                                                                S1159

system speaker facing the supporters trying to enter the turnstiles.

I haard him appeal for patience and to stop pushing but this seemed

to have no effect.

In view of the number of queries I had received for directions I

thought it would assist if I was able to direct the crowd visually

also from the problem areas, and I would obtain a better vantage

point.   I climbed onto the roof of the landrover took control of the

mobile public address system and personally began to advise people

where to go with their respective tickets and to appeal to them to

stop pushing.

I saw that the Mounted Police had in fact formed a barrier across the

front of the main gates between the natural barrier walls on either

sida of the main gates, I estimated 6 horses at this stage.   My

initial view from this vantage point gave me real cause for concern.

I could see that all around me people were stationary and close

together and as they neared the turnstiles they were jammed together

for the whole width of the turnstiles and for a depth of severed

yards (yds). All I could see were heads of hair.    Not even their

shoulders were visible.   They were so tightly packed that I began to

shout over the public address system to stop pushing.    I could hear

people screaming "Get the match delayed" and "why don't you get the

match delayed."

I rasponded with more appeals over the public address system and

sevaral times asked for patience and I informed the crowd that we

wera making efforts to delay the 'kick off.'    I could see people

frantically struggling to get further forward past the barrier created

by the horses.    Some youths I saw run underneath the horses, others

succeeded in pushing between them.

There was no indiscemable gap between the supporters on either side

of the horses and I could see that a space had been provided in the
                                                                  PAGE
                                                                  S1159

centre of the horses for the supporters to gain access.     This I

conveyed to the supporters over the public address system and

visually directed them also.     This should have restricted access by

approximately 80     but the crowd seemed to have been gripped by a

mania and their only intention appeared to be to gain access to the

ground at any cost before the kick off.

I was continually looking at my watch in the period between 2.50 pm

(1450) and 3.00 pm (1500).     I was gripped with real concern that

there was serious danger of injury or loss of life.     I looked to my

left and as far as I could see down Leppings Lane (approximately 400

yards) (400yds) it was crowded with hundreds of supporters which

stratched frcm wall to wall and all were making their way to the

turnstiles. The situation was similar frcm the other direction.

I continued my appeals to the crowd and was shouting above the P.A.

system so loud that this caused me to cough between messages.

I haard a cheer frcm within the ground which I later assumed to be

the players entering the field.     I became increasingly anxious as

people ignored the barrier of horses.     I heard abuse frcm supporters

diracted at the mounted officers who were being accused of preventing

then gaining entry.     I saw that the situation had worsened in that

there were people precariously balanced and tightly packed on top of

the row of narrow railings which ran down the centre of the approach

to the turnstiles.    The crowd was tightly packed below them and it

was though these people on the railings had climbed onto them so as

to avoid being crushed by the crowd.    They were simply sat there for

the full length of the railings facing both sides as if they had

climbed frcm both sides.     There was no more rocm for anyone else on

the railings and they were so tightly packed they were in danger of

falling off into the crowd below.     The scene was by now so desperate

that I looked at my watch again hoping that either there would be an
                                                                    PAGE
                                                                    S1159

announcement that the kick off was delayed or that the attitude of

the crowd would change when they realised that their objective to get

in the ground before kick-off had not been achieved.       It was fifteen

seconds to three.

Still I could see no signs of the crowd diminishing directly in front

of the turnstiles.     I could see a Police Officer in the c o m e r and to

the far left hand side of the turnstiles, he seemed unable to move

due to the sheer weight of supporters.      I could occasionally see

othar officers on the inside of the ground at the turnstiles.       The

problems continued in this vein as supporters continued to enter the

turnstiles.   The next thing I recall is looking towards the

turnstiles again and to my surprise and relief I saw that there was

only a small crowd about 5 yards(5yds) deep but for its whole width.

I had not seen where the main bulk of supporters had gone to and my

only belief was that they had somehow entered the ground quickly

through the turnstiles.     What I witnessed then I watched in disbelief

and amazement.     I saw the supporters clambering over the turnstiles

any way they could.    They were apparently not showing tickets or

paying to enter.     Some supporters I saw literally diving over the

turnstiles as though a huge wave of panic had descended over them to

ENTER the ground although there was no reason for this behaviour.         I

was instantly relieved at this stage to see the problem of entry had

been resolved before there had been death or injuries at the

turnstiles.

There remained approximately 200 people outside the ground on the

Leppings Lane side of the horses apparently still intent on gaining

entry and I heard one mounted officer shout "If you haven't got

tickets then get away."

This seemed to discourage them momentarily and they all moved back

and seme began to move position though they made no attempt to leave
                                                                    PAGE
                                                                    S1159

the area.      Some still attempted to get past his horse into the

turnstile area.

I then alighted from the roof of the landrover and having spoken to

PC BUXTON he then drove his vehicle into the lane down the right

hand side of the turnstiles and which gives access to the ground and

in particular to the South Stand.    After a few seconds I heard a

message over the radio requesting all available personnel onto the

field.    I observed 25 to 40 officers run in the same direction as a

result.     It then became apparent that there was a serious emergency

and myself and those remaining at the entrance received urgent

instructions to close the gates.

Imnediately the turnstile gates were slammed shut and I then assisted

other officers to close the forecourt and to close the main steel;

gates at the Leppings Lane entrance.    We were imnediately confronted

by anger and aggression frcm the many supporters remaining and

demanding entry to the ground.     I was personally approached by a few

individuals on separate occasions who were arguing with disbelief

that anyone could shut the gates.    They were waving their tickets

with fury in my face.     I explained that the ground was full to

capacity and had been closed because of safety regulations.       The

supporters seemed unable to accept any explanation.     I could

understand a persons anger at being refused entry having purchased a

ticket but this was more than simple protest and anger and I could

not comprehend the fanatical behaviour of these supporters.       I had to

forcibly push away those I was speaking to and I recall shouting at

one to take his ticket back to Liverpool and that the gates were shut

and closed.     It seemed that my final remarks registered with those

that they were directly aimed at but no sooner had I got the message

across I found myself repeating it to other similarly angry

supporters.     Other officers were likewise trying to clear the area in
                                                                   PAGE 10
                                                                   SI 159

front of the gates.

At approximately 3.10 pn (1510) I went into the Lane leading to the

South Stand where I had seen other officers running.    I   saw several

othar officers tending to injured persons just inside the lane, near

to the co m e r of the South and West stands. Some of the injured were

laid on the ground.    Some had white blankets of a type normally

carried by ambulances over their bodies and covering their faces.       It

was apparent that there was an emergency and there had been a

disaster though I was not aware at that time the extent nor the

circumstances.    I reasoned that there would be many officers inside

the ground and I looked around and saw supporters leaving the

ground.   Many were injured or distressed and were staggering about in

shock and disbelief.    I realised that this area would be a major

route for the emergency services and my efforts and those of the few

remaining officers was assisting and comforting the injured and

attanpting to keep people moving who were leaving the ground.       I

observed approximately 10 covered bodies and 20    or more injured

persons sat or laid on the tarmac amongst them.     Whilst workingI and

every officer was met with a wall of abuse frcm    seme of these

supporters apportioning blame to the Police.   Anger like I had never

seen before was being directed at us.

Many people were being aggressive to the extent that I anticipated a

serious disorder problem if we did not receive assistance outside the

ground and I hastily requested further Police assistance over my

radio.    I observed several individual officers and trying to restore

order.    Some of these supporters were uncontrollable, I understood

that this anger was partly/wholly attributed to something they had

seen in the ground and in seme cases was a shocked reaction.     I found

mysalf putting my arms round many of these people and walking with

then to keep them moving, consoling them whilst I did so.    All the
                                                                    PAGE 11
                                                                    S1159

time other officers and I were being verbally abused in a most

violent manner.   I fully expected being assaulted at any moment.

I observed that officers had formed themselves into a line near to

and protecting the injured and dead and naturally creating an avenue

in which supporters could leave without hinderance to the injured.

I saw one officer who was in full uniform but without a helmet

remonstrating with violent and angry supporters at the main gates.

In order to quieten the situation and at serious risk to myself I

went into the middle of these supporters and took an unusual course

of action and instructed the Police Officer to go away which he did.

This seemed to appease them.

It was now apparent that there had been a major disaster but still no

one could have comprehended the extent of it.     I easily recognised

that this was no normal situation and that it could not be dealt with

or catered for by normal Police practices.   The potential for public

disorder outside the ground at this stage was enormous.     In my

opinion, one wrong word by a Police Officer could have ignited a

situation which would have become riotous.   I felt that the Police

Officers could do no other than remain in their positions, taking the

abuse and aggressiveness which was continually directed towards

them.   I, as Senior Officer at the scene was primarily then engaged

keeping control of the situation.   The line of officers were

shielding and protecting the dead and injured and had the crowd been

able to see clearly this scene I felt this alone could have caused

serious problems of disorder and crowd control.     I am unable to

chronologically describe the sequence of events frcm this point as I

was continually engaged on various duties, which included tending to

the injured.   I removed my coat and put it round one injured person

after another as each left the scene or was conveyed to Hospital by a

fleet of ambulances which arrive.
                                                                     PAGE      12
                                                                     S1159

I instructed officers to place barriers and cover them with tarpaulin

sheets and place them around the dead and injured.

I directed a nurse in civilian clothes who offered her help to the

injured people lying on the tarmac.     I consoled a Policewoman who was

unashamedly crying but nevertheless she remained in the line of

Police Officers.   Some officers were assisting the injured.

Supt. MARSHALL arrived and at his request I sent several officers to

clear the lane for the ambulances so that they may continue to arrive

at the Leppings Lane entrance and leave via Penistone Road North.          I

later sent more officers to assist as more people began leaving the

ground.   A photographer arrived wearing a flourescent waistcoat.         My

attention was drawn to him when several violent and angry supporters

tried to attack him.     Whilst he did not say a word they accused him

of taking photographs.     So violent was their aggression, in my

opinion, he was in serious risk of losing his life had the supporters

not been prevented by other officers from getting hold of him.        I

literally frog marched the photographer out of the way for his own

protection.   He did not appear to appreciate the seriousness of the

situation he found himself in and all the time other supporters

were directing their aggression at him.     I found it necessary to

march him hurriedly 30 or 40 yards (30 or 40 yds)where I gave him to

the custody of two other officers in Leppings Lane     and instructedthem

to take him as far away as possible.

Three ambulances arrived and in the absence     of the driver I           drovethe

forsmost ambulance down the line of injured     people to allow           access

for the other ambulances.

Everyone at the scene had a task to perform.     I recall a Doctor

arriving and asking where he was required.     Supt. MARSHALL deputed an

officer to take him to the gymnasium.     A short while later another

Doctor arrived and I similarly deputed another officer to take him to
                                                                  PAGE :
                                                                  S1159

the gymnasium.

I assisted another officer to console an injured man who I know to be

Brian ANDERSON (approx 30 years). He was sat on the tarmac at the

side of his father who was apparently dead.    Brian ANDERS® did not

want to be conveyed to Hospital nor separated from his father and I

instructed a Police Officer to remain with him.

As the time elapsed it became clear as to the severity of the

disaster and a sombre mood befell the crowd.     I continued with my

duties and shortly after observed that some officers were in fact

performing the task of identification of the deceased.

I then left the scene with several other officers together with Chief

Inspector PURDY and we returned to the Railway Station and assisted

with enquiries and general duties in the area.

At approximately 1800 hours I returned with 5 officers to Claywheels

Lane.   More officers arrived a short while afterwards.    It was clear

many were visibly shocked and upset/distressed and unfit to continue

duty.

I returned with these officers to Rotherham where we all retired

from duty.

To summarise, it is my genuine belief that supporters entering the

turnstiles between 1450 and 1500 hours were in imminent danger of

being killed or seriously injured as a result of the huge volume of

fanatical supporters arriving en masse, all intent and anxious to the

point of desperation to get into the ground at any cost before the

kick off.    This was confirmed by the anxiety of many other supporters

who were frantically pleading for the kick off to be delayed and for

the Police to do something although the situation developed so

quickly and with the behaviour of the crowd this was impossible.

I an satisfied that the officers I could see behaved in a

professional and exemplary manner and did all they could in the
                                                                 PAGE 14
                                                                 S1159

circumstances prevailing.

The mounted police also acted in a professional manner and I was

impressed by the way they organised themselves to form a barrier

under great and difficult circumstances the like of which I have not

seen since the miners strike.     Whilst their actions may have relieved

the pressure for a short while on the turnstiles, the behaviour and

volume of the crowd was such that they were unable to sustain it.        I

was not surprised to find during the period consoling the violent

supporters leaving the ground after the incident that many of them

had been drinking and smelled strongly of alcohol.     I consider that

this played a large part in the behaviour of those acting

irresponsibly and violently. Whilst I was in close proximity to many

other NONE violent persons (including those injured) none of these

appeared to have been drinking.

I did not witness any violent disorder as such prior to the match

though this seems to have been diverted or released frcm the crowd

through efforts to enter the ground. My conclusions were that many

supporters had in fact arrived in sufficient time but had left the

area to consume alcohol.    Through having to walk some considerable

distance when returning, they had arrived late.     This resulted in a

situation whereby they were unable to enter all at once.     The whole of

Leppings Lane at the crucial 10 minute period was one mass of moving

people.   In my opinion this would have been the queue had they all

stood still.   It would have necessitated hundreds of Police in the

circumstances to control them and the majority would have been unable

to gain access without missing part of the match.

Those supporters at the rear would have been unaware of the problem

of entry as the turnstiles were so far away and out of view.     The

situation developed so quickly that we were powerless to control the

huge numbers and even with reinforcements it would have entailed

         crowd control similar to that witnessed in the Miners Strike to

         restore orderly queues.

             I am a Police Sergeant in the South Yorkshire Police, at present

             stationed at Rotherham.

             At 08.30 hours (0830) on Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489), I came on

             duty at Main Street Police Station, Rotherham for transport to

             Hillsborough Football Ground by Force coach.     I was in charge of

             Serial 36 which comprised of the following officers:

             PC 2403 MORTON, PC 13 ROSE, PC 72 LIPSKI, PC 3183 TRCEK, PC 3044

             DONNELL, PC 1429 BASHFORTH, PC 2910 CAMMOCK and PC 1266 ADSHEAD.       We

             were part of Sector 14 commanded by Inspector ELLIS of Rotherham

             Division.     We attended briefing at Hillsborough Stadium as directed

             and then deployed to Wadsley Station, Penistone Road.     We were to work

             with mounted officers in the supervision of Liverpool supporters,

             leaving the trains at Wadsley Station. We were to marshall them,

             carry out searches where necessary, and then escort them to the
                                                                   PAGE    2
                                                                   S3024

ground. The first thing that surprised me was the fact that there was

only one special train, carrying reportedly 550 supporters. I

expected more trains than this.

On reflection I think that the supporters are aware that these trains

are met by the Police, and they are then marshalled straight to the

ground, so to avoid this they ccme by other means.

The special train was not expected until shortly after 1400 hours

but we deployed early at about 10.25 hours (1025) and took up duties

in Penistone Road, outside the Station.

Between our location and Hillsborough Stadium was the main coach park

for Liverpool supporters at Claywheels Lane and all the local public

houses in this area were closed and boarded up.

It was a nice sunny day and there became a constant stream of

Liverpool supporters going up the hill away from the ground in search

of somewhere to obtain a drink.

It became a waste of time telling them that they would have a fair

distance to go as such advice was disregarded.    I remember one

particular request for directions to Grenoside Working Mens Club,

which is all of two miles away, they still set off walking.     Just

prior to the special trains arrival at about 13.50 hours (1350) I

heard a report of a disturbance in a Trading Estate off Halifax Road

just above our location.   I attended with other officers and saw that

a grassed area in the vicinity of Gateways Supermarket was crowded

with Liverpool supporters drinking from cans and bottles.     There was

no disorderly behaviour and we were told to resume.    I only got to

the entrance of the Trading Estate area but that must have contained

in excess of 1,000 football supporters all sitting drinking.     The

special train arrived just after 1400 hours (1400) and we were told

that in fact it contained only 440 Liverpool supporters.    As they left

the train we marshalled them as per instructions, the first thing
                                                                   PAGE    3
                                                                   S3024

that struck me was that there were none of the usual (idiots) among

then.   They were all decent orderly people, who seemed surprised at

the amount of Police attention they were receiving.   As soon as we

got them in a group we began to escort them to the Stadium en route

they were well behaved, and laughed and joked with us.   We arrived at

the Leppings Lane end of Hillsborough shortly afterwards and these

supporters joined the queues to enter the ground.

Because there were no more special trains I remained with my serial at

■the Leppings Lane just generally supervising.supporters. Because it

became progressively busier as it approached kick off time, we did not

go to Claywheels Lane for a meal.

The area outside the turnstiles in Leppings Lane was crowded with

supporters most of whom were drinking from cans and enjoying the sunny

weather.    There seemed to be a general reluctance to enter the

ground, and at about 14.30 hours (1430) mounted officers made an

attampt to clear these supporters in towards the turnstiles but most

just filtered back.    There was a disturbance at one stage towards the

Middlewood Road side of Leppings Lane but it was brought quickly under

control by mounted officers.

I ramained in Leppings Lane towards the junction with Vere Road, and

as kick off time approached the flow of fans coning towards me became

heavier.    I became fully occupied in directing fans as to which

turnstiles they should use.    They were running up to me and showing me

their tickets, asking where they should go.    I was also aware of

supporters approaching these fans shouting, "Have you got any spares.’’

The first indication I had that things were not right, was when a

woman came back to me and told me that there was another woman with a

leg injury near the outer gates at the entrance to the Leppings Lane

entrance.    I went to the metal gates at the North side of Leppings

Lana and saw a mounted officer just outside the gates, his horse was
                                                                 PAGE     4
                                                                 S3024

hemmed in by supporters and there was a solid mass of people in front

of him, I told him about the injured woman but he already knew and

said it was inpossible for him to assist because of the crush of

people.   She was apparently reasonably safe at this time in the Lee

sida of the metal gate.   I then began trying to prevent people from

entering this area but it was useless. A Police Land Rover arrived

and loud speakers used to try and get the fans to move back from the

turnstiles.   I saw Inspector ELLIS with a hand held loud hailer get on

the roof of a Land Rover requesting the fans to get back.    By this

tirrta it was obvious that the game had kicked off, and there was then

no reasoning with the crowd as they pressed forward toward the

turnstiles.   Supporters were going under the bellies of Police horses

to get through.   I was in possession of a personal radio which I had

in the top pocket of my tunic underneath my Police anorak.    Due to

the crowd noise it was very difficult to pick up messages.    Only

officers working inside the ground had been issued with ear pieces.

Sana of my officers who are Cormunity Constables with their own radios

had extension mikes clipped on the lapels of their jackets and

appeared to have picked up more radio traffic than I did.    The only

messages I can clearly remember hearing was a request for all traffic

to be stopped from entering Leppings Lane because of the amount of

jpeople using it just before kick off.   I then heard a voice on the air

saying " There's going to be a catastrophe."

I have no knowledge of the gates being opened just a sudden

realisation that the crush had eased.

The Liverpool supporters had obviously been drinking, their mood was

boisterous but reasonably good humoured.

As avery Police Officer knows it is difficult to reason with someone

who has been drinking.    There was one particular loud roar from inside

the ground which caused the crowd to push even harder which could have
                                                                 PAGE      5
                                                                 S3024

been when the teams came onto the pitch at 1454 (1454).   I have never

seen mounted officers so helpless in controlling a crowd situation,

and onfoot we were just useless.

The next message I received on the radio was for all available

officers to go into the stadium as Liverpool supporters were on the

pitch.

I entered the ground with other officers by Gate A, as we did this we

had to prevent Liverpool supporters from trying to enter with us.      I

then ran to the back of the North Stand and went up the first entrance

to get onto the pitch.   PC 1429 BASHPQRTH was with me at this time.

When I got to the playing area the game was no longer in progress.

There were a lot of Liverpool supporters on the pitch, and a Police

Cordon was forming across the pitch towards the half way line.      I went

towards the front of the West Stand and if I had felt useless outside

the ground, it was nothing compared to what I was to experience.      I

approached the central North standing area of Leppings Lane end at its

juntion with the North standing area.   There was a huge crush of

supporters in the central North terrace area and fans were pushed

right up against the perimeter fence.

At this stage there was absolutely nothing we could do to help them.

Because we were in uniform Liverpool supporters were caning up to us

screaming and swearing at us to do something.

There was nothing they could do, but they expected us to do something.

I have never felt as helpless in my life.   Some of the supporters in

that area were managing to get over the dividing railing into the

North terraced area and we evacuated them onto the pitch through the

perimeter gate of this area.

The perimeter gates at the Leppings Lane end are narrow only allowing

one person through at a time and there was only one perimeter gate for

the central North terracing which was further over towards the centre
                                                                    PAGE    6
                                                                    S3024

of the stand.    There were already Police officers there so I remained

where I was.

Eventually fans managed to get up to climb over the perimeter fence,

and I climbed up the fence on the pitch side and began to help them

over the top.

I was greatly hampered in this by the fact that the strands of metal

mesh fencing had been continued past the top bar to form a row of

spikes which was catching on their clothing.    I began bending the

spikes down to prevent them from doing this.    Eventually the crush in

this compound eased further and I could see the body of a man

lying on the floor at the base of the perimeter fence near to the

dividing fence to the North terrace.

He was apparently dead.

We then turned our attention to the perimeter fence which consisted of

a strong metal mesh welded to metal supporters.    It had been welded on

the inside of the metal supports so it could not be pulled outwards

towards the pitch.

It had to be peeled inwards towards the stand and this we managed to

do with some difficulty.

Persons were then able to escape through this and bodies began to be

lifted through.

I ramained on the playing field and began to give the kiss of life to

casualties.     I had no success at all which was absolutely soul

destroying.

I was with a woman aged about 26 years, who had not responded to

resuscitation she had an abrasion over I believe her left eye.       When

sort)3 Liverpool supporters arrived with some broken down hoardings to

transport her to the casualty station there weren't enough to carry

her so I helped to lift her onto the boards.     She was dressed in

jeans, and jumper as we moved her her clothing became displaced
                                                                        PAGE     7
                                                                        S3024



       I covered her with my anorak and helped to carry her to the gymnasium.

       As      approached the door to the gymnasium we had to stop as seme one

       had become violent and was having to be restrained by Police Officers.

       This occured while casualties were lying all around.    We were unable

       to get the hoarding through the doorway and I had to lift the woman

       off and carry her bodily through the gym.    The woman was apparently

       dead and I remember seeing Detective Sergeant John SMITH who was part

       of the team receiving the casualties.

       I returned to help carry a body that of a young man aged about 17 to

       18 years, who I first tried to resuscitate, he was slimly built,

                                   dressed in jeans and T shirt.

       I have no clear recollections after this everything seems to have been

       done in a daze.    I ended up outside the gymnasium understandably no

       one seemed to have much time for the minor casualties, so I assisted

       them where I could and put then on the mini bus type of ambulance to

       be transported to hospital.

       I then assisted with persons who had lost relatives and helped them

       where I could.

       I have worked several matches at the Hillsborough ground including the

       last three semi finals.     My usual duties have been on the Catchbar

       Lane/Parkside area of the ground but I worked the Leppings Lane

       turnstiles for the Leeds v Coventry semi final and we experienced no

       difficulties on this occasion.

       I have never seen so many supporters in Leppings Lane still arriving

       so close to and after kick off time.

           Reported on duty at 8.30 a.m. (0830) at Main Street Police Station,

           Rotherham. My serial consisted of Policewoman 3136 SHERBURN,

           Policewoman 3212 NESBIT, Police Constable 1779 WILLIAMSON, Police

           Constable 1981 BUTLER, Detective Constable 2790 YARROW, Detective

           Constable 1917 COCK, Detective Constable 1477 HILL and Detective

           Constable 2293 DAY. All the Officers are frcm 'Cl' Division, seme frcm

           the uniform, and the rest frcm the C.I.D. who had volunteered to work

           at the football match on a weekly leave day. There was another serial

           attached to ours and in overall charge of the two serials was

           Inspector Steve ELLIS. He has been recently promoted frcm the Traffic

           Division. We were bussed to Hillsborough onto Penistone Road, m a r to

           the entrance of the gymnasium. We went into the main stand where

           briefing was held by several officers who had drawn up the plans for

           the match including C.I.D. officers in relation to crime and we were
                                                                 PAGE    2
                                                                 S2498

finally briefed by Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD frcm 'F' Divison.

I had attended the previous match in 1988(000088), at this ground in

similar circumstances and at that time I was in fact at the Leppings

Lana end controlling the crowds and on the commencement of the match,

I was in the main stand with the Liverpool supporters. On that

occasion there was no trouble whatsoever, I believe there were one or

two arrests, but no disturbances or crowd trouble whatsoever.

After the briefing we proceeded to our duty which was at Wardsend Road

North, that's on the junction with Halifax Road and directly opposite

the British Rail Station at Wadsley Bridge. Our duties were to park

mini buses arriving down Halifax Road frcm the motorway and advise

supporters generally the direction of the ground.

Located at the junction of Wardsend Road and Halifax Road, is licensed

premses called the Railway Inn, when I worked in Sheffield, I recall

visiting these premises, but it is seme years ago, but when we arrived

at Wardsend Road, I recall Police Constable BUTLER informing me that

the licensee of the premises would like to see me. I met the licensee,

a tall chap with a beard. He informed me that he was not opening the

front doors and that the windows had been boarded but he intended to

open via the rear door in a small courtyard at the back, and allow

certain supporters and obviously his regular customers into the

premses. He stated that he had opened in 1988(000088) for the semi­

final and that damage had been caused to the toilets, although there

had not been any serious trouble. He asted that we direct any 'older

end' supporters, not the younger element who may cause trouble and

damage. I recall that he was quite friendly, asked us to keep an eye

on the place, and he would probably remain outside or near to the door

and we agreed that we would cover the premises as well as our duties

with the mini buses.

I rsmember him offering to provide a pot of tea for the officers and I
                                                                 PAGE    3
                                                                 S2498

agreed that 12.30 (1230) would be an ideal time and that we'd split

the officers up so that they could go to the back of the premises and

have a drink at about 12.30. (1230).

Coaches started arriving, I think the first coach arrived somewhere in

the region of about 11.30 (1130). This was a Ford Transit van and

they'd improvised and placed seme seats of their own in the van, the

lads in it were all in their twenties, that age group, they were in a

good mood, these did not appear to be drinking at all, they were

joking with the officers, there was no trouble. They parked where we

told them to park and I recall that this first bus load made their way

directly to the ground.

Buses arrived afterwards but there was not a great number of these

mini coaches. We parked than on the side of the road and although the

majority of the occupants were obviously excited about the

prospects of the match, they were generally well behaved and good

humoured. We joked with than, talked about the match, and they were

generally in high spirits and there was no problem whatsoever.

The coaches that were proper mini coaches, the drivers were generally

remaining with the coach and we did not see evidence of a great deal

of drink on this type of mini coach. Others which were consisting of

company vehicles, works' vans, that had obviously been borrowed had a

considerable number of cans of drink in them. But again, the occupants

were no problem whatsoever. I recall one van load arriving and asking

if they could obtain a drink, they were mainly in the 30/35 age group,

and actually walked down to the rear entrance of the Railway Public

House. Told them to go quietly to the back door and they were in fact

admitted by the licensee into the premises. I did in fact go into the

premses later on through the back door there was no problem in the

public house whatsoever, as I said before they seemed to be in high

spirits and quite good humoured as generally Liverpool fans are.
                                                                 PAGE    4
                                                                 S2498

There was a steady flow of spectators walking down Halifax Road,

towards the ground, and as every officer that was on duty in that area

will say, the majority of these fans, the younger element in

particular, were all carrying cans of beer or lager and large plastic

bottles of drink and openly drinking them as they walked along. All

the officers were quite surprised that they weren't carrying just one

can, they were carrying a half dozen cans at a time, and drinking

from them. As seme of the spectators left the pub again there was no

problem, they even thanked us for informing them and I saw one group

of fans leaving the pub thanking the licensee and shaking hands with

him.

Whilst we were at the location of Wardsend Road and Halifax Road, we

were visited by Chief Superintendent NESBIT who was touring the area

in a Range Rover. He came and spoke to us. We were also visited by

Superintendent MARSHALL who was on foot, and he was checking the

crowds. This was early doors, I would say in the region of 12 o'clock

(1200) time, he came and spoke to me. I do know Superintendent

MARSHALL although I've never worked with him, I know him frcm a social

aspect. His main concern was that no weapons arrived in these mini

buses and nothing was taken down to the ground which would cause any

injury. He also requested that we check as many for tickets and advise

those that hadn't got tickets not to make their way down to the

ground.

As the mini buses started to back up Wardsend Road, we had the use of

a company car park, and we did in fact park a number of mini buses on

this car park. One thing I do recall is that a mini bus full of

youngsters 20 years of age pulled onto the car park and when I walked

up to this van they'd got the sliding door open, I believe two or

three round public house tables and a half dozen pub stools and number

of cans of beer on the tables. I asked them in a joking manner what
                                                                PAGE     5
                                                                S2498

they were doing and they said that they knew that the pubs would be

shut so they'd brought their own mini pub. Again, they were no trouble

I believe Detective Constable Hill just had to warn one of these lads

who was getting a bit stroppy, to calm down, but in general we had no

problem whatsoever with any of the mini buses that came.

I counted a total of only 17 mini buses, I expected that we would be

inundated with mini buses and in the end would be trying to find

places to park them on both sides of the road but this wasn't so.

There were very few and I told the officers in my serial that if there

were late arrivals with cars rather than send the cars to the ground

where they would cause a problem trying to park down there that we

could start parking a few cars as well on Wardsend Road. I did in fact

radio through to the control room where I spoke to Sergeant GODDARD. I

was in fact in possession of a radio and informed him that there were

very few cars and buses arriving. I recall the football special train

arriving, I was stood at the end of Wardsend Road, I saw the train

cross the bridge over the road. I would say about 5/6 hundred fans

came off the train, they walked down from the station, two mounted

officers were in front of them, they just held thorn for a short time,

until they were altogether, then they went down Halifax Road towards

the ground, again although they were in high spirits and were singing,

I did not see any that tried to break away, they followed the

officers and went down towards the ground.

Our brief was to remain at Wardsend Road, until kick off time or

shortly before if there was no other duty to perform there, but I do

recall as late as twenty minutes to three, (1440) young men, I would

 think that they were Liverpool supporters, running up Halifax Road

 away from the ground towards a shopping precinct a short distance some

 20 or 30 yards (yds) further up, and obviously they were heading for

 the beer off and the supermarket and right up to ten minutes to three
                                                                 PAGE    6
                                                                 S2498

(1450) or even later, crowds of supporters were still coming down

Halifax Road and the significant thing was the amount of drink

they were carrying, cans of beer. Although we didn't have any

trouble with them, it was noticeable at the time and I'm not just

saying this in the aftermath of what happened, it was remarked on that

why at this late time were they going to the ground and having a

considerable amount of drink. I have gone to football matches all my

lifa and big matches, I've always gone early and wouldn't think of

going for a drink, thinking of being in the ground and having had

drink, but this certainly struck me and I related to my own two sons

who are in their twenties, and every time I go to a football match

with them we always seem to meet in a public house, but probably this

is what all the youngsters do nowadays and it was significant at the

time and as I've previously said, I'm not stating this in the

aftarmath of what happened, this is a fact and it was noticed by quite

a lot of people.

As we left Wardsend Road we left as a serial, there were still people

walking down at approximately three o'clock (1500) or just before

and I am almost certain that I heard over the radio as we got

towards Claywheels Lane the match, the kick off, had been postponed.

I was certainly aware of this and another thing I recall shortly

before I recall a radio message and again I know Sergeant

GODDARD'S voice, he was in the Control Room and I recall a radio

message where Sergeant GODDARD in the Control Roan was asking other

officers if they had seen the South Yorkshire Transport Liaison

Officer in the vicinity of the Herries Road garage. I recall this

because he was asking for that officer to contact or at least if

officers were in contact with him to inform him they had closed

 Leppings Lane because of the volume of supporters and that the bus

 drivers should be informed of this. We carried on and went and
                                                                PAGE    7
                                                                S2498

actually turned into Claywheels Lane where our brief was to obtain a

meal, we had not had a meal at this time, and as I walked with the

serial into Claywheels Lane, I heard over the radio an appeal for

officers to go to the ground as there were seme people in lappings

Lana, trying to get to the ground. I stopped my serial, told than to

turn round and we walked towards the ground. I then met Inspector

Charles coining in the opposite direction away frcm the ground. As we

met he asked me where I was going and I told him about the appeal I'd

heard over my radio. We had a discussion, I recall John Charles saying

no our instructions are to go to Claywheels Lane and I recall saying

to him we'd check again, you check or I'll check on the radio, they

want officers at Leppings Lane. John Charles did in fact go over the

air he was in possession of his own radio, and he received the same

instruction as me.

John CHARLES had got the equivalent of about five serials and the

only other officer with him I can recall was Inspector Bob MEEK,

there may have been somebody else, I can't recall. I can t recall

any other Sergeant or Inspector ELLIS or any other Inspector

with us, I can only recall Inspector CHARLES, Inspector MEEK and

mysalf, and we took the serials and I believe we'd got five serials

with us up Leppings Lane, and we could see then the volume of

spectators as we approached the gates to the ground. We stopped the

serials at the junction with Vere Road, that's the last road on the

 left before you come to the ground. There was a lot of traffic over

the radio and were trying to ask for further instructions. Bob MEEK

went on ahead to try and obtain information as a runner and Inspector

 CHARLES and I then lined up the serials in their serials, and told

 them not to move. I looked after the serials while John CHARLES was

 trying to get over on the radio. I recall telling the serials to

 follow Inspector CHARLES and I and not to break rank or move away and
                                                              PAGE       8
                                                               S2498

to keep with their individual serials so that we knew where everybody

was. I remember that we doubled up in military style up to the gates

of the ground, and I recall turning round to make sure that everybody

was with us, although we were winding our way through the crowds of

people, and as we approached the first set of big gates, the officers

that were there formed a kind of tunnel for us to go through, and we

momantarily stopped there and then an officer I don't know who it was,

it was an officer of Inspector or Superintendent rank, told us,

Straight into the ground lads, go straight into the ground, they need

soma help." We then went through the concertina gate, the big blue

concertina gate, as you look at the leppings Lane entrance it was to

the right hand side. As we went into the area immediately behind the

stand I could see the tunnel in question that goes under the main

stand at Leppings Lane, there were supporters running around, milling

around and then I saw both officers and supporters carrying three

people from underneath the tunnel from the ground. I am certain that

all those three people were alive because they were giving than what

first aid they could and I recall forming a circle with the serials

that we had round these people, and saying, "Look get these supporters

that are getting in the way, get them behind us so that they can see

to these casualties." I'd had no idea that there was anymore, it

looked like a fainting situation and I'm certain that these people

wera alive and we didn't realise the enormity of the situation in the

ground.

Othar officers, again with supporters, came up the tunnel with

 soma more casualties and I could then see that it was a more serious

 situation. They weren't just needing their ties loosening, or air, the

 normal fainting situations, and three—four or more were brought out

 as I say. I recall then a young officer running up the tunnel as they

 wera bringing some other people and I was stood more or less just
                                                               PAGE     9
                                                               S2498

inside the tunnel and he was more or less screaming at me saying, "Get

soma men in here, come and help us, we need help inside as many as

possible." I just recall shouting to or getting hold of as many chaps

as I knew. I recall getting hold of Steve COOK who was with me and

John HILL and saying, "Right, get them inside the ground they need us

inside the ground," and we went under the tunnel. We pushed our way to

the front and as we got to the front we were then faced with all I can

describe as a pile of bodies that appeared just stacked on top of one

another to the level of the top of the wall and several feet back frcin

the wall. Officers and spectators alike were just pulling at these

bodies. At this stage I'm sure that they weren't all dead and we were

just picking a body up, I can't recall Which officer, and we ran as

best we could up the tunnel out into the area we'd first ccme into on

the other side of the stand. I think I did this something like eight,

nine, ten times, with officers and spectators. The first body you

picked up you ran out with him and there were officers carried on

giving assistance. I remember that we tried kiss of life and heart

massage on one chap who we thought was alive for a considerable length

of time and then took him out away as people were falling over us on

the steps of the terrace and we got him to the back. As I said, this

took place carrying bodies out, as far as I'm concerned ten times, it

may have been more and I can't recall Which officer I saw, I can

remamber another Sergeant and I've just thought of his name over the

last day, a Sergeant WHITLAM, who used to be at Rotherham. I can

remamber carrying a body with him on a couple of occasions, but the

others, I've no idea who they were. I remember then that the entrance

to the tunnel appeared to become blocked and I then remember

Superintendent GREENWOOD who was on the pitch side of this fence with

a iregaphone in his hand organising a chain, and the only way to do it

was to take the top body first. We appeared to be just snatching at an
                                                                  PAGE 10
                                                                  S2498

arm and a leg and obviously it was trapped. I remember at first I was

near the gate and there was I'm almost certain a man with his leg

trapped behind the gate support, or his foot, and we were just

standing on him and eventually somebody got him out and that was

preventing us getting through the gate. Officers were trying to carry

bodies through the gate and this was impossible due to the width of

the gate. I remember Superintendent Greenwood continually telling

them, "Form a chain, form a chain, don't try and come through with the

body, don't try and come through." We formed a chain and we got seme

ass ambiance of order, if you can call it that in this situation, where

we did in fact get a chain going. I don't recall now whether this came

to nne afterwards or at the time, but there was a man somewhere

along the line screaming about his daughter. At first we tried to

shove him away and realised that he had got somebody there and he went

through onto the pitch. One of the things that struck me was the

colour of the faces of the victims. These were purple and you could

tell that they were dead, there were blue areas on the body which was

obviously pressure and I recall seme were frothing through the nose

and mouth. There was either one, two or possibly more people there who

were obviously doctors and I remember one of these chaps saying on

several occasions, "Leave him, leave him." Obviously he was dead, to

look for someone else. I recall also at this time the only other

officer that I did see was Chief Superintendent NESBIT and he, with

othar officers was tearing at the fence, away frcm the gate seme 10

yards (yds) away from the gate, and they actually broke the mesh

near to the top c o me r and peeled it back, and thinking about it, it

was like you peel a sardine tin back, and then he started saying,

Pass 'em through."   They ripped the fence out and that fence was

ripped out by hand by brute force of several Police Officers and as

many others that could. They ripped it out by hand and we started
                                                              PAGE 11
                                                              S2498

passing bodies two ways then. I remember hearing the sound of an

ambulance coming, which seemed ages, and I thought there was a fleet

of them and there was only one.

The orders were being given by Chief Superintendent NESBIT as best he

could, trying to organise the men as best he could and certainly by

Superintendent GREENWOOD. My memory of him it was as if he'd hung

himself on the fence near the gate and was just giving the orders to

the lads to pass these bodies in the chain.

The only other Inspector I saw was an Inspector from the Training

Department, Rob and I forget his second name. He was there and I

believe there was Inspector SYKES there. I can't recall now who I did

see of the officers, I remember seeing Bob GUTCHER and several other

officers.

Eventually we got all the bodies from behind the wall and they were on

the pitch and were either being tendered to by officers, St. John's

Fire Service oh, I recall as we were getting a body out, I recall that

there were signs of life in his chap, a young man and we shouted and

screamed for oxygen and the Fire Service came and they got cylinders

of oxygen and they then treat this chap with the oxygen, whether he

was dead or not, I don't know. The majority in that pile were dead

obviously. When we'd got the bodies out we remained in that enclosure.

We hadn't time to think, I wasn't conscious of the spectators around

me, and I never gave them a thought, but after the bodies had been

removed, we in that enclosure, then became very very conscious of the

spectators in the seating area above us, and for the first tune, I

became frightened and I feared that the anger was going to be vented

on us and I said, "There's gonna be trouble, I can see there's gonna

be trouble." They were really angry. I did in fact speak to Chief

Superintendent NESBIT and said, "You know we're gonna have trouble

here," and then he said, "Get them out, get the officers out onto the
                                                                 PAGE 12
                                                                 S2498

pitch." I remember saying to Steve COOK and John HILL, "Get those

girls out." Meaning our Policewomen and I remember in particualr

having Policewoman MARSH, Kaz MARSH, Jill DONNELLY and

Julie NESBIT who were all extremely upset and in particular Kaz MARSH

who was justs shaking and I remember telling Steve COOK and John HILL

and Kevin YARROW not to lose the girls, in any event to look after

those girls. John NESBIT then obviously appreciated the situation and

saw that those fans, they were hurling abuse at us. I've got to be

honast, I didn't see anything thrown at us, it was the verbal abuse,

and you could feel the anger that was being vented on us, and I don't

frighten easily. I've been in one or two situations, but I was

frightened and I was wondering what we were going to do, whether we

wera going to turn and run, because there was a crowd behind us. This

was brought heme when one of the Police Photographers, Dennis BOND,

cams and he actually spoke to me, I never gave it a thought at that

tirria, he was dressed in civilian clothes and he came and the next

thing he was virtually surrounded by angry supporters who were

milling on the pitch and came away, but as I walked over I saw another

crowd further over to the left near to the control box surrounding

another Police Photographer, I don't know his name. I found out

latar his name was Spike, and officers had to virtually drag him

out.

I can't recall seeing anyone else getting hold of that situation other

than Chief Superintendent NESBIT and Superintendent GREENWOOD and

there were a couple of Inspectors there in particular, this Inspector

Rob and I forget his name from Training, who I spoke to.

I can't recall any other officer coming until I saw the A.C.C. Mr

JACKSON come. Whether he'd been there and I hadn't seen him I don't

know, but he was the only one when we got all the bodies out. It was

in my book, it was down to John NESBIT, and Superintendent GREENWOOD
                                                               PAGE 13
                                                               S2498

and all those lads who worked just bloody fantastically.

We then eventually got an order from Chief Superintendent NESBIT to

try and get the spectators off the pitch and to try and get them frcm

the ground. Oh, I'd previously heard an appeal by DALGLISH which went

down very well, and someone else said that the Notts Forest Manager,

CLOUGH, had been on the pitch but we didn't see him. But another thing

that struck me is that an announcement was made over the Police tannoy

by a Police Officer, I presume asking the spectators to leave and when

he was making it I was worried that that's when we'd have seme real

trouble, but in actual fact they just went, certainly out of the

seating area, and it was then that Chief Superintendent NESBIT said,

"Try and get hold of seme blokes and try and coax them all, let's try

and get 'em out and off the pitch," and we did, and they went, there

was no trouble, we didn't have to even speak to anybody sharply, they

went and I didn't experience any trouble until saw one tall Liverpool

supporter in a blue shirt and I actually heard him saying, "We ought

to have a riot." He said that a couple of times. I think it would

hava been foolish to try and apprehend him or anything, but when we

did go and speak to him, seme of his own supporters got hold of him,

probably he was so upset obviously he was angry and one can understand

that, but he did in fact listen to his own mates who we spoke to as

well, and they went and I didn't see him again.

I don't know what time it was but we eventually went and were told to

go back into the stand where the briefing earlier had taken place. I

remamber asking a Chief Inspector BEAL if anyone had thought to inform

the Division that no Police Officers were involved in any injuries or

tragedy. He went away and came back and announced to the officers that

wera there that this had been done, they were doing it and that

provisions were being made for us to go Claywheels Lane. We were

diracted to Claywheels Lane where I saw Superintendent Brougham of the



                                                                         2667
                                                                       PAGE 14
                                                                       S2498

        Traffic Division. I informed him that the majority of Rotherham

        officers had been involved in the removal of bodies from the terrace

        and that I thought they ought to be taken back to Rotherham. Again he

        was very good, I don't know where he got the bus frcm or buses but he

        certainly got seme buses. He told me that he would provide drivers to

        taka any officer hone who couldn't drive and we were more or less

        busad away back to Rotherham.

        It's very hard to describe the horrendous scenes, it's alright three

        days later being able to talk about it and I have said that's what we

        get paid for but I've seen the effects on the Detectives that I've

        worked with. I saw the effect on Kev YARROW, Steve COOK, who at work

        can handle any situation but I saw the effect of that. I didn't see

        John CHARLES again, I know he got tied up in the gymnasium, it was an

        horrific experience. In 31 years on the Police I never thought that I

        would witness the horrific scenes that we did meet on entering the

        ground. I would like to say that every bobby that I worked with gave

        everything he'd got, did everything he had to do, and made me after 31

        years doubly proud that I became a copper and I know that the more I

        think about it, I thought of young lads, probably seme with only one

        or two years in and I looted at them thinking although my sons aren't

        on the job, they're my sons' age and what a bloody marvellous job, and

        also the Policewomen. Those Policewomen were absolutely terrific.

        Obviously criticisms will be levelled at us and I'm sure we can take

        that and I'm sure that the majority of officers can level criticism

        back but at this stage, it'll do no good whatsoever.

           On Saturday 9 April 1988 090488 I was on uniform duty at the FA Cup

           Semi-Final tie between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest PC at the

           Hillsborough Stadium.

           On that date I was briefed to be in charge of a group of Officers to

           be engaged in Leppings Ln to carry out searches of fans arriving with

           a view to finding offensive weapons, banners, alcohol etc.

           I can remember that deployed with me were; Detective Constable HOBSON,

           Detective Constable SHELTON, Detective Constable HUBBARD, Police

           Constable NESBIT.

           On this day the Leppings Ln end of the ground was designated to the

           Liverpool fans.

           At about 11.30am 1130 with the above officers I took up position with

           the above mentioned Officers prior to the entrance gates and

           turnstiles, close to the bridge in Leppings Ln.
                                                                         PAGE   2
                                                                         S2498A

        The turnstiles opened sometime after 12 o'clock 1200 and as a group we

        carried out our designated duties of searching arriving fans and in

        general giving them advice and directing them to the turnstiles to

       which their ticket was allocated.

       As the afternoon went on, it became clear that some of the fans had

        arived without tickets and they were instructed to leave the area to

        avoid congestion.

       At no time during this exercise did we form a human barrier in order

        to search every arriving fan, it was more or less left to each

        individual team to select at random fans for searching.   To cordon off

        the area and search every fan would have been a massive task.    In fact

        as it got closer to the kick off there was an increase in arrivals and

        searching became virtually impossible.

        I can recall that spare tickets were handed to myself and members of

        my team and they in turn were handed to fans without tickets and I

        might add that these were selective, one man with a young boy comes to

        mind.   Overall there was little problem on this date and whilst it was

        extremely busy the fans were inside the ground at kick off or just

        after and on completion of this duty I, together with the other

        Officers, took up a position in the lappings ln stand during the match.

        I can say on this date the volume of fans was less and more well

        behaved than this year.

        I am a Detective Inspector in the     South Yorkshire Police     and am in

        charge of the Force Serious Crime Squad.

        On I believe the 8 April 1989 (080489) I received       a telephone call at

        my home asking if I was available     to perform duty at the     Sheffield

        Wednesday Football Ground on the occasion of the F.A. Cup Semi Final

        the following Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489).      It subsequently

        transpired that Inspector Brennan of 'C' Division had been deputed

        but he for some reason was unavailable.

        I agreed to work and at 9.45am (0945) on Saturday 15 April 1989

        (150489) I attended the North Stand of the football ground Where I

        took charge of Serials 39 and 40 and was briefed by the senior

        officers present. I then allowed both serials who eat their packed

        meals, and then briefed them myself as to our particular duties which

        involved the reception of coaches on Halifax Road.       I made my way to

        Halifax Road near to Chaucer School and deployed one serial to

        actually receive the coaches and another spread out along that road

        back towards the ground to ensure where possible that the Liverpool

        supporters remained in the coaches until they were parked.

We were not particularly busy until about 2pm (1400) when marry

coaches began to arrive as a result of the first reception area being

filled.   This was situated on Claywheels Lane.

We gradually as coaches arrived worked our way down Halifax Road

closer to the ground and there were no difficulties experienced, the

supporters appeared to be in good spirits and few of the coach

passengers appeared to have been drinking.   Other supporters who had

arrived by private car and vans also walked past us and a number of

these appeared to have been drinking but except for the odd word of

advice, no other action was necessary.

As the time moved towards kick off, I could hear radio messages

reflecting difficulties in the control of the crowd at the Leppings

Lana turnstiles and I could understand such difficulties as I have

previously been on duty at that location years ago and on big

occasions arranging orderly queues of supporters who are inclined to

arrive near to kick off time is a problem.   I gathered the units

together and walked the short distance to the junction of the main

road with Claywheels Lane.   My radio had not been working

particularly well and I listened in to my Sergeants radio.    We were

supposed to return to the Traffic Garage for meal but a message was

received that all available Officers were to go to the ground.      I

walked with my units together with a number of others along Leppings

Lana and on reaching the turnstiles I saw a number of Policemen lined

up but few supporters.   I did not understand what was happening and

the radio was a succession of unintelligible messages.     I told both

my Sergeants to gather their serials together and I went to try and

find out what was happening.   I walked towards the service road to the

right of the turnstiles and saw an Ambulance.     There were officers

rendering first aid to two people lying on the ground and I could
MEEK                    ROBERT MCCULLOCH


hear supporters shouting that it was my fault and similar comments

were directed at other officers around me.     I ran through a gate and

down the tunnel that leads to the area behind the Leppings Lane

goal.   I wanted to know what was happening and I saw people milling

about in front of me.    I don't know how but I went forward onto the

running track and saw people lying on the ground and a parked

Ambulance with two persons inside.    I was stood at a door to the

terracing and I then started shouting at officers round me to lift

fans who were being carried towards me frcm the terracing to help me

lift them out of the crowd.    I helped both injured and uninjured fans

off the terracing and told officers to lift them away from the track

to allow others through.    I don't know   howlongthis went on but I

began to realise that to my left was a heap of injured.    I was

shouting at officers near to me to carry the injured away and render

first aid. I then heard someone saying 'This ones alive' and it was

then I thought there may be fatalities but I couldn't accept that the

people I was struggling to lift out were dead.    There were supporters

on the terracing throwing articles towards us and they were shouting

threats at me.   I couldn't understand why and kept thinking what are

they blaming me for, I just couldn't grasp what was happening.       I

lifted what seoned a lot of people outand some stage I saw a body of

a young man being passed to me.   He was purple and as we lifted him

he hit his head on the top of the wall.    I shouted 'mind his head' or

something and then thought, he's dead you idiot, get him out of the

way.    I was still telling officers to assist the injured as I moved

away from what had now become the exit from the terracing and I

encouraged fans and Police Officers to rip the wire netting away from

the area of the exit to allow more room.     How long I carried the

bodies I do not know but eventually the area in front of me cleared
MEEK                    ROBERT MCCULLOCH                                   4


and I had chance to look round at the playing area irrmediately behind

me.    Thinking about it now I presume that all except for two that I

lifted out were dead.     Those two showed signs of life but the others

did not.     Sane of the people we had laid on the grass had their faces

covered and were obviously dead but I couldn't accept that and wanted

to help them.

I eventually accepted that I was surrounded with dead people and that

there was nothing I could do.     I completely lost track of time and

can not even guess how long I was involved in what I have described.

I would estimate I entered the terracing between 3.10pm (1510) and

3.15pm (1515).

I then wanted the injured and bodies removing and tried to ask on the

radio for ambulances but the radio was just a succession of messages.

In retrospect I don't know if I actually tried to get through or if

the radio was so jammed that it was inpossible.

I was finding it difficult to accept that these people had to lay

there and was angry that no ambulances had been sent to us.    The one

ambulance that was there moved away from the area behind the goal and

I could then see many more dead and injured on the other side of the

goal area.

The next thing I recollect is supporters running up to me and telling

me again that it was my fault and sane wanting to fight me.     One in

particular was dragged away from me by his friends.     I was angry and

frustrated that I couldn't do anything to help people and found it

difficult to keep my temper.     I tried to calm down sane Police

Constables who were also feeling the same way and then, for some

reason the Liverpool supporters began to charge towards the

Nottingham Forest supporters on the Spion Rep.     I started to form a

line across the centre of the pitch and as I was doing so a
MEEK                  ROBERT MCCULLOCH


Suparintendent came to me and said something like 'Get a line of

officers, keep them apart.' I said I was doing that and continued to

do so.   I was joined at around this time or just before by Detective

Sergeant Morton who was working in uniform and he stayed with me.

Mysalf and others eventually formed the line and I must admit that

the prospect of a riot in front of the Spion Kop frightened me.      I

shouted at Officers to keep the line intact and then met Chief

Superintendent NESBIT who told me to get a line of Police dogs in

front of the Spion Kop.   Detective Sergeant MORION used his radio to

ask for the Police dogs and they were very quickly in position,      this

made me feel much better as I felt that we were now to some degree at

any rate controlling what was happening.    There were several

incidents of disorder around the Police line and I remember

supplementing one end near to the players tunnel with officers that

wera stood behind the line.

People young and old were coning up to me enquiring as to missing

friands and asking if people were really dead.     I lied to them.   I

said I didn't know and that although I knew there were injured, I was

not sure if anyone was dead.     I was still finding the acceptance of

the deaths almost inpossible on a personal basis and that is why I

lied to them.

A young boy, probably eleven years of age came up to us and asked if

any young people had been hurt.     I said I didn't know and he said

that his friend was missing and that it was his fault because he had

insisted he came to the match.     I almost broke down at this stage but

managed to reassure him as best I could, helped by Detective Sergeant

Morton and he walked back towards the Leppings Lane terracing.

This period of time is inpossible to estimate but I kept enquiring if

the match had been cancelled.     I felt very strongly that it should
MEEK                  ROBERT MCCULLOCH


have been and I put this point of view to a number of senior officers

who approached me.   Eventually this decision was made and I took half

the line of officers from the centre of the pitch to the Penistone

Road junction with Herries Road to supervise the Nottingham

supporters as they left.     Detective Sergeant MORION remained with me

for comnunication and there was a uniform Chief Inspector there but I

can't remember who it was.

I was engaged in this duty for some time and when the Nottingham

supporters had cleared the ground and went to the North stand where

officers were gathered.

I searched for my two serials with whom I had lost contact since

entering the ground and with the help of Police Sergeant CLOKE who

was in charge of serial 40 I located all but three Police Constables

and the Sergeant who was in charge of serial 3.

I talked to two Police Constables who were part of serial 39 who had

obviously been present at the incident and asked them to write down

briefly what they had seen.    They went away to do that and same short

time later, after a de brief from a senior officer in the stand I

sent all my officers present plus the two who had by then completed

statements to Claywheels Lane for transport back to Rotherham.

I then attended a short briefing of Inspectors and above in front of

the Police Control Room by Chief Superintendents MOLE and NESBIT and

returned to Police Headquarters.

I should add that I am confused as to my exact position in front of

the terracing.   I at the time of the incident believe that I was

lifting people from the terracing through a gate but it may have been

a hole in the wire netting, which with my encouragement was further

torn away from its frame at some stage to enlarge the hole.

I also pulled two police officers from the terracing and one of these
        MEEK                   ROBERT MCCULLOCH                                 7


        I have since identified as Police Sergeant 758 MDRGAN, 'F' Division

        who confirms this.    That officer left the terracing when I believe

        all the dead and injured had been removed.

           INCIDENT AT HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND

           SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989



           1.   At 8.30am (0830) on Saturday, 15 April, 1989 (150489) I reported

           for duty at Hackenthorpe Police Station, supervised the embussing of

          the 'E' Sub Division contingent of men, and then went in a convoy of

          one SYT double decker bus and two marked police transits to

          Hillsborough Football Ground.    We arrived at the ground about 9.15am

           (0915) obtained cups of tea, etc. and were then told to take our

          places in the North Stand for 10am (1000) briefing.

          2.     I was in charge of serials 61 to 64 which were mobile transit

          patrols, none of those serials comprised any officer frcm 'El' Sub

          Division and I therefore made my way to row 35 to liaise with my

          serials.     I made my first contact with same of those officers about
                                                                    PAGE    2
                                                                    S1812

 9.50am (09500) as they began to take their seats.

3.   After the main 10am (1000) briefing by Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield and other senior officers I arranged for the four

sergeants in my serials to be briefed by me: this consisted of

reminding them of their geographical areas of responsibility, checking

that they all had wide previous experience of policing the ground -

which they had, and instructing them to pay regular attention to

licensed premises in their areas. They were then told to brief their

own serials.

4.   I had been fully briefed by Superintendent Chapman and Chief

Inspector Price at the Special briefing which was held at 10am

(1000) on the day before and it was only necessary for Mr. Chapman and

I to have a very brief conversation on the Saturday morning.       I can

hardly recall what we said on the Saturday morning but I think it

centred on checking public houses.     He had told me to remain with

serial 62 (call sign Tango Eight).

5.   At 11.15am (1115) on Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) I went on

patrol covering the Southey Green area with Tango Eight and visited

various public houses in that area.    We were responsible for

Nottingham Forest fans but were not sent to any incidents of violence

or disorder created by them.   As time wore on it was obvious that a

reasonable proportion of fans were becoming under the influence of

drink but they were all good-humoured.

6.   About 2.40pm (1450) I began to notice that many of the fans who

had been in the public houses on Herries Road were beginning to make

their way to the football ground.     Quite a few were under the

influence of alcohol and noisy but not overly disorderly: to have

tried to arrest any at this stage would have been counter-productive

in that it could have been the catalyst for a major disturbance caused

by other fans trying to prevent arrests.    Because the fans were in a
                                                                      PAGE      3
                                                                      S1812
 good mood I felt it the better alternative to 'jolly' them along.

 7.    About 2.45pm (1445), or possibly slightly later, I was sitting in

 my transit vehicle in Herries Road, near to Herries Drive when we

 began to hear radio messages that indicated that the officers in the

 I^PPings Lane were experiencing difficulties with the crowd and they

 (the police) wanted a gate opening.        I believe they said      'A'.

 Numerous messages were passed asking for the gates to be opened that

 it became the subject of humour conment by the officers in the transit

 and myself.     Comments such as "Do you think someone wants a gate

 opening?"     "I get the distinct impression someone wants a gate

opening .      I seem to recall saying words like "I can imagine someone

making 'T' shirts with "Open the Gate" on them".        The whole matter

became a big joke at this time (clearly we were not to know what was

to happen later).

8.    About 2.50pm (1450) or slightly later I was still in my transit on

Herries Road when Inspector Bateman, 'C2' Sub Division walked past me

towards the ground, he too made jocular conment about "Do you think

someone wanted a gate opening?" Again the situation was the subject of

humorous comment by us all.        He then continued towards the ground.    I

cannot recall whether the gate was in fact opened but I seem to think

there was a radio message from Control giving permission for that to

happen.

9.    About 3.00pm (1500) I seen to recall an officer, possibly

Superintendent Marshall, saying words like "We're losing it" and asked

for more manpower.     I recall an officer, possibly Inspector Sewell,

saying that he had 100 men in the gymnasium and that he would send 5

serials.     A voice then said,     "Send everybody". I then thought that

there was a serious disorder situation and decided to take my serial

into Penistone Road North.        I did not inform control because the radio

was very busy.    We parted the transit on that road and I took my men
                                                                     pact :
                                                                     S1812
 into the ground to a position between the North Stand and Spion Kop

 and near to the gymnasium.

 10. Once inside the ground I saw there were a number of police

 officers standing in a state of readiness.    I also saw a large number

 of dogs and handlers, together with some Ifounted officrs.   I saw

 either Inspector Sewell or Chief Inspector Sumner, informed the

 officer how many men I had with me and asked for instructions.      Wte

 were told to remain where we were and to await further information.

 11. After a couple of minutes I decided to walk onto the pitch area

 between the North Stand and Spion Kop. I looked towards the Lappings

 Lane end and saw a large crowd of supporters on the pitch.   The game

was not in progress.     I believed it was a pitch invasion and

considered we had potentially a very serious public disorder situation

on our hands, although I could not see any fighting.    I then returned

to my men.

12. Shortly afterwards, a senior officer, I think it was

Superintendent Chapman, told me to bring all the men behind me —

approximately 75 to 100 officers onto the playing area and to form a

cordon along the front of the North Stand.    I told the men to form a

cordon and also indicated this by holding out my arms horizontally to

my sides in the correct PSU fashion.    As I did this I was hit

by several coins which were thrown towards us by the crowd in the

North Stand.   The crowd were very hostile and kept indicating towards

the Leppings Lane end.

13. I then saw people being carried out on stretchers and hoardings

and I think that both police and civilians were doing this.       Owing to

the hostility of the crowd in the North Stand I felt that our presence

was aggravating the situation, which at this time I thought was one of

public disorder which had caused injuries, I radioed to Control to

explain the siutation and said that we should move.    I was instructed
                                                                   PAGE     5
                                                                   S1812
 to remain in situ.

 14. A few minutes later, because by now the crowd in the North Stand

 were shouting obscentities at us, were becoming far more hostile and

 aggitated, and shouting things like "Get over there and help", I again

 radioed to Control and said that I was taking the cordon away because

 we appeard to be seriously inflaming the situation.    Control agreed

 and I indicated for the cordon to move away and towards the halfway

 line.   At this point I was still not really aware of the full enormity

 of the situation.    As we moved away towards the halfway line the crowd

 in the North Stand cheered us.

 15. We began to form a loose cordon along the halfway line and as we

did so, a large number of people, whom I presumed were Liverpool fans,

began to run towards us from the Leppings Lane end.     They ran through

our loose cordon towards the Spion Kop (the Nottingham Forest end) and

were shouting obscenities such as "Kill the bastards".     "Fucking kill

them, it's their fault".    Police officers ran towards the Spion Kop

and prevented the Liverpool fans from trying to climb into the Kop.

We managed to get the fans back towards the halfway line by both

force and persuasion.

16. Chief Superintendent Nesbit then joined us and ordered a cordon

across the full width of the pitch.     I then gave the ccmnand for that

to occur.   We then slowly moved the cordon towards the centre of the

pitch and remained at the halfway line.     By this time, such was the

number of officers who had trickled onto the pitch, Mr. Nesbit ordered

a double cordon, which I arranged.    By this time, there were about 100

to 150 officers involved in the cordon.

17. It appeared to me that the whole football stadium could have

erupted and I was very concerned.     I was still worried that the major

police problem was one of potential large scale public disorder and it

was only slowly that the realisation dawned on us all that it had been
                                                                    pac t :   6
                                                                    S1812

 a crushing incident which had caused the injuries.   Slowly the rumours

 began to spread that people were dead and the numbers continued

 to inflate.   I was first told by a police colleague that "People were

 dead", then "Five are dead", then "Twenty" and so on.     I do not think

 that any police officer in the cordon believed that such a high figure

 of dead was true.

 18. As we stood in the cordon, still expecting trouble, a number of

drunken fans kept running up to individual officers or groups of

officers and shouting obscenities such as "You've fucking killed them,

you bastards".   It's your fucking fault", and so forth.    They were

obviously distressed and I gave instructions that people should not be

arrested unless absolutely necessary as I felt that any display of

force could have caused the crowds in the stands to have created

further violence.    I was concerned that large scale violence would

break out, either directed at opposing fans or at the police.     I was

convinced that there would be mass violence towards the police as it

was obvious that a lot of fans believed we had been responsible for

the injuries/deaths.

19. I became aware that scaneone was speaking over the public

announcement system, I presumed it was Messrs. Dalgleish and Clough,

because the crowds hushed when they spoke and they seemed to have a

calming effect on the crowds.   I would have preferred this to have

happened some time earlier as I am sure it would have allowed the

police, particularly my cordon, to have participated more actively in

rescue rather than public disorder prevention.   I would add that

earlier announcements over the public address system had in the main

been ineffectual and hardly audible, either because of the quietness

of the individual using the system, or the actual poor quality of the

system.

20. After the calming influence of Mr. Dalgleish I felt it was safe
                                                                   PAGE    7
                                                                   S1812
 for me, qualified first aid instructor, to leave the cordon and do

 what I could for the injured.   I went to some Liverpool fans who were

 wandering aimlessly about and told them to grab a 'hoarding stretcher"

 and follow me.

 21. I walked amongst a large number of people who were lying on the

 ground and being treated by police officers, ambulance personnel -

 both local authority and St. John, fireman and civilians, but was

 informed by a senior police officer, possibly an inspector, that there

 were sufficient stretchers and all casualties were being looked

 after.   I thanked the fans who had accompanied me, asked them to put

their hoarding to one side, told them to sit around the perimeter, and

returned to my cordon.

22. A short time later, an announcement was made over the public

address system that the game was not to be played and fans were

requested to remain in the ground for the time being.   However, fans

started to leave the Spion Kop from each end and I was instructed by

Superintendent Chapman, who had been near the cordon for most of the

time, to take half the cordon outside the ground and to form cordons

across Penistone Road North to control opposing fans.   I took

approximately 100 to 150 officers out onto Penistone Road North via

the 'gymnasium entrance' and we formed various cordons, both along the

length and width of that road.   I helped to supervise crowd control

but we did not experience any disorder in this area.

23.   Whilst supervising the remnants of the crowds who were leaving

the ground I heard a call that fighting was taking place in

Hillsborough Park.   I saw nearby one of the transits from my serial

call sign Tango Ten with PC 718 Pont as driver accompanied by PS 2737

Hallett his serial sub ccmnander.   I collected a number of officers

who were standing near me and together with the above named officers

I attended that particular incident, which had cleared by the time we
                                                                             PAGE    8

          arrived.    We then remained on patrol and attended a further call to

          Hillsborough Park but again all was quiet on arrival.

          24.   We also attended the Bassett Public House, where the front

         windows had been damaged by, it is believed, Liverpool fans, who had

         tried to get the licensee to open up so they could use the telephone,

         ffe refused and they broke the windows along the length of the pub

         frontage.     A crime report was submitted but there are no useful lines

         of enquiry.

         25.    At 6.55pm we attended the North Stand for de-briefing but were

         sent out to an incident at the Northern General Hospital where it was

         believed that relatives were causing problems to staff.    Otter

         officers had arrived before us and it was ascertained that the Press

         had been harrassing relatives which had caused them to take issue with

         the Press.    No arrests were made and the matter was dealt with

         sensitively by the police.

                                   'C' DIVISION PROSECUTIONS DEPARTMENT

             At 8.30 am (0830), Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489), I paraded for

             duty at Main Street Police Station, Rotherham.       I there met up with

             other members of my serial and together we set off for the

             Hillsborough Stadium at about 9.00 am (0900) arriving at about 9.25

             am (0925).     I then liaised with Inspector MEEK and at 9.55 am (0955)

             the serial paraded in the North Stand for briefing.       After briefing

             at about 10.30 am (1030) we took meal and then left the stadium and

             made our way on foot to Halifax Road to conmence phase one which was

             recaption of Liverpool coaches.

             On arrival at Halifax Road I deployed officers in pairs spread out

             along Halifax Road on the Barnsley bound carriageway frcm the junction

             with Cowper Road to the junction with Wilcox Road.       Two
                                                                  PAGE        2
                                                                  S2708

policewomen in the serial were deployed in listing all coaches

arriving by obtaining the proprietors name and the registration mark

of each vehicle.   Two coaches were already parked at the location.

All passengers had left the vehicles prior to our arrival and these

vehicles contained drivers only.    Traffic using Halifax Road was

fairly light until about 12 noon (1200) when I noticed a steady build

up, particularly of private vehicles.    Many fans were arriving in

private cars, mini buses and Transit type vehicles.    These were being

parked up on the service roads adjacent to Halifax Road and in side

streets in the vicinity.

Another two or three coaches arrived between approximately 12 noon and

12.45 pm (1200 and 1245).    All passengers were good humoured and did

not present us with any problems.    I made a point of boarding each

coach and speaking to all passengers via the coach microphone system.

My intention was to 'set the mood' and in doing so explain in a

friendly way what was required of than and to inform everyone present

that bottles, cans banners, etc, would not be allowed.    Any such items

they may have had in their possession therefore would be best kept

well away frcm the ground.    This they accepted well and left quite

good humoured and in what I would describe as good spirits.

Coaches came in steadily until about 1.45 pm (1345) after which time

they began to arrive in considerable numbers.    I continued to board as

many coaches as possible working this duty in conjuction with

Inspector Meek and Sergeant Doyle but on occasions we had difficulty

in keeping up with the numbers that were arriving.    Out of a total of

53 or 54 coaches that arrived, we managed to board something like 40

or 45 and get the message across to fans.

The vast majority were good humoured and accepted what was said to

them without question.     I noticed that not all fans were

leaving coaches and heading in the general direction of the ground.       A
                                                                  PAGE     3
                                                                  S2708

good numnber of them were visiting public houses, clubs and off

licensed premises and a considerable number were in possession of cans

or bottles of alcohol.

We continued coach reception until about 2.40 pm (1440) when the last

vehicle in the column was at a point opposite Southey Green road.    One

vehicle was leaking diesel oil badly and I contacted ground control

via the radio and requested the attendance of the fire brigade to

swill away diesel and also to standby due to the fire risk.    The fire

brigade arrived a short time later and I left the scene.    With other

members of the serial we commenced to slowly walk along Halifax Road

towards the ground.

At this time I saw two or three large groups of fans making their way

slowly from the White Horse Public House.     By this time many of than

were under the influence of drink although I do not recollect seeing

anyone who I would describe as being drunk.    Many were quite merry and

boisterous.   I saw a large number of cans and bottles had been

deposited on the footpath and grass verges and garden walls.

At 2.45 pm (1445) I was at the junction with Kilner Way and it

occurred to me that a good number of the fans would not reach the

ground in time for the start at 3.00 pn (1500).

We made our way to the junction of Claywheels Lane when at about 3.02

pm (1502) a message was passed over the radio that all officers were

to attend the ground immediately.   Together with a group of officers

consisting of several of my own serial and several of another, boarded

a policevan and attended immediately at the ground, arriving at about

3.04 pm (1504).

I entered the Leppings Lane entrance and went into the enclosure at

the rear of the West Stand.   The scene was one of utter chaos.   Many

hundreds of people were milling around aimlessly and I could see that

there were a considerable number of injured persons lying on the
                                                                 PAGE       4
                                                                 S2708

ground in the vicinity of the tunnel entrance leading to the terrace

of the West Stand.

Many people appeared to be in shock and a good number had consumed

alcohol.   The smell of alcohol was quite strong even in the open air.

Although there was no message over the radio at this time I sensed

that something was very wrong inside the ground.     I would describe the

atmosphere as being 'uneasy calm.' It was my opinion that a nasty

situation could have developed had large numbers of people emerged

from the ground via the tunnel as many of these casualties and people

attending to them would have been trampled on.     I then spoke to

several constables from another serial as by now I had become detached

from my own, to start lifting casualties and placing them outside the

ground perimeter wall near to the River Don.     I personally assisted in

lifting some 12-15 injured persons to the relative safety of this

area.

Ambulances began to arrive and had difficulty in reaching us due to

sheer numbers of people milling around at the Leppings Lane area.       I

then assisted in clearing a passage for the ambulances.     I liaised

with ambulance personnel and directed them to where they were needed.

I then returned to the enclosure and assisted in carrying out more

injured and this time taking them direct to waiting ambulances.      It

was here that I took hold of one casualty and realised that he was

dead.   He was a youth of 18-20 years dressed in blue jeans and I

believe a blue coloured shirt.   This body was placed adjacent to the

River Don near to the fencing at the top of the river bank.     Other

bodies were lying nearby and in total I counted sente eleven bodies

which had been placed in this location.

The forecourt area was gradually being cleared of casualties but many

people were still milling around looking for friends or relatives.

Many were in deep shock and several in an almost hysterical condition.
                                                                 PAGE     5
                                                                 S2708

At a time which I would guess would have been 3.20 to 3.25 pn (1520 to

(1525) I was approached by a fire brigade officer wearing a white

helmet.     I believe his rank was that of Station Officer and he asked

me where he and his men were needed.    Although I had not entered the

area into the tunnel due to the fact that I had not had time and

indeed    had more than enough to cope with on the outside, it was now

obvious to me that there were many more casualties inside the ground

and I suggested to him that they would best be employed inside the

ground itself.    The two fire crews with him entered the ground via the

tunnel to which I had directed them.

Ambulances began arriving quite frequently and the next period was

occupied with loading them with casualties and getting them away to

hospital.

It was at this stage that I became aware of a different mood of a

considerable number of fans.    A group of seme four or five youths all

of which appeared to be under the influence of drink, were

standing in the enclosure and screaming obscenities at police

officers.    Garments such as 'People are dying in there and you lot are

doing nothing about it' were being made by several people and their

mood had become very angry and abusive.

The chaos began to unfold and a degree of order was emerging in that

all the dead were placed in one area which was now screened off by

barriers and tarpaulin sheets many of the injured had been removed to

hospital and many of the friends and relatives had also left the scene

to go to hospital with them.     A line of police officers extended in

front of the barriers to give additional privacy frcm the fans that

were now leaving the West Stand and filing past into leppings Lane

thus preventing them frcm viewing these bodies and obviously the

possibility of a public order situation.

Fans were now slowly leaving the West Stand and here many of them were
                                                                          PAGE      6
                                                                          S2708

        still being quite hostile towards police officers.    The bulk of

        supporters from this end of the ground slowly cleared and the ground

        emptied.     I assisted in then loading the eleven bodies into ambulances

        which then took them to the temporary mortuary in the gymnasium.    All

        were male in the 18-35 age group.     I could not describe in detail how

        they were dressed.    Radio reception had been quite good throughout the

        day even when I was seme 1 1/2 miles from the ground at Halifax Road.

        I did not however receive any transmissions from just after 3.00 pn

        (1500) onwards until a message was received at about 4.45 pn (1645).

        This was for all officers to re-form in the West Stand for a de­

        briefing.

        After de-briefing I then re-formed my serial and at about 5.45 pn

        (1745) we walked to Claywheels Lane Garage to await transport for

        Rotherham.

        The remainder of serial 40 were stood down from duty at 7.00 pn (1900)

        except PC 1961 LAWRENCE who had stayed on at Hillsborough in

        connection with mortuary duties.

           On duty at 0900 hours Ecclesfield Police Station.

           Briefing in North stand at Hillsborough at 0945 hours approximately,

           designated serial 49, mobile transit patrol, call sign TANGO FOUR.

           Other officers on this serial are 837 CAROL, 2976 WILLIAMS, 333

           OGILVIE, 1822 HUTCHINSON and 407 JOHNSON.       Insp. ROBINSON in charge

           of serials 48 and 49 decides to ride in our vehicle.

           After a quick packed meal we drive out to the Foxhill area. Things

           are very quiet for ages.      After a while we receive a report that

           there are a lot of football fans in the Fox Public House on Foxhill

           Road.   Insp. ROBINSON and 333 go inside but it is not too busy.

           They have words with the landlord and we leave.        This was probably

           around 1230 hours.      A short time later we have a report of youths

           urinating outside a chip shop in Trafalgar Road.        When we turn up the

           youths have gone and the area is quiet.        Shortly afterwards we are
                                                                    PAGE    2
                                                                    S2496

told that a youth has just urinated in someone's garden on Wilcox

Road.     We stop a group of about four Liverpool supporters walking

uphill away frcm the ground.      They are all drinking beer from cans,

none admit urinating. We turn them around and direct them towards the

ground.      It's pretty obvious that they intend drinking for a bit

longer before going to the match.

We carry on patrolling the Foxhill area and it's still comparitively

quiet.      The Fox is getting busier but nothing exceptional happening.

The Gate and the Travellers are closed and just letting regulars in

the back doors by the looks of it.

At approx. 1305 hours we are directed tc

                   where seme youths have allegedly stolen seme property.

We see the complainant who states that six youths have been into the

stop.     They've all picked up a handful of sweets and run outside.

She attempted to stop one of them and was clouted on her head for her

troubles.     They all got into a white van and she took the registered

number.

At 1320 hours the van is spotted and we follow it into the car park of

the White Horse on the opposite side of Halifax Road.      The six youths

are arrested.      They all smell of drink apart frcm the driver.    They

all deny being involved, a couple are a little agressive.      We take

them to Ecclesfield Police Station and book them in etc.      This takes

until approximately 1445 hours.      PC OGILVIE is left at Ecclesfield

with the prisoners.

We actually resume frcm Ecclesfield shortly before the last prisoner

is incarcerated.      When we begin to receive transmissions frcm the

ground again we can hear that there is a problem with the crowd at the

Leppings Lane turnstiles.      Someone is requesting permission to open a

gate to relieve the pressure.      There is obviously a problem with the

communications due to the noise of the crowd.      We are having problems
                                                                       PAGE     3

hearing messages ourselves.        Foxhill appears quiet, we drive around

the ground and this area is also rather quiet.        We don't go in for

our scheduled meal break as they are obviously having problems inside

the ground.        We start hearing requests for ambulances.      We park in

Leppings Lane and people are leaving the ground.        We hear that there

is a fatality inside, then we hear that three are dead.          We can't

believe it.        More people are leaving the ground now and Leppings Lane

is filling up.        A lot of the fans are having a go at the officers on

horses, who are at the side of us.        They are dragged away by their

mates.        All available officers are then directed to the Leppings Lane

Transits are required to act as ambulances. PC HUTCHINSON takes

the transit to Penistone Road and we don't see him again.          At the

Leppings Lane end we are directed to the gymnasium.           I see a line of

Police Officers across the tarmac between the North Stand where it

joins the kop and the gym.        They are preventing people getting access

to the gym area.        I see stretchers being brought out of the gym with

injured people on that are being placed into ambulances and taken

away.        People arrive at the line of Policemen saying they have lost

relatives and friends.        They are not allowed through.     We set up a

makeshift casualty enquiry desk and fill sheet after sheet with

details of missing people.        Inspector ROBINSON canes back fron the

gym and tells me that there are at least seventy five dead and

possibly more.       We initially sit the relatives and friends in the

North Stand and sometime later a coach arrives for them.

When everyone had gone we walked to Claywheels Lane where we found our

transit.       We were directed to take a meal break but we didn't feel

like it.       We attended two reports of football fans fighting at the

Northern General Hospital but on each occasion they ted gone and it

was quiet.

         We eventually got back to Claywheels Lane around 1900 hours and went

         off duty.

         It transpired that of the six prisoners, only three had tickets for

         the game.

             FA CUP SEMI FINAL LIVER V NOTTS. FOREST 9TH APRIL 1988 (090488)

             On the above date I was in charge of a serial at this venue and our

             brief was to vet Liverpool supporters going through the turnstiles at

             the Leppings Lane end of Hillsborough stadium.

             We were in position about 1.00 pm (1300) and initially there was a

             trickle of supporters and each one was spoken to, was able to produce

             their ticket and we ensured that no 'article' was being taken into the

             ground.

             At 2.00 pm (1400) the trickle of supporters increased but nevertheless

             at that stage we were able to form thorn into orderly queues and frisk

             them for 'articles'.      At approximately half past two (1430) the crowd

             increased to the extent that we were only able to check one in four

             persons caning up to the turnstiles.       At ten to three (1450) or

             thereabouts the situation arose where we were checking at randan one
                                                                         PAGE     2

         in probably every twenty, because the crowd had increased to the

         extent that there was no longer any possibility of orderly queues but

         just a mass of support heading towards the turnstiles.

         Shortly after this the pressure of the crowd was such that I found

         myself and at least one other officer hemmed up against the wall

         between the turnstile gates, and I because of my height and weight was

         at least able to give myself seme breathing space by pushing against

         the supporters close to me.   I was able to call for the assistance of

         a Mounted Officer and when he arrived he formed a 'break' in the

         supporters to the extent that myself and other colleagues were at

         least able to get to the perifery of the crowd.

           On Saturday the 15 April 1989 (150489) I attended at Sheffield on the

           occasion of the FA Cup Semi Final between Liverpool and Nottingham

           Forest.

           I was in charge of serial 42 which consisted of 8 constables and in

           overall command of our sector was Insp BROQMHEAD.

           Our duties on this date were to patrol Halifax Road from Southey Green

           Road to Brewery Road, the PC's working in pairs.

           At 10 am (1000) that morning we were briefed at Hillsborough Stadium

           during which time we had had a packed meal, and then we were to our

           location.

           At 11 am (1100) the same morning I went with Insp BROQMHEAD to the

           White Horse public house where we spoke to the licensee who informed

           us that he intended to remain open until the commencement of the

           match.    He also informed us that he intended to keep an orderly crowd
                                                                   pact:  2
                                                                   S2683A

and would have doormen on to reinforce this.

At 12 noon (1200) the same day I saw that this public house was full -

there was no bother and everyone appeared in good humour.     I also

noticed that Threshers Off Licence close by was being fully supported.

Liverpool fans were queuing up to obtain cans of drink.

The public house was packed solid and the beer garden at the side was

also fully supported.    Supporters of Liverpool arriving by coach and

public transport and at 1 pin (1300) the same day myself and Insp

BRDOMHEAD had occasion to rebuke only one Liverpool fan who was

acting in a rowdy manner.    We checked this mans ticket, saw that it

was in order and warned him about his conduct.     There was no further

repetition of misconduct from this fan or any others even though the

majority had had taken a good deal to drink.     All in all they were

well behaved in this particular part of the town.

At 2 pin (1400) many supporters were still arriving, Threshers Off

Licence closed because they were sold out of canned beers.    One fan

had to be removed to hospital by ambulance when he had sat on the

ground and a piece of glass had cut his buttocks    the fans were still

in good humour and there was no animosity.     I spoke to several fans

who were looking forward to the    game.

During this period a family consisting of two elderly parents, their

son and daughter arrived at the White Horse for the purpose of

obtaining refreshment.    I informed them that only Liverpool fans were

present in the pub and even though they were sporting the Forest

colours they managed to get into the pub without incident.

At 2.40 pm (1440) the majority of fans started to make their way

towards Hillsborough.    Those that were left were drinking off.

At 2.55 pm (1455) Halifax Road at our point was practically deserted,

and I assembled the serial in order to move towards Claywheels Lane in

order to have our meal and then remain in reserve until the conclusion
                                                                  PAGE   3
                                                                  S2683A

of the game, whereupon we would take up our initial positions.

At 3 pin (1500) we reached the junction opposite Claywheels Lane when

we saw a number of serials leaving en mass and heading towards the

ground.   We inmediately followed although it wasn't obvious to us at

this time the reason for the exodus although the way these serials

wera moving my initial reaction was that trouble of some description

have happened either inside or outside the ground.

When we reached lappings Lane which was the nearest point to us we saw

a mass of Police and people.     Some Fire engines were in attendance,

parked outside the main exit gates, others arived later, Ambulances

wera attending. Saw that the main activity was near the turnstiles

area for the away supporters (Liverpool). The number of police in

this area was massive and there was a double cordon of officers across

the nearside of lappings Lane.     Many other officers had already gone

into the ground.     At this stage it still was not patently clear what

actually had happened.     One of my officers had a portable radio and

when te switched it on we heard that there had been a crush situation

inside the ground.     The radio response went on to include that a

concertina gate had been opened to allow more people into the ground

and that the game had been stopped.

Fans started to leave the ground by the exit gates and I instructed my

serial that we would remain in our position to see them leave the

ground.   The officers with the portable radio kept informing me that

there have been deaths starting from 3 then 12 then 20 then 40.       All

this time the Liverpool fans were leaving the ground there was a

torrent of abuse from them blaming the Police for opening the

concertina gate.     The majority of these people were in tears and I

instructed my serial to let the abuse ride over them unless any

physical action was taken against us.    None was.   Some fans actually

sympathised others gave words of encouragement and didn't place any
                                                                           PACE   4
                                                                           S2683A

         blarne on the Police, only on themselves for turning up late.

        After about an hour the exit of fans leaving Leppings Lane had ceased,

         and I took my serial into the ground where we saw that the ground was

         littered with paper, the wire fencing in Leppings Lane stand had been

        cut open, I presumed by Fire Brigade officers using bolt cutters.

        Whatever injured or dead there was had been removed and the ground was

        almost empty.

         I then took my serial back along Leppings Lane towards Claywheels Lane

        and during this walk shepherded some groups of Liverpool fans who were

        making their way back towards their transport.   One youth had been

        so distraught he was arguing with a resident from one of the side

        streets close to Leppings Lane and we had to step in quickly and

        restrain this youth to prevent an assault taking place.   He was taken

        by his friends and they went on their way.   When we reached the

        traffic island at Claywheels Lane we remained in this area as some

        Notts Forest supporters were hanging about waiting for their

        coach transport to leave from the nearby coach station.    They were

        spoken to and they were sent to the coach station to wait on their

        transport.We remained at this island until I received a radio message

        directing all serials to report to the North Stand of the ground for

        de briefing.

           At 7.45 am (0745) Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) I cortmenced duty at

           West Bar Police Station, Sheffield, in relation to FA Cup Semi Final

           duties, Liverpool versus Notts Forest, at the Hillsborough.I was in

           serial 9 consisting of PS795 BOUGH, PC101 BARLOW, 1399

           THOMPSON, 3158 GILL, 2632 HAYES, 3329 SEGERIUS, 3068 SOWERBY.

           At 8 am (0800) same date I collected the packed meals from PS

           THOMAS for my serial together with four personal radios from the

           parade room and liaised with PS BOUGH.    Phase 1 of our duty was

           to supervise the arrival of Notts Forest supporters at the Midland

           station, Sheffield, and escort them by PSV from the station to

           Hillsborough.    Myself and PS BOUGH organised our serial into twos

           as follows:- Myself and PC101 BARLOW, PS BOUOi and PC3068

           SOWERBY, PC1399 THOMPSON and PC3158 GILL, PC2632 HAYES,

           and PC3329 SERGERIUS, each pair having one personal radio between

them . We then went to the gymnasium at WBPS where we had our

refreshments prior to briefing in the gym by Ch.Insp KING and          SUPT

BATES.     After briefing at 9 am (0900) in the gym irtyself and PS

BOUGH re-grouped our serial in the parade room at WBPS and again

briefed our Serial 9 regarding our duties.      We then made our way to

the Midland Station in our respective pairs arriving at about 9.35 am

(0935). Myself and PC BARLOW escorted our first PSV load of Notts

Forest supporters to the Hillsborough ground who were very well

behaved and then returned back to the Midland Station.        I then

travelled on our last trip to Hillsborough with Notts Forest fans on

the lower deck. Some of them were obviously under the influence of

alcohol and were shouting and singing obsceneties.      On the way up to

the ground several of the fans were asking to get off the PSV in order

to urinate and some of them were let off the PSV.

During the journey I noticed a stream of liquid from the upper deck

which was most likely urine into the road.      The PSV arrived at

Hillsborough at about 2.20 pn (1420) and we emptied the PSV outside

the ground.    Together with PC BARLOW I then went to the gym at

Hillsbrough to regroup my serial.     All my serial was present there

with the exception of PS BOUCH and PC3068 SOWERBY.      I reported

to an Inspector who     I believe to be Insp SEWELL and was

told to remain on standby at the Gym.     I collected my Serial's meal

tickets and issued them to PC'S THOMPSON and GILL and PC

BARLCW and obtained a meal.     I then issued a further two tickets to

WPC WIDDOWSON from another serial as PC'S HAYES and SERGERIUS

had received their meal ticket and kept the remaining two meal for

PS BOUGH and PC SOWERBY.     I had nearly completed my meal when I was

again called to report to the reception desk.      I again reported to

Inspector SEWELL and informed him that five of my serial were

present.    He informed me to go with my serial to 'A' gate at Leppings
                                                                    PAGE     3
                                                                    S3333

Lane. I asked him inside or outside the ground and he stated to go

round the track as it would be quicker.    As I was talking to him

several officers ran out of the gym.    Some of these officers must have

been part of my Serial because all I could see at this time of my

serial was PC's THOMPSON and GILL.     I informed PC's THOMPSON

and GILL that we were to go to Leppings Lane 'A' Gate and we started

to make our way there. Also present were PS915 TATTERSHALL and       PC269

BR03MHEAD.   As we walked along the track I was in front and switched

my radio to Channel 25, the match channel.    I could see that the two

teams were on the pitch warming up.    The atmosphere was electric and

the noise was deafening. When I reached Leppings Lane end of the

ground I saw that the right hand section had ample rocm left as I

could see parts of the terracing steps.    On reaching the middle

section of the terracing I saw that people were packed like sardines

in a can and were being crushed up against the perimeter fence from

the pressure of the people behind them.     I could see the agony on the

faces of people being crushed against the wire mesh.    I realised

people's lives were in danger and that somehow the pressure had to be

relieved.    I looked for the gates from the middle section terracing

and saw a gate to the left of the goal which was closed.    I went to

this gate and opened it allowing fans out on to the playing area.      The

fans started scrambling through the gate on to the playing area.      Hie

gate was very narrow allowing only one person at a time through it.

Due to the fans building up on the playing area I went to the left

hand section terracing gate.    I could see that there was ample rocm in

this left hand section as again I could see the terraced steps in it.

I opened this gate and directed fans who were not injured into it.      I

then returned to the centre section gate which I had opened and people

wera still scrambling through it and other people were climbing the

fence.   I remember assisting one young girl who was completely
                                                                   PAGE     4

hysterical who stated she had lost her friend.     I told her to sit on

the perimeter fence to await the arrival of her friend.     I assisted

other people including two youths the elder of them stated they were

brothers and I informed him to stay with his younger brother on the

playing area.   Other officers were now at the gate I had opened and

assisting people through it.     I radioed to control in order to get

medical assistance to the scene but could not get any reply.      I then

saw an Inspector on the playing area.     I ran to him and told him we

needed medical teams present.     He replied, "It is in hand."   I then

returned to the centre section fence and tried to pull the wire mesh

away but it wouldn't give.     I then climbed on to the perimeter wall

and I could see people still getting crushed against the side railing

and I had visions of it collapsing due to the pressure on it.      I

shouted at the people in the left hand to get away from it and saw

Insp DONNELLY doing the same thing.     Some of the spectators started

to move away from it.   A group of about six Liverpool supporters in

the left hand pen started shouting abuse at me.     I couldn't hear what

they were shouting due to the noise but I could see the anger on their

faces.   I assisted people jumping over the fence onto the playing area

but couldn't reach the others on the terrace due to the wire mesh and

spikes pointing inwards.     I then eventually went into the left hand

section and helped carrying injured persons away that were being

lifted   over the fence from the middle section and handing them to

officers at the left hand section gate onto the playing area.      I

continued doing this with numerous people.    I can remember carrying a

young girl about 17 yrs of age who had been lifted from the centre

section into the L/H section and carried her out on to the ground with

another officer.   On laying her on the ground I saw that she was

unconscious due to her having swallowed her tongue.    Her tongue was

moved forward and I commenced cardiac massage on her chest.      The girl
                                                                      PAGE    5
                                                                      S3333

started coughing and I instructed the officer who had assisted me in

carrying her out to stop with her.     I then returned to the L/H pen and

further assisted carrying persons handed over the fence from the

middle section to the L/H section gate and handing them to officers at

this gate until the centre section was cleared.

Aftar the centre section was cleared I went back on to the playing

area and met up with my Inspector in charge of our serial, Inspector

HARPER.     I can remember DC BOND, Scenes of Crime Dept, going into

the centre section to try and obtain photographs of it.       As he started

to photograph the scene supporters started shouting abuse at

him and throwing objects at him.    He was instructed to get out of the

section because I heard Ch.Supt NESBITT shout, "Get him out of there."

I shouted to DC BOND, "Get out of there Dennis."       As DC BOND

cama out on to the playing area, a Liverpool       supporter shouted at

him, "You bastard," and made towards    DC BOND.     I stopped him and

said to him, "Calm down, he's a police photographer trying to get

evidence.    The man obviously thought he was a press photographer due

to DC BOND being in plain clothes and the man immediately calm

down on hearing my remark.

At about 4.25 pn (1625) I was instructed by Insp HARPER to carry

out Phase 3 duties which was to carry out PSV escort duties of Notts

Forest supporters from Penistone Rd back to the Midland railway

Station.    I gathered up my depleted serial PC'SlOl BARLOW, PC1399

THOMPSON, PC3158 GILL, together with another officer PC2618

HOULT frcm another serial and went to Penistone Rd.       I instructed

PC's THOMPSON and GILL to take the second PSV and myself and PC

BARLOW got on to another PSV and commenced our journey back to the

Midland station as soon as our PSV was full.       Our journey back to the

Midland Station was very slow due to the volume of traffic.         On our

journey back about six or seven Liverpool supporters came to door of
                                                                            PAGE    6
                                                                            S3333

        the PSV whilst we stood in traffic.    They asked if they could get on

        the PSV to get to the Midland Station.     I replied, "No this is for

        Notts Forest fans."     The Notts Forest fans on the PSV were well

        behaved.   They shouted to me to let the Liverpool fans on to the PSV,

        and promised that there would be no trouble.     I let the Liverpool fans

        on to the PSV and one of them who was obviously affected by drink

        askad if he could smoke.     I told him not downstairs.   He started

        arguing with a Notts Forest fan.     The other Liverpool fans told him to

        calm down and I told him that he continued in this manner he would

        have to get off the bus.     He continued arguing and I asked him to

        leave the PSV.     Shortly after the Liverpool fans left the bus.    The

        progress of the PSV was very slow and Notts fans kept getting off in

        dribs and drabs.

        We arrived back at the Midland Station at about 6 pm (1800), where I

        rejoined Insp HARPER.     After dispersal of the fans on to the

        station Insp HARPER instructed us to return to WBPS.

        At about 6.45 pn (1845) I return to the Gym at WBPS.

        At 8 pn (2000) same date I retired from duty.

DATED: 200489                                                 D GUTCHER (SIOIED)



          On or about the 5 April 1989 (050489), I was asked to perform duties

          in uniform in connection with the F.A.Cup Semi-Final match between

          Liverpool and Nottingham Forest football clubs, to take place on

          Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489), at    Hillsborough.   I was informed

          that insufficient uniformed officers had volunteered to work on this

          date.

          On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489), I reported for duty in uniform at

          Police Headquarters, Snig Hill, Sheffield, as instructed. At 9.00am

          (0900) that date I attended at West Bar Police Station, Sheffield, for

          a briefing.

          At the briefing I was informed of my duties for the day.     Together

          with Police Sergeant 840 WRIGHT of Attercliffe Police Station, I was

          to be in charge of a serial numbered 13, consisting of eight officers

          from that station.    After the briefing had conducted, with Sergeant

          WRIGHT and the serial, I commenced duties at the Sheffield Midland

          Railway Station.     The serial, together with other serials, under the

          command of Police Inspector DEWES, was involved in football supporter

          recaption at the railway station.     The first of the Liverpool
GUTCHER                 DAVID


supporters on service trains arrived at around 11.00am (1100). From

that time on the Liverpool supporters arriving were placed on special

buses laid on to take them to the ground at Hillsborough.      Each of

the buses left the station when full, with a two man police escort,

taken frcm the serials present.      Up until 1.00pm (1300) the two men

escorting a bus were returning with the empty bus frcm the ground to

the station.     As it was to be our duty to be on stand-by at the

ground during the match, after 1.00pm (1300) officers were instructed

to remain at the Police Room at Hillsborough until the full serial

was re-grouped. I left the Midland Station on a full bus of

supporters, together with two men from ray serial, at around 1.30p

(1330).     At that time some of the serial had already left for the

ground, Sergeant WRIGHT remained at the Station to follow with the

remainder of the serial on later buses.

I arrived at the ground shortly after 2.00pm (1400).      I reported to

the police room and grouped the serial.

By 2.30pm (1430) the full serial was available at the police room on

stand-by.     Shortly after that time the serial was instructed to move

to a position behind the turnstiles (inside the ground) which gave

access to the north stand.      We were re-allocated call serial number 65

On arrival at that position I could see through the turnstiles that

there was a serious problem with crushing outside.     There was no

orderly queueing, people were pushing to get through the turnstile

gates.    The people ccming through the turnstiles were in a very

distressed condition.     It was clear that they had been in a very bad

crush.    Seme of the people were trying to catch their breath,

although none I saw required immediate first aid.      Others who came

through, either through panic, stock or drink, were very aggressive

towards myself and other officers present.      Many of the people had
GUTCHER                 DAVID


obviously been drinking heavily.

The turnstiles are positioned in pairs.     At the point where I was

there was an elderly man operating the turnstile to my right, a

younger man with long shoulder length dark hair operating the

turnstile to my left.     The elderly man at one point asked me to check

a ticket of one supporter through his turnstile who had cone through

the wrong turnstile.     His ticket was for the West Terrace.   It was

apparent that a lot of otter people had done exactly the same, caning

through the wrong turnstiles.     In an effort to alleviate the crushing,

I asked both turnstile operators to forget about checking tickets and

to just freely let people through.     This was an independent decision

I made because of what I could see from inside the turnstile.         It was

impossible to hear radio messages at that time.

At one point I saw a young boy aged about 12 being held horizontally

above the crowd outside.     I reached through the turnstile and lifted

him through it.     I stood him with a police officer at a fence

adjacent to the turnstile, instructing him to await there for his

father.    A short time later he was re-united.

It was impossible to get outside initially but when I saw the

crushing had subsided slightly, I went over the turnstile and

outside.    Pushing my way into the crowd, I attempted to form it into

orderly queues.     After seme time I managed to achieve this and the

crushing stopped.

It was whilst still outside the ground that I heard the radio

message, 'All officers to the pitch.' I climbed back through the

turnstile and instructed two officers still inside to follow me.        We

joined other officers running towards the south stand.

I do not know who any of these officers were, I just ran with them,

believing there must have been seme sort of crowd trouble.      The
GUTCHER                 DAVID


situation was obviously urgent because as I ran the radio message was

repeated and I heard a similar message came over the ground public

address system.     I then saw Sergeant WRIGHT was one of the officers

running with me.

I want onto the pitch with other officers via the south stand.      I saw

a number of policemen up on the fencing behind the Leppings Lane end

goal, people from that enclosure climbing the fence to get out.        Frcm

what I saw and heard over the public address sytem I immediately

realised there was a problem with crushing in the central pen behind

the goal, numbered 3.     The crowd at the Leppings Lane end, both in

the terracing enclosures and in the stand, was very noisy.

Knowing it would be extremely difficult to get people over the

perimeter fencing and out of pen 3, I entered pen number 2.     This

enclosure had much more space at that time.

The gate in the perimeter fencing leading into number 2 pen was

opened for me to enter.     I was aware of other officers following me

in there but am unable to say who they were.     The crushing in number

3 pan was at its worst at the front.

People were already trying to climb the iron railings from the front

of number 3 pen to get into number 2 pen.     I went to the railings at

this point.   They are about six feet (6') in height.    I climbed onto

the railings and started to assist people who were climbing over.

Holding one of the spikes on top of the railings with my left hand, I

grabbed people inside pen three and physically pulled them up and

over the fence.     I was assisted by people in pen 3 who pushed.   I was

conscious of the spikes on the railings as people came over and used

my right arm as a cushioning barrier, lifting people upwards with it

and simply dropping them backwards over my head.     The crowd behind me

broke their fall.
GUTCHER               DAVID                                                    5


After pulling out several people by this method I began to select

people who I could see were clearly in distress. I could see people

wera clearly having difficulty breathing from their faces.        Seme were

only being held up by the pressure exerted on them by the crowd,

literally out on their feet.     I shouted to less distressed men into

the crowd to pass me those people.      The lesser distressed men behaved

impeccably, without panic and ignoring their own obvious fears for

personal safety and passed me the people I shouted for.      It was

necessary to shout and scream to be heard but I pulled several more

people over the fence and I was aware that otter supporters behind me

wera tending for those most distressed.

After pulling in the region of twenty people over the railings, I got

my first view of a pile of people under the perimeter fence.        They

were laid in a heap reaching ten to twelve feet (10' - 12') back from

the fence, six or seven deep and along the length of the fence. My

immediate thought was that the people had just fell and because seme

of the crowding had been relieved, they were all going to get up.          I

then saw a woman's face.     She was entangled in the pile towards the

top, with ter head hanging backwards.     Her face was purple.     I

realised I had to get to that vranan.     I shouted to someone to my right

to cup his hands to accorrmodate my foot, assisting me to scale the

railings. I cannot be sure whether this person was a police officer or

a supporter.   I got over the fence and started to try and free people

from the entangled pile.     It became inmediately obvious that many of

the people were already dead.

Two supporters were trying to give cardiac massage to a youth of

about twenty years.   They were not giving mouth to mouth.       The youth

was laid on the steps of the terracing.      I got down, could not feel a

pulse on the youth's neck.     I gave the youth two quick lung
 GUTCHER                DAVID


 inflations, followed this by cardiac massage and further mouth to

mouth.     The youth vomited into my mouth.   I turned him over, cleared

his mouth and throat with my fingers and tried to get more air into

him.     I gave further heart massage and mouth to mouth.   The youth did

not respond.     I left the two supporters with him trying to revive

him.     He was obviously dead.

I went back to the entangled pile of people and tried to pull seme

free.     I was surrounded by supporters trying to help but seme,

understandably looking for their friends and relatives, were just

getting in the way.     I tried to organise them into a line to carry

bodies towards the perimeter fence gate.      I knew there would be a

gate somewhere in the fencing and I hoped to get people out through it

to receive help from the police officers and St Johns ambulancemen on

the pitch.     When I looked for the gate I saw it was still closed.

There was a pile of bodies under it.     People from the crowd were

still pushing forward against myself and other helpers.     The only

policemen I could see were still up on the outside of the perimeter

fence.    They were pulling people over it who were still rushing

forward, scrambling over the bodies, and climbing up it.        I saw

Police Constable 1775 HUMPHRIES on the fence pulling a supporter

over.     I shouted to Police Constable HUMPHRIES to get the gate open

and to get some policemen into the pen to form a line to carry people

out.     I then saw Chief Superintendent NESBIT at the fence.    I shouted

to him and made the same request. The supporters in the pen were

acting in panic and it was impossible to organise them.

I had found a youth in the pile still breathing and I was carrying

him towards the gate, assisted by a supporter not in panic.       Whilst I

was doing so, the crowd was still pushing forward, I was kicked in

the back, scmeone behind me picked up a length of broken crush
GUTCHER                 DAVID                                                 7


barrier and threw it over the perimeter fence at the Police.        I was

looking towards Chief Superintendent NESBIT Who was organising men at

the gate into a line and I saw the barrier land near to him and those

officers.     As I neared the gate it was opened and a panicking youth

who had seen someone in the pile of people he knew, jumped onto the

pile in front of me and in front of the gate.        The youth laid on top

of the pile crying and totally emotionally distraught.        I had to move

him to get to the gate.     Mr NESBIT saw this and came into the pen to

assist.     The youth was pushed through the gate.     I was then able to

pass the youth I was carrying, assisted by Mr NESBIT, through the gate

to officers outside the fence.     With Mr NESBIT and other officers I

began to move bodies from the area of the gate.

One a this was achieved, other officers were able to enter the pen and

assist to get the injured and dead out.     There was no way to select

the living from the dead in the pile.     Every person was pulled out

and passed through the gate.     Others were still climbing the fence

whilst this was going on.

In the struggle I twisted my right knee and I felt a very sharp

pain.     I shouted 'My knees gone.' I was unable to stand.     Mr Nesbit

saw this and instructed me to leave the pen.     He remained in there

with other officers.     I recall Police Constable HUMPHRIES helping me

through the gate and I walked onto the pitch.        I was physically

exhausted.    After sitting on the pitch for a couple of minutes, the

pain in my knee eased.     I got up, took off my Police anorak and tunic

and rejoined the line of Police taking a position directly at the

gate.   Chief Superintendent NESBIT was still in the pen passing the

injured through.     I was aware of another officer on the fence above

my head with a loud hailer organising the line.       At one point, after

a number of people had been passed through the gate, the line was held
GUTCHER                 DAVID


up.    Mr NESBIT shouted to me that the one he was passing was still

alive.     Due to the line being held up, I carried this person from the

gate onto the pitch with another officer.     As we put him down I felt

for a pulse in his neck.     I could not feel one.   I was then aware of

Police Sergeant MCCALL to my right bending over the youth.     The youth

had stopped breathing and Sergeant MCCALL started mouth to mouth

resuscitation whilst I gave heart massage.     Almost immediately after

starting this, two doctors came to the youth and continued to tend

him.     I left to re-join the line.   I went back inside the pen after a

while.    The pile of people seemed bottomless.   They had been piled

several people deep in the well at the front of the terracing.        It

was my only thought to get all the people in the pile out onto the

pitch.    The physical effort involved was tremendous.   At one stage

whilst in the pen I saw Sergeant MCCALL again giving heart massage to

an injured supporter.     Another officer was giving mouth to mouth.

Sotebody shouted, 'We've got this one going.' He was lying on the

steps of the terrace.     Most of the other people had already been

taken out of the gate.     Again my thought was to get the supporter out

onto the pitch as quickly as possible.     I shouted, 'Ccme on lets have

him out.'     I went to pick the youth up, he vomited and I got my

fingers into his mouth to make sure his airway was clear.     The youth

was coughing and spluttering but I could see he then continued to

breath.     Again Chief Superintendent NESBIT came to help us and we

carried the supporter to the gate and passed him through to other

officers.

We worked until all the people were carried out.

I then saw that a crush barrier had completely collapsed.     There were

shoes, coats and personal belongings strewn all over the front of the

terracing.     I looked up to see a number of individuals in the West
GUTCHER                 DAVID


Stand above me shouting and screaming obscenities directed at the

Police.    Seme of the people remaining in the pen were becoming angry

with each other.

Sore alleged that others had been running forward and picking up

property fron the front terracing.     I was in the pen but had not seen

this.   A problem with a group of men and a youth was sorted out and

then I organised ten police officers from the pitch to form a line

across the terracing halfway down to preserve the scene and protect

the lost property.    Whilst still in the pen with these officers, a

Police photographer, Detective Constable BOND, came into the pen to

taka photographs of the scene.    This aggravated some of the crowd

still in the pen.     It was apparent they believed Detective Constable

BOND, who was in plain clothes and not identifiable as a Police

Officer, to be a press photographer.    Two or three men broke through

the cordon of Police and ran at Detective Constable BOND in an

aggressive manner, shouting obscenities.     I restrained one of them and

saw Police Sergeant MCCALL restraining another.    They were taken back

behind the cordon to the top of the terracing.    Detective Constable

BOND left the pen.    I shouted to the remaining crowd in the pen to try

and remain calm.     I explained that the man with the camera had been a

Police photographer and that he was not press.     I explained that the

photographs had to be taken for the Coroner.     The majority seemed to

accept this, others replied with abuse.

The property strewn around was collected and piled on the track

around the pitch.    The Police in the pen, including myself, then left

the pen.

There were both police and supporters on the pitch.     Seme injured

were still being attended, both Police and supporters involved in

carrying people on advertising boards used as stretchers.    An
GUTCHER                DAVID                                                10


ambulance was on the pitch.    The crowd in the West Stand was now quiet

although seme individuals were shouting obscenities at the Police and

throwing missiles.    At this time I could only walk around totally

shocked and physically exhausted.    I tried to console seme

supporters.   One fan came to me and identified me as having pulled

him frcm the crowd.    I did not know whether I had or not, whether it

was me or one of the hundreds of other policemen there.     In any event,

he thanked me for saving his life and walked away.   The whole scene

was one of total shock.   Police officers I have known for years who

are very experienced men walked around with tears rolling down their

cheeks.   Seme stood in silent groups whilst others tried to help

distressed fans.

I ramained on the pitch and there was an announcement that the game

would be abandoned.   The crowd at the Lappings Lane aid applauded

whilst there was jeering from the Spion Kop.   The crowd then started

to disperse, I remained on the pitch until the majority of it had left.

I found my helmet and tunic but could not find my anorak.      I returned

to the Police rocm area behind the North Stand.   It was there I heard

over the radio that my serial was on Halifax Road with the buses the

Liverpool supporters were to take back to the railway station.

I made my way there and re-joined my serial.   I remained with them

until we were stood down from the ground at about 7.00pm (1900) that

date.

I then returned to Police Headquarters and went off duty at 9.00pm

(2100) that date.

           I am a Detective Sergeant in the South Yorkshire Police

           presently stationed at the Police Headquarters.

           On or about the 5 April 1989 (050489), I was asked if I would perform

           duty in uniform on Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) to cover the semi

           final football match between Liverpool Football Club and Nottingham

           Forest Football Club.     I was informed that insufficent uniform

           officers had volunteered for this duty.

           I agreed to work.

           At 8.00 am (0800), Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489), I commenced duty

           in uniform.   A briefing took place at the West Bar Gynasium and I,

           together with other officers, commenced our designated duties at the

           Midland Railway Station.     The task was to segregate the rival

           supporters arriving at the Station and to transfer these supporters to

           waiting PSV's.   Myself and my serial, number 14 consisting of another

           Police Sergeant and seven officers, together with other similar

           serials, were allocated the Liverpool supporters.

           The PSV's were loaded with fans and then officers accompanied the

           vehicle to the football ground.     These Officers were then to return
MORTON                 PAUL                                                   2


with the PSV's and continue until such time that all the supporters

had been cleared frcm the station.

At 2.20 pn (1420) there was no further information that any other

supporters were expected to arrive by train.     It was then that

Inspector Dewes, the officer in charge, stood down the refining

serials at the railway station.     I, together with members of ray serial,

boarded a PSV to travel to the football ground to continue our

designated duties. About 2.50 pn (1450) the PSV was travelling along

Leppings Lane and I commented to an officer on the vehicle that in my

experience as a policeman and as a previous regular supportor of

Sheffield Wednesday, that I had never seen as many people outside the

ground at that time of day, obviously attempting to gain entry.       I

could see densley populated circles of supporters trying to obtain

tickets frcm ticket touts.     I was sat on the lower deck of PSV and the

window was banged at the side of me and a group of between twenty and

thirty supporters were asking if we, the passenger on the PSV, had any

tickets.     Once they saw the Police Uniform they dispersed.   The PSV

travelled very slowly along Leppings Lane through the enormous deluge

of people.     I would estimate that there were about 3,000 people

pushing and milling around the area closest to the entrance.        The PSV

eventually made its way onto Pennistone Road where we alighted frcm

the vehicle and about 3.00 pn (1500) made our way into the gymnasium

awaiting further instructions.     We were immediately told by Inspector

Sewell that we could be required to attend the leepings Lane End of

the ground. About 3.05 pn (1505), myself and the serial were told to

attend inside the ground at the Leppings Lane End.     We made our way to

the playing area and could see the match in progress.      I looked

towards the Leppings Lane end and could see supporters milling around

on the side of the playing area.     I then started to run to what I
MORION                  PAUL                                                     3


thought was crowd disorder. At this time I saw Superintendent

Greenwood run onto the playing area and approach the referee.        I went

immediately to the rear of the goal area at the Lepping Lane end and

looked at the crowd.     I then saw with horror and disbelief that the

first three or four rows of supporters within ray view were dead.       They

were still in an upright position packed into each other, some beyond

the first few rows were dying as pressure frcm the people behind

continued.   All the dead were purple in colour and some had bulging

eyes.    There was a considerable amount of vomit.    I could see that

sane people had attempted to protect the persons in front as their

amr.s were wrapped around them and crushed into the chest of the person

protected. Seme were so small that you could only see their heads.

I shouted to Superintendent Greenwood that there were thirty or forty

dead within my view and that we must get the crowd to retreat

backwards and obtain inmediate medical help, especially oxygen.         Mr

Greenwood ccmenced to use his personal radio and I imnediately

mounted advertising hoardings and screamed at supporters to move

backwards waving my arms in a similar gesture.       I could see space at

the rear terrace and the tunnel exit frcm the terrace just to my

right appeared clear.    However, other supporters were still

running through the tunnel and pushing into the rear of the crowd.           I

other saw officers also on the advertising hoarding shouting and

gesturing as myself.

Some of the crowd did not seem to care what was happening as they

were spitting at us as we waved them to go back.

At this time I saw to my left a young boy of between eleven and

fifteen years old about three rows frcm the front.       He was still

alive and had his fingers on the steel mesh.     He was turning purple

and looking and looking directly into my eyes.       I was totally
MORTON                 PAUL                                                  4


helpless and could not reach the boy.      I jumped down frcm ray position

and attempted to push ray hands through the metal fence in an attempt

to pull him clear.    It was futile.    I spoke to him and told him

to hang on and held his hands.Then complete panic seemed to break out

and instead of going backwards, youths were rushing forward treading on

the dead and dying and swinging on the perimeter fence attempting to

get out of the terrace.   One such supporter stood on the boy and was

swinging on the spiked fence in front of me.      Together with other

officers, I was obliged to help this and other supporters who were

attempting the same escape route.      Several supporters were removed in

this way, some received injuries on the spiked railings and others

ripped clothing.At the first opportunity I looked for the boy but could

not identify him in the mass of bodies at ray feet.     I think at this

time the advertising hoardings making the task to remove

supporters more difficult.

I turned and saw Mr Greenwood beckon to me.      He said that he could

not be heard on the radio and I attempted to use mine with similar

result.   No medical team or oxygen had arrived in the area and I

could see several officers removing supporters over the perimeter

fence,    I had seen officers to ray left attempting to open the steel

escape gate to ray left and by this time I think it was open and

persons were being removed.    Mr Greenwood asked me to obtain an

ambulance.    I ran the length of the field to the entrance way between

the North Stand and the Spion Kop where I knew frcm previous

experience that an ambulance would be positioned.

Officers at the end of the ground did not realise the enormity of the

situation and I shouted to an unknown Inspector that there was a

desperate need for manpower at the other end.      My main concern was

the ambulance and I eventually persuaded an ambulance driver to drive
MORTON                 PAUL                                                 5


his vehicle down the narrow entrance way and onto the side of the

playing area.    An advertising hoarding had first to be broken down

before the vehicle could be directed towards the leppings Lane End.

Once the ambulance reached the area I left the two ambulancemen to

get on with their jobs of tending to the injured.

I again ran to the perimeter fence as supporters were still swinging

on the fence in an attempt to remove thanselves frcm the terrace.       I

assisted supporters over but could see that there were no officers in

the rear pulling people backwards where they should be.    I spoke to

Mr Greenwood who stated that he could not be heard by radio.    Almost

immediately I saw officers climbing over the dividing fence to the

left and run into the terrace.    I continued my task of removing

supporters over the perimeter fence.    I saw officers with tears

running down their face working with strength that I didn't think was

possible.    Some were physically lifting people frcm inside the

terrace over the dividing fence to the left.    Others were inside the

terrace extraditing people and passing them to Officers inside the

gata.    Supporters were still trampling on the dead and injured and

jumping onto the perimeter fence.    I continued to drag these p>eople

over the top.

A supporter then pulled me frcm behind and pointed to a man who was

laid on the floor obviously distressed and shocked and screaming for

his son.     I went to the man who was in a very high state of hysteria

and was immediately joined by a woman who said she was a nurse.     I

attempted to give him words of comfort about his son and left him with

the nurse.

I assisted in removing several persons frcm the terrace, seme

obviously dead.     Together with a man who said he was a doctor I gave

heart massage to a man whilst the doctor gave mouth-to-mouth
MDRTON                  PATH,                                                 6


resuscitation.    After a short time the doctor said he was dead and

moved to a further supporter being cared for by police officers.

At this time I saw Chief Superintendent Nesbit working frantically

with officers.    Mr Nesbit was grey and sweat was pouring from him.

Almost irrmediately a loud cry went up and some Liverpool supporters

on the pitch began to charge towards the Nottingham Forest supporters

at the other end.     I grabbed two supporters who were about to run

with the crowd. One of them turned and punched me in the upper body.

I held him and could see there were tears in his eyes.       He was not

violent any longer and was calmed by his friend.       They both walked

away from the pitch.

Mr Nesbit then shouted to me to use my radio.        It was impossible to

speak to ground control.        I changed my radio to Channel 29, the one

used in the morning whilst in 'Dl' Division.        I passed a message from

Mr Nesbit that he required dogs and officers onto the pitch in front

of the Nottingham Forest fans who were taunting the Liverpool

supporters.   Mr Nesbit took immediate control and arranged a line of

officers across the pitch.       Chief Inspector Beal also assisted.      I

saw Detective Inspector Weak around this time and could see he was

attempting to form a line of officers across the pitch.        By these

very positive and quick actions, a possible catastrophic public

disorder situation was averted.

I saw the fire service were in attendance and oxygen was being used

where possible.     Make shift stretchers had been made from the

advertising hoardings and supporters and police officers were placing

persons on these and moving them to the other end of the ground through

the cordon of police officers.

Several of the supporters on the pitch who had, with assistance,

clambered over the perimeter fence had been drinking heavily and
MORTON                  PAUL                                               7


smelled strongly of intoxicants.     I saw same of these supporters

spitting and kicking officers who were in the process of attempting

resuscitation.    Several approached me in anger and called me a

murderer.     I attempted to calm them down.

The annoucement was then made that the match was to be abandoned.      A

short time later Mr Nesbit directed part of the line of officers on

the pitch to form a cordon across Penistone Road in order that the

ambulances with casualties could obtain a clear escape route and to

segregate rival supporters.     Chief Inspector Beal, Dectective

Inspector Meek and myself went with these officers and formed the

cordon as requested.

Intially when I arrived at the Leppings Lane end I saw two officers

from my serial, Police Constable 2611 Parkin and Police Constable

2174 Cutler, who were making their way towards the gate area of the

fence.   I did not see these officers from my serial until much later

that night.     I did not see any other officers from my serial that

day, although I did contact Inspector Dewes by radio later that night.

I saw at this most unforgettable incident several officers, most of

whom were unknown to me, working with total ccmitment and with the

highest degree of professionalism.     Ones I knew were Police Constable

Steven Fairclough and Police Constable John Friend.

During the whole tragic incident I may have been involved in other

places than described but I cannot recollect anything further at this

time.

In conclusion, I would just like to say that words cannot express my

feelings at the time when I realised there were dead, dying and

injured.    To say I felt inadequate and helpless are mere syllables

which convey part of my thoughts.

I have had severe feelings of self doubt, could I have done things

        differently, could I have done more, should I have done more, all

        these and other thought will never be forgotten.

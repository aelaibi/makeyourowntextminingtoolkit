PRESS RELEASE AA17737/2511




                     CONFIDENTIAL BUT MAY BE RELEASED
                      FOR PUBLICATION AS SHOWN ABOVE
                         UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTIFIED




    A front page lead in TODAY contained two factual inaccuracies,

but the newspaper was entitled to conclude that the treatment of a

police     press     officer   at the time of the        Hillsborough      disaster

reflected     scapegoating, the Press Council ruled today.                It partly

upheld     complaints by South Yorkshire Police against the story and

an editorial.



    The     story,     bylined Kim Sengupta, chief crime             correspondent,

was headed     "Police     girl     scapegoat”.       It said   a     sacked   press

officer,     Lindsay     MacFarlaine, had been made a scapegoat for              the

police handling of the Hillsborough disaster.



    It said her bosses used teams of Special Branch detectives,who

normally hunted spies and terrorists, to trap her.



    The newspaper reported that she was grilled for eight hours by

the head of South Yorkshire CID.
Press Release No.AA17737/2511 -- Page 2




       A    comment column, headed "Revenge of the bullies", considered

that her sacking was a scandalous piece of bullyboy injustice.                    It

said the force did not like the press it got after the disaster so

it had taken its brutal revenge on her.              She was the one person in

the entire force to lose her job after the whole affair, it said.



       Mr      K.S.    Anderson,      assistant    chief    constable     of South

Yorkshire          Police, complained that TODAY published a report of            an

internal          police   civilian disciplinary hearing and      an     editorial

comment        which contained significant        inaccuracies.     He said that
Miss MacFarlaine was subsequently reinstated.



       At    an    oral    hearing, Mr T.    Watson, former    assistant       chief

constable,         said    it   was blatantly untrue to refer to        "teams    of

Special Branch detectives".             Special Branch officers were not used

exclusively for Special Branch work:              they were primarily used for
regular police work.



       In      this    case,    one   officer,     chosen     because     of     his

administrative         skills,     was used to transcribe the tapes at         Miss

MacFarlaine1s hearing. At no time were any teams used.



       Detective Chief Superintendent T.G.          Addis said he interviewed

Miss       MacFarlaine     for 2hours 32minutes.     There was no       "grilling"
and notes were taken which she signed.
 Press Release No.AA17737/2511 —            Page 3




       The disciplinary hearing lasted eight hours.             Miss MacFarlaine

attended        with    her union representative who did not at           any    time

complain        about the interview or hearing.       She was not       questioned

during the hearing and was found guilty of five charges leading to
dismissal, Mr Addis said.



       He     said    the     investigation into a police   headquarters         leak
started before the Hillsborough disaster occurred.



       Mr     Sengupta said in the light of what Mr Watson said the              use

of the       word "teams" was substantially inaccurate.           He appreciated

that        there was some confusion with the disciplinary hearing when
referring to the length of the interview.



    Mr       John     Honeywell,    the   editorial manager,     said     when   the

editor, Mr David Montgomery gave instructions for the leader to be

written       with     such    strong wording he had been      outraged     at   the

story.        Mr     Sengupta said when he spoke to Miss       MacFarlaine       she
said she had been grilled.



    The       use of the words "Gestapo style grilling" was to give the

impression of the length of time during which Miss MacFarlaine was
interviewed.
Press Release No.AA17737/2511 -- Page 4




   The Press Council's adjudication was:



                   The     front       page        lead story on        24     August      1989

          written        by TODAY'S chief crime correspondent,about the

          internal police civilian disciplinary hearing against a

          police     press officer employed by the Sheffield Police,

          contained        two         statements            of        fact     that       were

          substantially          inaccurate.              The first stated that             the

          South Yorkshire Police had used teams of Special Branch

          detectives       in        the disciplinary process, whereas                      the

          fact was        (which       was     conceded           by     the        newspaper

          representativesat            the     oral hearing) that              a    single

          officer       whose     normal duties were related                   to       Special

          Branch    work was employed in an administrative capacity
          to transcribe certain tape recordings.



                  The     second       factual           inaccuracy      was       that     the

          interview       (described          as     a     "grilling")        by    a     chief

          detective superintendent lasted for "eight hours".                               The

          interview       of     11 July 1989, which TODAY'S chief                       crime

         correspondent           confused          - not deliberately - with               the

         hearing     before the disciplinary tribunal of 21                             August

         1989, in        fact took 2 hours and 32 minutes.                      While      the

         Council     does        not think that "grilling"                itself         meant

         more than        tough       questioning, the discrepancy in                     time

         taken over        the       interview       was a        substantial        factual

         error.      This        too was accepted at the oral hearing                       as

         inaccurate.            To    those        two,      limited      extents          the

         complaint of significant inaccuracies is upheld.
Press Release No.AA17737/2511 -- Page 5




                The         editorial     which    accompanied       the        story

          embellished        the     factual   error    about   an    eight-hour

          grilling     by     adding the epithet "gestapo-style".                The

          Council1s    view is that the connotation of Nazi tactics

          was impermissible           as being not merely an exaggeration;

          it exacerbated           the factual inaccuracy.      To that extent

          the complaint       that      the editorial wrongly        attacked      a

          senior police officer in his conduct of an interview is
          upheld.



                The    Council is of the opinion that the issue                   of

          disciplinary       treatment of the police press officer was

          a matter of genuine public interest which the newspaper

          was entitled       to     conclude reflected a scapegoating             of

          the police     press       officer   around     the   time       of    the
          Hillsborough disaster.

      As discussed with your private office a. few days ago, I an:
enclosing three submissions which I have received fro:’       .; constituents
who were oresent at the disastrous rsatc-h between Nottingham. Forest
and Liverpool at Hillsborough.         The first is a letter from
r-.r                                                 1    The second is a
detailed written submission from                          “ I of I          I,
                                                    and Mrs. |        [have
also been to see me at my Advice Bureau, at which we had a full
discussion, but I would not wish to add anything to their own
detailed written notes.         Thirdly, there is a submission from
hr.           of                                         I have also discussed
 this with Xr            ’.' ho  was accompanied by  his  (adult) son, ’.-.'ho was
also present at the m a t c h .

     All three constituents and their wives have gone to considerable
trouble to put their thoughts down, and I would be most grateful if
your office would please pass these documents to Lord Justice Taylor's
encruiry, and confirm to me accordingly, so that I can advise my
constituents.

      I have in all cases sent you the original handwritten copies.

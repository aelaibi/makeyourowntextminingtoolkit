Correspondence

I attach the following documents, which have all come in over the last few days

        a)       letters (12 and 23 September) from Dr Wardrope, the latter enclosing as we
                 asked medical records for Lee Nicol and Phillip Hamm ond, the patients w hom
                 we know were examined by Dr Ed Walker;

        b)       D r Ed W alker’s response to your letter to him in July;

        c)       a submission on behalf o f Mrs W illiams about her son Kevin (the boy whose
                 death was featured in the ‘Cook Report’ TV programme). You are seeing
                 Mrs W illiams privately on M onday, and M r Bruder immediately after her;

        d)       a dossier from the Family support Group containing letters to you from
                 various family members. They say they intended this as a supplem ent to their
                 main submission, which we got on Thursday last week, but it arrived
                 separately later. You have seen some o f these letters before, but not all o f
                 them - 1 think it makes sense to have another look even at the letters you have
                 already seen prior to our Liverpool visit next week, when we will m eet m ost if
                 not all o f these people, some in the M onday morning session and others
                 privately later. It would help if I could have this material back on Friday so
                 that I can incorporate it into the brief notes I am making up on the people you
                 are seeing privately;

        e)       a letter (to me) from Dr Popper, in which he says that he wants advice on
                 whether he should have contact with the Family Support Group. I cannot see
                 that we would have any objection to that and I will write to tell him so if you
                 agree.

2.      I will also acknowledge receipt o f the rest o f this material.

   Professor Scraton


   4.         I have had a call from Professor Scraton, who will be at our opening session on
   M onday morning but would like to visit you in London on 23 or 24 October
   (Thursday/Friday) w ith an important witness who can, he says, provide inform ation about the
   way in w hich the police got the witness statements together. (I wonder whether this doesn’t
   have to do with the changes which were made in some o f them). Does e ith e r o f these dates
   p re se n t a p ro b lem ? If not, I would rather go for the Thursday.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith,                    who is carrying out the

hear from all the families and individuals who wanted to put

them to relive the terrible events of 15 April 1989, but I

wanted to have as full an opportunity as possible to hear

their evidence.

 from families, survivors, the police or other agencies - with
 the utmost care.  I hope to report my findings to the Home

£ ♦ . lrY ® sponse t0 a quest'on from M r Davies, the Home Secretary explained
that Lord Justice Stuart Smith was making a private visit to Hillsborough and
Liverpool and would meet the parents' groups. The Home Secretary had found
it impossible to decide if there was video evidence hidden a w a y som ew here he
had therefore decided to appoint Lord Justice Smith to conduct an inquiry M r
Davies said that Hillsborough had had a great effect, for example, on Graham
Kelly and on his ow n attitude to the game. He would be prepared to answ er anv
   'estions that Lord Justice Smith had for the Football Association. The Home
_ cretary said th at he believed there w ere no outstanding questions for the
 ootball Association and that the main points w ere for South Yorkshire Police to
a" s w ®r ^ut he assured M r Davies that he would let Lord Justice Smith know
that M r Davies had made this offer. (M r Pugh for action please)

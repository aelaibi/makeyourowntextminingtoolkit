               • from the vans and mini                  buses.

                   While       t ravelling      towards        city there were a number                    of such vehicles

                   queuing       behind the        police       car.     I could see through my                       rear view
                                                                                                     PAGE            2

m ir ro rs      that black      plastic       bin liners     containing     the empties were

being         thrown from vehicles            towards    the nearside      grass verge as            litter.

I was         not   in a position to identify from w hich vehicles                      these      had been

thrown.

On paying further a tt e n t i o n             to this    behaviour      I observed that numerous

occ up an ts        in vehicles as des cr ib ed a p p e a r e d to have           been drinking

heavily.            I was aware       of the    content    of some      radio m es sages      that were

passed about             this time where        complaints were being            received from            local

residents.              The manner and volume           of empty beer      cans being       discarded

being         the   source    of these       complaints.

At 3 . 0 0      pm (1300)      I commenced a r efreshment            break at E cc l e s f i e l d

Q G I L V I E . \/ Access     to the ground had been hindered to some degree                           due      to

the    volume of           parked vehicles along S o u t h e y G reen Rd,            through the

P a r s o n Cross        estate.      At    the time    of our arrival      at    the L ep pi ng s Lane

turn st il es           I parked the       response    car at the junction with Vere Road.

T he first fire             engine was a l re ad y at the scene.

A large         number of Liverpool            fans were outside         the ground.        Ihere was a

h ostile a tm osphere.             C e r t a i n fans were    clearly     in a state       of distress

others were              clearly drunk.

Insp H UD SON made            his way towards          the L ep pings Lane       gates of the

ground.             I saw a hysterical         male    throw himself at         Insp H UD S O N     the

officer         had to restrain the man.

W ith PC O G I LV IE         I assisted       Inspector H UD S O N the man was          shouting,

" T h e y ’re dead,         fucking    dead you bastards        have done        it."    No details

were      taken from this man,               he was    one of a group numbering            six or

more      5s o u n d '.

A lt h o u g h    the     initial    reaction was         to arrest        this man for a public

to the a re a of            roadway bordering            onto    the    river bank near             to the

double       exit gate on that             side    of the ground.             (Gate C).         This       clearly

took      priority over arr es ti ng              this man.        He was       led awa y by his friends

shouting,          ’I ’ve carried dead m e n . 8

T here were a large number                  of     police    officers        present at this           time,          I

do not       recall        recognising any as being from                   local     d^isions.             While

these scenes were                 taking   place     these      officers      outside      the ground were

as yet unorganised.                  There was a lack of               cojrinyuni cat i o n ,   I           the

a d v a n ta ge of having           seen the       initial      scenes     inside     the astound on

control          channel and yet specific                instructions a/tL>Chis time were                    not

p os se ss ion of radios and as sucm police                        commu ni ca ti on were            poor.

By the       river        bank    I saw the/first         o b v i ou sl y dead body being             laid by

the    railings.            D i s t r e s s e d friends were      falling       over other          injured

people.

to improv                >ss for ambulances.

With the                 i in place       I saw Su                                      the a rea a ro u n d

C as u a l t i e s were    still       being    carried back        from the a rea of the              tunnel

below the West Stand.

The m a jo r i t y of      people       leaving     the   ground at this time were                now quiet

and s ubdued however              there were groups of young men who were                         drunk,

t h e y ’re m anner was a g gr es si ve and their                presence was           hindering       the

situation.

C alls    from wi th in these            groups of        ’Its not our fault            this   time.’         (An ,

obvious      reference          to the Heysel        Disaster)       were      repeated      conti nously

in an o bsessive           defensive manner.

Such groups were also attem pt in g                   to stir       up hatred against            the    police

w ith    further     calls       from the       crowd blaming           the   police.

The a tm os ph er e was such that very s en sitive                        policing was ne ce ss ar y and

e very officer           that    I saw was acting           in a professional              and d ig nified

manner.

In contrast         to the dero ga to ry          calls from the u n r u l y / d r u n k e n element            of

the     crowd there were              others    leaving     in a quiet and orde rl y manner                   some

of w hom stopped at hearing                    calls a i m e d at       the   police an d a t t e m p t e d to

d ef en d the      statements.

I was     present whe n Liverpool                people made ap ol og ie s           for    the behaviour

of others         from their          city.

The     calls against           the    police heav il y o u tw ei gh ed the           compliments        that

were     being     passed.

To    improve access            for e mergency vehicles             I a ss i s t e d Sgt S T R A F F O R D to

F ro m   this    position we a t t e m p t e d to         clsa/ the area by requesting                 the

large     number of          people     present    to pass through a small               gateway giving

access     to the area behind the West S t a n d                    at    its    corner wit h the North

S t an d and to exit           the ground via other              gates    into Leppi ng s Lane.

Fro m this       position          I w i t n e s s e d the entire   spectrum of human emotions

from those           leaving.        The vast m a j o r i t y of    people heeded advice            to

return to their              vehicles.         There were       groups    of youths who a p p e a r e d      to

revel     in the situation.                Others were         displaying a ng ry behaviour and

d emanding       to know whe n the             game w o ul d finally kick off or how to get

their m o n ey back.

Oth er s were         clearly and d el ib e r a t e l y a tt em p t i n g       to do exactly the

opposite        to what       they were        being    requested by the Police.

Two Liverpool           fans,       clearly     conscious       of this anti       police    behaviour

being     dis pl ay ed by certain of their                  numbers      took up a position a he ad

of the officers              that were       present and a ct i v e l y e n co ur ag ed them to

clear     the area by using              the    route via the small             gate avoiding      gate

*C*.      It was       not i cable      that    these    two fans were          given some

c redibility by the others and the two men w or k e d hard an d their

e fforts    resulted          in      a number     of the u n r u l y / d r u n k e n element event ua ll y

leaving     the ground.                The   two fans were         spelling      it out that     the

presence        of    people       in this area was         hindering      the    rescue operation.

They were of great assis ta nc e and did get through to some who                                   police

officers w ould have                had d i f fi cu lt y with.

As   the area         cleared         I attempted       to obtain        personal details from one of

the two men and to thank                   him for his a s s i s t a n t          The— tyfilv— det^ai 1 s

            I do    recall       that' I had been at                      the    incident   for one hour            before      I

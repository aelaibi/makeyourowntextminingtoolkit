                                  T H O M A S HO WA RD

        MR. FRASER:                T h e first two cases you w i l l h e a r
   this a f t e r n o o n are li nk ed b e c a u s e they are fa th er and
   son.    T h e y are T h o m a s H o w a r d and Tho mas A. How ard , his
   son.    I say that at this stage, sir, to effect, as it
   were, r e p r e s e n t a t i o n on be h a l f of the family in its
   entirety.

             The se ni or Mr. Howard, that is, the fat her of
   Th o m a s H o w a r d and the g r a n d f a t h e r of Th om as A. H o w a r d
   w i t h his go o d lady w i f e are in co urt w i t h Tho mas
   H o w a r d ' s si st er and a soc ial worker.             Th e family tree
   is a little c o m p l i c a t e d b e c a u s e they all hav e the same
   C h r i s t i a n name, b u t they are o b v i o u s l y se pa r a t e so far
   as your p r o c e e d i n g s are concerned.

        Sir,       I r e p r e s e n t the family        th r o u g h the st ee r i n g
   committee       in b o t h cases.

         TH E CORONER:   Mr.                 and Mrs. Howard, one of you is
   a sis te r of Mr. Howard,                 senior, is that right?  (Y e s )

             I wi ll d e s c r i b e to you what we are go in g to do so
   that you can u n d e r s t a n d the format.                Fi rst of all, I
   am g o i n g to re a d to you wha t h a p p e n e d on the 19t h of
   April, 1989 in this court and that was wh e n I de alt
   w i t h the r e l e a s e of Mr. Th om as H o w a r d ' s body.            Th e n I
   am go ing to tell you wh at the b l o o d a l c o h o l level was
   and then we are g o i n g to turn to the p a t h o l o g i s t who
   wil l give his evidence.                 W h e n he has fi ni s h e d the
   O f f i c e r s of the W e s t M i d l a n d s P o l i c e who h a v e p r e p a r e d
   a s um ma ry for me w i l l take us th r o u g h that.

          T hen I n s p e c t o r Lay ton , a n o t h e r Offic er, wi l l take
   us t h ro ug h the v i s u a l e v i d e n c e as it r el at es to - I am
   g oi ng to say dad - Tho ma s Howard.                  Th at is confusing.
   Y o u are go in g to h e a r pla n r e f e r e n c e s and all kinds of
   things, but lis ten to the text, try and get the sense.
   Do n't wo rr y about the n u mb er s b e c a u s e he then g oi ng to
   sh o w us on these b i g p la ns wh at he has be e n talking
   about.

        All the of fi c e r s ha v e be e n sworn, so they wil l
   just co me a lo ng and gi v e their evidence.

             W h e n we h a v e c o m p l e t e d the e v i d e n c e in r e l a t i o n to
   T h o m a s H o w a r d - da d - we are g oi ng to just ris e for a

                                     -   1    -
m o m e n t or two.     T h e n we wil l com e b a c k and dea l w i t h
the lad and the fo rm at wil l be the same but, of course,
the e v i d e n c e will be a bit di ffe ren t.

          This then is a r e s u m e d inq ue st op e n e d on the 19th
April, 1989.                On that o c c a s i o n Ne i l A n t h o n y Parkin,
a c t i n g C o r o n e r ' s O f f i c e r said:

       "The bo d y w h i c h is the s u bj ec t of this i n qu es t has
       be e n i d e n t i f i e d to DC 3155 W a l l a c e of the S o u t h
       Y o r k s h i r e P o l i c e as that of Th om as H o w a r d by L in da
       Jo a n Howard, his ex-wife.

        He was 39 years of age h a v i n g b e e n bo r n on the
        24 t h May, 1949 at p l a c e unknown.

        He was        a d i v o r c e d m a n and he lived at
                                       | Runc orn , Chesh ire .           He was a
        c h e m i c a l p r o c e s s w o r k e r by oc cup ati on.

        He d i e d at H i l l s b o r o u g h f o o t b a l l g r o u n d f o l lo wi ng

        M e d i c o L e g a l C e n t r e and there he i d e n t i f i e d it to

        i d e n t i f i e d the same b od y to P r o f e s s o r Us he r and
        Dr. C l a r k and DC Wallace.

        It is the fa m i l y w i s h that             the bo d y     should be
        cremated."

         N o w there are one or two err ors in that a c co un t
w h i c h I h a v e just re a d to you.           We k n e w there w o u l d be
a few m i s t a k e s in some cases but we felt it was w o r t h
ta ki ng that ri s k in o r d e r to de a l w i t h it speedily.
N o w the first is that DC W e i g o l d di d not, as far as I
can tell, i d e n t i f y this bo d y to DC Walla ce.              T h e r e is
no d o c u m e n t a r y e v i d e n c e of that.

      Th e o th er thing we still do n' t k n o w is his p la ce
of birth.       Mr. Fr aser, p e r h a p s yo ur cli en ts c o u l d h e l p

DEALING WITH DISASTERS - HOME OFFICE GUIDANCE

Thank you for your note of 11 November, providing a timely
reminder that I was about to miss the second deadline for
comments on the draft guidancei  I apologise for the tardy
response.
I can confirm that we have nothing to add to the text, which
appears to cover the ground quite comprehensively.

Although the draft guidance is clearly intended to have the
broadest possible application, its recommendations appear to be
readily applicable to a disaster at a sports ground, and it
complements the more specific advice on the responsibilities of
ground operators contained in the ‘Home Office Guide to Safety
at Sports Grounds’, which was revised and reissued by this
Division following the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster.

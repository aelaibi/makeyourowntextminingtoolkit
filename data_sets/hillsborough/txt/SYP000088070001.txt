                            I am a single man and I live at the above address with my parents.



                            On Saturday 15th April        1989 (150489)            I travelled to the Sheffield

                            Wednesday Football Ground at Hillsborough, Sheffield,                         to the Football

                            Association Challenge Cup Semi-Final game between Liverpool Football

                            Club and Nottingham Forest.



                            I am a supporter of Liverpool Football C l u b / I have supported

                            Liverpool for most of my life and I have been regularly attending both

                            home and away games for the last five years.



                            I had arranged with friends to travel to the Semi-Final and as                           I am

                            not a season ticket holder,           I found it difficult to get a ticket for
                                                                             PAGE      2
                                                                             S3233

       the game.    A friend in Skelmersdale had promised to get me a ticket

       but he was unable to and I actually travelled to Sheffield on the 15th

       of April    (1504-89) without a ticket.



       I travelled to the game at Sheffield with the following four people
Q Ai
       who are all friends.




       In our group there was myself and                  who travelled to

       Sheffield without tickets,    we were both hoping to purchase tickets
                       -   ----

       outside the ground.



       All five of us travelled in a hire car, hired by                 L. we left

       Skelmersdale at about 9.30 a.m.     (0930)



       We travelled to Sheffield by the M58 and M62 motorways then across the

       Snake Pass and down into Sheffield.       We travelled direct to Sheffield

       without making any stops, we were not subjected to any travel delays.



       We parked our car about half a mile away from the football ground on a

       car park next to a B and Q store, we parked at about 11.30 am.        (1130).



       After we parked the car the five of us had a walk about      looking for a

       pub, we walked down past the Leppings Ln entance to the football

       ground, at this time about     11.35 am (1135) there were quite a few
                                                                             PAGE     3
                                                                             S3233

     people milling around in the Leppings Ln area.




$
     the pub but it was in a side street about ten minutes walk away from

     the ground.     We stopped at the pub for between twenty and thirty

     minutes and I had two pints of lager.        There were a lot of other

     Liverpool Supporters    in the pub,    it w a s n ’t packed but it was very

     busy.    We left the pub at about midday, all five of us wanted to go

     down by the ground to see if me and        ____________ could buy a ticket.



     All five of us got back to the Leppings Ln entrance to the ground at

     about    12.15 pm (1215).    We stood by the bridge just opposite the

     turnstiles.     At this time there were quite a few people starting to

     gather    in the area, we started to ask people as they walked past us if

     they had any spare tickets.        I noticed there were a lot of other

     people also asking for spare tickets.        We stayed in this position for

     about thirty minutes,       during this time we were offered tickets by two

     or three different people but they were asking thirty or thirty five

     pounds for a six pound terrace ticket and neither myself or ______were

     prepared to pay that much.



      t about    1.00 pm (1300) myself and                 decided to have a walk

    K to try and get a ticket.      The other three lads   in our group said they

     were going back to the pub we had been in earlier for a drink.



     Myself and                  walked off up Leppings Ln towards the traffic

     lights asking supporters as we walked along        if they had any tickets to

     sell.    After about twenty five minutes we h a d n ’t been able to buy any

     tickets,   we were getting worried by this time that we w o u l d n ’t be able

     to get a ticket so I discussed it with             and we decided to walk
                                                                       PAGE    4
                                                                       S3233

back down towards the ground and look for a man who had earlier

offered us six pound terrace tickets for thirty pounds.



We walked back down Leppings Ln and past the entrance to the ground

which was on our right and continued along Leppings       ln for about

another hundred yards and we again saw the man who we both believed

was a ticket tout.



This man who we believed was a ticket tout was a white male aged about

Jg2 or 23 years,   taller than me about 6 feet Sins,    slim build,   he had

mousey coloured straight hair which was quite long almost down to his

shoulders.   I can’t remember what he was wearing,     he had a scouse

accent.



When we had seen this man the first time it was when we were walking

down from the pub towards the ground at     about    12.10 pm (1210),we were

walking along the road asking people    ifthey had any spare tickets

and this man called us over to him, he said he had spare tickets. He

did not say how many tickets he had, he      just pulled one ticket out of

his pocket but because we thought he was asking too much money

we d i d n ’t buy anything from him on our first meeting.



The second time myself and                approached this ticket tout he

had changed his position,    he was now standine^on the ground side of

the Leppings Ln the opposite side of the r^ad to where we had first

seen him.



We approached him on this occasion,    the second time at about 1.30 jpm

(1330), we asked him if he had any tickets    l ef t, he said,   "Yes"/ we

said,   "thirty quid", and he replied "yes". Before he had got/the
                                                                                   PAGE          5
                                                                                   S3233

tickets out of his pocket a number of Policemen came/round us and took

hold of me,         and this ticket tout.              Myself and/the ticket tout

were arrested,   they just searched                   and let b*m go.



I was taken inside the ground A>y the Policeman who arrested me and I

was taken to a porta cabin. / After        I made a written statement to the
                                f                                                            •
Policeman about what     I w a / doing when I was arrested,             I was released

without any a c tion be in gf taken.



I was released from the ground and taken ou|/side by the entrance to

the j-eppings Ln terraces at about 2.45 p m / ( 1445) .           When I got out       into

Leppings Ln the area from the footpath t o               the entrance to the

turnstiles was a solid mass of people./                I couldn’t see any sort of
                                           ....   f

queues   leading to the turnstiles just this massy of people.



I can remember seeing^I think two mounted Policemen by the pavement
                                          "/ —   — 1"•
area in Leppings Ln, but as far as I can recall they d i d n ’t seem to be

doing anything they were just observing the crowds.



I walked about for a few minutes         in the area between the bridge in

Leppings Ln and the traffic lights asking other supporters for spare

tickets. Some people said there were spare tickets at the other end of

the ground,    the Spion Hop end, so I decided to walk around there.



I got around to the §>pion Hop end of the ground at about 2.5Q ofn.                    I

was asking around for a ticket when a corporation bus pulled up.                       Some

supporters got of the bus and as I was asking                if any of them had any

spare tickets this lad with a scouse accent said he had a spare

ticket for the Spion Hop end.          I asked him how much he wanted for

it, he said,    "face value".       It was a six pound ticket.           I d i d n ’t have
                                                                         PAGE     6
                                                                         S3233

the correct    change and the lad let me have the ticket for five pounds.



I got    into the Spion Hop end of the ground at about/2.55 pm (1455).            I

had no problems entering the ground.       I handed my/ticket into the

turnstile operator.



Whilst   I was at the Leppings Ln end of the ground I did not see any

signs of drunkeness,    disorder or fighting.     I did not see a n y gates

open other than the turnstile gates.       I did not witness any

unauthorised entry to the ground at any time.




ground at about 2.55 pm (1455) , / l   looked towards the Liverpool

the ground and I could see at that time that the area of the terraces

behind the goal   looked packed whilst the terraces on the extreme right

and left hand sides of that end of the ground were not so full,           there

appeared to be room to spare on the sides of the terraces



I stood and watched the game kick off.        I remember Peter/BEftRDSLEY

hitting the crossbar arid just after that I looked towards/th^ other

end of the ground and I could see people       climbing over y n e   perimeter

fence and onto the pitch.     When I first saw this I jusJf thought the

Liverpool   fans were   invading the pitch,   the Nottingham Forest

supporters around me must also have thought this,        they were jeering

and shouting.



The next thing I saw a very short time later was people being pulled

up into the stand above the Leppings Ln terrace/.         A couple of minutes

later the game was stopped.

                                                                                  S3233

From my position at the other end of the ground I did not actually

witness any crush,      but just after BEARDSLEY hit the crossbar           I did see

a ^urge on the terraces behind the goal           in the    Leppings Ln e n d .     I

c a n ’t des cr i be this surge precisely other than it appeared         to be      in

the area of the terraces behind the goal and the surge only appeared

to occur from midway down the terraces and to              the front at the

perimeter fence.      The rear of the terraces did          not seem to be affected

by this surge.      This surge occurred I would say because of BEARDSLEY

hitting the crossbar.        I was not personally involved in any crowd

crush,   I was not injured.       I did not personally witness any deaths,                I

was not able to assist any of the dead or injured.



I cannot recal 1 what time I left the ground but I think it was a fter 4-

pm (1600),    I left the ground of my own accord.



I did not witness anything during that afternoon which               I considered

would have been a factor        in causing the deaths or injuries.          I did not

witness anything that I considered to be a criminal offence.



After the match was stopped I thought the handling of the tragedy was

very disorganised,      it appeared to take too long for people lai/d on the

pitch to get medical as s i s t a n c e .   I think the Police were too

interested in forming       lines to keep people off the pitch when           they

should have concentrated on assisting the injured.



I think the tragedy caused a great deal of bad feeling towards the

Police at the match.



I eventually found my four travelling companions, all of us were

uninjured.

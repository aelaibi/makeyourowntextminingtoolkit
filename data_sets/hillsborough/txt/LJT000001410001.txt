                        THE FOOTBALL LEAGUE LIMITED
                     REPORT OF THE MEDICAL WORKING PARTY


TERMS OF REFERENCE AND APPOINTMENT TO THE WORKING PARTY


1.    Following the publication of the Final Report of Lord Justice Taylor,
     Mr. R. Myles Gibson, FRCS, Honorary Consultant Medical Advisor to The
      Football League, was asked to make recanmendations to the League on
      the implementation of the spirit and the letter of Lord Justice
      Taylor's recommendations concerning first aid, medical facilities and
      ambulances (recanmendations 64 to 69).


2.   Mr. Gibson felt that as well as considering the requirements of The
      Football League in respect of the Taylor Report, the task required the
      best medical advice frcm distinguished practitioners in the fields of
     Accident and Emergency Medicine and Immediate Medical Care.
      Invitations to join the Medical Working Party were therefore extended
      to:-


     Dr. Howard Baderman, B.Sc., F.R.C.P.
      (Consultant in Charge, Accident and Emergency Department, University
     College Hospital, Iondon and Consultant Advisor to the Department of
     Health on Accident and Emergency Medicine)


     Dr. Judith M. Fisher, M.B.,B.S., F.R.C.G.P.,
      (Chairman, British Association for Immediate Care and General Medical
     Practitioner)


     Colonel Ian R. Haywood, F.R.C.S.
      (Professor of Military Surgery, Royal Army Medical College, London and
     Consultant Surgeon)


     Dr. E. Brian Lewis, M.A., F.F.A.R.C.S.
      (Surgeon-in-Chief, St. John Ambulance and Consultant Anaesthetist)




                                        -1 -
                                         -2 -


      Lt. Gen. Sir Cameron Moffat, K.B.E., F.R.C.S.
      (Chief Medical Advisor, British Red Cross Society and late Surgeon-
      General to the Armed Forces)


      It was also agreed to invite representatives of the ambulance service
      on to the working party, in order to ensure the complete
      representation of the emergency medical services.   The following
      representatives were duly nominated by their respective professional
      as so c i a t i o n s .


      Don Page, J.P., F.A.S.I.
      (Regional Ambulance Officers Group)


      Gordon P. Turnbull, F.A.S.I., F.B.I.M.
      (Association of Chief Ambulance Officers)


      The representation on the working party thus gave a comprehensive
      overview of the medical profession's standards in Immediate Medical
      Care and disaster medicine.


      Chris Whalley of The Football League acted as Secretary to the working
      party.


3.    Copies of the Taylor Report were circulated to members of the working
      party and the first meeting was held on 4th April, 1990.   At this
      first meeting the background to the establishment of the working party
      was outlined to members and the Taylor recommendations in relation to
      medical matters were addressed.   Further meetings were then held on
      18th April, 2nd May, 30th May, 13th June and 4th July, 1990.


REXXM4ENDATION 64 - There should be at each sports ground at each match at
least one trained first aider per 1,000 spectators.   The club should have
the responsibility for securing such attendance.
                                      -3 -




4.    The working party agreed that the definition of a trained first aider
      should be someone who holds the Standard Certificate in First Aid
      issued by St. John Ambulance and the British Red Cross Society.      The
      latest syllabus for the Standard Certificate is shown at Appendix A.


5.    The ratio of 1 first aider for every 1,000 spectators was agreed, with
      the proviso that there should be a minimum of 3 first aiders at any
      one match. Local knowledge to be used to determine any extra
      attendance of first aiders for certain matches, such as local derby
      matches etc.


6.    The working party felt it right that the responsibility for securing
      the attendance of first aiders should lie with the football club.


RKXM4EMDAHGN 65 - There should be at each designated sports ground one or
more first aid roans.   The number of such roans and the equipment to be
maintained within than should be specified by the local authority after
taking professional medical advice and should be made a requirement of every
Safety Certificate.


7.    The working party felt that at least one first aid roan should be
      provided to the satisfaction of the local authority and subject to the
      following minimum standard.


8.    The room should be readily available at all times when a specified
      event is being undertaken and should not normally be used for any
      purpose other than the rendering of first aid.   The roan should be
     positioned as near as possible, taking into account the location and
      layout of the establishment, to a point of access for transport to
     hospital and with easy access from all parts of the sports ground.
     The roan should be clearly identified as a first aid room, its
      location publicised, and the route(s) to it clearly signposted.
                                        -4 -




9.    The roan should be of minimum area 300 sq.ft. and of a regular shape.
      The door should be of sufficient width to allow a stretcher plus
      attendants to be admitted, bearing in mind the possibility of
      stretcher access frcm a corridor.        The roan ideally should have
      provision to treat 3 patients simultaneously with adequate provision
      for privacy.    The roan should be provided with a stainless steel
      sink, work surface, wash-hand basin, adequate drainage and supplies
      of hot and cold drinking water, soap and hand drying facilities.
      Hypochlorite disinfectant should also be provided, effective against
      H.I.V., Hepatitis B, etc., for cleaning of blood and body fluids.
      Recanmended concentrations for use are 10,000 ppm to deal with
      spillages;     1,000 ppm for general washing purposes.


10.   The roan should be a designated 'no-smoking' area, be effectively
      ventilated, lighted, heated and maintained and it should be provided
      with at least 6 x 13 amp. socket outlets.       All surfaces should be
      hard, impervious and easy to clean.       The roan should be kept clean and
      well maintained and adequate provision made for the disposal at the
      end of each event of waste and refuse including clinical and 'sharp'
      waste.   The roan should be in close proximity to a watercloset and
      private waiting area provided with chairs.       The roan should be
      provided with effective means of ccmmunication to and frcm the central
      control point and the emergency services.        In most stadia the
      appropriate means will be by telephone link with an exclusive external
      line.


11.   Paragraphs 8 , 9 and 10 contain the ideal recommendations for a first
      aid roan.    The working party recognises that clubs may have made
      provision following the Football League's letter to clubs dated 10th
      July, 1989 (copy shown at Appendix B).       In such cases, future ground
      developments must take into account the ideal recanmendations
      contained in paragraphs 8 , 9 and 10.
                                        -5 -




12.   The working party recommends for club first aid rooms a medical first
      aid pack along the lines advised by the Scottish Football
      Association's Medical Committee.         The contents of this first aid pack
      are as follows

       1 x Box Large Paper Tissues


      The cost of such a first aid pack should be approximately £220 net of
      V.A.T.


      The need for the Crowd Doctor to check and maintain the club's first
      aid roan equipment is stressed,      (see also paragraph 24 ).


13.   Where there is more than one hospital locally, there should be
      displayed in the First Aid Roan a list of the 'receiving hospitals'.
                                      -6 -




14.   The working party stresses the importance of first aid posts being
      sited around the ground and the need for proper signposting.    This
      would help with public awareness of the presence of first aiders.      The
      working party recatmends that the location of the club's first aid
      facilities should be shown in the match programme.


15.   In making these recommendations the working party was conscious of,
      and appreciative of, the existing arrangements at clubs, the liaison
      with the voluntary first aid organisations and the statutory ambulance
      service and the many improvements that had been effected post
      Hillsborough.


RECCM4ENDATI0N 66(a) - At every match where the number of spectators is
expected to exceed 2,000? the club should employ a medical practitioner to
be present and available to deal with any medical exigency at the ground.
He should be trained and competent in advanced first aid.   He should be
present at the ground at least an hour before kick-off and should remain
until half an hour after the end of the match.   His whereabouts should be
known to those in the police control roan and he should be immediately
contactable.


16.   The working party recognised that the Club Doctor was primarily in
      attendance at matches to look after the players.   It was felt that
      there should be a further doctor in attendance to handle any medical
      emergency at the ground.   For the sake of convenience we call this
      second doctor the "Crowd Doctor".


17.   Recognising the difficulty that this might cause clubs with low
      attendances, the working party feels that at a match where the number
      of spectators is not expected to exceed 3,000, the role of the Crowd
      Doctor may be taken on by the Club Doctor, providing the latter is
      trained and competent in Immediate Medical Care (see paragraph 18) and
      on the strict understanding that his first priority is to the crowd.
                                        -7 -




18.   The Crowd Doctor should possess skills in coirmunication and ccarmand
      and control as well as medical skills and he should be not more than
      70 years of age.   Doctors having taken relevant courses would be
      preferred; doctors without such certification should attend a special
      day course in Immediate Medical Care for medical practitioners.


19.   For this purpose, the format of the BASICS one-day course was accepted
      subject to the deletion of the sessions on water-related emergencies
      and paediatric emergencies and to the inclusion of a special session
      to cover inter-service liaison, catmunications, major incident
      management and the delegation of duties to voluntary first aid
      workers.   (The format of the BASICS course is shown at Appendix 'C').


20.   This day course should be mounted by the Football Association Medical
      Coirmittee with the assistance of BASICS, the Ambulance Service, the
      St. John Ambulance and the British Red Cross Society.   The Chairman of
      this working party has made contact with the Football Association
      Medical Ccnmittee, whose chairman has expressed willingness for the
      Football Association Medical Coirmittee to undertake this task through
      its medical/education activity.


21.   Recertification or reattendance on course is regarded as necessary
      every 5 years.   The ideal long-term objective is for Crowd Doctors to
      possess the Diploma in Immediate Medical Care.
The Crowd Doctor should have available to him the following equipment
at the ground:-

23.   Most of the above equipment should be contained in light carrying
       cases and stored in a safe place at the ground between matches. A
       trolley should be available to enable the equipment to be quickly and
       easily transported to the First Aid Room on match days.    The Crowd
       Doctor should ensure that the arrangements for storing the equipment
       between matches are to his satisfaction.   Crowd Doctors should keep
       certain items of equipment such as the defibrillator (if this has not
      been supplied by the local Ambulance Service — see next paragraph)
      and/or certain drugs with them rather than leave them in storage at
      the ground.   The working party recommends that the Crowd Doctor should
      be responsible for the asterisked drugs listed in paragraph 22.     Those
      doctors who are not ordinarily in possession of controlled drugs may
      need to make special arrangements.


24.   The Crowd Doctor must ensure that the equipment is checked and
      maintained.   It is suggested that the local Ambulance Service could
      assist by providing and maintaining the more complex items of
      equipment, such as the defibrillator.   The Crowd Doctor should liaise
      with the Ambulance Service on this point.


25.   The working party feels that the Crowd Doctor should remain at the
      ground for a minimum of half an hour after the end of the match. If
      his attendance is required for a longer period, he must remain until
      his work is done.


26.   The Crowd Doctor should familiarise himself with the local Accident
      and Emergency Department's major incident plan and the local
      authority's emergency plan.


27.   It is reccanmended that a full record of all medical incidents at the
      ground for each event should be made by the Crowd Doctor.    He should
      make an annual return to the co-ordinating officer in the local health
      authority (respecting patient confidentiality). The Crowd Doctor
      should give an abstract of these records to the club,   making sure
      that patients' names have been deleted to maintain confidentiality,
      and the club should make an annual return to the Football League.
                                         -12-




      There should be a supply of NCL referral forms available to the Crowd
      Doctor, so that he can hand a chit to the patient if hospitalisation
      or further medical attention is required and retain
      one himself.   For this purpose the working party recommends the
      standard A S H form used by the local ambulance services.   An example
      of this form is shown at Appendix D.


28.   The Chairman of this working party has been contacted by the
      appropriate British Medical Association carmittee on the subject of
      remuneration for Crowd Doctors.    The British Medical Association has
      asked to be kept informed of the outcome of this working party's
      report in order that appropriate remuneration for Crowd Doctors can be
      recommended.


EEXXM4ENDBTIQN 66(b) - At any match where a rmmheT- of spectators is not
expected to exceed 2,000, the club should make arrangements to enable a
medical practitioner to be summoned immediately to deal with any mpHinal
exigency at the ground.    He should be trained and competent in advanced
first aid.   Hie arrangements made should be known to those in the police
control roan.


29.   In such cases, the Crowd Doctor must be able to get to the ground
      within 10 minutes.    If this is not practicable for geographical or
      traffic reasons, he must be on call in the ground.


RECXMffiNDATION 67 - At least one fully equipped ambulance frrm car approved
by the appricpriate ambulance authority should be in attendance at all
matches with an expected crowd of 5,000 or more.
REXXM4ENDATIQN 68 — Hie number of ambulances to be in attendance for matches
where larger crowis are expected should be specified by the local authority
after consultation with the ambulance service and should be maHo a
requirement of the Safety Certificate.
                                      -1 3 -




30.   The working party agrees that dedicated ambulances are required for
      each match with an expected crowd of 5,000 or more; the number of
      ambulances at each ground to be determined locally - this will depend
      on the size and geography of each individual ground.    The working
      party would recommend that for matches with an expected crowd of 5,000
      or more, there should be a minimum of 1 ambulance approved by the
      appropriate ambulance authority and 1 voluntary service ambulance in
      attendance.
31.   The statutory ambulance(s) will only leave the ground if the patient
      needs immediate hospitalisation and no other vehicle is available.     If
      the statutory ambulance does leave the ground, the Ambulance Service
      communications officer present should immediately order a replacement
      ambulance.    The working party would suggest, however, that the
      voluntary service ambulance (St. John Ambulance/British Red Cross
      Society) could be used to good effect to transport people to hospital.
      Again, these arrangements should be determined locally.


32.   The equipment carried on the statutory ambulance includes the
      following:-


      2 stretcher trolleys - both multi-posture
      piped oxygen to both stretcher trolleys
      defibrillator
      paramedic kit
      ambu bag
      resuscitation equipment
      analgesic drugs
      blankets
      burn sheets
      first aid dressings
      carrying chair
      orthopaedic stretcher
      cervical collars
      splintage variety (i.e. inflatable, box, spinal)
      radio coirmunications
      aspirator
                                        -1 4 -




      carry sheets
      maternity pack


RBCXMMENDATION 69 - A "major incident equipment vehicle", designed and
equipped to deal with up to 50 casualties, should be deployed in afVKtir»n to
other ambulance attendance at a match where a crowd in excess of 25,000 is
expected.


33.   The working party agreed with this reconmendation, but felt that there
      could be problems in certain areas of the country if there was more
      than one match with a 25,000+ attendance taking place on the same day
      or if such a match clashed with other large attendance events in the
      area.


GENERAL


34.   It is recarmended that a liaison meeting be held once a year at every
      club immediately before the start of each season.    In attendance at
      this meeting should be the following:-


      the Club Doctor
      the Crowd Doctor(s)
      the nominated liaisonofficer   of the local Ambulance Service
      the nominated liaison   officerof the local police
      the nominated liaisonofficer   of the local Fire Service
      the liaison officer of the voluntary first aid organisation
                               (St. John Ambulance/British Red Cross
                               ' Society)
      the Accident and Emergency Consultant frcm the local hospital
                               (or his nominated deputy)
      the Club Secretary or Stadium Manager
      a representative of that branch of the local authority that issues the
      club's safety certificate.
                                       -1 5 -




35.   At this meeting the club's fixtures for the forthcoming season can be
      notified to all parties.     Any subsequent fixture alterations should be
      circulated by the club at the appropriate tune;        the Ambulance Service
      should be responsible for notifying any fixture changes to the
      Accident and Emergency Consultant.        It would be helpful, at the
      liaison meeting, if the local police could identify any 'high-profile'
      matches. This would enable the local Accident and Emergency
      Department to be pre-^warned.


36.   At every match there should be a meeting one hour before kick-off
      involving the following:-


      the Police Ground Commander
      the Crowd Doctor
      the Senior Ambulance Officer
      the liaison officer of the voluntary first aid organisation
      (St. John Ambulance/British Red Cross Society)
      the Stadium Manager or the club's Safety Officer


      Following this meeting the name of the Crowd Doctor in attendance
      should be relayed to the local Accident and Emergency Department by
      the Ambulance Service, who should also confirm that the arrangements
      are in hand at the ground.


37.   The working party recommends that this report, which has been compiled
      with football grounds in mind, should be considered by other sporting
      bodies for implementation in venues under their jurisdiction.


AUTOPSY REPORTS FRCM HILLSBOROUGH


38.   The working party required a presentation on the autopsy reports from
      Hillsborough and the lessons to be learned.       A full presentation was
      received from the pathologist involved.       Clinical recommendations to
      doctors may follow in due course.
                                       -1 6 -




WEMBLEY STADIUM


39.   Wembley Stadium has been visited and the arrangements for accidents
      and medical emergencies inspected by the Chairman and Secretary to
      this working party, who were very impressed by what they saw.     These
      arrangements include 2 (or more if necessary) crowd doctors on site
      and a full-time nurse practitioner, together with up to 120 trained
      first aiders, 80 of whcm may be registered nurses.     There are 4
      quadrant-sited medical rooms and there will be this year 5 dedicated
      and equipped ambulances.     On-site training is a continuous process.


40.   Briefing and debriefing before/after each major event is a routine
      procedure.   The working party recarmends this practice for grounds
      that regularly receive large attendances.


ONGOING ROLE OF THIS WORKING PARTY


41.   The recanmendations of this working party, if accepted by the Football
      League Management Cammnittee, will need to be comprehensively and
      tactfully presented to the clubs.


42.   If and vriien these recarmendations are in place, it is further
      recommended that a system for the inspection of medical arrangements
      at grounds be implemented.    It is felt that clubs should be
      accountable to The Football League and this working party is prepared
      to carry out inspections and make reports to the League.


43.   The working party would also wish to see an annual exercise carried
      out, at a different ground each year,, whereby a major incident is
      simulated and the staff, first aiders, emergency services etc. are
      tested.   This could be a desk-top exercise or a more extensive and
      expensive option.   Additionally, it would enable technological
      advances and advances in medical procedures to be introduced and
      ensure a regular upgrading of practice.
It is also felt that in future years this cormittee should identify
key people and reccrtmend their recruitment to ensure continuity and
progress in this important field of medical practice.

Dear Secretary,

                                         First Aid Facilities at Grounds

      Following the tragic events at Hillsborough, consideration has been given
to the subject of first aid facilities at grounds.

      It is recognised that clubs would need a fully-equipped casualty ward to
cope with a major disaster. This is clearly not feasible, so what has been looked
at is what can reasonably be provided.

      The Management Committee consider th at clubs should follow the
recommended guidelines given below. It should be stressed, however, that these
should be seen as minimum requirements.

a)   First Aid Room

      Each club should have a designated First Aid Room, in addition to the club's
medical room. The First Aid Room should contain at least two beds, a sink, a
work-top and a curtain to give the necessary privacy. The room should be
supplied with power, light, w ater and a direct line telephone. There must be
ready access for emergency vehicles.

b)   Medical Equipment

      The First Aid Room should have a well-stocked cabinet containing antiseptics,
analgesic, bandages e tc. Management should designate one person as being
responsible for stocking the cabinet and for the general up-keep of the First
Aid Room.

     Stretchers, a carrying chair, blankets and oxygen should be available.

c)   Medical S taff

       It is recognised that the club doctor's attendance at matches is primarily
for attention to players. It is felt, therefore, that there should be at least one
ex tra qualified person in attendance at matches.




                                                                                                  Continued/2



           Ml c o rrespondence to be a ddressed to The Secretary R egistered Orrice as j b o v e . p.,

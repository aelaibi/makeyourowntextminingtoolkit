        drivers       can be s u b j ec te d to a h ea vy fine           if sup po rt er s    nave

        beer     on the       coach.      Football     clubs    are    not a l lo w e d to sell

        beer,      yet    supp or te rs    can go    into    pubs and s u p e r m ar k et s   b e tw ee n

            Dear Sir

            H I L L S B O R O U G H S T A D I U M DISASTER

            The Director of Public Prosecutions has n o w received from the West
            Midlands Police the final report in this criminal investigation together
            with substantial supporting evidence and documentation. Y o u will recall
            in August 1989 that the Director requested a full criminal investigation
            following publication of the Interim Report produced after the Public
            Enquiry conducted by Lord Justice Taylor into the circumstances



            The most careful consideration has been given to all the evidence and
            documentation. The Director has decided that there is no evidence to
            justify any criminal proceedings being instituted against South Yorkshire
            Police, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Messrs Eastwood and Partners
            or Sheffield City Council in connection with the disaster at the
            Hillsborough Football Stadium Sheffield on 15th April 1989.

            The Director has also concluded that there is insufficient evidence to
            justify proceedings against any officer of the South Yorkshire Police or
            any other person for any offence.

            I am sending a copy of this letter to you by FAX.

            I am also sending copies to the investigating officer, Chief Constable
            Leslie Sharp, to the Coroner Dr Popper and to the Police Complaints
            Authority. Copies will also be sent to solicitors representing the
            Hillsborough Steering Committee, the Sheffield City Council, Sheffield
            Wednesday Football Club and Messrs Eastwood and Partners.

I also enclose a copy of a press release to be issued by the C rown
Prosecution Service Press Office at 3.00pm today.

Yours faithfully

   Following a lengthy and detailed investigation by the West Midlands

   Police and close consideration of Lord Justice Taylor's report, the

  Director of Public Prosecutions, Allan Green Q.C., has concluded that

  there is oc evidence upon which a prosecution for manslaughter or any

  other criminal offence may be brought against the South Yorkshire Police,

  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Messrs Eastwood and Partners or

  Sheffield City Council in connection with the disaster at Hillsborough

  Football Stadium Sheffield on 15th April 1989.



  The Director has also concluded that there is insufficient evidence to

  justify the institution of proceedings against any officer in the South

  Yorkshire Police force or any other person for any offence.

           Dear Sir

           HILLSBOROUGH - Chief Superintendent David DUCKENFIELD

           I reply to your letter dated 31 August 1990 which       was   addressed     to   the
           Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police.

           You are correct when you say that the DPP has decided that there is
           insufficient evidence to prosecute your client for any criminal offence
           arising out of the Hillsborough tragedy.    It is also correct to say that
           the disciplinary issues now have to be considered by South Yorkshire Police
           in consultation with the Police Complaints Authority.

           I believe you are also aware that there are outstanding civil actions being
           brought by various parties with an interest in the matter, and that there
           are 95 Coron er’s Inquests to be reconvened.

           I am aware that at the interview on 3 July 1990 your client intimated that
           once the DPP had made his decision in respect of the criminal issues, he
           would consider being interviewed in respect of any disciplinary matters.
           If that is still his wish then I am ready to conduct that interview but it
           must be understood that the disciplinary matters are very closely related
           to the criminal issues, so any interview would have to be conducted under a
           Police and Criminal Evidence Act caution,      and the transcript of the
           questions and answers would have to be sent to the DPP for further
           consideration of the criminal matters.
That is the position in respect of any new or additional evidence which
comes to light, for example, that which may arise out of the civil actions
or the C o ro ner’s Inquests. It is not for me to advise you or your client
as to how you, or he, should proceed, but it seems to me that you should be
aware of the foregoing information.

If I can be of any further assistance,   please   do not hesitate to contact
me.

   NATURE OF REPORT, ALLEGATION OR COMPLAINT



             A letter sent to the Home Secretary on the 7 June 1989 by Trevor and Jenni
             Hicks                                                      las been forwarded

             enquiry conducted by Lord Justice Taylor.

             It is alleged by Mr and Mrs Hicks that you were deceitful and intentionally

             command and control of police officers engaged on that duty.

             If established these allegations could disclose possible offences against
             the Police Discipline Regulations 1 9 8 5 , Regulation 5, Schedule 1, Paragraph
             5 or 1.

  On Saturday, 15 April 1989, at Hillsborough Football Ground, Sheffield, a
  disaster occurred in which 95 people died.

  Leslie Jones                                           the father of one of the
  deceased, Richard Jones, has made the following allegations relating to your duties
  at the ground on 15 April 1989;

     (a)      You failed to acquaint yourself with the planning and problems related to
              the control of the Liverpool v Nottingham Forest Semi Final on Saturday,
              15 April 1989.

     (b)      You failed to monitor the crowd numbers packing into Pens 3 and 4.

     (c)      You failed to act when it became obvious that Pens 3 and A were over full
              when you had an excellent viewpoint from the Police Box above the pens.

     (d)      You failed to make provision for fans coming through gate 'C' after you
              had given the order for the gate to be opened.

     (e)      You failed to act when it was obvious that people were in distress.

     (f)      You attempted to mislead the Assistant Chief Constable at the ground and
              others, namely, representatives of the Club, the F.A., and the fans
              themselves regarding the origin of the order for gate 'C' to be opened.
              That is by inferring supporters had forced open the gate when you had, in
              fact, given the order to open the gate.

 NATURE OF *               COMPLAINT


                  On Saturday 15 April 1989 at Hillsborough Football ground, Sheffield, a
                  disaster occurred in which 95 people died.

                  Trevor Hicks       ________________________________________________
                  has made previous allegations in relation to your duties at the ground.
                  He has now made the following further allegation;
                  That he, Mr Hicks, with regard to his previous complaint against you
                  of making a false statement, in that you were deceitful and intentionally
                  misled senior police officers and the public, (SEE REGULATION 7 NOTICE
                  OF 3 AUGUST 1989 SERVED BY MR COOPER ACC NORTHAMPTONSHIRE) now further
                  alleges that he questions whether Mr Walter Jackson A.C.C. was unaware
                  of the real circumstances relating to the opening of the gate. Mr
                  Hicks can see no reason why you would not have told Mr Jackson the
                  truth and therefore considers there may have been collusion between
                  yourself and Mr Jackson concerning this point.

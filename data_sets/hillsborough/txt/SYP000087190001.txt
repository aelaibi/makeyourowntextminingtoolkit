                  At    points       along      the      A&16      trunk       road    there      were      signs       directing       the

            expecting,             to     be      held     up    in t h a t         traffic,          all/the          way     into S h e f f i e l d

            as     I expected             the       majority          of      the    football             supporters           vehicles          turning

            of f     at    Oughtibridge.                   At    the       Oughtibridge               tfurn off          the    vehicles

            I followed             the       road       through          O u g h t i br i dge        expecting           to    be    held       in h e a v y

            traffic         however,              the     flow      of     traffic         was       no    busier        than       on a n y     other

            Saturday.




            The      amount        of     traffic          on    the       r oa d    to O u g h t i b r i d g e        was     only       slowed       by

            congestion.                 This        may    or    may       not      explain          to    some       extent        the     delayed

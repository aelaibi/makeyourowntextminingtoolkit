At    7 minutes             past       3    (1507          h r s ) the     order          was     given        by    Insp C h a r l e s             and

our       serial       Sergeant             PS Carter             f or    us    to    enter          the    ground            in    relation

to    the       incident          which          had       taken     place.           At       t his    t ime       it w a s        not       known

what       had       happened          inside          the       ground and           no       other       information                  was

available             at    th at      time.




All       the    Officers             entering             the    ground were              quickly         separated and                      I made

my way          to the          tunnel       that          leads     from       the       concrete         hard          standing             at    the

rear       of    the L e p p i n g s         Ln       stand       through           onto       the m i d d l e       2    portions             of

the L e p p i n g s         Ln    lower          terraces.               Whilst       making           my w ay       towards             the

tunnel          leading          to    the       terraces          I saw        numerous             L i v e r pool       fa n s        coming

out       of    the    ground          using          the    s ame       tunnel       and       quite      a    number             were

carrying             people       who       appeared             injured        or    in s o m e        distress.                  The       people

with       casualties             began          depositing              people       on       the     concrete           hard          standing

at    the       back       of    the       stand and             these      were      being trodden                 on    by        the       large

number          of    crowds          still       leaving          the      sta n d .




As    a    result          I positioned                myself        in     the      c e n t r e of      the    tunnel              at       the

rear       at    the       p o int     where          it    becomes         concrete             hard standing                and       began

dividing          people        to    the       left       and    right         hand      side walls             of      the     tunnel

thus    keeping           them awa y            from       the     concrete           hard      standing           where

casualties             were     beginning             to     increase.              Whilst          positioning             myself          and

making       my way        to     the       tunnel         entrance           I was       greeted          by n u m e r o u s         fans

who    were       shouting           at    all      the      Police        Officers,            shouting,             "You mu rd er in g

b a s t a r d s . ” "It's         your         fault,        you've        killed         them,          it's all          your       fau l t " ,

and    various          similar           comments.




The    f ans      coming        out       of    the      ground were               also     punching            and      kicking          at     me

and    I noticed           t hat      s ome      other        Officers             were     also         struck       as    they         tried

to m a k e       their     way       through          the      l a rge     crowd.




As    soon       as    it w a s      possible            I made         my way        through            the    f ans      into       the

front       terraces          sti l l      being         punched and               k i c k e d as        I made       my way

through,          and,     having          gained          access        to     the      front       terrace          I was         met     with

large       numbers        of     inert         bodies        ly i n g     on      the    concrete             hard s tandi ng              with

numerous          other       people           milling        around          in v a r y i n g       degrees          of    distress.



The    blue       metal       perimeter             fencing         w as      still       intact          at    t hi s     time       and

together          with     other          Officers          who     I could           not      identify          I went          to      the

nearest          person       to me        and      carried         that        person         to    the       concrete          hard

standing          at    the     rear       of    the       s ta n d .      That       p e r s o n was          a male, white,

about       30    yrs     of age,          w ho w a s n ' t       breathing              and    his       complexion             was

blue    tinged,           and waxen.                I commenced artificial                           respiration               on     the

youth       t hat      I ha d     carried           to     the    back        of    the     stand while               another

Officer          commenced           heart       massage.                The       youth

and    as    the       body was           w a rm,     I continued               resuscitation                  efforts         until        I

was    relieved           by a w o m a n         who       identified              herself          as    a nurse.             1 l eft          the

casualty with              this       off-duty             nurse        and     returned            to    the    terrace.

In all       I brought          4    people        b ack      from        the    t e r r a c e,    on    each       occasion

attempting          to    revive        them with             mouth        to m o u t h      resuscitation                and    heart

massage.        All       the       casualties           at     this       time       had    the    same        complexions            as

the    first,       t h eir     bodies         were      still        warm       but       they were          not    breathing,

and    there    was       no    evidence           of a n y        pulse.            Any    efforts       made       to    revive

them    were    made          without        g a i n at       t hat       time,       and    repeated           enquiries            were

made    with     people         in the         crowd       in a n         effort       to    find       anyone       with medical

training.           I finally           returned           to      the     front       of    the    terrace          where       the

remainder       of       the    casualties              were       taken        out    through          the    front       fencing

which    had    now       been       cut a w a y        and     o nce      the       terrace       had    been       cleared          of

casualties          I made          my w a y      onto     the       pitch where             I assisted             with    other

fans    who    required             minor      attention and assisted                          in the m o v e m e n t           of

             I have         previously            submitted my written                 recollections             in    respect        of    the

              (150489).              I now w i s h      to   clarify        certain matters                 concerning        the

             deceased              persons      I had    dealings         with.




             Having / n t ered              the    ground      at    3.07pm       (1507),       I made        my way      through          the

             tupn/i         under        the W S t a n d a n d       onto      the L e p p i n g s     Ln    terraces.         y     went       to

                   who     t h e y were.             We    carried          him    b ack      out    through          the       t u n n e l , and         placed

                   him     on     thdf g r o u n d        about     13 f ee t          from    the    tunnel          entrance             towards            the

                   left-hand            side.         I tried          to    resuscitate             him     until         a    l ady w h o        said        she

                   was     an     off-duty           nurse       approached             and    took       over       from       us    in a t t e m p t i n g

                   to    revive         him.



                   1 then went            back        down       the     tunnel         into       Pen 3 .       I went          to     the       front        of

                   the     terracing            towards          the     right-hand            side.         I there            saw     the       body        of a

                   male     person.             He    was       lying       on    the    ground       on     his      side,          facing        the

                   pitch .         He was        wearing          light          coloured          trousers          a n d a b lue          jacket,
T>C(
                   somewhat          scruffy.              It w a s      lightweight.                He    had       f air      ha ir      about        col l a r

                   1e n g t h .     He was           shorter       than          the    first       person.           Together             with      other

                   officers,            I carried           him    out       through          the    tunnel          and       placed       him      on       the

                   ground         near    to     the       first       body.           The    nurse       indicated             t hat      she w o u l d

                   attempt         to    revive           him,    but       I thought          that       he w a s     d e a d as          w e ll.


                                                                                                                      5513
                   I returned again                   to P e n     3 a n d wa s          called       by P O L PC 1 5 37 F A I R C L O U G H                   to

                       TWENTY-FIRST DAY'S PROCEEDINGS

                         WEDNESDAY, 14th JUNE, 1989

                            (AFTERNOON   SESSION)


                           STUART THORPE Recalled

                       Cross-examined by MR. WOODWARD:

      Q. Mr. Thorpe, I was asking you about the obligation of a
         steward to remain in his position throughout. - A. Yes.

      Q. Have you got page 58, please, in the club's bundle or
         do you have your little booklet there which sets out
         your obligations? - A. That is right.

      Q.    Does that - sir, if we look at page 58 in the bundle -
           does that show you at paragraph 4 there about the
           obligation to remain in the position until the final
           whistle is gone and the area is clear? - A. Yes.

      Q. Do you see that? - A. Yes.

      Q. Does it then say, "The practice of stewards leaving
         their position before the final whistle will not be
         tolerated"? - A. That is right.

      Q. You knew of that rule? - A. Yes.

      Q.   Does it then say "except in an emergency"and then,
           "Stewards should not leave their place of duty without
           the consent of the Chief Steward or Senior Police
           Officer"? - A. That is right, yes.

      Q.    What was the point of stewards having their tabards   on?
           - A. Well, I have got to lock them away and where I    pay
           my stewards it is just a counter.

      Q. What is the point of them wearing tabards? - A. Well, so
         people can recognise them as stewards.

      Q. So how would that occur in the event of an emergency
         happening after you had paid your stewards? - A. I
         would not have paid my stewards in an emergency.   I
         only pay my stewards ....

      Q.   Forgive me. It is my fault.   If you had paid your
           stewards and they had handed their tabards in. - A.
           It would have been end of the match.

      Q. Are you saying that you did not pay your stewards until
         after the final whistle? - A. About three minutes before
         the final whistle I pay my stewards because where I pay
         *

                                           76


                                                                   S. THORPE

                  my stewards there is no office whatsoever.   It is the
                  counter of the snack bar.  And when I am paying 26
                  stewards I have got money to pay stewards.  I do not
                  want to get mugged by supporters coming down the steps
                  from out of the seating.

             Q. So are you saying that it is just a moment    or two before
                the final whistle goes? - A. Yes.

             Q. And they then go back to their positions, do they? - A.
                That is right.

             Q. The gates are opened about 10 minutes before the final
                whistle? - A . On a League match, yes, about 5 or 10
                minutes before the end of the match because a lot of
                people leaving the ground to get to the coaches and
                the cars, but when we get a biggish match, Manchester
                United coming to Hillsborough Everton, Liverpool, the
                Police seem to hold them back so they can get   the coaches
                round to firry them away from the ground.

             Q. Your area of responsibility was where? Where did it begin
                in relation to the turnstiles? Where did your area of
                responsibility begin? - A. Bottom of the steps of the
                stands.

             Q.   At the bottom of the steps of the stands. - A.   Yes. That
                  is where my area starts.

             Q. And how far then did it go? Did it go to the balcony
                front at the front of the stand? ~ A. Yes, ali the way
                round the ground - all the way round the seating area
                of the West Stand.

             Q.    And is that an area which you   patrol,from the bottom of
                  the steps to the balcony front of the   stand? - A. I do
                  not go to the bottom of the steps of the balcony,you know.
                  I do not go to the bottom.

             Q. But you would be going up and down the gangways and around?
                - A. Yes, seeing my stewards are all right in their
                positions.

             Q. Did you have any stewards at the bottom of those gangways?
                - A. I have two - there are two fire escapes, at the
                right-hand side of the stand and the left-hand side of
                the stand because, the briefing of the match, Inspector
                asked me the names of those two stewards.

             Q. You have two stewards in the West Stand at the front?
                - A. Yes.

             Q.And they are positioned one at each end? - A. That is
                quite correct.
                              77


                                                     S. THORPE

Q. There are no stewards across the centre? ~A. Just at the
   turnstiles - at the gangways.  As you come up the steps
   there are gangways.

Q. You mean at the back of the stand? - A a. Well, it is middle,
   more or less.  Middle of the stand.

Q. Where are your stewards, Mr. Thorpe, in ;the West Stand?
    Whereabouts would you expect to find them, please? - A.
   As you come up the steps there is a landing and there are
   six steps leads up to the seating area, gangways.    There
   are two stewards stand at top of that gangway.   It is just
   a small one, about half-a-dozen steps, and they just look
   at the tickets, as the supporters come in, which way to go.
   The seating is numbered from 1 to 30.

Q. So you have two at those steps? - A. Yes.

Q. Where else do you have them in the stand? -A. Bottom
   corner. Two in every stand.  Go from D to Z,

Q. Four stewards in the West Stand? - A. No.  There is two
   in every gangway.  There are six gangways, six gangways,
   where they go up to the ticket, from U to Z.

Q. So at each gangway in the West Stand at the back there
   are two stewards to be found? - A. Yes.

Q. Do those stewards have any view    across the people in
   the West Stand? - A. Oh, yes.

Q. Do they have any responsibility for controlling those
   people? -A. No,   Just show them - only way they have
   got is to tell them where their seat is and if someone
   is sat in their seat they come back, they tell them
   that someone is in my seat and that steward goes to
   have a look if he has got the right ticket.

Q. Do we understand that on this day, the occasion of
   the semi-final in April, there were a number of people
   who were in the wrong seats in the West Stand? - A, Yes.

Q. People who should    not have been there? - A. That is
   quite correct.

Q. And who when approached and asked to move were most
   unco-operative? - A. That is right.  The language was
   terrible.

Q. I am sorry? - A. The language was terrible.

Q.   And there were quite a number of those,   were there?- A. Yes.

Q.   More than you would have expected? - A.   That is right.

                                                          S. THORPE

Q* 1    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Is that people who were in
   the wrong seats or who had no stand tickets at all? - A.
   Some of them had no stand tickets whatsoever, sir, and ....

Q. How had they got past down the bottom of the steps? - A.
   Some of them had climbed up from the front, been pulled
   up from the front.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Oh, I see.

Q.         MR. WOODWARD:   Some of them had come      up from the
     front? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you see that happening in any numbers? -A. I only
   saw it on the television.

Q. On the day? - A. Well, I did not see it but some of my
   stewards saw it.   They told me that they were climbing
   up from the front.

Q. Did any of your stewards report that to you? - A. They
   tell me.

Q. On the day? -A. They tell the Police when anything happens
   like that.

Q. Did any of your stewards report it       to you?   -A. Yes.

Q. Did you report that to Mr. Lock? - A. No.  It is the
   Police.  Report it to the Police because Mr. Lock
   cannot do anything.  He has got to refer it back to
   the Police.

Q.   But if there were numbers of people in the West Stand
     who should not have been there that would be a matter
     for the stewards tohave to deal with, would not it? - A.
     No, it is the Police, to eject them out of the ground.
     They have not got to be involved with anything like that,
     in thewwrong seats.   If they won't move out of the seats
     the Police eject them out of the ground.

Q.    There seem to be two stages to it.  If someone is observed
     to be in a place that he should not be in the steward comes
     along and says, "Excuse me.    May I see your ticket? You
     are in the wrong seat," and the steward deals with it if
     he can? -A. If he can.

Q.And if there are numbers of people like that is  that not
   something that you would report back to your control room?
   - A. Report it to the Police.

Q. You have a radio, do not you? - A. Yes.

Q.What is it for? - A. Reporting matters.          Thatmatter    is for
                                 79


                                                         S. THORPE

     the Police, not the club.   What can the club do if they
     are sat in the wrong seat and they have not got tickets?
     The club cannot do nothing.   It is the Police to eject
     them from that area, not the club.   That is my underÂ­
     standing.

Q. Are you saying that so far as you         are concerned no
   instruction had been given to you         by the club to
   report people being in the wrong          place, being in
   the stand when they should not be         there? -A. No.

Q. Did you know that the club was monitoring, so far as it
   could, the admission to the various parts of the ground?
   -A. Oh, y e s .

Q. What do you report on your         radio to the club? -A. Any
   accidents, if stewards are         short, stewards are late,
   anything like that and for         medical - it is more or less
   for anyone getting hurt in         my stand.

Q.Does it follow from that .... -A. Calling Mr. Lock if
   there is anyone injured so they can get the St. Johns
   into my stand.

Q. So it is in the event of an emergency you would use
   your radio? -A. Yes.

Q. Where there has been an injury? - A. That is quiteÂ®correct.

Q.    Does itfollow from that that on the day ofthis match      you
     had no radio contact with Mr. Lofek? -A. No.

Q.   It does follow? - A. Yes.

Q.   You did not speak to him once on your radio? - A. Spoke to
     him once asking for more medical people after he had been
     over the PA system.

Q.   But that was after the incident had happened? - A. Yes.

Q.    But before the incident, whilst the crowd are coming in,
     people being found in the wrong seats, is this the
     position, there was no radio communication between you
     and Mr. Lock? - A. No.

Q. Nor radio communication between you and anyone else? - A.
   No.

Q.   The club radio is in fact on talk through? - A. Yes.

Q.   It is on talk through, is not it? - A. That is quite
     correct.

Q.So you are able to hear any messages? â€œ A. That is right.
                                   80


                                                             S. THORPE

Q. That are being passed.      For example,         to Mr. Lock? - A.
   That is right.

Q. If there were more people in your stand than should have
   been there than you had expected was there any reason   for
   not   telling Mr. Lock about it? - A. No, only spy - Ihave
   always done this - is fetch a Policeman, if we have got
   too many people in without tickets and in the wrong seat
   giving abuse, go to the Police and ask him to eject him
   out of the ground.   If he does not eject him out of the
   ground or anything like that we have got to take his
   number and report him.   That is. That is on rules for
   my stewards in that stand.

Q.     Yes.  You have that identified in your rulebook, I think?
     - A.That is quite correct.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:           Page 58.

          MR. WOODWARD:     Yes.        No. 5 there:

Q. "Stewards are responsible for ensuring spectators are in
   the correct seats and when this is not the case they have
   a responsibility in the first instance to request them to
   do so." And then you get in touch with the Police? - A .
   That is right.

Q.Well, were there any people who actually moved when you
   asked them to? -A. Some of    them moved but ,...

Q.There were some    that    did? -         A. Yes.

Q. Did you see where they went? - A. They were brought downÂ­
   stairs, ejected from the ground and some of them went into
   the proper seats.

Q. If your responsibility began at the bottom of the stairs
   what steward - do you know his name - had the responsibility
   for the forecourt? -A.There was no-one on the foreceort
   whatsoever.

Q.    There was no steward who had any responsibility for the
     area between your stairs and the back of the turnstiles?
     - A. No.

Q. You have spoken of seeing people hanging around in the
   area?- A. Yes.

Q. Milling about betweenthe stairs .... - A.That is right.

Q ..... and the   turnstiles.  Is this the position, that there
    was no-one from the club who was doing anything to deal
    with those people? -A. No, because a lot of people wait
    for their mates coming in and they stand talking.   There

                                                            S. THORPE

           are the toilets there and there is a refreshment bar.
           They go to the refreshment bar and they stand there
           eating and I do not th&fc -fif a a y m m went up to them
           and told them to go to the terracing you will get a
           lot of abuse, "Who do you think you are talking to?"
           and the language is very nice to you.

      Q. Are you saying that there were no clubs Officials dealing
         with people in the forecourt? - A* No.

      Q.   You agree? - A. I agree, yes.

      Q.    If you had sent someone down the stairs because he had
           not got a ticket from the West Stand .... - A. The Police
           do that, not me, not the stewards, the Police.

      Q.The Police do that? - A. Yes.  They bring them right down
         and eject them out of the ground.

                                    S. THORPE



May I just ask you one matter on the emergency procedure,
the evacuation.  Do you have the Club's bundle please,
page 13, there is a document entitled:  "Emergency
Evacuation Procedure";

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Are you moving off this
booklet?

      MR. WOODWARD:   I am sir.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Can I just ask you.  Would
you look at page 49 for a moment please before we go on.
That is the outside, is it, of this booklet we have been
looking at? - A. That is quite correct.

And it says there:  "1988/1989 West Stand Steward".  Is
there any different booklet for any Stewards elsewhere?
- A. Yes, North Stand.  The Stewards for the North Stand
they have "North Stand" on their books and books similar
to that sir. They are different from the Gatemen.   They
have Gatemen in for the turnstiles ....

That is the full range, is it? - A. Yes.

Particular named Stands and Gatemen and who else? ~ A.
The turnstile operators come under the gatemen, the
North Stand and there is one for the South Stand.

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Right, thank you.

       MR. WOODWARD:  You have got a little green booklet
 there, Mr. Thorpe? - A. Yes.

 Is that the same one.  Forgive me, will you hold it up
 again because the print seems to be somewhat different.
 1988/89 is in much bolder figures thafi the one that we
 have got copied.  It may be unimportant.   That is page 49.

       I have asked you about the Stewards or any stewarding
 between the West Stand and the turnstiles. Do you have
 any Stewards with any responsibility for the turnstiles?
 - A. No.
. Do you have any Stewards who had the task in front of
  the turnstiles, between the turnstiles and the Leppings
  Lane gates? - A. No.
. So really it is not until a supporter gets to the bottom
  of your stairs that he is really going to encounter
  his first Steward who is going to help him togo anywhe e?
  - A. That is right, yes.

. Are there any Stewards at the tunnel entranee?    - A. No.

. Hasthat always been the     case? - A. Yes.
                                  S. THORPE


So the direction of any individual coining through the turnÂ­
stiles relies almost entirely upon the writing upon the
notices? - A. That is quite correct.

There is nothing else to help them? - A. No.

To help with their confusion. May I ask you about the
day that this incident occurred. You were expecting,
weren't you, that there would be some Liverpool Stewards
coming to join your forces? - A. That is right, yes.

I think if we look at page 3 of your statement this was
information you had received from Mr. Lock, the bottom
of page 3, do you see:

      "I now turn to my involvement in the events
      which took place on 15th April 1989 ....

A. Yes.

Then it goes on:

      "I picked up my radio and made my way to the
      West Stand.  I was told at the previous
      match by Doug Lock ...."

Now that is a match that had taken place at Hillsborough,
is it? - A. Yes.

What a week or so.   How long before? - A. A week before.

So according to your understanding from-Mr. Lock some firm
arrangement had been made .... A. With me as well for
temporary Stewards, for my temporary Stewards to come and
I had arranged it with Doug Lock to have ten temporary
Stewards.

So you had asked Mr. Lock, had you, at some planning stage
for additional Stewards? - A. That is right.

Ten in number? - A. That is right.

Because you thought you needed ten? - A. That is right.

Those were Stewards who you were expecting to come from
Liverpool? - A. No, it is the Stewards that I had employed
the year before.
The Lloyd brothers? - A. No. Them ten temporary Stewards
was temporary Stewards for me last year.

I see, these were Hillsborough men, were they? - A. Yes.

Not Liverpudlians? - A. No.
                                 S. THORPE


But you were expecting before the day of the match that
there would be Stewards coming from Liverpool? - A. No,
I did not expect anyone.

You had had some in the previous year, hadn't you? - A.
Yes.

And they had been paid for? - A. No, they were not paid
for in the previous year.

In 1988? - A. No.

Had they taken part in the stewarding in 1988? - A. Yes.

Had they worn their Liverpool colours, their tabards?
- A. Yes.

How many were there. Were there about eight? - A. Six
to eight of them last year.

I think on page 4 of your statement you describe:

      "During the 1988 semi final, the Lloyd
      brothers had stewarded the terrace with   g
      about 6 other Liverpool stewards."

A. Yes.

So that is right, there were six plus the Lloyds and they
had stewarded the terrace, had they? - A. Yes. Well they
went on to the terrace where they said they were going
to go and I left it at that.

But you were directing them, weren't you? - A. I told
them to go there.

Where did you send them? - A. I sent them to the southÂ­
west side of the Stand to the terracing.

Well what was the point of sending them there? - A. Because
I can't send them under the tunnel because there was a
Policeman there, a load of Policemen.

Are you saying that if there had not been Policemen there
you would have sent some Liverpool Stewards on to the
terraces under the tunnel? - A. If any of the Stewards
had come I would have done but like I have been saying,
it is not my responsibility for stewarding of the
terracing.  I have been to two or three semi-finals away
from Sheffield to watch Sheffield Wednesday and we have
never had Stewards in the terracing.

Are you saying that you would have sent Stewards on to
the terrace but there were Policemen in the tunnel? -
A. Yes.

                                      S. THORPE


Q. Do you mean the Policemen were in the way? - A. They were
   stood at each side of the tunnel.

Q. Well why did that prevent you from sending Stewards on
   to the terrace? - A. I sent them to the right-hand side.
   They could filter their way round if they wanted to.

Q. Why did the presence of Policemen prevent you sending
   Stewards on to the terrace? - A. I don't know really
   but I sent them that way.

Q. You have given that as a reason, you see. Why is it a
   reason? What reason is it? - A. Well that right-hand
   side it filters a lot with Policemen on horseback and
   you get a lot of Police standing there in case they are
   wanted for emergency. You seem to get a lot of Police
   around that area and I said:  "Go round that area and
   then you can filter across to 1 and 2 Pens from the back".

Q. I am sorry, we may be at cross purposes, but as I underÂ­
   stood it the reason for not lending Stewards into Pens 3
   and 4 was because there were Policemen in the tunnel? -
   A. Yes.

Q. Well why is that a reason? How does that prevent you
   sending Stewards on to 3 and 4? - A. Well I can't send them
   on to 3 and 4, they have got to go through the gates and
   they have got to go through a crowd. I just tell them to
   go there. I told them to go there and that is my final
   with them.

Q. You have told us that you told them to go there? - A. Yes.

Q. The reason you told them to go there was something to do
   with Policemen in the tunnel? - A. Well there was a lot
   of Policemen in the tunnel. They can see to that.

Q. Why did that prevent you, Mr. Thorpe, sending Stewards
   on to the terrace as you thought of doing? - A. I don't
   know to tell you the truth.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Well you must have meant
     something. Did you mean the Policemen would not have
     liked them going there for some reason or the Policemen
     were already looking after that so you did not need them
     or what? - A. They did not need it really because the
     Police was looking after it.

Q. That was the reason? - A. Yes.

Q. Were they wearing tabards when they went? - A. Yes sir.

Q.         MR. WOODWARD: You say there were "a lot" of
     Policemen in the tunnel or one or two either side? - A.
     There would be about three or four either side of the
     tunne1.

            Q. At what time is that? - A. They were there all the match.

            Q. This is 1988 we are talking about? - A . Yes, they were
               there all the match because I know a lot of them and they
               used to stand and talk well before the match.

            Q. Where were they? - A. The bottom of the tunnel.

            Q. Is that the entrance to the tunnel? - A. Just to the
               entrance to the tunnel by the toilet doors.

            Q. Well you would not be able to see them from up on the
               West Stand balcony, would you? - A. No, I would bring
               them downstairs.  I saw them from the bottom of the steps.
               I brought them downstairs.
            Q. In 1989 the two Lloyd brothers came and spoke to you
               again? - A. Yes.
            Q. And according to your statement that you made, they gave
               you information that there would be a lot of fans coming
               from Liverpool without tickets? - A. Yes. They were at
               the bottom of the steps and we were all talking.

            Q. It was a point of conversation, wasn't it? - A. Yes,
               a point of conversation, that is quite correct.

            Q. They were making a point of telling you? - A. Yes.

            Q. As if it was news? - A. Well it is news. We get it a lot
               at big semi-finals people coming without tickets and we
               just take it that the Police will cope with it. Every
               semi-final there is always a lot who travel without
               tickets trying to get in.
             Q. But if it was nothing more than you would ordinarily have
                expected, if it was not a matter of news why did you set
                it out in your statement? - A. Well I just put it m
                my statement, that is all.
             Q. Weren't they telling you that more than usual were going
                to be coming? - A. Yes.

             q   .   now if more than usual turned up withÂ°utT7t^ kÂ®^sw^ ^
                     would cause problems, wouldn't it? - A. Well it would
                     not for the Police.
             Q. it would not for the Police but it would have keen more
                than they might have expected? - A. I can t say that s .

             Q.       Did you thinkof passing that piece of information on
                     to anybody? - A. No.
             Q.       So that the Police if they had n o t got it   fromsomewhere
                     else might be warned? - A. A lot of times        ..
                                    S. THORPE


      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Mr. Woodward, he has been
asked that before already and he said no, it never crossed
his mind.

      THE WITNESS: The Police get to     know a lot when fans
are travelling down,   at other matches fans aretravelling
down without tickets. The Police seem to get to know as
well over their PA system because I have known a lot of
the Police for years and they have all left that area now
and they all seem to   be new ones.

      MR. WOODWARD:   In    the statement   you madeyou said:

      "They also said ...." that is the Lloyd brothers,
      ".... that they thought there was going to be
      a lot of trouble."

A. Yes, they did say a lot of trouble but we get that
coming from other supporters other semi-finals.  "You are
going to get some trouble, you have no tickets". The
reason was Liverpool wanted the Kop and they got the
Leppings Lane end and that is where we got a lot of abuse
to my Stewards in the Stand. "We should have had that
f-ing end". That was the language.   I can't pronounce
some of the language what was said to my Stewards because
there is that many ladies present in this room. They
were just shouting at us as we were going up the step:
"This Stand ought to fall down" and things like that to
my Stewards. Abuse, it was disgusting.

More Liverpool Stewards arrived while you were talking
to the Lloyds? - A. Yes.

Do you remember how many? - A. About five or six.

In your statement you said "7 or 8"? - A. Well it might
have been 7 or 8.

At that time there was a discussion as to where they would
go, how they would be used? - A. I told them:  "There is
no room up here for you. You can go on the terrace amongst
your own supporters" because I said I would not put my
Stewards in that area. No way will a home Steward go
amongst away supporters in a ground.

Did you know that that was just the plan in respect of
the Kop? - A. Well the Kop was all Nottingham Forest
supporters. They were well behaved.




                           /Q. In your statement
                                         S . THORPE

In your statement, you said "I explained that my stewards
had already been allocated to the stewarding of the stand
and that they (the Liverpool stewards) were needed to look
after the terraces as before"?   A. Yes.

You needed stewards to look after the terraces? A. Well,
I told them to go and look after the terraces.  I may
have said it wrong in my statement, but my idea were just
to put them on there and that's it.  I wasn't interested
in the terracing whatsoever.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  You know, Mr. Woodward, if
you will forgive me - and I am not saying this in any
way against you - I do feel that we are getting the
Liverpool stewards a bit out of proportion, are we not?
I mean we are taking an enormous amount of time over
them and we are only talking about six chaps.

       Mr. WOODWARD:   Sir, if the time is disproportionate -

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I am beginning to feel that
it is .

      Mr. WOODWARD:  Then I apologise.  Thank you, sir.
Sir, I am reminded by my learned junior of something that
I must put.

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Yes, of course.

      Mr. WOODWARD:   In your statement, Mr. Thorpe, on
page2, the statement that you made to the police, at
the top of the page, you say "All the stewards posted
by me worked in the vicinity of the West Stand"? A. Yes,
that's quite correct.

"I have no responsibility for the men working on pens
1 to 7"?   A.  That's right, if there is any put on
there.

Sorry?   A.  If there's any stewards put on there, I'm
not responsible for them.

So that is what you meant,    is it?   A. Yes.

       Mr. WOODWARD:    Thank you, Mr. Thorpe. Thank you,
sir.

            Cross-examined by Mr. GLASGOW:

Mr. Thorpe, you have been asked some questions about your
statements, your two statements, and I want to ask you
about them.  I think you answered a questionnaire for the
police?   A. That's quite correct, sir.

And gave them as much information as you could recall?
A. Yes, sir.
                                         S. THORPE

I think you were then seen by a solicitor?       A. Yes.

Who took a long time with you and asked you a great many
more questions?   A. That's quite correct.

And you have been perfectly properly asked about sane of
the additional material which you put in your second
statement?   A. That's right.

Perhaps you would make this plain, Mr. Thorpe.  Was it
made plain to you when you were asked to come and assist
this Inquiry that you should tell that solicitor everything
which you could recall that might be of assistance to
this Inquiry, whether or not it was thought to be helpful
to the Club? A. That's quite correct.

And have you attempted to do that, both in your statement
and your evidence?   A. Yes.

Thank you, Mr. Thorpe.  I would like you to go on doing
so and bear with me for a few minutes if you would.
A.   All right.

First, I want to take you back to 1981 and I want to ask
you about the incident which occurred outside the ground
and then about anything you can help the Inquiry on that
happened inside the ground.  Outside the ground first.
Is it right that in that year, 1981, that was the year
that saw some of the first football unpleasantness outside
this ground that your Club had ever unfortunately witnessed?
A.  That is correct.

It was the first year, to your knowledge, in which there
had been, in a word, violence on the streets? A. That's
right.

There had been fighting between rival fans - and let it
be said that none of them was from Liverpool? A. That's
quite correct.

Local residents had been disgusted and offended and had
made complaints both to the police and to the club?
A. Yes.

As the people who had invited those fans to the area?
A. Yes, that's right, and also to the MP's.

Yes, Members of Parliament?       A.   Members of Parliament.

You have rightly been asked about this.  There were
accounts of violence, of drunkenness and of thoroughly
 anti-social behaviour? A.   That's quite correct.

For the first time?   A.   Yes.

Can I bring you to the area outside the turnstiles where
your colleagues were working?   A. Yes.

                                             S. THORPE

Q. Is it right that despite what was happening in the streets
   in that area, the turnstiles had orderly queues of well-
   behaved people in that year?   A.  They had, y.es.

Q. And, despite all that was going on with the hooligan
   element, which was then even smaller in proportion than
   it is today, it was completely unaffecting the queueing
   at the turnstiles?   A.  That's right.

Q. And the turnstiles coped and the men had no difficulty
   whatsoever?   A.  That's correct.

Q. Was there a problem with segregation of fans as a result
   of the fighting that there had been in the streets?
   A.  No, there was no segregation.

Q. There was no segregation until that game?       A. Until that
   ga m e .

Q. I simply want to ask you this:   Did you know that the
   police were concerned as a result of the queueing of that
   match, that there should be segregation if possible in
   the future?   A. Yes, they were.

Q. And was one of the incidents which resulted from the
   warfare and the fighting in the streets that individual
   groups of fans had had to be brought to the ground almost
   under police protection?    A. That's correct.

Q. At that time, had it been important to which end of the
   ground they were delivered, do you recall? A. The
   Tottenham supporters were brought to the Leppings Lane
   end and the Wolves supporters were took to the Penistone
   Road end.

Q. And there came a stage when, despite the orderly queueing*
   a very small group of approximately, I think you said
   50 ---   A.  50, that's quite correct.

Q.   -- was brought to 'C ' Gate?     A. That's right.

Q.    Was that as a result of a general    crush that was happening
     outside the gates?     A. I couldn't really tell you, sir.
     They brought them and we opened them gates, and what we
     did was we put them up at the side of the wall and they
     were coming steady.

Q. When you say "They brought them", is it right that they
   were lined up on the outside?   A. Yes.

Q. And that a number of stewards, with police, had been asked
   to stand inside the gate in advance?   A. That's quite
   correct.

Q.   And the 50 or so people were brought in and their   tickets
     were properly checked?   A.    That s right.

               Q. And they were sent to the area of the ground where they
                  should go?   A. Yes, that's right.

               Q. I simply have to ask you this Mr. Thorpe.  If you cannot
                  help, then of course you must say so.  Did you believe
                  that that was part of the attempt to segregate fans or
                  as a result of a crushing incident that had occurred
                  outside the turnstiles?   A. The crushing outside the
                  turnstiles.

               Q. So be it.  But your recollection is that there was
                  orderly queueing      A. Orderly queueing.

               Q. Throughout that period?       A. Yes.

               Q. That is right?   A. Yes.  They were fetched and they were
                  going right across the bridge, and that's where a lot was
                  brought from, because they were going up Leppings Lane
                  end.  They brought them from the top and then they started
                  coming in orderly and there was no trouble as they were
                  coming i n .

               Q. No trouble of any kind?       A. No, orderly, joyful and
                  everything;  no trouble.

               Q. No trouble in the queueing?       A. No, not as they was coming
                  in.

               Q.   Thank you.   I would now like to move to inside    the ground
                    in that year, Mr. Thorpe.     Did you know that    there had
                    been any trouble of any kind on the terraces?       A. No, I
                    did not.

               Q. Whether or not you knew of injury?         A. I didn't know of any
                  injuries whatsoever.

               Q. But even if you were unaware of that, you knew that there
                  had been a police briefing shortly after that match when
                  views had been exchanged between the Club and the Police?
                  A.  No, I don't remember if anything like that happened.

               Q.   Well, you remember Mr. Calvert?       A. Yes.

               Q. Chief Inspector Calvert.        You remember him coming to talk
                  to you?   A. Yes.

               Q. And you have told us that Chief Inspector Calvert said
                  something about the divisions of responsibility between
                  his men and your men, putting it bluntly? A. That's
                  right, yes.

               Q. In the course of that, did Chief Inspector Calvert suggest
                  that he thought that stewards ought to be on the terraces?
                  A. He thought that, yes.

               Q. And you left the meeting, I think , at the end, without
                  making any protest?   A. That's right, yes.
                                     S. THORPE

But a number of stewards did protest?     A. That's right.

And said that they thought â€” --   A. It was too dangerous.

And, whether it was right of them or not, they were critical
of the policeman for suggesting that they ought to be on
the terraces?   A. Yes.

Did you know that as a result of that exchange of views,
there was a complete separation of the way in which the
terraces were organised? A.   Yes, after that.

As a result of this exchange of views between the Police
and the Club following that difference of opinion, the
terraces were divided into pens?   A.  That's right, yes.

And from that moment onwards did you hear anybody ever
suggest that the stewards were responsible for policing
the pens?   A. N o .

But it is right to say that until they were divided, and
as a result of the 1981 trouble, you had heard the
suggestion made which had provoked annoyance --- A. Annoyance
with the stewards.

Yes.   Once the terrace had been divided up into pens, who
controlled the people who went in and out of those pens?
A.   The police.

Did the Club attempt to organise, for some years, a ticket
numbering system so as to divide fans between those pens?
A. Yes, they did.

And did you recall that there had been a time when there
had been numbers hanging outside the concourse area?
A.  Yes, there was numbers hanging.

And I am sure that you seek to be helpful, Mr. Thorpe.
Those numbers have now gone?   A. Yes.

And the signs which are left are not as helpful as they
ought to be, are they?   A. No, they are not, not really.

No.  But did the system of numbered pens and numbered
tickets have to be given up? A.    No.

Do you remember that up to today there is not a numbering
system for the tickets between the different pens? A. I
have not seen any.

You have had no involvement in the ticketing of the terraces
at all?   A.   No.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I am sorry, I did not get the
answer to your question whether the numbering had to be
given up.
                                                   S. THORPE

         Mr. GLASGOW:    He has no knowledge, sir.

         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       He does not know.

         Mr. GLASGOW:    I will have to take it up with someone
else .

         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       Thank you.

      Mr. GLASGOW:  I would now like to bring you right
forward to 1988, and may I simply in the interests of
 shortness - and if you want to say more, please
interrupt - put to you the results.  Since 1981, the
only changes that there have been in organisation have
been the division of the terraces into pens?   A. Yes.

A vast increase in the number of police both outside and
inside the ground?   A.  Very big increase in police.

A very big increase, and a very big increase in the
number of stewards?  A.   That's right.

Inside and outside the ground?           A.   That's right.

And a small increase in the number of turnstiles,
specifically two to deal with the terraces? A. That's
right, yes.

And some changes in the lay-out to assist your organisation
outside the ground?  A.   Yes.

And after those changes had come about, principally in
1984 and 1985, had you seen or heard any trouble of any
kind in policing any of the matches that have happened
since then?   A. No.

I would now like to ask you, Mr. Thorpe, about your
conversation with the Lloyd brothers, which you very
properly volunteered and which has been put before the
Inquiry.  I simply want to know whether you can now
remember at what stage that conversation took place,
in terms of time, first of all?    A.  It was after 2 o'clock.

After 2 o'clock?        A.   Yes.

I do not know whether you were in theroom  yesterday,
were you?   A.  Yes, I was in the room, sir.

It may be that there is a perfectly genuine difference of
recollection between you and the Lloyd brothers.   Do you
remember that they do not believe thatthat conversation
did take place?   A.   Yes.  It was at  the bottom of the
steps, on the rightâ€œhand side at the bottom of the steps,
and we also saw some more Liverpool people, because when
he was sat up near his brother, I was stood with Jimmy,
and there were about five or six Liverpool supporters and
their stewards and they came in with tickets and they were

stood talking to me, because I know them because they have
come in at previous matches and they always have a chat
with me.

                                                    J. CASTLEY

Q. Do you know whether the wording inside the book is the
   same as for other stewards? - A. It will be the same,
   yes.   The only difference that is possibly there is
   there may be a difference   on theoutside, saying Kop.
   I really do not know.

Q. Can you let us have a copy of one of those booklets?
   Got it with you? - A. I have mine.  Mine actually says
   North Stand steward.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Says what?- A.Mine actually
     saysNorth ^Stand steward.

Q. That is your father 1s , .=is it? -A. No, no. It is mine.
   I only got the job as Chief Steward on the Kop this
   season - I think it was probably decided late on, before
   they had actually given me my ....

Q.        MR. GOLDSACK:  That is a different colour .... - A.
     It is, yes.  That is what I am saying.

Q.What colour is the Spion Kop .... - A. I do not actually
   know whether there is a particular one.  I do not know.

Q. All right.  Just one other matter, please, Mr. Castley.
   You were of course at the semi-final stewarding away
   fans, were not you, on the Spion Kop? -A. Yes.

Q. Which is not the normal situation? - A. That is correct.

Q. Was any thought given to removing stewards from the
   Spion Kop area for that match? - A. Not before the
   start of the match, no.

Q. So as the match approached the fact that you would not
   be stewarding your own supporters did not give you any
   cause for concern? - A. Not unduly, no, not until later
   on when I moved - when I came to the front of the Kop.

Q.   You mean there were   some problems on the day? - A.   Yes.

Q.    But you had not felt before the match .... - A. Had   not
     anticipated any.

Q ....... that it would be so unsafe you could not put your
    stewards there? - A. No.

Q.    Do you know whether any consideration was g^ven to
     putting stewards on the Leppings Lane terrace before
     that match? - A. No, none at all, as far as I am aware.

          MR. GOLDSACK:    Thank you.

                             Cross-examined by MR. HYTNER:

           Q. I would just like to take that up, if I may, Mr. Castley.
              The philosophy at Hillsborough was that the home
              supporters were stewarded but the away supporters
              were not.  Is that correct? - A. I do not believe it
              would be right to say that, no, because there are
              away supporters that sit down in the West Stand ....

           Q. I am sorry.  I should have been more precise.  Those
              who stand up, of the standing supporters who would
              stand on the Kop or stand on the terraces, the normal
              philosophy was home supporters were stewarded within
              the terrace;  away supporters were not? - A. I cannot
              really comment on that.  It has never been within my
              remit to have any discussions about really the away
              supporters and how they are stewarded.

           Q. All right.    Let's just deal with .... - A. As far as -
              sorry.

           Q. I am sorry.   May be that somebody higher up than you
              should answer those questions.   Now, let's just deal
              with your duties on the Kop. We know that the Kop*
              takes something like 21,000 supporters.   There is a
              capacity.   Was it ever brought to your attention that
              possibly due to people coming in with forged tickets
              or jumping the turnstiles or something of that sort
              that there might theoretically be more than 21,000
              on the Kop? -A. No.

           Q. Was the possibility of overcrowding on the Kop ever
              brought to your attention as one of your duties? - A. No.

           Q. Was it ever brought to your attention that even with
              the normal capacity on the Kop some parts of it might
              actually be overcrowded whereas other parts might have
              space? - A. Brought to my attention, no.  I, as I
              stated, later on, I, looking, you know, my own personal
              opinion was that some areas may be. No-one else brought
              it to my attention.

           Q. You have now jumped to the semi-final, have you? - A.
              Yes.  Sorry.

           Q.   I am just talking generally, you see.- A. Oh, no.

           Q.    We know that at the other end - that is the Leppings Lane
                end - pens 3 and 4 traditionally fill up quicker than the
                other pens.   Precisely the same thing is likely terhappen
                at the Kop end, the early supporters will tend to go for
                the part behind the goal and fill that up first.    Is that
                right? -A. I do not really know.    I think it is more
                likely the Kop being home supporters, and being a lot
                of regular supporters, people will be more likely to
                                                J. CASTLEY

stand in the same place every time they go.  Certain fans
will prefer to stand behind the goal.  Other fans would
prefer to be off slightly to the wing.  It is obviously
up to their own - you know, what they decide, but there
does seem to be a great amount of people actually behind
the goal than anywhere else.

Yes.  That is right, is it?   Did it ever cross your mind
or did anybody ever bring it to your attention that if
there were too many crushed behind the goal they should
be dispersed to other areas? -A. I do not think it would
be possible for too many to crush behind the goal because
the Kop does not have the barriers going up - call them
radial barriers - the pens, in effect.  Therefore I do
not think you would get people crushing because, can I
say, maybe the younger people, the weaker people, maybe
the older people, if they wanted to be in that would not
want to stand in that area where there was likely to be
any crush.  They are very free to move about and so they
would not stand ....

It did not cross your mind there might be a crush anyÂ­
where? - A. No.

On the semi-final day you say at some stage you noticed
overcrowding in one section of the Kop, did you? -A. I
noticed - I would not really say overcrowding, no.
There obviously were a lot more people there than
normally at a League match and some of the fans did not
seem to be being quite as well behaved as would normally
be the case, being home fans.

I am not thinking of the way they behaved.  I am thinking
of the density.  Do you follow? - A. They were definitely
more dense ....

More dense. - A ....... than at a normal League match.

Was there any procedure that you knew of for dealing with
situation that you found on semi-final day where one part
was too dense? -A.As far as I am aware, no laid down proÂ­
cedures.  Nothing I have been told of.

            Cross-examined by MR. JACKSON:

Mr. Castley,you are now the Chief Steward at the Kop?
- A. That is correct.

Would you consider - I do not wish to be rude in any
way - it essential that the Kop be stewarded during a
match? - A. I think it is very important that the Kop
be stewarded to make sure that the alleyways up and
across the Kop are kept clear of people.  However,
whether it is possible for stewards to actually do
that is another question at all times.
                                                      J. CASTLEY

Q. I do not want to be rude but I do want to be sure we
   do not take too long about it.  There are very many
   jobs a steward does in the Kop end and you accept that
   that is essential? -A. I believe so, yes.

Qi Can you tell me what would have happened if.Evertonhad
   had drawn-Liverpool and Liverpool had been given the
   Kop end? - A. There would have been a lot of Liverpool
   supporters on the Kop.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Whichever end? - A. WhichÂ­
     ever end, sir, yes.

Q.        MR. JACKSON:   The position is, is it not, that no-
     one would have given any thought then to the Liverpool
     people being unstewardable, if there is such a word.
     It was the position of the ends, not the nature of the
     fans, that decided there was going to be no stewards.
     Mr. Castley, let me explain why I ask ....

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      I should give him a chance
     to answer the question.

          MR. JACKSON:    I was trying to make it as simple
     a question to ....

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      What you have done is to
     make a statement.

          MR. JACKSON:    Indeed.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Can we just see because I
     was going to ask about this?

          MR. JACKSON:    Yes.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I think what we have been
     told is that certainly at League games stewards do go
     on the^Kop? -A. Yes.

Q. That is a well established practice and it is usually
   home supporters? - A. H'm.

Q. It is also a large undivided area.       Right? - A. It is
   not divided ....

Q. Not radially divided, no. - A. That is correct.

Q.The Leppings Lane end is much narrower front to back?
   - A. Yes.

Q. It is also divided into pens? -A. Yes.

Q. And it is also where the away supporters usually are?
   - A. That is correct.

                                                       J. CASTLEY

Q. I'.'think what Counsel is putting as a statement but I
   would like to put as a question is,is the reason for
   not putting stewards on the Leppings Lane terraces
   but putting them on the Kop the difference between
   who is inside them or the layout at each end which
   is quite different? - A. I really do not feel able
   to comment on that ....

Q. Perhaps another Officer of the club may be able to help.

               Cross-examined by     MR. KALLIPETIS:

Q. Mr. Castley, page 3 of your statement to the Police.
   You said, "At about 2.50 p.m. I was at â€™0 â€™ Gate when
   I heard that the Liverpool fans had broken down a gate
   at the Leppings Lane end of the ground"? - A. Sorry.
   Can you ....

Q. Sorry.  On page 3 of your statement to the Police.
   - A. I am sorry, sir.I have not a copy of that.

Q.   I have just readout to you.  I will do it again.
     "At about 2.50 p.m. I was at '0' Gate when I heard
     that the Liverpool fans had broken down a gate at the
     Leppings Lane end of the ground." - A. Yes.

Q.   How did you hear that and from whom? -A. I cannot
     recollect who it came from.   I do not know whether
     it was from another steward or it was a Policeman
     in passing.  I really do not know.   I just seem to
     remember hearing that at roughly that time.

         MR. KALLIPETIS:     Thank you.

                 Cross-examined by MR. WOODWARD:

Q. Mr. Castley, is it 11 stewards for the^Kop? - A. There
   are normally, if they all turn up, there are normally
   II stewards on the Kop terrace.

Q. Was that the number you had on the semi-final day? -A.
   No.  I had an extra nine stewards making it 20.

         MR. WOODWARD:     Thank you.

                     By LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:

Q. Can you just help about one thing there?  On the Kop if
   I am not mistaken there are quite readily discernible
   gangways with steps at a different level from the main
   part of the terrace.  Is that right? - A. That is correct.

Q. Do you aim to keep those gangways free or not? - A.
   That is basically a Kop steward1sjob, to try and make
   sure as far as possible that they are kept free.

Q. When you had 21,000 in that day were they kept free or
   was it just one solid mass? -A. I do not really know.
   All I can say is that the stewards will do the job as per
   their numbers as best as possible.

Q.    I suppose we can see it from the video. We have been
     mostly looking at the other end but ....

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Yes.     Sorry, M r .....

          MR. GLASGOW:    No, sir, there was nothing.

Q. Are you Albert Ronald Marsh? - A. I am.

Q. And are you the Deputy Chief-Steward for the West Stand
   area? - A. Y e s .

Q. Assistant Chief Steward? - A. Yes.

Q. Stuart Thorpe is of course the Chief Steward there? - A. Yes

Q. He has told us he confines  himself to the West Stand
   itself, to the seated area? - A. More often than not, yes.

Q. Do your responsibilities go into that stand or do you stay
  !<somewhere else? - A. I stay downstairs.

Q. You stay downstairs.    On the concourse itself? - A. Yes.

Q.   Are you responsible for the men who are posted to Gates
     B and C? - A. Well, I thought I was until Stuart Thorpe's

Q. Well, never mind what Stuart Thorpe said.  L e t â€™s have

   Yes, yes.

Q. How many other men do you have directly under your
   control? -A. Just the six gatemen.

Q.   Just the six gatemen. - A. Yes.

     - A. In the concourse.

Q. In the concourse. - A. Not all the time but most of the
   time.

Q. Do you in fact have any other stewards available; to you
   in the concourse apart from those gatemen that you have
   mentioned? - A. The only stewards that would be available
   would be the stewards at the bottom of the stairs but I
   would have to ask Mr. Thorpe's permission to move those
   stewards.

Q.   They are under his   .... -   A. Yes.

Q p articular jurisdiction         andthey are concerned with
.




     checking tickets of people going in to the West Stand?
     - A. That is right.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:Told    usabout  one steward
     who was in the gap in the wall.  Do you know anything   ....
     - A. That is right.  That was ....

Q. Was he one of Mr. Thorpe's or one of yours? -A. No, it
   was Tony Garner, one of the gatemen.  I asked him if
   he would stand at that gate.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       Ah.     Right.

Q.        MR. PHILLIPS:   How many men do you have on each
     of those two gates? - A. Three on each gate.

Q. Do you need three on each gate?- A. Yes.

Q. Why? - A. Well, it is worked on a rota system, agreeable
   by the men, each one is on that gate for quarter-of-an-hour
   a n d n o n e of the gatemen are allowed to leave that gate
   until the other one relieves him.       That gate is covered
   throughout the game.

Q. Yes. So you need one at a time in effect? - A. Yes, for
   ejection purposes or Police coming in and out of that
   gate during the match.

Q. And can the other two then take up some other position
   in the concourse if they are not exactly on the gate?
   - A. Yes.

Q. And do you in fact get them to do this? -A. Yes.
   Occasionally they go upstairs sometimes and watch
   the match.

Q. Yes.  Well, until the match starts.  I am concerned
   with .... - A. Before the match starts those six
   stewards, well, gatemen, three on each gate, they
                            110


                                                 A. MARSH

   never leave the gate until they know that the whistle has
   blown for the kick-off.

Q. So if people want to be directed to a particular part of
   the terrace they would not find a steward in the concourse
   would they? - A. No.

Q. Unless they came upon you? - A. Yes.

Q. Do you think it would be helpful to have some stewards
   in the concourse there as well as the gatemen? - A. Yes,
   could be, providing they do not have to go on to the
   terraces.

Q. Yes.  Why not? - A. My own personal opinion is I would
   not ask anyone to go on the terraces.  If I can give a
   little example.  Probably half-an-hour before the
   kick-off the programmes run out.  The supporterss come
   in.  They want programmes.  You have not got them.  And
   the first man that they turn to is the steward, to abuse,
   so we have already got trouble before they even get on
   the terraces.

Q. That would apply anywhere in the ground, would not it?
   - A. Possibly so, yes.

Q.Well, have there ever been to your knowledge stewards
   on the terraces? - A. No.

Q. And you do not think it would be at all sensible to put
   stewards on the terraces? - A. My own personal opinion, no

Q. What about stewards at the entrance to the tunnel or to
   the other entrances to the terraces? Do you think that
   would be sensible?- A. It could be sensible providing
   they have got the protection of the Police.

Q. What is the particular problem about having a steward at
   the entrance to the tunnel? - A. You have got to be at
   the match to see the trouble that is caused at the
   matches.

Q. Have you ever been asked to take control over the number
   of people going into any of the pens on the terraces?
   - A. No.

Q. You wouldof course need more stewards available to you
   personally to be able to do that, would not you? - A.
   Direct on to the terraces, yes.

Q. Has anybody to your knowledge been responsible for
   seeing how many people get into each pen on the
   terraces? - A. The Police.

Q. Have you seen them on previous occasions directing fans

    to or sway from particular entrances? - A. Oh, yes.
    Normally - it has been done in normal football   matches
    apart from the semi-final - whereby the gate that Your
    Lordship said about being closed, where I put the stewards
    on for fche semi-finals, that is closed and also at the
    far pen, which is the South, West pen, is railed off
    so that all the supporters are channelled down the
    tunnel and then I assume from the Police control they
    can see when a certain area is getting full, then they
    open the other end into the South, East pen - the South,
    West pen and fill that and I have asked personally
    myself on occasions if the North Stand pen could be
    opened and the answer I got from the Police was it
    was a safety area.   What that meant I do not know.

                                          A. MARSH


     Q. Are you talking about league matches or semi-finals? - A.
        I am talking about league matches when we get Manchester
        United, Liverpool, various Clubs like that where you are
        getting a 40,000 gate.

     Q. So the decision as to which pens are filled and how they
        are filled you say has always been left to the Police? - A.
        Yes.

     Q. I just want to deal with one or two other matters if you
        will, Hr. Marsh.  On the day in question of course you
        were there in your position, were you? - A. Yes.

     Q. Did you see the gates C and B being opened just before the
        time for the kick-off? - A. I saw C gate, yes.

     Q. You saw C gate being opened? - A. I saw C gates open, yes.

     Q. Did you hear any of the instruction for that gate to be
        opened? - A. The first time or the second time?

     Q. Either time? - A. I heard instructions the second time to
        open the gate.

     Q. Where exactly were you when that happened? - A. I was at
        the side of the gate.  There is barriers where the Programme
        Sellers stand behind.  I was stood at the side of those
        which is just at the side of the concertina gate.

     Q. Was your man in position on the gap in the wall at   that
        time? - A. As far as I know, yes

     Q. what instructions had you given him to do when he was there
        in that position? - A. On the ....

     Q. The man in the gap in the wall? - A. Just to let people
        through, that was all.

     Q. Well the gate was open, wasn't it? - A. Yes.

     Q. People could go through at will? - A. They could go through
        at will, yes.

     Q. In either direction? - A. Yes.

     Q. Did he have a particular job to do? - A. No, the only
        particular job that he could do was if any of the away
        supporters asked where the programme was or whether there
        was anywhere they could stand they could tell them then.

     Q. He did not get any information from anybody about the
        state of the pens though, did he? - A. Oh no.

     Q. Nov/ when the gate was opened a number of people came
        through.   That is right, isn't it? - A. That is right.

                                       A. MARSH


Q. Had you immediately before that stage had any information
   about the state of the pens on the terrace? ~ A. No.

Q. What do you think about the possibility before that gate
   was opened of closing off the tunnel down to Pens 3 and 4?
   - A. That never entered my head because from where we are
   I never see the terraces so consequently I don't know how
   many people are in. We have to rely on the control tower
   from the Police when the pens are full.

Q.   Have you ever known of the tunnel itself     being closed off?
     - A. Not to my knowledge.

Q. Have you known of the gates to the tunnel being closed? -
   A. No, because I have always been on the understanding
   that is the emergency, well it is the direct entry on
   to the terraces and it is the emergency evacuation of the
   terraces.  There are the gates at the front of the terraces
   but I thought that was the main exit for any trouble.

Q. Those gates of course open    inwards intothe tunnel     don't
   they? - A. That is right.

Q.   Would you regard itas sensible to close   those gates? - A.
     No, not at all.  In fact personally I don't know what the
     gates are there for.

Q. Don't you? - A. No.

Q. Have you ever seen them closed apart from when the ground
   is closed? - A. That is all.  During a league game or a
   semi-final I have never seen those gates closed.

Q. Have you seen access effectively barred by Police Officers?
   - A. I have seen Police across the gates, yes.

Q.   When was the last time you saw that? - A. I don't know.

Q.    Can't you tell us when you last saw that? - A. No, I     am
     afraid not.

Q. Did you see that at the 1988 semi-final?        - A. To be truthÂ­
   ful, no.

Q.   Were you there? - A. I was there, yes.

Q.    Yes? ~ A. I think 1988 semi-final is a bit of a blur because
     we did not have any problems and I think if you don't have
     any problems you don't remember these things.    It is when
     you have problems that you remember these things.

Q. Can I just move forward a little- bit to the point when
   practically everybody outside the ground had got into the
   ground.  You were, I think at this stage, close to a
   Police Officer and overheard something on his radio?
   - A. That is right.

                                          A. MARSH


Q. What did you hear on the radio? - A. It was repeated twice:
   "Pitch invasion, pitch invasion".

Q.   Was there any request with that or was it simply a statement?
     - A. That is all I heard. Those were the only words that
     I heard.

Q. That is all that you heard? - A. Yes.

Q. What did the Police Officers near to you do? - A. They just
   went.  I don't know where they went to but they went.

Q. And you were left outside still with your ....        A. Hot outside,
   in the concourse.

Q.   With your gatemen and your gates? - A. Yes.

Q.   Were both of them open then? - A. For B Gate I cannot say.
     For C Gate yes, it was open.

            MR. PHILLIPS:   Yes, thank you very much.


                    Cross-Examined by MR. WOODWARD:

Q. Mr. Marsh, over the years that you have been a Steward you
   must have been to many meetings? - A. Yes.

Q. You must have had a lot of contact with the Club to tell
   you what your duties are? - A. Yes.

Q. That would be one-to-one contact with Officials, people
   like Mr. Lock? - A. That is only at the Annual Meeting.

Q. Yes, from time to time you have met and discussed with
   the Club your job of stewarding? - A. At the Annual Meeting,
   yes, but not at any other time.

Q. From your knowledge are you able to assist the Inquiry at
   all on this point:  does the Club take any steps at all
   to help to achieve an even flow of spectators or is that
   all left to the Police? - A. It is left to the Police
   because the Police have taken it over.

            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Sorry, I am not quite sure
     what   you mean by "an even flow of spectators"?

           MR. WOODWARD;    Sir,    I am quoting from paragraph 195
     of the Green Guide.

            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  May be, but I would like to
     know   where you are talking about, inside, outside, what?

           MR. WOODWARD: Sir, page 56 heading entitled       "STEWARDING"
     the section on Stewarding.
                                 115

                                           A. MARSH


           "Effective stewarding should prevent overcrowding
           in sections of the ground, reduce the likelihood
           and incidence of disorder, help disperse spectators
           in such a way as to reduce crowd pressure and
           provide the means to investigate, report and take
           early action in an emergency."

     Then paragraph 195:

           "Manning levels and stewarding requirements will
           vary depending upon the size and configuration
           of the ground, the nature of the event and crowd
           levels, but there are five basic duties which
           stewards are called upon to carry out.  These are:


     Then it is the first one.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        " --- the even flow of people
     to the viewing areas ...."        Is that it?

           MR. WOODWARD:  ".... to the viewing areas and safe
     dispersal of spectators on the terraces or viewing slopes."

Q. Are you aware of any instruction or direction being given
   to any Steward to do that? - A.No, no.

p    So the moving of the spectators around the ground is being
     left to the Police to do? - A. No, no, not "left to the
     Police to do".  I think I am repeating myself again.  In
     the south-west area on the big matches we get a build-up
     of supporters stood at the back probably six or seven deep.
     Now those people can't see the match.

q   . what do the Stewards do about it? - A. In the past I have
      asked Police if we could open the north-west pen so that
      those people can go up into the area to watch the match.
      My request has been refused because that has been used
      as a safety area, so therefore we have not been allowed
      to do the stewarding so it has been accepted that the Police
      will do it.

Q. Whether it has been accepted and whether or not there has
   been an occasion when you have tried to do something about
   it, is the situation this:  from your knowledge of the
   stewarding and instructions that have always been given
   to you, no step has ever been taken requiring you to help
  "to achieve an even flow of people to the viewing areas
   or safe dispersal of spectators" from the various .....
   - A. I know what you are saying.  Yes, this did happen
   until as I said before that the Police  took control, so
   consequently occasionally the Stewards may say:  "That
   pen or that pen you can go into those" but the direction
   of the Stewards has always been, well not always but probably
   the last six, seven years done by the Police, so consequently
   the Stewards have thought it is of no value to them to do
   it because the Police are doing it.

                                          A. MARSH


    Q. So is the only role that the Stewards have fulfilled in the
       past five to six years been to help people to go to wherever
       their ticket directed them? - A. As far as the seating is
       concerned?

    Q. Yes, anything.  What else do the Stewards do? - A. That is
       chiefly their duties.

    Q. So they just tell somebody where Gangway A is and Seat 23
       is? - A. They can do that but when you walk into the ground
       there is the letters above the stairs telling you U, V, W,
       X, Y, Z.  It used to be X, Y, and Z where the away supporters
       used to go and it is above the Stand for them to see, so
       when they walk through the turnstile they look at their
       ticket and they look up at the Stand and they can see where
       they should go.

    Q. So the fans know where to go. What do the Stewards do then,
       what are they there for? - A. They check tickets; to allow
       people who have got their tickets for seating to go upstairs
       and sit down and stop the people who are supposed to be
       standing going up in the seating area.

    Q. So is this it:   the fans can read what is on their ticket
       and they can see what is on the wall, see what the signs
       are, and the role of the Steward has been to just check the
       ticket when a man seeks to go into a particular entrance
       and that is all that you do? - A. Yes, also the Gatemen are
       asked where the seating area is because the Gatemen are at
       the side of the turnstiles.

    Q. But if we try to put it in a sentence, is the Stewards job
       simply to point people to where their place is? - A. Not
       their seat.  The job of the Stewards where I come into
       contact with are downstairs are to tell them where the
       entrance is   to go to those seats.

    Q. But you are   aware of how the Stewards work in theinstructions
       that have been given to them over the years,aren't    you?
       - A. I don't follow you.

    Q. Don't you know what goes on in the West Stand and what the
       Stewards do there? ~ A. In the Stand itself, yes, I know
       what goes on there.

    Q. Do the Stewards do anything more than tell a spectator
       which row his seat is on? - A. In the West Stand -that is
       what the Stewards do, yes.

    Q. Do they do anything other than that at any other part of
       the ground?   - A. No, that is their full-time job.

    Q. That is all   they do? - A. Yes.

    Q. They take no part whatsoever in watching the crowd and
       ensuring that it is safe? - A. I don't know what you mean
       by "the crowd"?

         Q.   Anywhere? - A. The terraces,    the Stewards in the West   Stand
              can't see the terraces.

         Q.    Anywhere in the ground, Mr. Marsh, do the Stewards take any
              steps to make sure that thespectators are safe?   - A. Are
              we talking about the West Stand now?

         Q. Anywhere? - A. I don't know what happens in other parts
            of the ground.

         Q. What part of the ground do you know about? - A. The West
            Stand.

         Q. Well in the West Stand do they do that? - A. In the seating
            area, yes.

         Q. What do they do to make sure that the fans are safe? - A.
            I am afraid I don't know.

         Q. Do they do anything? - A. Well I don't know whether there
            is anything for them to do until there is an emergency.

                    MR. WOODWARD:   Very well, thank you.


                             Cross-Examined by MR. GLASGOW:

         Q. Mr. Marsh there is one matter.  Have you seen this book
            before? - A. Not until this disaster,no.

         Q. Well we can help you with it.  It has got some 7 5 pages
            of useful information about testing barriers and the strength
            and that sort of thing.

                    Can you tell us: would it in fact have been more
              helpful to you to have a 75 page book including all the
              details on testing barriers and egress procedures and
              balustrading or to have the book that you get with a clear
              statement of what your duties are? - A. The book that we
              get.

         Q. I think they spend about an hour-and-a-half giving you
            lectures at the beginning of every season, don't they?
            - A. Yes.

         Q. Whatever may be in the Green Guide, has there ever been
            any lack of clarity in the language used by the people
            who try and tell you what your duties are at those
            sessions? - A. Not to my knowledge.

         Q. Have you ever had any difficulty understanding what Mr. Lock
            is saying when he is explaining in his terms what a Steward's
            duties are? - A. No.

Q. Have you ever had any difficulty in understanding or following
   the Police advice when they give you lectures at those sessions?
   - A. No.

Q. Just your experiences, Mr. Marsh, on the terrace.  Quite
   apart from the men who serve under you, in the light of your
   own experience would you be prepared to go and stand on the
   terraces under the West Stand? - A. No, I am afraid not.

Q. Is that as a result of any incident that has happened
   recently or as a result of what has happened to you over
   the past years as a Steward? - A. Well during the semi-final
   I had the occasion when the door was opened the first time
   to go to the bottom of the stairs to tell the Stewards to
   get the gates closed, that the people were coming in and I
   did not know whether they had got tickets or they had not
   got tickets, to stop them from going up the stairs unless
   they had a ticket and I was physically wrestled to the
   ground.  I was trod on.  I think that these are the things
   what would happen if we were on the terrace.

Q. Did you know that Police Officers in uniform had been
   assaulted on that terrace and rendered incapable and had had
   to be rescued from the terrace? - A. Only by hearsay.
   I never see the terrace.

Q. Mr. Marsh, you yourself I think have been on duty at this
   ground for some 17 years? - A. Yes.

Q. Had you ever known of any occasion when Gate C had been
   opened to allow people in before? - A. No.

         MR. GLASGOW:   Thank you very much.

                    Examined by MR. GOLDSACK:

Q. Mr. Cobb, I think for very many years now your Saturday
   afternoons have been spent just inside A Gate? - A. Yes.

Q. And you are one of a team of four men responsible for that
   gate? - A. Yes.

Q. And in general terms what you have to ensure is there is
   always at least one of you immediately by the gate? - A.
   That is correct.

Q. I am going now to page 7, sir.  On the 15th of April of
   this year were things fairly normal up until about 10 or
   quarter-past-2? - A. 10-minutes-past-2.

Q. And up until then from time to time if individual Police
   Officers needed to go in or out you would open the gate
   to let them? - A. Yes.

Q. Shortly after the crowd had built up outside Gate A did
   you speak to a Police Inspector about the crowd outside?
   - A. Correct.

Q. Was there anything in particular you wanted to bring to
   his attention? - A. Yes.

Q.   What was that? - A. To move allnon-ticket holders   out.

Q. What led you to believe that there were a lot of non-ticket
   holders? - A. Because they were offering money through the
   glass panel of the door.  They were offering Â£20 notes and
   Â£10 notes.

Q. Now we are talking about just one or two peoplÂ« doing that?
   - A . No a few who could get near the front.

Q.    Can you give us any idea of the numbers you aretalking
     about? - A. Not really.

Q. But quite a lot? - A. Quite a few was offering money right
   from say half-past-l, not when it built up.  Previous  to
   that there was one or two coming and offering money before
   it even built up.

Q. What did the Inspector say about your request? - A. "I have
   not the manpower".

Q. What was happening so far as the crowd were concerned
   specifically with the gate? - A. It was getting very
   hostile and they were banging and kicking on the door and
   saying so and so, we will smash the gate down.

Q. From what time were you hearing threats to smash the gate
   down? - A. It would be round about half-past-2.

Q. I think you were receiving requests from time to time from
   individual Liverpool supporters to be let back out? - A.
   That is correct.

Q. You know that is often a trick? - A. We don't know how many
   tickets they had taken out so you refuse.

Q. So can I move forward, this is now page 9 of your statement,
   to the time when Gate C was opened for the first time.
   Did you know it was opened? - A. No.

Q. Did you become aware that it was opened? - A. It must have
   been the second time when somebody shouted:  "C Gate is
   open" and that is all I heard.

Q. You can't see C Gate from where you are? - A. Only the
   very top.

Q. What was the first you knew about the suggestion that Gate A
   should be opened? - A. Well I had said no to the gate being
A.

                                         R. W. COBB


        opened.

     Q. To whom did you say that? - A. To the Police that were at
        the side.  A Police Sergeant came and he was really violent
        at this time.  It is a collapsible gate and the gate was
        not forward and backwards, the gate was actually going side
        to side, so I looked through the window and there was no
        bars and no hammers.  All this movement was being done by
        human beings moving all this steel work and that is how
        frightening it was getting, you know.   The Policeman came
        over and he said:  "We had better open the gate" and I said
        "No, not until we get higher authority to open it" so he
        came back and said they had authority which only left three
        Policemen.  Then I said: "Nov/ there is not enough Policemen
        here to release this lot in here" so with that he went away
        and got may be 20, 25 Policemen.




                                 /Q . This was
                                              R. W. COBB

This was a Sergeant, was it?     A.   Pardon?

Was this a Sergeant, a Police Sergeant?         A. A sergeant
at the time, y e s .

I know that times are very difficult, Mr. Cobb, but do
you know at what stage it was when the Sergeant first
suggested opening gate A?   A.  Oh, it may have been ---
I think it was after someone shouted about 'C' gate being
open.

It was after that?    A.   Just after that.

When you insisted that he, as it were, get higher authori
do you know who     he contacted?   A.No.

Do you know   how    he contacted them?A. No.

But he left you     for a short time?A. He left and then
came back and said "Well, we have the authority to open
it." Jack Stone was with me and he was handing the keys

He was handing the keys?   A.  So we said that we didn't
think that they ought to be opened.  So with that, when
he said he had the authority, Jack gave him the key and
said "Right, you open" and then afterwards he got the
extra policeman here which he lined up round each side.
I said to him, "Do you know what to expect?" and he said
"Oh yes, oh yes", so I picked the biggest policeman out
and I stood behind him; and then the Sergeant said "Right
open the gate" and they opened them.

Is this right:  Your main concern, from the moment that
it was suggested, was the way that people would rush in -
A. Would run in, yes, and hoping that nobody fell over.

Yes.  Again I know it is difficult, Mr. Cobb, but from
the time that the suggestion of opening that gate was
first made to the obtaining higher authority and then
getting more policemen, are we talking about a couple
of minutes, longer or shorter?    A.  It could be a couple
of minutes, it could be a couple of minutes before they
came back.   It wasn't too long in bringing the extra
police back.

When Gate   'A' was eventually opened, did people come in
orderly?     A. You must be joking!  Whoosh, they'd gone!

How did   the police cope with it?    A. Pardon?

How did the police cope with it?    A. Well, they just
filed down each side, because there's no way they could
go, only behind the North Stand.   You see, they can't
see the match at all.   They can't see the match unless
they go up the aisles.
                                               R. W. COBB

So they have to carry on right through ----         A. Right
through  to '0' gate.

You have mentioned that at about half-past-two you had
seen people waving money as though they had no tickets?
A. Yes.

Was that something that continued right up until the
gate was opened?   A.   That's correct, yes.

Can you say whether or not the number without tickets had
increased during that time?       A. Vastly.  During the
course of this time we was occupied --- There was three
attempts to get out;      two youths and a girl.   The people
that wanted to get out stood back - and we didn't know
this because everything happened so quickly - and the two
youths took a run at the gate, with it being a collapsible
gate, and they put their foot on the gate and they were
over the top.      Now, how many tickets  they had took out
with them, we don't know.      Whether the girl made it, I
d o n 't k n o w .

Basically, you were conscious all the way through of
people being there without tickets?  A. Oh, definitely.

That is right, is it?   A. Definitely. Even long before
that they were coming with two tickets that hadn't been
torn, which should have been torn, and they were saying
"I've lost my mate, he's outside, can we go out?" and we
had to refuse them, because he could have had dozens in
his pocket.   How do I know?  I don't know.

      Mr. GOLDSACK:    Thank you.

      Mr. HYTNER:     I have no questions,   sir.

           Cross-examined by Mr. JACKSON:

Was this any different to the behaviour at any other
semi-final, about getting in without tickets?  A. No,
none whatsoever.

There are very many excuses given to gatemen, and have
been for years, have there not, about how to get into
a match?  A. Yes, certainly.

And I think last year you opened it for a wedding party?
A.  That's correct.

Did you actually believe that it was a wedding party?
A.  I was told it was a wedding party from the Football
Club.

I think it is well known in Liverpool that the Duke of
Edinburgh and his smaller, less well dressed friend
normally arrive at about 3 o'clock?   A. I don't know
about well dressed.
                                                 R. W. COBB

You get all kinds of people giving all kinds of excuses
and have done for years?   A. Yes.

This was no different?       A. No.

What was different was the number of people outside
trying to get in through the turnstiles?   A. That's
right, yes.

Thank you.      A.   And the number trying to get out.

Out?   A. Trying to get out with their mates'        tickets
to give out.

Well, that is what you suspect?   A. Well, I know it was.
They were coming up with two or three tickets and saying
"These three belong to my mates outside" and I was saying
to them, "Well, why isn't your mate with you" and they
were saying "Well, they have gone for a drink and I've
come in." How can you accept that?   It's got to be an
excuse to get out.

Is that something new?       A. Oh no, no.

      Mr. JACKSON:     Thank you.

             Cross-examined by Mr. MAXW E LL :

Mr. Cobb, in normal circumstances can one man open the
gates at Gate A easily?   A. Yes.

By normal circumstances, I mean when there is not a great
crowd on the other side?   A. Yes, yes.

You work it with your fellow gatemen so that there is always
one gateman at Gate A?   A. Yes, always, right through
the match.

Has anybody ever suggested to you that there should be two
gatemen?    A.   There are four allocated.  There is one
on the internal gate and there is one on the 'A' gate.
The internal gate separates the north from the west,
which is a small gate to allow the police through, or
to allow the catering staff through.   There are two on
'A' gate at 1.40, so there's always two at the gate.

There are always two available to deal with the gate?
A. May I remark this?   I've been on that gate 22 years
and this is the first match that I've ever used a key
to lock it;  the very first match.  At every other semiÂ­
final, it's got a click on the inside door, as the police
 will tell you, and you pull it by that and you open the
gate, and it closes and clicks to;  but it has never
been locked;  it has never had to be locked.

At what point did you decide that you had to lock it?
A.  Twenty-minutes-to-three.
                               124


                                                 R. W. COBB

Q. What made you decide to lock it then?      A. Because of the
   crowd outside.

Q.    And what was happening to the gate at that time? A. The
     gate at that time just started to move a bit and the top
     bolts, which are on spring steel clips that shoot in, were
     gradually working down, which made it that the gate could
     be moved more and more like that. (Demonstrating).

           Mr. MAXWELL:   Thank you very much, Mr. Cobb.

              Cross-examined by Mr. WOODWARD:

Q. Mr. Cobb, you have been on that gate 22 years?       A. Yes.

Q. You have been asked by Mr. Jackson about the tricks and
   the ruses that people get up to in order to try and get
   in.   Of course, that is nothing new to you, is it?
       No.

Q. But on this occasion is it right - and do you agree with
   and answer to Mr. Goldsack - that people had been
   offering or trying to pay you money from about half-past-1?
   A.  Yes.

Q. Not just half-past-2 but at an earlier stage? A. Yes,
   earlier than that they was offering money, yes.

Q.   And did that increase as the afternoon went on?    A. Yes,
     it greatly increased.

Q. You have talked about the people coming into the ground?
   A.  Yes.

Q. And then, almost as a kind of signal, running back and
   jumping out over the gate?   A. Two of them did, yes.

Q. They were with other people at that time, were they?
   A.  I don't know, sir, because they came from the back
   as we was looking forward, you know, to the crowd
   outside through the glass, and then all of a sudden
   these two came but I don't know where they came from.
   The girl went up the side of the gate but whether she
   made it or not, I don't know.

Q. Are you saying that there were two and a girl? A . Yes,
   two youths and one girl, but the two youths definitely
   got ov er .

Q. So they must have managed to get enough clear space to
   do this?   A.  To do that, yes.

Q. And they did get the clear space?     A. At    either side of
   us, yes.
                                           R. W. COBB

And your impression, using your experience and nous,
was that they were going out with tickets?    A. That's
correct, y e s .

Did you also see people throwing tickets over?   A. That's
right, yes.

Are you saying that in all your 22 years, whilst people
resort to tricks, you have never seen quite as many at
it as you saw on this day?   A. No.

That is right, is it?    A. That's right._ The throwing
of the ticket is wrapped in a 50 pence piece or a 10
pence piece and then it's thrown over and whoever picks
it up comes through with that ticket returns the 50p.
It's their own supporters, Liverpool or Manchester, who
are at that side, so it makes no difference.   So that
ticket can be constantly used by supporters coming
through in a big match.

As though it is organised between them   and they are
waiting for it?   A. Well, it doesn't    matter.  I'm
not going to say it's organised but if   it's thrown over,
anyone could pick it up, but they know   what they have to
do to throw it back.

Having picked it up, they come in and then throw it over
again?   A. That's right, yes.

So it is not just to let in one, it is repeated?  A. Well,
I think it was on the Liverpool League match that I spoke
to two policemen and they stopped it.

But on this match, 1989 ----  A. Oh, well, I was so busy
on the gate at this match that to actually see whether
it went on long enough,  I don't know.

But you noticed that there were far more of these tricks
being tried than you had seen before?  A. Yes.

And would you say that it seemed to be far more determined
than you had ever seen before?   A.  Definitely, yes.

May I ask you about the gate?   It was being shaken,    was
it?   A. That's right.

 Was there also a lot of banging going on at it?    A. That's
right, yes.

And the effect of shaking the gate was to loosen the
security of the bolts?   A. It could have been, which
did loosen the bolts, which give it more flexibility
for the movement of the gate to go like that. (Demonstrating)
A person behind - I'm not sure of her name - shouted
"Look at the gate", as though it was going to go._ It
wasn't forwards and backwards;  it was all going sideways.
                                             R. W. COBB

In the proper direction for the gates to open?            A. Yes.

And was that building up to a sort of crescendo?           A. Oh
yes, yes, it must have been, to move it.

      Mr. WOODWARD:      Thank you.

      Mr. PHILLIPS:     Thank you very much.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Thank you.

      Mr. PHILLIPS:     Brian Ridge please.

                 BRIAN RIDGE, Called
             Examined by Mr. PHILLIPS:

Is your name Brian Ridge?      A.     Yes.

And you have worked as a steward at Sheffield        Wednesday
for about 20 years?   A.  Yes,correct.

On the day in question you were one of the three men on
B Gate?   A.  Correct.

At Leppings Lane?      A. Correct.

Is this a position that you had held before?         A.    Yes.

How long had you been working on B Gate?         A. About five
years .

About five years.  Your job, of ocurse, was to open it
from time to time if you were required to do so by the
police?   A.  Police or catering staff, programme sellers,
anybody in authority from the Club.

Now, this gate was normally kept locked, of course, but
when you went on duty you would unlock it, would you not?
A.  Most League matches it's unlocked but for the semi-final
it was locked.

It was locked?      A. Yes.

Did it stay locked throughout the period till just before
3 o'clock?    A. No, it was unlocked at approximately
11 o â€™clock to allow the programme van in to unload his
programmes.

I appreciate that, but then later on when people were
arriving and were waiting at the turnstiles to get in,
you were there in charge of the gate.  Was the gate locked
or unlocked?    A. It was bolted with four bolts.

With four bolts?     A. Yes.

It also had a catch, did it not?        A. It has a catch in the
centre, yes.
                                         B. RIDGE

And did you keep it bolted except when you had to open
it to let somebody out?   A.  Yes.

And that was unusual, was it?   A. Yes, it was.     On a
normal League match we don't need to.

Why did you have it bolted?   A. Well, as the fans come
past, they invariably give it a kick.  We keep it locked
just in case the centre catch jumps.  It's only a little
tiny catch maybe an inch long.

Is that right?  A. It is possible to kick it hard enough
to make it jump out of the socket.

It is as easy to dislodge as that, is it?     A. It can    be,
if it has not been properly connected.

You were there on duty at this gate during the build up
of supporters outside those gates, is that right? A. Yes.

When did you notice things getting to be difficult outside
A. At 2.15 I remarked to one of my friends there that
you wouldn't think it was a semi, you know, with so few
people coming through the turnstiles.

But then did things change after that?

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   What time do you say that
was?   A.  Around 2.15, and then about 2.30 it really
started to build up.  Fans were banging on the gates as
they moved towards the turnstile.  They had had to walk
across the front of our gate to get to the standing
turnstiles, and we can see through a little porthole.

       Mr. PHILLIPS:  And you saw what was going on outside
did you?    A. We saw something of what was going on
outs ide.

Were you worried by it?   A.  Not really, not at that
time.  They were still singing and making a general
hullabaloo.

Was anything happening to your gate?     A. Apart from
banging it and kicking it, no.

Did things get any worse after this?     A.   They got worse
after, yes.

And when they started to get worse, you could still see
through the porthole, could you?   A. Yes, we could see
a great mass of fans at the back.

Was anything happening to your gate then?     A. No, just
that it was getting banged and thumped.

Was it moving about, the gate itself?     A. No more than
normal.
                                                     B. RIDGE

Do you remember a police officer coming to you shortly
before kick-off and giving you some instructions with
regard to the gate?   A. At 2.55 the police ordered the
gate to be opened and I said to the constable with the
ginger moustache "No way am I opening the gate."

Why did you say that?   A. Well, I knew what would
happen if we did open the gate.

What did you think would happen?            A. There would be an
almighty great rush.

Because there were still fans outside, were there?
A.  Yes.

At that time?    A. Yes.

Even though, as we know, Gate C had been opened some
minutes beforehand?   A. Yes, there was still a lot of
people outside.

In the immediate area outside your gate?                A. Yes.

Were you able to hear anything from these people? Were
they shouting anything in particular?    A.  No, not
from outside.

Not from outside?     A. No.

So you thought there were so many people,              it would be
dangerous to open the gate?   A. Yes.

The   gates were in fact opened,           though?     A. Yes.

Who did that?    A.   A Police Constable.

Pulled the bolts at the top?   A. Yes, he pulled the bolt
and then once he had done that, we opened the gates.

And where did you stand then?   A. I stood at the side,
at one side of the gates, and the other chap who was
working with me stood at the far side of the gates.

And did the crowd rush in?           A.    Yes.

Did they come in quickly or did they come in at walking
pace?   A.  Well, I've got it down on a note here "Fans
rushed into the ground.  Some lost shoes in the mad rush"

Q. Round the tunnel area? ~ A. Yes.

Q. And round where? - A. -Round the bottom of each stair,   I
   cannot see the other stair.

Q. Which staircase are you talking about? - A. That one.

Q. About how  many Policemen did you see there last year? -
   A. I cannot really remember, but theoverall amount of
   Police seemed to be less. At the tunnel last year there
   was definitely Police.

Q. How many? - A. I don't know, there might have been four,
   there might have been five, there might have been more.
   They were directing people into the tunnel area.

Q. Are you saying there were no Police there this year? -
   A. I can't remember seeing any, no.  There might have-been
   but I can't remember seeing any.

Q. I suggest to you that according to the figures there were
   the same number of Police around? - A. It might have just
   been that we did not know them.  They like make themselves
   known to us and we have a chat at some matches when there
   is not a lot of fans.  It might have just seemed less.

Q. It is just a guess is it on your part? - A. No, it is not
   a guess.  I stated that to me it was as though there were
   less Police there.

Q. Are you saying this:  there were less people there that
   you knew? - A. There was nobody there that I knew apart
   from the Inspectors.

Q. One can look at the numbers and the disposition indicates
   how many there were?

         So far as your job was concerned in the immediate
   area that you were working in, there were the same number
   of Police Officers as you were familiar with? - A. As
   most matches, yes, but I have seen more.

Q. Well when have you seen more? - A. M i 1lwa11 match for instance
   this season.  I reckon there was a lot more Police behind
   the turnstiles searching them coming in than there was at
   the semi-final.

Q. If there were less people about did you think of mentioning
   it to anybody? - A. It is not our job to tell the Police
   their job.  They tell us what we do. We don't tell them
   what to do.

Q. So are you saying that this apparent difference had no
   effect upon what you were doing? - A. No, we are there
   to steward.  We are there to let Police in and out,*
   catering staff in and out; Club Officials in and out and
   anybody that are allowed in and out.

Q. You say that the Police did not seem to be so well organised?
   ~ A. I said that, yes.

Q. How did that show itself? Why do you say that? - A. That
   was just how I felt.  I felt as though to me they were not
   as well organised as normal policing.

Q. Well what leads you to say that? - A. It might just be ray
   opinion.  It is my opinion.  I thought they were not as
   well organised.

Q. On what is it based? - A. My opinion.

Q. Well what did you see that was different, if anything? -
   A. Well to me it was different.

Q. What was different? - A. I can't remember what I saw but
   it was different on that day.  What are you trying to get
   out of me? What do you want me to say?

Q. I would like you to give us the detail or the observation
   that you had that led you to the judgment that it was less
   organised.    Now what did you see that was different? - A.
   To me it was different.    I can't put a finger on what it
   was but it was different to a normal, to the normal policing
   we have on match days.    It may not have been different but
   to me it w a s .

Q. But you are not able to put your finger on anything that
   was not being done? - A.No.

Q. Did you see, Mr. Beadsley, in 1988/ the tunnel being closed
   off? ~ A. Yes.

Q. What time did that happen? - A. I have no idea.   When this
   happened this year you think of things that was different
   last year.  After 10-past~2  this year I never looked at
   my watch.

Q. In 1988 you were able more or less to pack up at about
   10-to-3 you told us? - A. I would not say "pack u p " . We
   still stopped on our gate but everybody had gone.    EveryÂ­
   body was in the ground that was coming in the ground.

Q. Yes, to all intents and purposes the spectators had got in
   and your job was really you had just got to stay there till
   the time but there was really very little to do? - A. No.

Q. So by 10-to-3 this had happened, most of the crowd was in?
   - A. Yes.

Q. What time do you say you saw the tunnel being closed off?
   - A. I would not like to say.  I d o n 't know.

Q. W e i 1 was it before or after all the crowd was in? - A. It
   was early on.     They filled the middle pens and then they
   allowed people in.     They would not allow people into the
   side pens until the middle was ful1.

                                                R.W. BEADSLEY


        Q. Are you confusing this with a league game? - A. No.

        Q. How do you know that they were filling the centre pens? -
           A. Because they were telling everybody to go in the centre,
           the sides were closed off.  Until they closed the gate they
           put Police in front of it.  They closed it for a minute and
           sent them round the sides.

        Q.    You heard that being said, did you?  - A.You don't need to
             hear, you can see.    You can see them close the gate and
             move the fence and let people round, you don't need to
             hear it.   I am not thick.

        Q.   This must have been seen by lots  of other people then?   - A.
             It has been mentioned by other people.

        Q. That the Police were not allowing people into the side pens
           in 1989 until the centre pen was full up? - A. Until later
           on, yes.   I remember a chap come to us and he had got a
           youngster.   We had a word with the Police and he said:  "If
           you hang on a bit they will be opening the side pens, you
           will be able to get in there and get a good view of the
           match".

        Q. So far as you are concerned is there no difference then
           between what was happening in the 1988 semi-final compared
           with an ordinary league game? - A. In 19 88, no I don't think
           there was any difference to a normal league game.   They
           filled a pen and when that was filled they opened another
           one and filled that one like they do in a nornal league
           match now.  On semi-final day this year they left everything
           open and let them go where they wanted.

        Q.    May I suggest you are mistaken about that? You saw a lot
             of ticket stubs being passed back to people, did you?
             - A. I saw tickets being thrown back out through the gate
             as we were ejecting people, yes.

        Q. So at your gate, Gate C, that was happening on a number of
           occasions? - A. Yes.

        Q.   From what time did it start? - A. I would say you are talking,
             it has got to be round half-past-2.   It has got to be after
             lO-past-2 because we had not got the gate open till then.

        Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  You mean when Gate C is open
             to eject somebody, somebody from inside would throw some
             tickets out? - A. They were throwing tickets back out.
             We opened the gate so a Policeman could throw somebody out
             and they were throwing stubs out to people outside.

        Q. What I don't understand, perhaps you can help me, you heard
           the evidence a little bit before about people wrapping ....
           A. I don't know about 50 pences in it.

        Q. Or whatever else.  I mean the sort of crowd that we have
           seen on the video outside, I would not have thought there

                                                      R.W. BEADSLEY


                  w&is a great deal of chance of a ticket getting to the chap
                  you wanted it to get to? - A. Ithink it was just   a case
                  they were all trying to get everybody in. They weren't
                  bothered who it was that got in ....

             Q.    It wasn't to anybody in particular? - A. No, it was just
                  a case of so-and-so had not got a ticket, I will give him
                  one and throwing them out to anybody.    They weren't
                  bothered who it went to.

             Q. Let me follow it through.  Presumably somebody who has got
                in with a ticket should have left half his ticket in the
                turnstile? - A. He did do, yes.

             Q. So what he has got left to chuck out is ....          A. Is just
                the stub, his half of the ticket.

             Q.   If things are done properly how is that going to help
                  somebody to get in? - A. As far as I could see it was not
                  going to help them but if there is a queue at the turnstile
                  and a chap turns up with half a ticket and he throws his
                  half of the ticket how does the man in the turnstile know
                  he has not ripped it in half already and given him the other
                  half?

                        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Right.

             Q.         MR. WOODWARD:   May we look at it in a little bit
                  more detail.

                        You say that they seemed to be intent on getting these
                  other people in who had not got tickets? - A. I did not say
                  they had not got tickets all of them round that gate, but
                  they were intent on getting people in, yes.

             Q.    It was obviously being done       for some purpose? - A.        Yes.

             Q. This was tickets being thrown out of Gate C? - A. Yes.

             Q. That gate is only open from time to time? - A. Well tickets
                was only going out from time to time.

             Q. Of course but they would not be thrown out until the gate
                was opened, would they? - A. No.

             Q. So the coincidence was not only someone there ready to throw
                tickets out, but someone having to get the gate opoiso that
                they can be got out? - A. As I say when the people were
                first coming over the top of the turnstiles, the first six
                or seven that climbed over the top was thrown out and there
                was a lot of people milling round the gate and they knew
                after the first one that they were going to be opened to
                be thrown out, so they were milling round more and more then.

             Q.    So they would have to wait until by arrangement or chance
                  the gate was opened? - A. Yes.

Q. And in order for it to have some purpose they would have to
   expect people waiting outside for the tickets, wouldn't
   they?- A. Well what did they lose if there was not nobody
   waiting for the tickets and they went on the floor.7 They
   were in, they did not need the ticket.  They are not
   bothered where the ticket goes once they are in the ground.

Q. But this was happening on tnumber of occasions? - A. Yes.

0.   Did you see people throwing the tickets over the turnstile,
     tops as well? - A. I can't see a ticket going that far,
     to tell you the truth.

q . Did you see people on the turnstile tops gathering tickets
    from people and throwing them down over? - A. I can't
    say.  I was not looking on the top of the turnstiles.

           MR. WOODWARD:   Thank you.

                                                   M. BAIN

      Mr. PHILLIPS:   Malcolm Bain please.

              MALCOLM BAIN, Called
             Examined by M r . PHILLIPS:

Is your name Malcolm Bain?     A. Yes, sir.

Have you been a steward at Sheffield Wednesday for about
12 years? A. Y e s .

Were you one of the three men on â€™C ' Gate on this particular
match?   A. Yes.

Along with Mr. Beadsley who has just given his evidence?
A.  Yes.

And you were under instructions        to keep those gates closed,
were you not?   A.  Yes.

Except when they were required to be opened by the police
for the purpose of ejecting people?   A.  Yes.

Early on, when you first got there, did you in fact at
one stage have the gates slightly open?   A. Yes.

For some considerable time?.      A.     Yes.

Why was that? A. We normally do, because there's no fans
about and it allows the police and catering staff to move
in and out without keep opening and shutting the door.

How far apart did you have them        ----     A.About 18 inches.

What time was this - during what period?    A. I ^ot there
about quarter-past- 11 and it was up to about 2 o clock.

Up to about 2 o'clock?      A. Yes.

At that time, were there many people about?    A. No, because
I commented to Inspector White that it was very quiet.

When you were standing there with the gates partly opened,
were you approached by anyone? A. Yes, I was approached
two or three times.   I was offered Â£20 and Â£30 if I d let
them in.    There was a young lad who came and offered me
Â£20 and I told him to m o v e away before I fetched the police,
and then he started looking up at the perimeter and I said
"What are you doing?" and he said "I'm casing it so I can
get in'.  I said, Well, clear off".

Were there many people about at this time?    A. No,
there were only about a dozen.  They was early, those.

And these people were coming quite early on, were they?
A.  Yes.

Did you let any of them in?      A. No.

                                  142


                                                     M. BAIN

        Q.   Did you report any of this to the police?    A.   No.

        Q.   You did not?   A. No. They were just coming and going.

        Q. At 2 o'clock, did you change your tactic and close the
           gate completely?   A. Yes, I went to Inspector White
           and told him that they was milling up and there was a
           lot of people trying to get in.  He came over, looked
           out, and said "Right, close the gates.  You only open
           them for the police", and that's what we did.

        Q. But you still nevertheless, having closed the gates, had
           to open them on several occasions, did you not? A. Yes,
           for the police to eject fans.

        Q. And when    you were able to open them, you were able      to see
           what was    going on outside, were you not?   A. Yes.

        Q.    Did you notice a particular build-up of people outside?
             A.   You can't see.  All you can see is just in front of
             you.   The gate is only open about 18 inches.   As they
             throw them out, they shut them straight away so you only
             get a quick glimpse of the outside.    As they was trying
             to get in, we was getting a lot of abuse from them,
             swearing.

        Q.    A lot of abuse from people outside?    A. Yes, "Let us
             in, let us in".

        Q. And they were people in the area immediately outside         'C '
           gate, were they?   A. Yes.

        Q. Of course, you took no notice of that, did you?       A. No.
           I don't want ray earhole thumping!

        Q. So you closed the gate and kept the gate closed?          A. Yes.

        Q. Did you find that the crowd outside was getting somewhat
           worse?   A. Yes, as the time went on they got very much
           worse.

        Q. Was there any pressure on the gate itself, after pethaps
           20-to_3 or quarter-to-3?    A. It wouldn't have gone.
           I've said all the time it would never have gone, that
           gate, because I was stood directly at the back of it
           and all you could feel it doing was just vibrating.

        Q. You could feel the gate vibrating? A. Yes, but it
            wouldn't have collapsed; I don't think so anyhow.
           Nobody knows, do they?

        Q. No.  Fortunately, it did not, but you did notice the
           gate moving, did you?   A. Yes, it was moving, flexing.

        Q. And that was at about what time, do you say?        A. I should
           say about 20-to-3.
                           143

                                                M. BAIN

Q. Do you remember the gate being opened on the first
   occasion when a fan was ejected or an entrant was
   ejected who had come in, I think, through turnstile
   B?   A. Yes, they were ejecting a fan when the gates
   was opened.   I was stood at the side.  I don't remember
   exactly until I saw it on the video, to be honest.

Q.   Until you saw it on the video? A. When I saw it on
     the telly, it came back. I was stood at this side
     and all of a sudden the gate opened.

Q.   Had you been one of  those who opened the gate on that
     first occasion for this fan to be ejected? A. On the
     first one?

Q. Yes.    As you know, there were two occasions when fans
   came in in quantity and the first one was at 2.48?
   A.   Yes.

Q. Had you been one of the gatemen who had opened the gate
   for the ejection of that ---   A. Not that particular fan.

Q. You had not?     A.   No.

Q. But you had nevertheless been standing ----      A. I was stood
   at the side of it, yes.

Q. The gate had only been opened 18 inches or so?         A. And
   then all of a sudden it just came wide open.

Q. Could you see what caused it to come wide open?   A. As
   far as I know, the police opened it, as far as I know.

Q. As far as you know.     That gate was closed after about 30
   seconds?  A. Yes.

Q. Do you recall that now?         A. Yes.

Q. Do you recall the gate being opened on the second occasion?
   A.  Yes,it was opened on the second occasion.  We was
   told to open it.

Q. You were told to open it, were you?   A. I heard somebody
   say "Open the gate' and the gate was opened.

Q. So you did not in     fact open it yourself? A. No, I didn't
   in fact open it.      I was stood to    one side, they letthem
   in, and then they     said "Pull it so far to" and then they
   filed them in and     asked them to check their tickets as
   they came in.

Q. Did you do that?      A. Yes.

Q. But that was, of course, some considerable time after
   it had been opened, was it not?   A. Yes.

Q. It had been open for about five minutes, had it not?
   A.  Yes.
                                             M. BAIN

About five mintues?   A.  Yes.  T h e r e w a s a W.P.C.
police lady outside and a constable directing them in.

She was directing them in and there were still people
outside after the five minute quantity had gone through?
A.  Yes.

      Mr. PHILLIPS:     Thank you very

      Mr. HYTNER:     I have no questions,   sir.

      Mr. JACKSON:     No questions, sir.

         Cross-examined by Mr. WOODWARD:

Mr. Bain, the number of people without tickets this year
seemed to be quite a lot, according to your recollection?
A.  Yes, there was a lot.   There was a lot this year
milling about without tickets.

Your view from Gate C is rather a narrow view,         is it not?
A.   Yes.

So you do not get much of a panorama of what is happening
outside?   A. Only when we have it open first. Before
2 o'clock there was a lot by the river.  We can see the
river and there was a lot milling round there without
tickets.

I think you put an estimate upon those that you could
see, in your statement, and it was your impression that
there were about 500 or so?   A. Well, I should say at
the time when the gate was opened there would be about
500 came in without tickets.  A chap came up to me and
said "I've paid Â£14 for this and I've no need to have
bothered.  Half of those you've just let in haven't got
tickets".  I said, "Well, thatâ€™s nothing to do with us'.

You are talking about them coming in through the gates?
A. Yes.

And one of the complaints that was made by a number of
Liverpool fans with tickets wasthat about  half of those
who had come had not got tickets? You got that complaint
from more than one person?    A. Yes.

That was not quite what I was asking you about.  Have
you got your statement there?   A. No, I haven't, sir.

On page 5 of the statement that you made to the police
A.  I haven't received one.

Would you have a look at it? Have you got it there?
(Handed to the witness). That is a statement that you
made on the 10th May 1989.  Will you look at page 5?    (
Do you have the top of the page   there?A. Yes, but it s
cut off.   The page is cut off.

                                               M. BAIN

Q. Does that page begin "... very quiet which I thought was
   extremely unusual ..."?   A. Yes.

Q. On this day in 1989 there was a difference because it
   seemed to you-very quiet.  What this says is this:

           "After 2 p.m. a few more people began to arrive
           but what was noticeable was the large numbers of
           people standing outside the ground who obviously
           didn't have tickets".

     Do you see that?    A. Yes.

Q. The time you are talking about is a long time before the
   gates were opened.  You say:

           "The people were Liverpool supporters and I would
           estimate that just after 2 p.m. there were at
           least 500 people just hanging around and approaching
           spectators coming to the ground for tickets."

     It is that time I am asking you about?   A.   Yes.

Q. At that time round about 2 o'clock, your impression was
   that there were in the order of about 500 people who had
   not got tickets milling about?   A. Yes.

Q. That is your guess?      A. Yes.

Q. And that seems to be confirmed by what happened when the
   gate opened?   A. Yes.

Q. Because there were people saying "Half of them that have
   come in haven't got tickets"?   A. Yes.

Q. You stewarded in 1988?      A. Yes.

Q. But you were up on the West Stand?    A. That's correct.

Q. Perhaps you cannot help too much about it, but you say
   that in the past you have seen the tunnel closed on two
   or three occasions? A. Yes, I have.

Q.   But only in relation to League games?    A. That's the
     only time I've seen it closed, yes, because last season
     I wouldn't have seen it because I was upstairs.

Q. That is right, but your understanding of any closing of
   the  tunnel was in relation to League games?   A. Yes,
   when they had big League games they used to put them in
   the pens first and fill them up.

Q. Because there was a difference at League games?       A. Yes.

Q.   Whether anybody had decided in 1988 to   close the tunnel
     for some other reason, there was a difference? A. Yes.

          Q. In League games, people were put into pens?         A.    Yes.

          Q. As though some organisation was attempted to ensure that
             that was done, but that was not done at semi-finals, was
             it?    A. Not as far as I know.

          Q. Where were you in the West Stand in 1988?       A. Showing
             people to their seats.

          Q. Were you able to see down on to the terrace?         A. No, you
             can't see from where I was.

                     Mr. PHILLIPS:   Thank you, sir.

                     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Thank you very much.

                     Mr. GOLDSACK:   Mr. Cardwell please.

                          STEPHEN CRAIG CARDWELL, Called
                          Examined by Mr. GOLDSACK:

          Q. Mr. Cardwell, I think you work with Mr. Stuart Thorpe?
             A.  Yes, that's right.

          Q. And you got to know, through him, that he needed some
             temporary stewards to help out at semi-final day? A. Yes.

          Q.   You had never stewarded before?    A.   No.

          Q.   But you fancied going to the semi-final?A. Yes.

          Q. So you volunteered?     A. Yes.

          Q. Were you at any stage given any written instructions by
             Mr. Thorpe?   A. Not written instructions, no.

          Q. Or any instructions at all, before the day?     A. No, I were
             told just to report about quarter-past-11.

          Q. You turned up, I think, and the man at the gate had your
             name on a list and you were allowed in?    A. Yes.

          Q.    And you made your way up towards where there was a briefing?
               A.   Yes.

          Q. Taking the matter shortly, is this the position:  Because
             you had arrived a little later than you intended, the
             briefing was about to finish? A.   I just caught the last
              three or four minutes.

          Q. And were you then simply told to go with a more experienced
             steward into the West Stand?   A. Well, we were already
             in the West Stand.  We were having the briefing where the
             gangway was where I was positioned.

          Q. Were you given anything in writing on the day?           A. No.

                                             S. C. CARDWELL

Q. Were you told anything at all about an evacuation procedure?
   A.  Yes, I remember the police officer who were giving the
   briefing asked for the names of the two stewards in the
   bottom corners of the stand and said he would want their
   names if there were any evacuation, and if there was, we
   were to use the exit on the right, the bottom right.

Q. So you got there in time to hear something about the
   evacuation procedure?   A. Yes, I heard him say that,
   yes.

           Mr. GOLDSACK:    Yes, very well. Thank you.

                  Cross-examined by Mr. HYTNER:

Q. Mr. Cardwell, I think some time before the kick-off you
   noticed that pens 3 and 4 were "heaving"?   A. Yes.

Q. It is a possible mis-typing in your statement.  Do you
   mean it was 1.50 or 2.50 that you noticed that they were
   "packed like sardines"?   A. It were 2.50.

Q. 2.50?     A.   Yes.

Q. This is before there was a sudden surge at 2.55? A. It
   were gradually building up from like 2.40. You could see,
   you know, more people in the pen.   About 2.50 there were
   a sudden rush into the stand as well.

Q. Before the sudden rush, you noticed that the fans in the
   pens were packed like sardines?   A. Yes, only in the
   two middle pens.

Q. Yes.  Did it occur to you - and please do not think this is
   a criticism of you, because you just turned up, of course,
   without any training or instruction - before the rush at
   2.55 that there was any danger to the fans who were packed
   like sardines?    A. Notparticularly. I go to football
   matches nearly every week and you get used to people, you
   know, swaying, so really it didn't, you know

Q. I do not suppose you had any idea at all that there was
   a safety capacity for each pen?   A.  I assumed there
   were, but obviously, like I say, you don't think at the
   time.

Q. If you had thought there was any danger, did you have
   any instructions or any idea of what you should^have done
   about it?   A. On the terracing, no. It's not like I were
   stewarding in the stand.

Q. You just did not think it was your business?      A. I suppose
   you could say that.

           Mr. HYTNER:     Thank you.

                     Cross-examined by Mr. KALLIPETIS:

        Q. Mr. Cardwell, will you turn to the last page of your
           statement, please?  Can you find the point five lines
           from the end of your statement?   A.  Yes.

        Q. Did you actually see that yourself?    A. Yes, certainly
           jostling and punching.  I know it says in here about
           being dragged over the fence, but at, what time and at
           what stage I can't really remember. I think it were when
           it first started happening and I think everybody just
           assumed it were like a pitch invasion. It were obvious
           that they were, you know, hostile.   You just got the
           feeling that it were going to be violent.   I definitely
           saw police officers pushed and punched.

        Q. Did you see any ambulancemen hit?   A.  I saw an ambulanceÂ­
           man get chased and a lad got hold of him, but whether that
           were to come and attend a friend, you know, or whatever,
           I don't really know.  There was so much going off that you
           can't really take it all in.

                Mr. KALLIPETIS:     Thank you very much.

                Mr. WOODWARD:     I have no questions, thank you, sir.

                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Thank you very much.    We will
           break now until 10 o'clock in the morning.




                 (The Inquiry was adjourned until 10 a . m .
                          the following morning)

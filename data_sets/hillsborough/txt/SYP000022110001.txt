F.A.O Mr Peter Jackson.

Dear Sir,
         I have been invited by                       to forward my observations
of events at Hillsborough on .April 15th.         .          - -

         Had the Nottingham Supporters been aware of the-'serious situation
earlier, the unsavoary charts which angered the Liverpool Supporters would
not have occured, and the police would have been able to make a more positive . -
effort to assist the casualties. There was no information given over the
Tannoy until Kenny Daglish spoke; in fact one of the most absurd, acts,orethe
afternoon was to see an official walking round the ground shotting instructions
through a megaphone! I have no idea what he was shouting.

         I could go on listing acts of stupidity, but to summarise, the following
are my main areas of complaint
         incorrect allocation of ends
         poor access to the ground for a large crowd
         lack of understanding of the situation by police
         delay in opening the gates to allow the crowd on to= the pitch cost lives
         police were more intent in controlling the crowd than helping
         save lives                                 '
          police provocation by bringing dogs on to a pitch where people
         lay dying.

               The final act of stupidity by the authorities was evident as we
tried to get out of the ground through narrow gates; unbelievably, parked
outside the gates where two fire engines and a police car with two officers
sitting in the car. It is to the credit of the Liverpool Supporters that
they kept their heads in face of the final provocation.

          I am sure you can appreciate my feelings as I recall the events
at Hillsborough, but I have tried to contain my emotion, and relate the
incidents as objectively as I can.
          I hope this letter helps you.                   ---


Yours faithfully

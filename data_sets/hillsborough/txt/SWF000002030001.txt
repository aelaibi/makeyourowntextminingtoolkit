B                      Examined by MR. COLLINS      (cont.)

    Q. Mr. Mole, before we progress m your evidence I would just
       like to d al with one matter that was covered yesterday.
       - A. Yes sir.

    Q. I don't know whether you have read any of the reports cr
       your evidence about the allocation of the ends at
       Hillsborough? - A. No, I have not sir.

    Q. Well if you had I think you would have been rather surprised
       by them because they don't accurately reflect what you said.

                    As I understand your evidence, and I think as every­
            one in this room understood your evidence, it was to this
            effect, was it not, that you made it crystal clear to the
D           F .a . and indeed to the Club that the only basis upon which
            you would agree to the game being held at Hillsborough was
            on the basis of Liverpool having the ends they had and
            Nottingham the other end? - A. That is correct sir, yes.

    Q- And that if they wished therefore to hold the event at
       Hillsborough that was the basis upon which they should hold
       -it? - A. That too is correct sir.

    Q - Bun if they did not like that arrangement then obviously
        they had the opportunity to find another ground at which
        they could hold the event? - A. I presume that would be
        the course of action that they would take.

                  MR. WOODWARD:   Sir, I am grateful to learned Counsel
            for the Inquiry for making that point because we were
            rather concerned with the coverage in the media both broad­
            cast and printed concerning the evidence that Mr. Mole
            had given   and that not only the appearance that ’people
            may have heard things which they wished to hear rather
            than listen to what was said, but also slanted that which
            they wished to hear.

                  LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     I don't know, Mr. Woodward,
            it is put right now anyway.

    q   .         m r . COLLINS:   Now Mr. Mole   again before I cone on
            to inside, inevitably overnight there are one or two matters
            that I think I ought to ask you to deal with.

                  Now the first is as I understand it the plan that
H           was adopted for 1989 was essentially the same as that
            initiated in 1987? - A. That is correct, sir.
                           2

                                       B.L. MOLE


Q. That was a plan devised by you.     Is that right? - A. It
   was sir, yes.

Q.   Obviously with consultation with other Officers? -   A. Yes.

Q.    So far as the ultimate approval of that plan for each year
     was concerned, was that you or someone else? - A. I would
     prepare the plan in consultation with my Officers and
     sign that plan and forward it to Headquarters as a copy
     for information sir.

Q. By "Headquarters" you mean? - A. The Assistant Chief Ccnstabi
   of Operations would receive a copy of the order.

Q.   Mr. Jackson? - A. That is correct sir, yes.

Q.   Did Mr. Jackson have the ultimate decision whether or not
     to approve? - A. If in fact he had any fault with the order
     then he would have that sanctioned to rectify that matter
     and refer it back to me sir.

Q. So it was his ultimate decision as to whether that plan
   should go ahead or be modified? - A. That is correct sir.

Q. Did he have any comments can you recall in relation to the
   plan.on any of the years 1987, 1988, 1989? - A. No sir.
   In brief during the arrangements I am often in consultation
   with Mr. Jackson as well as my subordinate Officers so most
   of the matters are resolved before I put pen to paper with
   the final plan, but certainly there were no particular
 / comments which would require modification or rectification
   once I submitted that order for the seal of approval sir.

Q. The next thing I would like just to ask you about is horses.
   Clearly the use of mounted Officers is something which is
   recognised as being invaluable in crowd control? - A. I
   find it invaluable sir, yes.

Q. Indeed if one looks at what we have as Document 11 which
   is the South Yorkshire Standing Instructions for Policing
   of Football Matches.  If you would turn to page 5 of that
   document, paragraph 7.6? - A. Yes sir.

Q. Incidentally I assume you are well aware of this document
   which emanates from Mr. Jackson and is dated March 1986?
   - A. I am indeed sir, yes.

Q. It is a memo from Mr. Jackson to effectively those concerned
   dealing with already updating the Yorkshire Instructions
   following  the Popplewell Report.  That is right, is it?
   - A. That is correct sir, yes.

Q. 7.6 one sees Police horses are dealt with and their role
   is set out as thus:

           "They should be used to escort visiting supporters
           to and from the ground in the segregation

                                                   S.L. MOLE


                        of opposing fans, regulating queues at turn­
                        stiles and clearing the playing area in the
                        event of serious crowd invasion".

                 A. Yes sir.

            Q. Nov; it was part of your Operational Order that there should
        g      be a number of mounted Officers available? - A. That is
               correct sir, yes.

            Q. Again to see that can we go to Document 14 which is the
               'F1 Divisional Operational Order, the relevant one.  Turn
               to top right-hand corner 4, para. 3.9.1:

                        "Members of the mounted section will be
                        employed outside the ground to maintain
                        order, segregate supporters and escort them
                        from and to their transport".

                 A.   fes sir,

            Q. It does not there say anything about helping to form queues
               as part of the duties of the mounted section? - A. In point
        D      of fact sir that is correct, it does not there, but
               certainly the briefing by Mr. Hans-Davies would certainly
               concern that aspect, particularly in relation to Penistone
               Road.  Those Officers are regularly used on that function
               and are aware of the- action they take and in Leppincs Lane
               sir.

            Q.   Now in Leppings Lane the ability of the mounted Officers
                 to help in queue form is limited by the geography of the
                 entrance, is it not? - A. It .is very difficult to operate
                 certainly within the perimeter fence because of the
                 confines of application, but certainly they can operate
                 in Leppings Lane keeping the crowd in a queue form
                 on the footpath and not on the highway and that is the kind
                 of action they undertake sir.

            Q. That is their major role surely is to prevent a crush
               on the perimeter fence as it were? - A. Public safety
               sir is the major role   that they form in that locality.

            q,         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   What is the sort of queue you
                 have in min d looking at Composite 1, 20A, it is South
                 Yorkshire Police Volume 1.   If you look at that it looks
                 as though the Of ficers there are operating both mounted
                 and otherwise to keep the stream coming down that pavement?
                 - A. That is right sir.

            Q.   I don't know, because what we don't know is what happens
                 when it just goes off.the photograph to the right, but is
                 that what you meant? - A. That is the kind of operation
                 they would carry out sir.
        H                . COLLINS:
                         h r         I think one sees that even more
                 clearly on 22A where the Officer in question is obviously

                                         3.L. MOLE



q   .          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: But that really amounts to
        keeping the stream on the pavement.  It is not quite the
        same as producing a queue towards the turnstile, is it?
        - A. I think the difficulty is as I described the perimeter
        fence is difficult to operate inside that actual area.

q   .          MR. COLLINS: Which means that the ability of mounted
        Officers to help control crowding inside the perimeter
        fence is somewhat limited? - A. That is right, sir.  My
        experience is of a limited flow which usually occurs and
        which this action has facilitated in the past to bring
        them to the turnstiles and then once they get into the
        perimeter fence area they approach their various turnstile
        positions.

Q. Indeed.  Would it be fair to say if you get overcrowding
   in front of the turnstiles, that is inside the perimeter
   fence, Police horses can be somewhat dangerous because
   it is a confined space with a lot of people about? - A.
   My experience is that the horses are very experienced
   and can operate in those situations and regularly do so.
   To put them inside the pens in a very confined area could
   be difficult, but I think they are very used to this
   operation and in fact operate very well in that kind of
   a situation.

Q. A s .I understand it you have never had to, or you have never
   had experience of this sort of situation before.    Is that
   right? - A. At a football match?

Q.      Yes? - A. Ihave   not had the large swell andappearance
        in numbers that   were seen on this occasion.

Q.       Who was in ultimate control of the mounted section? - A.
        Inspector Hans-Davies.

Q. He was not answerable to any Superintendent? - A. He is
   answerable to the Officer in charge of the operation which
   would be myself, but his deployment of horses rests on
   him because of his expertise and knowledge in deploying
   those horses in the past.

Q. So effectively he has an independent command? - A. He has
   that command with my knowledge and with my consultation
   and-approval.

O. So that means that for example Superintendent Marshall has
   no direct responsibility or control over the mounted Officers.
   Equally Superintendent Greenwood in the ground doesn't?
   - The mounted section is a support service but because of
   the command structure within the Police Service, Mr. Marshall
   would have the authority to direct Mr. Hans-Davies but  the
   actual deployment at the time is down to that Officer as it
   is to other sub-sector Commanders in the various areas of
   their responsibility.
Nov/ apart from horses the other aid that certainly was in
use in 19S8 was a spotter plane,wasn't it? - A. That
is correct sir.

Was that for traffic purposes or also to monitor crcwc
arrival and position of fans and so on? - A. It was for
traffic.  Because of our experiences in 1937 when in fact
we had a build up on the motorways it was intended to
pick up if those same problems were arising in 1988.

Did you have a spotter plane in use in 1989? - A. Ho sir.

VJhy not? - A. The need for it in 1938 was very minimal.
It had no purpose   that was of beneficial value at that
time and the need to utilise it again on this occasion
was felt not to be necessary.

Of course it can be used, can it not, to monitor as I have
said the position  of fans and to see how many are approaching
the ground and from what quarter? - A. It could be sir
but that situation had not arisen in 1988 and the need for
the spotter planewas not perceived.




                        /Q. Was the question
                                   6

                                                         B .L . MOLE




         Q.   Was the question as lead?   -   A. It was indeed.

         Q.    Whether it would have a use over and above a traffic use?
                  A. It was discussed and Celt that because of what had
              been experienced the need was not, as I say, perceived.
    B
         Q.    Can I, before wa leave outside, refer you to one or two
              matters in the Standing Instructions, document 11.    Can I
              ask you first to look at page 7 of that document.    - A.
              Yes sir.

         Q.   Paragraph 9.1 under a heading     "Traffic Flow":

                        "The five main football stadia in South
                        Yorkshire were purposely constructed in
                        residential areas to cater for mass
                        spectator attendance."

              I'm not quite sure that that is entirely accurate because I
              think in this case the residential area grew up around
              Hillsborough, but no matter, they are in fact in
    D         residential areas:

                        "That situation was no doubt satisfactory
                        at the time but the advent o£ modern
                        transport in current times resulted in
                        serious congestion and conflict between
                        pedestrian/vehicular move m en t. "

              and then they deal with controlled parking and then this,
              9.3:

                        "There must be an acceptance by persons
+                       attending a football match, whether on
                        foot or otherwise, that delay and con­
                        gestion will arise and must be endured
                        when in close proximity to a ground.    It
                        is our duty however to make every effort
                        to minimise delay and congestion by w h a t ­
                        ever means possible."

              That is a clear identification of the potential problem of
              congestion, and an indication that there must be thought
              given to every possible means to avoid it.  - A. Yes sir.

         Q. And that means, does it not, adequate policing arrangements
            on the approach to the ground?  - A. Yes sir.

         Q. And then thre is an. indication in 9.4 of the usual practice
            of spectators staggering their arrival, then 9.5:

                         "At this time previous intelligence
    jj                   enquiries will have been of assistance
                                        B.L. MOLE




         to determine the number of visiting
         supporters expected and their mode o£
         travel.        Once known and identiEied
         arrangements should be made Eor their
         routing and arrival at designated parking
         areas at a time shortly preceding kick-ocf.
         the strategy of delayed arrival oE visitors
         ceduces the time for pre-match disorder
         pro b l e m s . "

That suggests an approach to encourage rather lata arrival
does it not?  - A. I think the intention oE that is the
staggering oE arriving supporters, and one has to tefac
back to my comments yestarday regarding the trains and the
coaches, and efforts are made Eor the tcains to arrive at
staggerad times where you can control that.  I believe the
ourpose oE that is Ecr that reason.

But that last sentence, "The strategy oE delayed arrival of
visitocs reduces the time for pca-match disorder problems"
does that not suggest that certainly the thinking behind
this document was an encouragement of fans arriving close
enough to the game not to have time to hang around or drink
in oubs or whatever?   - A. I think that there is an element
of: that.  The main thrust of this document was based upon
the findings o£ the Popplewell Inquiry which was tha result
oc considerable public disorder, and the aim was to prevent
public disorder, and clearly as you say there is a
oossibility of bringing them later to the stadium but the
intention has always been to get them in sufficient time to
,-et in, whether that later be half past two as opposed to
three o'clock.

May I just go on again, I think to point out something you
have covered but I just*would see it in black and white,
Dage 24 of this document, Appendix F.  The last two para­
graphs on that page they talk about pre-match:

          "The most useful instrument available to
          the Police in their responsibility  for
          crowd control within the stadium is the
          tannoy or public address system which
          should at all times be available to the
          Police, should be proved effective through­
          out the ground and thoroughly testad befora
          each fixture. "

Now your experience in 1988 - and I appreciate you were not
there in 1989 and I am not asking you about it, but your
exoerience in 1988 in relation to the tannoy, what do you
say about its effectiveness?  - A. I found the tannoy to
be effective.   I didn't have occasion to use it for a
problem.  We do have occasion to use the tannoy as we do.
                                                B.L. MOLE




We had the over-ride facility in the Police control room
and it is tested pre-match to ensure that those areas are
all covered by the tannoy system.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I suppose testing it pre-match
is tasting it against silence.   - A.. That is corract,
sir.  It is merely a test to see that it is operating, but
during a match we do test and ask for responses from
Officers in all the localities that they can hear it, but
there is some difficulty, one has to appreciate, at
oarticularly loud times of the crowd that it is not as
distinctive as others.

     MR. C O L L I N S :  Do you have any systems at Hillsborough
whereby there is a means of attracting a crowd's attention
to an important announcement, on for example sacety or
control of crowd?        - A. I have only in the past utilised
the public address system.

What. I am getting at is I think in some grounds they have
some sort of a bleep or that dreadful ding-dong noise one
hears on railway stations sometimes, some sound which
attracts attention and makes it clear that this is an
announcement that ought to be listened to?    - A. No we
hava not used that facility.

Is that something that was considered?      -   A. No sir.

What about the usa of the electronic scoreboard?  - A. I
have never considered utilising the electronic scoreboard.
I must say I have no knowledge as to who activates that and
I have always used the public address system and not found
a need for the electronic scoreboard.

Was that ever considered or simply not considerad as a
oossible means of crowd information? - A. Not considered
by me as a means because its location is immediately
adjacent to the Police Box and I think there are some
limited restricted access to it although I have not tested
that and clearly I have not utilised the thought of using
that scoreboard.  I have been satisfied with the public
address system.

Clearly for the future if there is difficulty making people
hear there is a lot to be said for having something they
can see from any part of the ground.  - A. That is right
sir.  I think one of the difficulties would be attracting
their attention to sea it.  The public address system at
least does address all areas and one can draw people's
attention by hearing, but certainly to draw their attention
to look at the sign is not quite as aasy and I cannot
guarantee that they would have looked and saen.

    q   .         MR. COLLINS:   Incidentally there are public address
             speakers are there at all the turnstiles?  - A. There ara
             public address certainly on the Leppings Lanes and they
             certainly come to the outside.  Yes sir.  I am just
             thinking it out.  Yes sir they do.

B   Q. There is presumably no way of isolating those?      That is to
       say you c a n 't'make an announcement specifically to people
       outside Lappings Lane which isn't heard all over the
       ground, or am I wrong about that?     - A. I couldn't answer
       that.  I hava utilised the public address system mainly for
       massages - personally this is - mainly for messages inside
       the stadium and usad all tannoy aspects.      Certainly we have
       used them readily for the Leppings Lane visitors, to advise
       them of what we are going to do      after match, ie.take them
       back to the coaches, trains and whatever, but that has gone
       out, been broadcast right across the stadium.       As far as I
       am aware, and the tachnical aspect I couldn't, I have never
       had need to use it on one area.

    Q.       But it is something which could arise and indeed did arise
             on this occasion. .- A. Apparently so sir.
D
    Q.       Can I go back to page 24 and just go to the bottom
             paragraph of that page where it says this:

                       "The crucial period Eor disorder is in the
                       half hour immediately preceding the game
                       and maximum Police strength should be
                       available at that time.  The use of enter­
                       tainment during this period if valuable
                       in turning the attention of supporters away
                       from disorder and clubs should be encouraged
                       to make the necessary provision."

                A. Yes sir.

    Q. Did you in fact have any input in '37 and '88 on this
       asoect of entertainment?  - A. I have mentioned many times
       to"the club that I feel that entertainment is of value,
       that it does fall in line with the Popplewell Report and on
       occasions they have introduced it.   I can recall having
       youth football before the match.   In fact I mentioned that
       yesterday and I have confirmed since that we did have youth
       football.

    Q. You did.

        Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Can you tell me what happened?
             You had some youth football before the game in '88 - A.
             That is right sir.

        Q. When did it start and - it would be a full match would it?

           A. No it was a competition type o£ thing.   I am trying
        to recall the details.  It was something like who can keep
        the ball in the air longest.  Young boys.  They were judged
        by Ian Knight, one of the players.  As I recall they came
        on the pitch about 2 pm and stayed on there for half an
        hour, forty minutes, clearing the pitch twenty to, quarter
        to, before the players came out for the first warm-up.
        That was viewed by the spectators in the stadium.   On this
        occasion I know that I had mentioned about entertainment
        and often it has cested on music as opposed to physical
        entertainment, but there have been occasions when there has
        been entertainment on the pitch in the form of marching
        bands and in the form of keep fit enthusiasts.

q   .        m r . COLLINS:  Entertainment really involves a
        spectacle of some sort.   I mean muzak through the tannoy
        system really doesn't count does it?   - A. I think I said
        yesterday that it counts.   On a personal note I would like
        to see more entertainment on the pitch which draws
        attention, but it does count and if it encourages community
        singing involvement then that does have some effect, but
        clearly I think some actual physical thing to see has
        greater benefit.

Q. Of course, the problem of that is it tends to create a surge.
   If people come at the last minute altogether they will come in
   probably to one part and create a problem in that part, won't
   they? - A. That is right, sir.

Q. And so you must have been aware that there was a potential
   problem if there was a late arrival of a large number of fans?
   - A. As I said previously, there was no anticipated late
   arrival, but yes.

G.   I know.  You say "no anticipated".  It is something you have
     to bear in mind as a possibility, surely, in case of forming a
     plan? - A. Yes.

Q. And then they refer over the page,   page 2, the paragraph in
   the middle of the page:

          "Mr. Herold has already referred to the late arrival of a
          large number of spectators still waiting to enter
          Leppings Lane when the match started.  The flash point
          occurred when Tottenham scored after only 3 minutes.   The
          spectators just entering pushed forward to see what was
          happening and caused a crush which resulted in the
          i n ju ri e s" .

     Then there was reference to two or three minor fights at the
     same time.-

          "This had resulted in the order from Mr. Gosling"

     who was the Assistant Chief Constable at the time,   I think?
     - A. He w a s , s i r , y e s .

G.          "To open the gates at the front of Leppings Lane in
            order to release some spectators on to the pitch
            surround".

     There is, of course, a similarity, is there not, between that
     and what happened here? - A. The scenario does seem similar,
     sir, yes.

Q. Can I also refer to one other matter.  This is document 5,
   which is the letter or copy of the letter from I think.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Before you go on, at that time
     there were no radial fences? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q. Was there then a computer or computers at the Leppings Lane
   turnstiles showing how many had gone through? - A. No, sir, a'
   that time as I recall they were on the click system, the
   numbers on each turnstile, but that was not linked to a
   computer where you could have an overview.  You would have to
   collect all the various numbers from the turnstiles.

Q. So that would only used for afterwards and not during? - A.
   That is correct, sir.
                                      16


                                                                B.L. MOLE


     Q.       When was the computer installed? - A. I could not be sure of
             the date, but it was in the last three or four years.

     Q.       The effect of the computer is only to tell you or warn you          of
             when you come within a percentage of the total capacity of           the
             terrace as a whole? - A. That is right, sir.

B    Q. There is no means of checking the individual pens? - A. I
        believe it is -15% short of capacity it starts to pulsate,
        which then gives us an indication we are reaching that level.

     Q.      What I was going to ask you is this.  I believe there may be
             some grounds where tickets for the terraces are issued
             specifically for particular pens? - A. I am not aware of that,
             but clearly that would be very useful, sir.

     Q.      It would be useful? - A.      It would   indeed, sir.

     Q.      Is there any practical reason why it should not be done here?
             - A. I think the limitation possibility of the turnstile
             entrances might be difficult to segregate even greater.  The
             areas we have described is a very confined area, and in queue
             terms that may well be difficult to split out 1,000 and 1,200
D            and another 1,000 and 3,700 in the north-west terrace, but I
             think there is merit in that avenue being pursued.

     q   .        MR. COLLINS:   Yes.  Just leading on from all that.  Of
             course, in relation to the sudden surge created by late
             arrivals, your thesis that they milled around and went and gcr.
             refreshment, etc., simply would not hold water there, would
          ■' it? - A. I think that is correct, sir, yes.

     Q. Clearly defective signing, if there was defective signing,
        would exacerbate any problem which was in any event going to
        be created by late arrivals? - A. It would cause confusion,
        yes, sir.

     Q. Can I ask you to look at document 5, please, which as I
        understand is a copy of a letter from the Assistant Chief
        Constable to the Chairman or the then Chairman of Sheffield
        Wednesday Football Club.  He may still be Chairman.  I am not
        sure. - A. Yes, he is.

     Q. Can I ask you to look at the second paragraph of that:

                 ' "The letters of complaint you received and those both
                   complementary and otherwise which I have received have
                  established beyond doubt that the Police action in
                   letting spectators on to the track was not only necessary
                   but was vital to avoid further serious injuries and
                   possibly save life.            In this respect my only criticism of
                   my senior Officers is for not opening the gates earlier,
                   thus avoiding the emergency measure of allowing and
                   helping spectators to climb over the fence.             This type of
tt                decision, however, is often necessary in operational
                   s i t u a t i o n s , and although it may look untidy the needs of
                   the occasion demand instant action irrespective of how it

                                                          B.L. MOLE


              may appear to the o n l o o k e r " .

         I am sorry to read it rather haltingly,      but it   is nor easy to
         read in my copy. - A. Mine is the same.

   Q. Now, it would appear that on that occasion there was a
      difficulty in Police reaction to the emergency that developed?
g|    - A. Reading that, sir, it would, yes.

    Q. Are you aware of that?  Is that the matter you discussed? - A.
       Yes, I am conscious of that aspect.

    Q. Because it was essential, was it not, to ensure that perimeter
       Officers were fully alive to the distinction between a pitch
       invasion on the one hand and a problem arising which needed or
       led to people trying to escape because of conditions inside
       the pens? - A. That is correct, sir, and that problem has been
       addressed in many ways.  One of the main areas is the same
       Officers are used regularly on the perimeter track.  I
       introduced a policy at the ground of whar I called community
       policing which utilises the same Officers in the same areas so
       they can recognise not only individuals and infiltrators who
       are liable to cause public disorder, but also respond to
D      incidents because they recognise it.  The difficulty so far as
       the recognition of a pitch invasion is one which is apparent,
       and in fact my own experience last year showed signs very
       similar to the end of the match to what we saw at the start of
       this problem.  From the footage I have seen here the signs
       were very similar from what happened at the end of the
       Liverpool-Notts Forest match last year, with people climbing
       the fences when they in fact invaded the pitch, and there is
       clearly a matter to be determined which is taking place.

    O. Of course.  The fact that someone climbs out is equivocal on
       the face of it.  It could mean a pitch invasion.  It could be
       because he is trying to escape something inside? - A. Yes,
       sir.

    Q. But one has to use a little common sense and surely at the
       beginning of a match, particularly when your side has started
       quite well, is a singularly improbable time for a pitch
       invasion, is not it? - A. I th'ink that is not true, sir.
       There is often the occasion when I have seen spectators climb
       the fences, even at the beginning or during the match, for
       various reasons.  I think it is unfair to say the O f f i c e r s ’
       reaction is not such.  they have to assess the situation, and
       I am quite confident that the O f f i c e r s ’ knowledge and ability
       on that perimeter has been first class and is still the same,
       and they address that situation with what is being faced by
       them.

    Q.   It is fair to say the Operational Order emphasises their
         duties in relation to stopping people getting on to the pitch?
         - A. I think that is correct, sir.  One of our main functions
         under all the aspects of policing football is the maintenance
H        of public order, and it is a sad fact of life with football
         that people want to disrupt that and create disorder.

                                                    B.L. MOLE



    Q. But surely safety, even safety of those in the pens, is more
       important than preventing a possible pitch invasion, is in
       not? - A. I am absolutely confident that the preservation of
       life is one of our prime functions, and safety comes into that
       aspect, yes.

®   Q. All I am getting at is wondering, looking at your Operational
       Order, the emphasis was not too much on prevention of climbing
       over ranher than on looking to see the cause of the climbing
       over? - A. I d o n ’t think so, sir.

    0. Can I take you back to document again.   The Standing
       Instructions, page 37. - A. Yes, sir.

    Q. This, of course, was a document produced as we have seen by
       Mr. Jackson, and related specifically to the five grounds, I
    think, in .... - A. In South Yorkshire.

    Q. Yes. in South Yorkshire.  And if you look at No. 6 on page 37
       of this document. - A. Mine starts az 7 on page 37.

    Q. I beg your pardon.   Mine is a very poor copy.
D
            ”8 . Communications available within the ground.    This
            should include:

            (a) Police communications

            (b) Club communications, i.e. radios and/or telephones
£            with information on the systems employed.

            (c) Methods of communication with the public to include
            where the Police have access to them,- ie. (1) Tannoy (1
            Electronic display boards.  (3) Loud hailers.  (4)
            Banners".

       So it appears it certainly was contemplated by Mr. Jackson
       that there might be Police use of electronic display boards? -
       A. There is the consideration, and I felt that at Sheffield
       Wednesday was not practical, and have used the facilities that,
       are available to me, that is the public address system which
       has been extremely functional and useful for my operations.

    Q. What about loud hailers? - A. Loud hailers are always
       available at the ground.

    Q. Where? -A. In the Police control,   and in the Police room which
       is the other side of the stadium.

    Q. How many? - A. On most occasions when I operated, and I d o n ’t
       know what was on this occasion, certainly I would have two
       loud hailers there and two at the Police room.   I also travel
       in the Landrover which has a loud hailer system facilitated on
H      the top of it with 4 speakers, and a hand held facility for my
       use within the Landrover.

                                                  B.L. MOLE


Q. Was one handed out    to the Sergeant in charge ofthe   perimeter
   serial as a matter    of    routine? -A. No, sir.

Q. Would it not have been useful? -A. The communications link
   between the Police room and the Sergeant at the perimeter is a
   matter of a couple of    minutes atthe most to     get to him,and
   they have that equipment on hand there.

Q. Because one of the things that appears from the shambles on
   this occasion after the event was that there was very little
   use of loud hailers to try to get the crowd to go back in the
   pens? - A. My understand of it there was quite a bit of use of
   loud hailers and in particular the public address system, but
   as I have said, that is what I have learned subsequently as
   opposed t o ... .

Q.   I appreciate you were not there and you can't deal with it
     directly.  You told us yesterday why you did not, as part of
     your Operational Order, have deployment of Police on the
     terraces themselves. - A. Yes, sir.

Q. As I understand it it was really a question of them being too
   full? - A. No, sir, I think the question was they serve little
   function and operationally are not useful when you are dealing
   with a packed situation.  I can deploy from the tunnels.  I
   can deploy from the perimeter track, but if I have them
   trapped into the area at the back of the terrace they are of
   very little use to me in deployment terms for public order.

Q, Can   I ask you to look at page 42 of document 11, which is one
   of the appendices.    This deals with specific duties of
   stewards, 7(a). - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Where it talks about the first specific duty is:

          "(a) Preventing overcrowding;  ensuring that crowd limits
          in various parts of the ground are complied with and that
          gangways and exits are kept clear” .

     - A. Yes,   sir.

Q. And then:

          "Preventing   as far as possible standing on seats and the
          climbing of   fences and other structures and so o n ” .

     - A. Yes,   sir.

Q. Now, you would accept, I imagine, that preventing overcrowding
   and ensuring that crowd limits in various parts are complied
   with would include the crowd limits in the individual pens? -
   A. I would say it is, sir.

Q. Did you inn 1988 liaise with the club in relation to
   stewarding of the terracing to ensure there was even
   distribution? - A. The club are fully aware of the conditions
   for stewards.  They are briefed by them and by the Police and
                                             B.L. MOLE


Fire Service at various times in and out of season.   The
stewards are briefed by the Inspectors on sector duties and
would give them that briefing on each match.   The deployment
of stewards is a matter for the club, and I would not
specifically brief them on that aspect.   They have
communications through the chief steward of which we have a
link into in our Police control. . We have one of their radios
so they can communicate with Police control direct in additic
to our own facilities.




                           /Q. I think from that.

Q. I think from that the answer to my question is no, there
   was no liaison specifically in 1988 in relation to the
   stewarding of the terraces at Leppings Lane? - A. As I have
   said we allowed that to fill and that no doubt was the
   same understanding with the stewards.

Q. Do you know or did you know in 1933 whether there was any
   steward control either at the back of the terracing or, and
   I think one can extend it, to the tunnel giving access to
   that part? - A'. My recollection of 1933 is that the stewards
   were operating in the area behind the terraces, that is the
   open area in the concourse and the stands.

Q. But not on the terraces? - A. Correct sir.

Q. And that I imagine would not surprise you altogether because
   I suspect that Sheffield Wednesday stewards would not be
   over eager to put themselves on the Liverpool terraces? -
   A. I think not only Sheffield Wednesday stewards but probably
   stewards in general, sir.

Q. Did that not mean that it was the more important that there
   should be a Police presence to ensure that there was even
   distribution? - A. I think that is not a function of the
   Police.   If there was a public order situation we would
   have reacted.   My resources were available to react and
   are deployed at all phases to react to that situation should
   it arise.

Q. So you are saying that you don't believe it is a Police
   function to ensure even distribution along the terraces?
   - A. If we are talking about the full capacity crowd then
   as I have said the decision has been and worked on two
   previous occasions to find its level. If we are talking
   about an expected crowd at a league match, which is limited,
   then there is liaison and assistance between the Club and
   the Stewards regarding which sectors would be utilised and
   therefore there is some control of the filling of those
   terraces.

q   .         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Does there come a point, you
        have said several times that you rely upon the filling
        to find its level, but does there come a point at which
        Police surveillance would have to judge whether that had
        been successful or whether a dangerous situation was
        arising? - A. I think sir that is absolutely right.

Q. Is there any specific order to that effect? - A. No sir.
   The control box is situated in such a position that it
   can see very clearly all aspects of the ground.   In
   addition the cameras are generally on that particular
   area because it is usually the visitors' area and we
   watch that, but if that problem was seen, and as I can
   say from my experience it has not arisen, but had it
   arisen then I would as Commander ,or Mr. Murray as the
   Controlling Operator would have reacted to it.

           MR. COLLINS:    „ ,      , _       . . _ ^
        Q. forgive me, Mr. Mole, and I appreciate that we must be
           careful not to approach this with hindsight, but I would
           have thought that it was obviously foreseeable that if
           you took no steps whether by stewarding or by Police action
           to control the distribution of those pens, you might get
           overcrowding in the central pens particularly as you have
           agreed that people tend to like to go behind the goals?
    B      - A. That has happened before sir.   It has been my
           experience I have not had the problem.   I cannot comment
           further than that.

        Q. Well did you not think about it? - A. Of course, but I
           have not had the problem and I would have reacted to it
           had the problem arisen.

        Q. So what you are saying is because the problem had not
           arisen you did not take any steps to counter it in case
           it did arise? - A. I think that is not correct, sir.
           What I have said is I have Officers available for deploy­
           ment.  The flexibility of the plan caters for that and they
           can be deployed if I perceive a problem.

        Q. Can I ask you to look at page 20 of Document 11 please,
    D      To put this in context this is Appendix C which deals
           with the duties of Officers at the ground.  Perhaps we
           should start, just to put in context on page 19. You
           see this is an Appendix headed "Individual Briefing" -
           A. Yes sir.

        Q. And deals with what individual Officers should be told
           in various posts, points on the ground? - A. Yes.

        Q.   (b) at the bottom of page 19 is dealing with Officers
             other than on the playing area track.  Do you see that?
             - A. Yes sir.

        Q. Can I ask you to go over the page and look at vii towards
             the bottom.   It says this:

                   "Officers engaged on duties in the stands
                   and terraced areas will take up positions
                   at the rear of the crowds using any raised
                   or otherwise advantageous positions which
                   might be provided or available.  Passageways
                   in these areas will be kept clear and the
                   the necessary advice and support given to
                   stewards".

             A. Yes sir.

        Q. Now that surely presupposes that there will be an Officer
           present at the back of the terraces to help direct fans
           to the right parts? - A. As I have said, sir, I interpret
           that Officers available in the tunnels which they are
    H      deployed to within the orders sir.
                          23

                                      B.L. MOLE



Q. But there weren't any Officers deployed on your order to
   the tunnel? - A. At Phase 2 sir.

Q. Mo,   not Phase 2, Phase 1 which is when people are coning
   in?   - A. The Officers on those serials are at the back of
   the   terraces at the turnstiles, that is on the inside of
   the   turnstiles and that is where they are deployed.

Q. I see.   But what is your understanding of vii, Hr. Mole,
   which on the face of it would appear to indicate that you
   ought to post Officers at the back of the terraces to
   help the Stewards to direct, inter alia to direct people
   to fill up the terraces evenly because that is one of the
   steward'.s duties? - A. My understanding of that is the
   Officers are deployed to the rear of those areas and in
   fact do direct as a matter of course people to the various
   locations but they are not actually stood on the terraces.
   That is my understanding of that paragraph.

Q.   "Officers engaged on duties in the stands and terraced
     areas will take up positions at the rear of the crowds
     using any raised or otherwise advantageous positions
     which might be provided or available". - A. That is
     correct sir, and when they are deployed to those terraces
     that is the position they take up, but in Phase 1 of
     the order   their duties is at the turnstiles for public
     order searching and property and advising and directing.
     When Phase 2 operates at-the match they take up advan­
     tageous points at the rear of the terraces.

Q. But of course unlike the league matches, as we have
   indicated, there were no Officers deployed on any duty
   in relation to filling of the terraces, were there? - A.
   I think I    have made that point sir.

Q. One small  thing I ought just to have elicited.   The 1937
   final was on a Sunday? - A. It was sir, yes.

Q. In fact kick-off was due at 12 but delayed till 12.15?
   - A. That is correct, sir.

Q. That, I suppose, avoided to some extent the drink problem?
   - A. It did sir.

Q. Because of course the pubs don't open till 12 and I think
   even now it is slightly more' difficult, well can you get
   off licence drinks on a Sunday morning? - A. No, same
   licensing hours.

Q. Same licensing hours as pubs? - A. Yes.

Q. I think that is really all I need ask you about the
   planning because I appreciate you were not involved
   directly with the events of the 15th of April last.

           You told us that you were transferred on the 27th
     of March and therefore of course you were aware that your
                            24


                                         B.L.   2I0LI




      successor, C h i 2f Superintendent Duckinfield was going to
      have to take over the policing of this event? - A. That is
      correct sir, yes.

   Q. And although things had gone in your view well in 1933
      there was always a potential problem with a full house
      and large numbers of supporters coming in from far afield
**    from outside Sheffield? - A. I think whenever you have
      54,000 people congregating together there is always
      p ot e n t i a l .

    Q. In effect Hr. Duckinfield was being thrown in at the deep
       end, was he not? - A. I think his experience of policing
       football is wide.  Certainly I think he had not policed
       a semi-final but certainly policed crowds in large numbers.

    Q. Had he -policed Hillsborough before? - A. He had policed
       Hillsborough when he was there in a different rank sir.

    Q. What rank? - A. I believe my recollection is as Chief
       Inspector and Inspector.

]) Q. So he had never been in the position of having as it were
      a overview of the operation? - A. I would be guessing if
      I said he had or h a d not but I don't think he had ever
      been in command of the operation at Hillsborough but
      certainly Sheffield United he had and at other major
      events in the town sir.

    Q. And you no doubt then briefed him in some detail about
       the problems that he might anticipate? - A. I did sir, yes.

    Q. Did you go around the ground with him? - A. No sir,
       Mr. Duckinfield has a knowledge of the ground having
       worked there in the past, as I have said.

    Q. So there was no as it were   walk round which you considered
       necessary? - A. No sir, in   fact I called him to a meeting
       prior to my departure with   the rest of the people involved
       in the planning and he was   present  at that prior to his
       promotion.

    Q. That was a meeting on the 22nd of March? - A. That is
       correct sir.

    Q. This was a meeting with as it were your sub-Commanders?
       - A. Yes and other interested parties.     I received noti­
       fication of the match on the 20th of March and conscious
       of my move on the 27th I called an urgent meeting for
       the 22nd which involved all the sector Commanders that
       I selected to support Mr. Duckinfield together with
       people like the transport, British Rail; Officers in the
       Central Division who w o ul d be affected by the influx of
       people and the Traffic Division etc.

    Q. That was your last direct concern I think with the planning
       of this operation? - A. That is correct, sir.

    Q. You then handed over completely to Mr. Duckinfield? - A.
       I did sir.

    Q. Were you responsible for the decision about manpower levels
       or was that Mr. Duckinfield? - A. Manpower levels I
B      addressed before I left and asked Mr. Murray, Chief Inspector
       Beale and Inspector Sewell who are in fact the Planning
       Team, to look at the manpower levels bearing in mind my
       comments of yesterday that some Officers were underemployed
       to see if there was any need for any increases or reductions
       and to determine the manpower level commensurate with, what
       v/as anticipated on the intelligence that was to be available,

    0. Yes, but who decided on the actual levels, you or
       Mr. Duckinfield? - A. The final number would be decided
       by Mr. Duckinfield when he arrived but I put them into
       the plan to ask the questions.

    Q. What I am getting at is this:   did your plan before you
       left include as it were your view of the right numbers,
D      of course leaving it to Mr. Duckinfield if he wanted, or
       did you leave it to Mr. Duckinfield to fill in the figures
       as he thought right? - A.   In fact it was left to the team
       to look at the, the Planning Team that I have referred to,
       bearing in mind my plan and the experience of under­
       employment last year ana Mr. Duckinfield then made the
       final decision so far as manpower was concerned.

    Q. Did you discuss directly with Mr. Duckinfield the manpower
       position? - A. No sir, it was probably commented on at my
       meeting of the 22nd when he was present.

    0 . So effectively you left it to your subordinates to fill
        Mr. Duckinfield in, as it were? - A. Yes, the same Planning
        Team was used in 1988 and the Planning Team was again used
        in 1989.

    0. Now I want to come now to  purely factual matters,    your
       involvement on the day in question.

              I think you had no role to play in the operation
       and were doing or policing your own Division in Barnsley
       on .that Saturday? - A. I was indeed sir, yes.

    Q. You were on duty were you that afternoon? - A. I v/as on
       well 24 hour cover on the Saturday, yes.

    Q. I_tiiink you were first aware of problems by hearing a
       message or hearing a broadcast on the local radio at
       about about half-past-3 when you were on the motorway?
       - A. Yes, I was on the Ml and I heard t h e ® was- a pitch
       invasion delaying   the progress of the match.

        Q. As you continued to listen and drove on did it become
           apparent it was more serious than had first been supposed?
           - A. That is right.  I was surprised in point: of fact
           because the first message v/as clearly a mere delay and
           pitch invasion which was a nuisance value.   That v/as the
           message coming over, but it gradually drew the picture
            of being a more serious problem.
    B
        Q. I think eventually when you realised there were possible
           deaths and appeals being made for doctors and so on, for
           Police Officers to respond, you yourself I believe went
           to the Hammerton Road Police Station and arrived there
           about 20-past-4? - A. That is correct sir, yes.

        Q. Did vou go to the ground or just to the Police Station?
           - A." I went to the Police Station and immediately contacts
           Mr. Duckinfield in the Control Box to see if there v/as
           any assistance I could give him at that time.    I spoke
           to" him and obtainedcertain action he wanted doing and I
           then spoke to and deployed a number of Officers who had
           responded to Hammerton Road Police Station and deployed .
           them into the area around the Sheffield Wednesday Football
           Club .
    D
        Q. And effectively you did all you could to be of assistance
           to Mr. Duckinfield at that stage? - A. I did sir and then
           I went to the ground arriving in Leppincs Lane.

        Q. What time did you get to the ground? - A. My perception
            of time is somewhat difficult.  I know for a fact I was
          / there by 5 o'clock.  Whether it v/as five or ten minutes
            before that I could not be certain.

                                             B.L. MOLE




    Q.   And by this time most oc the supporters I imagine had left
         the ground.       A. I was surprised to find large numbers in
         Lepoings Lane who were clearly somewhat aggressive towards
         the Police for whatever reason, and I must say at that
         stage I didn't know the enormity of the situation.    I had
g        been told there had been a few deaths, and it wasn't until
         I turned in to. the south lane at the back of Leppngs Lane
         leading down to the South Stand I found the bodies of
         eleven people in a pen at that location and was tola there
         were a further seventy plus in the gymnasium.

     . This is something which is going to crop up in a number oc
       Police Officers' statements.  You talked about: hostility of
       the fans towards the Police.  It was clear, was it not,
       that there was a general attitude of blaming the Police Eor
       what had happened?  - A. There was sir, yes.

    Q.   I am not sayng it was justified or not, simply that it
         existed.  - A. Certainly there was agression towards me
         and other Officers in the area and I ’
                                              w asn't at that tine
         aware of the reasons or feelings of the individual? that
D        was being expressed.

    Q. Of course.  I think you found when you got into the ground
       that it was obvious that Superintendents Marshall and
       Murray were very distressed.  - A.   They were extremely
       distressed.

    Q./Was Mr. Jackson still there?    -   A. Mr. Jackson, Mr.
      ■ Duckinfield, together with Mr. Murray and Mr. Marshall and
        the controllers were in the control box and they were
        having a conversation at that time, but there was a lot oc
        traffic on the air, disorder, fighting taking place in and
        around the stadium, and in fact Mr. Jackson, Mr.
        Duckinfield and Mr. Marshall left at about 5.15 and I was
        asked to take over operations at the location.

    Q.   And you I think effectively went round your men to see what
         the position was and to if as necessary organise the
         mortuary and so o n . - A. That is correct.   All the action
         had been taken by Mr. Duckinfield and Mr. Jackson that
         needed to be implemented at that stage.    They went to
         update the Chief Constable.  I immediately sought Sector
         Commanders' update reports to see what the situation in
         public order terms was outside the ground.   There were
         clearly some problems which would persist and I ensured
         that Tango Units remained on duty together with horses and
         other Officers in strategic locations to maintain public
         order.  The stadium had cleared and I went to the gymnasium
         to see that the mortuary facilities were in hand.

    Q. There was inevitably soma degree of confusion still was
       there not?  - A.   There was sir yes.
              28                   B.L. MOLE




At one stags I thin'< you spoke to Mr. Mackrsll the Club
Secretary.  - A.    Yes.  I had done the rounds.  I had been
over to the Police side, seen the Police Officers, many of
whom were distressed, went to the Club and found many of
the Club Members who were distressed and clearly ball boys
in particular had been badly affectd.   I spoke to Mr.
Mackrell and.advised him that he might need medical
attention ana counselling for his staff.   He thanked me for
that and said he would put that in hand.

I think he told you that the computer print-outs regarding
the turnstile figures at three o'clock had been put in a
safe place.  - A. Yes.   I can't remember whether it was
'safe' or 'drawer' but he had got it somewhere to show what
the figure was at the three o'clock time.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Because that really wouldn't
relate to all those who came in through the gate.   - A.
All that would show sir was those who had passed through
the turnstile.

     MR. COLLIN’S:  Sir we have   those figures, as you
probably appreciate but that is   not for this Officer to
deal with that:

I don't think it really will help this Inquiry to take you
through the rest of your statement dealing with what
happened thereafter.  We have all got it in front of us and
if anyone does consider something that needs to be brought
out 06 course it can be done.  - A. Thank you.

     MR. GLASGOW:   Sir most of my friends have asked that
I go out of order on this occasion.   There is a particular
reason for it.  We have prepared a bundle of documents
during the course of yesterday, and I think out of courtesy
to those who have not had the opportunity of seeing them it
would be better if they were introduced to this Officer by
me so that they don't take them by surprise.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I am quite prepared to follow
any course you agree.

      MR. GLASGOW:   Sir we took the liberty, of course with
my ‘friends' permission of letting Chief Superintendent Mole
have those documents   overnight.  I hope that was all
right, because many of them are his letters and it seemed
more courteous to allow him to read them -at his own home
rather than be shown them for the first time today.
Could I provide you with copies.   (Produced) If I could
just explain what we have done, sir.   We have been through
the files, the entirety of them     at the Club and we have
extracted all those letters and documents which haven't
found their way into somebody else's bundle, and we have
                                        B.L. MOLE




put them all together as the Club's bundle.   Most of them
will not need to be referred to but we thought it more
helpful if they were put in as one collection with an index
at the front so you can have an idea of what they refer to,
although I hasten to add that the vast majority of them are
matters of record such as the entirety of the minutes and
the stewards' ’tickets which appear at the back, and we
certainly won't need to refer to them.

              Cross-examined by HR. GLASGOW:

Chief Superintendent Mole I think you have had an
opportunity of seeing the bundle we provided last night.
A. I looked through it last night sir, yes.

And you obviously know that there are differences between
the Club and the Police as to what may have been breakdowns
of communications on t h e .day in question. - A. I under­
stand that is probably the case.

Before we get to those differences which I would like to
face with you Mr. Mole, the officers oc the Club have asked
me publicly to express their gratitude to you personally
for what they had believed was your very efficient and
helpful way in which you co-operated with them over many
years when you were responsible.  - A. Thank you sir.

And I would like it to be understood by you and by
everybody else that the criticisms that we do feel we have
to make do not in any way detract from the sincerity of
that gratitude to you personally.  -   A. Thank you sir.

Is it true to.say Chief Superintendent that your view is
that the key to proper policing in the situation that we are
talking about lies in communication and understanding
between the Club and the Force.  - A. I think that is a
very important aspect sir, yes.

And by proper policing you, as the Officer who was
responsible until very recently, were attempting to strike a
balance between containment and control on the one hand and
freedom of movement and means of escape on the other.  - A.
Yes sir.

And it is fair to say from the outset is it not that those
two concepts are at first glance fundamentally inconsistent
with one another.  -  A. I think there is an overlap yes.

And facing it bluntly,  whenever there is violence and
pitch invasions there tends to be criticism from well
meaning and other quarters that the Police and/or the Club
have allowed people to escape.  - A. Yes sir.

Q.   You have experience of that?   - A. Yes sir.

Q.   And whenever somebody gats hurt or tragically killed as a
     result of being contained for too long, thera is equally
     vociferous criticism in precisely the opposite direction.
     -   A. Yes.

Q. Can I first attempt to break it down into the number of
   areas.  I would lixe first to deal if I may with your
   liaison over the years with the Club - if I can use that
   horrible word'. - A. Yes.

Q.   You liaised with the three recent Secretaries   of the Club,
     Mr. England, Mr Chester and Mr. Mackrell.       A. I did sir,
     yes.

Q.   And would it be fair to say of all those   three men,
     including the two who have retired, that   you found them
     throughout your time to be co-operative,   professional and
     reliable.  -  A. I think that would be a   fair assessment
     sir, yes.

Q.   It happens to be the casa I think that you got on with
     them all personally.     A. I think on a personal vein I
     got on with them all and particularly in recent times with
     Mr. Mackrell.

Q.   Buc that personal goodwill did not prevent you on both
     sides of the fence so to speak, from expressing your views
     when you thought things were going wrong?  - A. That is
     correct sir.

Q. And let me deal specifically with Mr. Mackrell unless the
   history takes me to somebody elsa.  On the occasions when he
   believed that something had gone wrong with Police tactics
   and Police control he told you so very bluntly?  - A.   I
   respected that and appreciated it.

Q. And when you thought there was something that the Club could
   or should have done you told Mr. Mackrell.  - A. Yes sir.

Q. Could we look at an example of that in the bundle that you
   have got.   Would you go to page 16 first of all.  - A.
   Yes sir.

Q. This was in fact one of the historical occasions on which
   Mr.. Chester had written to you about an incident which had
   occurred in 1986.   - A. Yes sir.

Q. And the letter is vary short.  He said that following the
   West Ham/United fixture, which had been on the 12th of
   March about which he had telephoned you, he would be
   obliged if you could arranga that thera would be no future

             repeat of: the situations concerning your Officers relevant
             to the closing of the elevated standing area of Leppings
             Lane.  - A. Yes sir.

    Q. And a minor matter concerning some problem with the
B      cameraman.  - A. Yes.

    Q.       And what had happened was that your Officers had, until a
             late stage, closed off that area of the terracing in the
             belief that the crowd could be better policad if they were
             contained in a slightly smaller area of the terracing.
             A. That is correct sir, yes.

    Q.       And despite the fact that this had been discussed amicably
             over the telephone the Club -Secretary, in accordance with
             the practice that had then developed and was afterwards
             continued, recorded the matter in writing so that you could
             b o t h see what was done.
                                     ~    ^ mu-u
                                        - A. That ;
                                                  is    -- - sir, yes
                                                   - correct

             And you replied both promptly and courteously on page 17,
             on the 26th March, setting out in the second paragraph of
D            your letter personally addressed to Mr. Chester what had
             led to the confusion and the reasons why what had been dons
             was dons.  - A. Yes sir.

    Q.       Perhaps we should look at it in its entirety,   just that
             paragraph Mr. Mole.  You said:

                        "In dealing with the situation regarding
E                       the elevated standing arsa on Leppings
                        Lane I can only repeat my earlier comments


             that refers to the telephone conversation I think.      -   A.
             Yes .

    q    .              "That there was confusion regarding the
                        use of this area on that occasion and
                        that the Ground Commander saw fit not to
                        open it initially but subsequently on my
                        instruction did so.  I can only add that
                        it is not my intention to regularly close
                        the elevated standing area and that as
                        agreed in the past either I or John Freeman
                        would discuss the position prior to a match
G                       and if there was such an intention then you
                        would be informed accordingly."

             -   A. Yes, that is right.

    Q. May I extract the following points from that, and I use
       that just as an example.  If you were going to control
       movement on the terraces you would invariably personally
                                           B .L. MOLE




discuss that with the Club Secretary before the match at
the time when you were considering your decision?  - A.
That is right, sir.  That harps back to what I said earlier,
that there are occasions when I only utilise part of the
terrace and I would tell them of that intention.

But whatever your intentions may have been, and however much
it might have been discussed, that in no way detracted from
the right of the Ground Commander to vary the decision if
the need arose.  - A. That is right sir, yes.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Does this mean that really you
saw it as being the responsibility of the Police as to
which part of the terracing was being used?   - A. This
stems back to use of the ground at league matches when in
fact to maintain segregation between those individuals in
the West Stand and the home supporters in the North it is
good practice to keep sterile the area of the elevated
section, and when we are expecting a large crowd on a match
then to take the corner on the plan there and keep it empty
provides a natural barrier to stop stone-throwing and
aggression between the   North and the South.

I quite   understand the rationale, but I'm only asking about
division of responsibility between Police and Club.   You
saw it as being the Police decision as to whether you as
you say   render an area sterile or not.  - A. I   would put
that to   the Club as my intention to police that  safely and
free from public disorder.

And if there was a disagreement?      -   A. There has not been,
sir.

No but if   there   wera, would you give or would they?    - A.
I think I   would   probably have to give unless I felt    that I
had to refer to     legislation with a view to seeking a   ban on
the match   going   forward because I could not maintain   public
order.

     MR. GLASGOW:   And as you understood the matter Mr.
Mole that was something which was done not only in
accordance with the wishes of, but as controlled by, the
local authority.  - A. Yes.

That when you had advised the installation of radial fences
the local authority had agreed to that installation
provided that the gates in them were under Police control.
   A. The gates at the front of the perimeter track.

And at the back.     -   A. I am not aware of that point sir.

We will come to it in the documentation.  I wonder whether
that pre-dated'.your involvement. - A. Probably sir.
                                         B.L. MOLE




But it is in fact right isn't it that the gates along the
back which enable spread if people behave  sensibly, those
gates are in fact locked back at the start of matches.
A. They are sir, yes.

And the Police have the keys.   -   A. The Police have keys
and stewards have keys.

And the Officer responsible for that section of the ground
will always walx through there and ensure that they are
locked back before the match starts.  - A. One of the
Inspector's duties is to do that and I think on this
occasion Inspector White carried out that function.

And lest there is any confusion about it perhaps we should
look at the photographs together.     Would you mind taking
composite 2 which is one of the little blue bundles withou
a label on the outside.    If you look at the very first
photograph there was understandable doubt expressed
yesterday as to whether or not the gate under the word
"timber"  was open or closed.   I don't know whether you
heard that or not.   - A. I didn't sir.

But if you go through the bundle with me, approximately
half way through to photograph PR17A I think we see a
clearer view of that gate which, to be fair to Chief
Inspector White, it is quite clear that it was locked open
   A. It  was sir.

I should   say that it is clear it is open,'we can't   see the
lock. -     A. Y e s .

And returning to your letter at page 17 you were there
referring to the discussions which you had as to your
reasons for wanting to preserve a sterile area firstly.
A. Yes sir.

Secondly the reasons why despite apparent confusion the
Ground Commander had saw fit to change that on the day.       -
A. Yes sir.

And thirdly, your right which I accept as the Commanding
Officer, to over-ride his decision.  - A. That is right
sir.-

On the ground.   -   A. Yes.

And it is right is it not, and indeed it was your
experience, that the Commanding Officer on the ground
should have a direct control over what was being done by
his Officers as to the use of areas of the ground.  - A.
Yes. sir.
                                             B.L. MOLE




Could we look at another example, and again I won't go
through them all of course but I would li.te to see that
that wasn't an isolated occasion.  Go on to page 29 would
you?  By now we have come to Mr. Mackrell's period of
office.  This is the 11th February 1987 and again in wholly
courteous and co-operative terms you had written to him
making a suggestion about the use of the West Stand by
season ticket holders.  - A. I had sir, yes.

And in keeping consistent with your desire to keep that
area for visitors what you were saying to him, very co­
operatively, was "Will you see to it that affectivly home
people are moved out of that and relocated elsewhere"?
A. Yes.   I think I commented yesterday a lot oc ticket
holders were allocated annual tickets for that area and
persisted in that which created segregation problems for
US   •
And again within the week you got a one sentence courteous
compliance with that from Mr. Mackrell.  -   A. I did sir.

           "Dear Brian, I acknowledge and agree with
           what you say."

It is on the next page.           As usual your requirement would be
putting it too high, but your suggestion as to ground
a l l o c a t i o n was immediately complied with. -  A. It was sir,
yes .

Could I next ask your    help with   the question of the
training of stewards,    because that too is an area where you
nave co-operated over    the years   very closely with theClub
and the stewards.  -     A. Yes.

At the beginning of every season you have had Officers at
the ground to assist with a full training session of
stewards.  - A. Yes sir.   My fifth Inspector, as I
referred to earlier, Mr. Sewell was on the planning team or
in fact Mr. Cowler prior to him regularly attended and
assisted with the training sessions.

And there was nothing vague or casual about this.  This was
sat up very formally at high level in advance of the
meeting.   - A. It was sir, yes.

The Secretaries, all three of them in turn, had the
practice of writing to you, telling you what they wanted to
do on that evening, you would reply, the meeting would be
set uo and then you would have a debriefing afterwards.
A. That is correct sir.

Perhaps again we could look at one example, page 23 of this
bundle.  This was again Mr. Chester writing to you I think
                                35

           - I'm sorry it is you writing to Mr. Chester.  Is        your
           signature at the bottom?  - A. It is sir, yes.

        Q. This is the 3rd July 1986 and what you were there saying,
           as appears from the letter, is that you were referring to
           the visit that he had made with the proposal for the
    B      meeting at the start of the new season and setting out a
           series of matters, nine in all, of what was going to be
           discussed.  - A. That is correct sir, yes.

Q. Have you seen the video? - A. I have,      sir, yes.

Q. Have you seen the whole lot or have you just seen the
   compilation? - A. I have seen the compilation which has been
   prepared by this Inquiry, sir.

Q. You are aware then that at 2.47 or 2.48 there was an
   accidental, if I may call it that, entry? - A. I think that
   was an ejection, as I understand it.

Q.    It started as an ejection,   but it led to an unfortunate rush?
      - A . Yes.

Q. And coincidentally, it actually corresponded in time almost
   precisely with Mr. Marshall's request for the gate to be
   opened. - A. I see, sir, yes.

Q.     You have seen that, I call it a rush, the  first entry of
      people, certainly less controlled than what occurred 5 minutes
      later? - A. Yes.   As I recall I think the mounted men retook
      the situation.

Q. Clearly what I am calling accidental and not an unintended
   inrush of people? - A. Yes.

Q.    That is something that has to be avoided if atall possible,
      though? - A . I would agree, sir.

Q.     Again, it is a matter to be regretted that somebody chose to
       override the Standing Orders for ejection.   Is that not the
     , case? - A. If that is the case, sir, yes.

Q.    Well, Chief Superintendent, you are very   loyal, but we know
      perfectly well it was the case, don't we, because Standing
      Orders specifically require there should be no ejection
      without proper processing? - A. I am not sure this was withe
      proper processing.  It would depend where he was taking him
      to.  That is a comment I am making.   I don't know he was
      ejecting him and leaving him or did he take him with him.     I
      am not aware of that information.

Q.    If, as we understand the position to be, that people were
      simply - I d o n ’t use the word emotively - thrown out as
      distinct from taken out through that gate, that was in clear
      breach of the Standing Order that anybody to be ejected shouic
      be taken to the Police room and processed and then ejected
      formally through the gate at the far end? - A. Not knowing the
      circumstances of this I may well, having looked at this with
      hindsight, have taken the same decision, because one of the
      problems of dealing with ejections or arrest is that you lose
      Officers, and probably in the circumstances they were facing
      we c o u l d 'not .afford to lose Officers. When I say "lose them",
      I mean taking them with a prisoner, escorting them to the
      Police room, processing them, and as an Officer commanding I
      would have said, in your words, sir, "Throw him out", and have
      taken the consequences, to maintain my Officers in the
      situation I needed.

                                                     B.L. MOLE



Q. But Chief Superintendent, throw him out through a gate
   against which there were hundreds of crowd pressing on the
   outside which Officers could not control? - A. Yes, sir.
   I don't mean that, sir.  What I am saying I was addressing
   the problem of failing to comply with Standing Orders and
   dealing with the ejection.  I would merely say there would
   be occasion when I would do that.  I think the gate we are
   talking about.was not under pressure at that time, but
   probably with hindsight it was not a good gate in any case
   to utilise for that matter.

Q.   It must have been under pressure because you yourself have
     seen what happened when it was opened? - A. C gate?

q . Yes. - A. My recollection is that C gate was not under
    pressure, that B gate was under pressure, and that zhe fans
    who ran round or took advantage of the opening of C gate would
    come from the back of those turnstiles between the perimeter
    and A-G gates, sir.  That is my viewing of the tape.   I was
    not there.

O. But did you not see on the tape that at 2.47 or 2.48 what
   happens is that the Police attempt to push one man out and in
   fact scores of people, if not hundreds, push in? - A. That is
   correct.  I don't think the gate was under pressure in my
   recollection.  I would have to look at the video again.

G. We can deal with that on the film then.  Thank you for your
   help.  Can we now move on to the terraces.  The position is
   that on league matches the filling of the pens is something
   which is physically controlled by Police Officers in those
   pens? - A. The agreement to utilise certain sections and pens
   is a decision we take, yes.

Q.   I am sorry.           Does that vary from what I said? What I put to
     you simply was that the filling of the pens is physically
     c o n t r o l l e d by Police Officers in those pens? - A. Insofar as
     we d o n ’t in fact put people separately into an area, we would
     determine which pens were to be utilised, bearing mind
     intelligence of how many were coming.           It is difficult to
     allow the whole terrace to be used if you are only going to
     have 200 supporters.           So we ^ould probably say we would use
     the centre pen only, lock the gates and Officers would direct
     people to the centre pen.

Q. And you entirely accept in your experience it is the Officers
   who do the directing? - A. In those circumstances, yes.

Q. Because without being rude or offensive to anybody, the people
   who are heading for the terraces are very unlikely to pay. much
   regard to stewards attempting to show them where to go, are
   they? - A. I think they pay very little regard to the
   stewards.

Q. The realities of the position are that the stewards have
   enouEh difficulty getting people to allocated seats, and it
                               45

                                                      B.L. MOLE


         would be quite impossible for them to direct people into
         standing areas? - A. I think when you say "impossible", if we
         were to address the quality of stewards is another aspect, but
         in general terms with what is available on the day they do
         have considerable difficulty, and I doubt whether that
         individual or those individuals would take notice, and they co
         have difficulty even to get them to sit in the stands.
B
    Q. What I have difficulty with and what I frankly do not
       understand, Chief Superintendent, is why is it any differenn
       on a Semi-Final day from a league game? - A. Because I think :
       expressed earlier this morning that we have no control of the
       area we are using for segregation.  It is merely a  ma-czer of
       saying the whole area because it is a ticket sell out is to be
       utilised and will find its own level.

    Q.   It is almost like turning the terrace on its stand and filling
         it with water and let it overflow as it goes along.    Is that
         what you are saying? - A. The general attitude is they head
         for the middle one first to get the      best position. Once tna~
         is full they ease out to the sides, yes.

    Q. And they simply ease through, I think there are two metre
D      gates at the back? - A. I think many go round the north and
       south tunnels as it were to the locarions they are heading
       for.       They don't all enter, or my experience is they don't all.
       enter by the centre tunnel.        There are a lot of honest to
       goodness common sense people who approach it in that manner
       and know that they are going to go to the north or souzn
       t u n n e l . and I think you can see that on some of the video
       where people are drifting either side as well as cenrral.

    0 . We were told by one experienced football supporter that the
        design of having access round the sides of the stand for the
        ends of the terraces was something thar was quite normal anc
        to be expected.   Would you agree with that? - A. I would
        accept that, yes.

    Q. Despite the fact that the signs for it at this ground at thi~
       time were nothing like as clear as the signs for the tunnel? -
       A. That is right, sir.

    Q. But you do accept, do you not, particularly on this day, it
       would have been wholly unreasonable to expect any Sheffield
       Wednesday steward to be on that terrace attempting to control
       those fans? - A. I would think that is fair comment, sir.

    Q.    And whether between the two of us we have worked out the right
         solution or whether we are to be criticised, the fact remains
         that on this day there was nobody there controlling it? - A. I
         am alleged to believe so, sir.    I was not there.

    Q.   I know you were not, but you are the most senior person of
         experience I have to ask the question. - A. Quite.
H   Q.    And if that is the position   we have to face candidly  the fact
         that it was unsatisfactory,    do we not? - A. I think with
                            46


                                                    B.L. MOLE


     hindsight of what has happened that is a question we will have
     to address, and I agree with what you say.

Q. Forgive me.  Is it really only hindsight?  Even if you had
   seen that situation from the Police control box on that day
   you would have regarded it as unsatisfactory, would you not? -
   A. I think if I had seen something which activated my mind on
   that day, and I can only say if it activated my mind, that
   there was something to do with the terraces that required
   attention, I would have hopefully reacted to i t . I would have
   had to see the problem first of all.

0.   But you did say, Mr. Mole, that in the past the crowd had
     simply found its own level? - A. In the last two years that
     they did exactly the same, and I had no difficulty.

0. But bluntly, that is simply not right, because taking the 19S3
   game alone the crowd did not find its own level.  It filled to
   the point of capacity and the Police closed the tunnel under
   your, very rightly. - A. I have no recollection of closing the
   tunnel in 1988.

0. Do you have a recollection of a serial going into the back of
   that stand in order to control it? - A. A serial going into
   the tunnel?

Q.   Yes? - A. A serial 14 or 15 are deployed to that location?

C.   Again, we will produce anything that helps.      What we have done
     is to go through all the photographs we had of the 1988 Semi-
     Final.   I wonder if you would at one you might be able to help
     us with.   (Photograph produ c e d ) I am sure no dispute will
     arise upon it but we can prove it if necessary. - A. None at
     ail.

G.   This is a photograph of the Semi-Final in 1988.         We see at the
     back - please just accept that from me at the moment - we see
     the tunnel at the back with what we can see of the Policemen’s
     helmets.      As you can see three heads away, or in racing terms
     3 -and-a-half heads away in the right-hand margin, we see the
     senior O f f i c e r ’s peak cap? - A. I can see a peak cap of an
     Officer.     I presume it is an Inspector in charge of that
     serial.

Q. At some time during the progress of that game which we can
   actually see being played, what looks like a serial has come
   down through the tunnel? - A. Serial 14 would normally be
   deployed at phase 2 to take up that position.  Serial 15 would
   take up a similar position in the north tunnel, and the
   reserve serial would take up a similar position in the south
   entrance to the pen.

Q.   Is it reasonable to assume, if you don't have any direct
     knowledge of what happened in 1988, that those men until they
     came to that position had been the serial which had closed the
     tunnel from the top? --A. My enquiries, and I have made many,
     I have seen photographs of the Inquiry, and I have no
                          47


                                                B.L. MOLE


     information of anyone putting a serial or barrier across that
     tunnel.  I certainly did not give instructions in 1988 for it
     as far as I recall, but that serial would, before moving to
     the tunnel, be activating at the rear of the turnstiles in the
     enclosure at the back.  If they had gone to that location
     ready to go down the tunnel at some phase that could have
     been interpreted as a serial, but I have no direct knowledge
     of a specific instruction.

Q. Would they be by and large the same Officers as were used for
   policing "league games? - A. Generally, yes.

Q. And is there a possibility for confusion here that those who
   had policed league games would know that that particular
   serial would be involved in actually filling pens in
   accordance with c o n t r o l ’s instructions? - A. The section of
   the Officer in charge of the area there is important, and I
   made the same selection there this year as last year, and it
   is he really who deploys 13, 14 and 15 for the duties in that
   location, and would be normally the same man at league matches
   as well.

0. Could we have a look at one example of an operational order
   for a league match.  Page 87 is the one we have managed to
   find for the Sheffield Wednesday-Oueen’s Park Rangers game,
   2nd May, 1987.  It is right to say it was your practice to let
   Mr. Mackrell to have a copy of the operational order so he
   knew what was going on? - A. Yes.

Q. Would you agree it is rather a good idea the club should have
  ■ the operational order, not so they would interfere but so the
    would-know the way in which the policing is being controlled:
    - A. I believe that is the correct way.

Q.   Is it within your knowledge they were not given the
     operational order this year for the first time? - A. That is
     not within my knowledge.

Q. Could we go specifically to the details for each section and
   just go to page 98.     I hope it is just clear at the bottom
   right-hand corner.     You see the way in which the detail that
   polices phase 1 at a league game behaves.     Serial 6, this is.
   We d o n ’t have the Officer's name on the left-hand side.  Their
   functions before the match are, in the terms of the order:

         '"To maintain order, to ensure pens are filled in
          accordance with instructions from control;  occupancy of
          pens by away-home fans will be given at briefing".

     - A. Yes.  This is when the end was used by both home and
     visiting supporters.

Q. So during the filling up process at least one serial of 11 men
   in all is physically in the pen controlling their filling? -
   A. They are filling the pen for segregation to that pen which
   has been selected, and at page 1 it says they will be in the
i cmit*h n(=n on l.pDDines Lane terrace and Dart of the West. Stand.
                                  48


                                                         B.L. MOLE


            So they fill the south pen.

    Q.      Is there any conceivable reason why the same process should
            not be controlled by the Police during a Semi-Final? - A. In
            1987 and 1988 I found the same practice was followed, that it
            filled and maintained its level and spread out, and I did not
            find any need to alter that system.
B   0. If that is right, Chief Superintendent, it is an alarming fact
       alone that you are hearing for the first time today that that
       did not happen because somebody, your Officers were among
       them, had to close the tunnel without you even knowing that
       had been necessary? - A. I d o n ’t accept that. sir. I don't
       think that is correct.  The enquiries I have made suggest that
       is not correct.

    Q.      I see.  What you are disputing is the accuracy of people’s
            recollection of seeing Police involved in closing the tunnel?

    Q.          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    You are saying nobody closed off
            the tunnel in 1988? - A. I am aware of that suggestion, and I
            have made enquiries and can find no conformation of that.    I
            certainly have no recollection, and those Officers who were
D           present have no .recollection of it.

    q   .        MR. GLASGOW:   Again, I am sorry, I have to put it on the
            hypothetical basis, and I accept that you dispute the basis of
            fact upon which the question is put.  The fact remains if that
            evidence is reliable and acceptable and that Police did close
            the tunnel, it does, putting it bluntly, make a nonsense of
            the suggestion that the pens filled themselves and found their
            level without supervision, does not it? - A. It does, if that
            is correct.




                                          /Q. Your own experience.




H
 Your own experience had been of previous years that in
 your words "people don't directly head for the tunnel"
 when they cone through the turnstile, they have time
 to walk around and find their own way in? - A. That is
 correct sir, yes.

 Of course you would accept that they certainly do head
 directly for the tunnel if Gate C is opened under pressure?
 - A. I think if Gate C is opened under pressure that is
 the first thing they see.

 And it is  for that reason that it is essential that
 people inside know when that gate is going to be opened?
 - A. I would think that is a course of action which should
 be followed sir.

 Those were the matters I wanted your help with on terracing;
 Chief Superintendent, thank you.  Just a few natters cn the
 general relationship.

       In addition to. all the other material that you get
 in advance of a game, when there is a semi-final do you
 actually get a copy of the F.A. arrangements for that
 game? - A. Not usually, no.    I think I have received
 subsequently from Graham Z-lackrell a copy, or seen a letter
 by him.   In fact there is something in this file which
 reminds me.   They do a leaflet.

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   What do mean by the "F.A.
 arrangements"?

       MR. GLASGOW:   Could we go to page 125.

       TH3 WITNESS:  If that is in real terras a blue leaflet
 I have seen that document.

       MR. GLASGOW:  Do they let you have it in advance
 of the game? - A. No.

 Again simply as a matter for the future, would it be helpful
 if the F.A. did let the Police responsible for policing the
ground have their own arrangements for semi-finals? - A. I
 am sorry, sir, could you repeat that?

 Would it be helpful in the future if the F.A. were to send
 the -Police a copy of their own match arrangements? - A.
 I think any information that is available to us is useful,
 yes.

_ What I wanted to know particularly, since much has been made
  of entertainment, whether you knew that in fact there was.
  a plan to have the usual and I think successful Super Skills
  Competition on the field on this day? - A. I did not know
  that but I know that I spoke to Graham Mackrell and said
  were we having some entertainment because I find it most
  important.
                                 50

                                             B.L. MOLE



         You satisfied yourself there was going to be pre-match
         entertainment? - A. I had posed the question and that v/as
         the answer that was given to me but whether it happened
         I d o n ’t know.

         We find it on page 128, if you want it from the booklet,
         that the Soccer Star Team, where they are there saying
B        in the pre-arranged publicity the Press Department of
         the Football Association is going to contact the Staging
         Club separately regarding Soccer Star demonstration prior
         to the match? - A. Yes sir.

    Q.   All you are able   to say is that y o u .knew there had bean
         entertainment of   this kind laid on in previous years? -
c        A. Yes indeed in
         Mackreli that it
                            1S38 and I recall mentioning to Graham
                            is useful to have entertainment to
         encourage people   into the stadium in good time.

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I am sorry, Mr. Glasgow, are
         vcu saying that there was or there v/as not entertainment
         this year pre-match?

D              MR. GLASGOW:  It v/as programmed and advertised but
         unfortunately not held.   That is I think one of the issues
         between the Football Association and ourselves.

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I suppose from the point of
         view of people turning up for it the fact that it v/as not
         held would not matter.

               MR. GLASGOW:  That is precisely the matter, sir, that
         it was advertised as being there and discussed, as we know,
         but regrettably it was cancelled after the publicity.

               The reason for raising it, sir, is that you perfectly
         understandablyasked a question of one . witness:   "Was there
         any when you got there?" and not surprisingly the indignant
         answer was "No, there'v/as just the records".    There should
         have been.

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Thank you very much.

    Q.
               MR. GLASGOW:  There is one other matter I think,
         Mr. Mole, on previous occasions you have had to delay a
         kick-off I think only once? - A . Only once sir, yes.

    Q.
         I don't know whether it is a fair question and if it isn't
         then you will simply have to say so, but knowing what you
         now know of the problems that v/ere being experienced at
         about auarter-to-3 on this day, would you have postponed
         this kick-off? - A. I must say I have addressed this question
         to myself.    Without being in the position of having an over­
         view of what was taking place not onlyoutside the ground but
         also in the ground, I cannot give, you a definitive answer.
H        All I can say is it would be a serious consideration in my
         rjiind and my mind would be affected as much by what v/as taking
                                  51


                                              B.L. MOLE



     place inside; the fact that I had a tremendous amount of
     people already inside who themselves wculd be disappointed
     and might cause public disorder inside as a consequence
     of my decision, and really and truly I would have to be
     stood facing the question for me to give an answer as to
     whether or not it would be delayed, but I would seriously
     have to consider it.

Q. It is of course a Police decision, isn't it, nobody else
   could interfere with it? - A. It is indeed.

Q.   And     similarly if  there is any question of changing kick-
     off time in advance of the match, that toe is a matter
     for Police? - A. It is a matter we would raise, yes.

Q.   And    on occasions   in   the past when you have suggested that
     the kick-off be advanced for any reason, quite often till
     12 o'clock, the Club has always accepted ycur judgment on
     that and advanced the kick-off time? -' A. Vie may have had
     argument and discussion but in general they have always
     accepted my advice on that footing.

           Mi1
             ,. GLASGOW:         Thank you very much, Chief Superintenden

           THE W I T N E S S :   Thank you, sir.


                          Cross-Z:;amined by HR. K I N G :

0.   Chief Superintendent on the decision as to postponing the
     kick-off which you have just mentioned, it should not
     depend on the reason why the people have arrived outside
     in such huge numbers, the decision whether or not to
     postpone, should it? - A. I don't think so sir, no.

Q.   That is quite irrelevant? - A. I think that is the case,         ye-
     sir.

Q. Had you in fact had any predetermined arrangements as to
   the circumstances in which a kick-off would be delayed?
   - A. In general this would be a matter of discussion
   between me and my Sector Commanders sometime prior to
   any major event on policy decisions and really it would
   have to be on the circumstances facing me at the time both
   inside and outside the stadium and down to my decision,
   not one of my Sector C o m m a n d e r s , it is purely a policy
   decision for me to make at that time.

Q. But, the mere fact that you in that position formed a view
   that the reason for these people arriving v/as their own
   decision and it v/as their own fault for arriving late,
   that could not possibly be a reason for saying:    "Well
   I am not going to postpone the kick-off"? - A. It is not
   a final reason, it is a consideration of attitude but
   clearly it is not one that would stop me delaying the match.
                              52

                                           B.L. MOLE



    O. In fact you would be quite wrong     to if there .v/asa dangerous
       situation outside wouldn't it to   let  that affect your mind?
       - A. As in isolation I would, yes.

    Q. Mov/ can I turn to   the considerations given to the flov; at
       the turnstiles? -    A. Yes sir.

B   Q. Were you yourself aware of the particular capacities of
       the different .sections of the ground? - A. I v/as sir, yes.

    Q. You would know therefore that the Leppings Lane had 10,100
       for terraces? - A. Yes.

    Q. And you were only allowing, if you only allow A-G, some
       seven turnstiles? - A. The allocation of turnstiles is a
       matter for the Club sir.   I don't allow the turnstiles.

    Q. But vou would be informed of that? - A. I v/as av/are of it.

    Q. '-joule you have an opportunity to consent on it? - A. I
        think there v/as little alternative to that arrangement.

    Q. But having acquired that knowledge, seven turnstiles fcr
D      10,100 people, v/hat conclusions were you able to draw as
        to the need for fans to arrive at any particular tine prior
        to the match? - A. I think the consideration would be I
        would want people to come as early as possible £nd therefore
        olan for the opening of turnstiles at 12 o'clock which gives
        a three hour rate before kick-off to encourage people througi
        the media to come because in the last hour on reasonable
        assessment I could expect to accommodate something like
        7 ,000 .

    Q. It would not only be a good thing for them to arrive early,
       it would be crucial on those figures, wouldn't it? - A.
       They should arrive early and in fact that v/as the case the
       previous year and the year before that.

    Q. Just let me put these matters to you and see if you agree
       with me.

             If you took your optimum figure, which is far greater
       than the Green Code, of 1,000 per hour, that is 500 per
       turnstile in the last half-hour? - A. On those figures, yes.

    Q. That'means that the most, on an optimum situation which
       those turnstiles could cope with, A-G in thelast half-hour
       would be some 3,500 fans? - A. Yes sir.

    Q. That means that even if you had a perfect situation because
       1,000 really requires quite good conditions, doesn't it?
       - A. Well that is the advice given- by the Club sir and I
       respond to it.

H   Q. You  have got to have well over a half having arrived before
       2.30 if you are going to cope with the remainder? - A.
                                  53

                                              B.L. MOLE



    Q. But that is what you need,       isn't it? - A. Yes sir.

    Q. Isn't it unrealistic to expect in every game that over
       half will have arrived by 2.30? - A. I think you cannot
       compare this type of game w ith every game because the
       crowd is so different in size.

B   q   .         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  On this type of game? - A.
            On this type of game I think it is realistic to expect
            them to arrive and they have done so and shown that
            willingness in the past.

    q   .         MR. KIIJG: But they are advised on their ticket, we
            know, to arrive when? - A. I now know.  I was told yesterd

    Q.Did you not know? - A. I didn't.

    Q. Had you ever looked at the ticket before the game? - A. I'lo
       sir.

    Q. Would you accept that advice to arrive 15 minutes before
       v/as who lly unhelpful? - A. I don't think that is helpful
       at all, sir.
D
    Q.      Far from that it would be quite a burden, it would be
            impossible if everyone took that advice, wouldn't it?
            - A. On those figures absolutely right.

    Q. It must also be the case that if you don't get 500 per hcu
       of course the situation is even worse? - A. Obviously,
       500 per half-hour.

    Q.      500 per half-hour, yes.  If one took the Green Code figure
            of 750 per hour that is a mere 37 5 per half-hour, that
            means that you could get in no more than2S25 people in
            the last half-hour? - A. I accept those figures, sir.

    Q       Which makes the situation even worse.    You have got tc
            have about 7 5% o f the fans having arrived by 2.30.  Now
            did you have any contingency plans available for the
            possibility that that huge majority of people did not
            arrive by 2.30? - A. Yes, the plans are made that if in
            fact you are lef t with a large number you have that one
            facility we have talked about of delay.    You also have
            the question of those without tickets which we have
            had addressed to me here, and there were contingency
            plans to deal wi th those after kick-off.

    Q.      What I am really referring to is the contingency that
            people quite legitimately with tickets arriving perhaps
            in accordance with the back of the ticket, arriving say
            at 2.30.  What were those contingency plans to deal with
            the possibility that you could not possibly get all those
            people through in the half-hour? - A. The contingency
H           plan is if you are faced with that situation you would
                          54

                                       B.L. K



   have to consider a delay and give then time to enter the
   stadium if disorder v/as to be avoided.

Q. Is that   the sole plan? - A. Yes sir.

Q. Are you av/are of the Green Code in paragraph         46 which says
   this and I read it to you:

         "Contingency plans should be made to deal with
         situations where the available entrances at a
         ground have proved insufficient to stop unduly
         large crowds front gathering outside".

   A. That   is a direction to the Club,    I    think sir.

Q. Are you   aware of it? - A. Yes.

Q. Uere you av/are whether the Club had such contingency plans?
   - A. No sir, I think as I have given in my evidence I~
   offer the facility and they have to satisfy the F.A. that
   they can stage it.

Q. Have you got it in front of you? - A. Page 20, yes.

Q. Could I just read to you the whole of that paragraph, well
   not the whole but the next sentence on. '

         "Contingency plans should be made to deal with
         situations where the available entrances at
         a ground have proved insufficient to stop undulv
         large crowds from gathering outside.  This may
         for example include opening additional entrances
         of local knowledge of the ground, crowd patterns
         and advice from the Police should be taken into
         account in drawing up contingency plans".

   Do you see that paragraph? - A. Yes,         just read it, yes.

Q. As far as you are av/are had the Club drawn up any contingency
   plans to deal with the possibility that with only half-an-
   hour to go the huge majority of fans had not arrived? -
   A. Not that I am aware of sir.

Can I ask this point now please.  You have your serials
outside, whose duty it is to help filter that crowd
through the turnstiles.  - A. Yes.

You told us yesterday that they were under the control not
of Insoector Marshall but of Mr. Grievson who was inside
the ground.  - A. Superintendent Greenwood is a
Ground Commander, Superintendent Marshall the outside
Commander.  Those Serials, 15, 17, 18 and 19 form part of
the Ground Command Serials.

So they would be under the control of who?   -   A. Mr.
Grenwood.

How would they communicate with Mr. Greenwood outside the
ground?  - A. By radio sir.

Do they all have radios?   -  A. The two Inspectors, Sykes
and Purdy and the four serial sergeants would all have
radios.

And what about the foot Police Officers.  - A. No sir,
except those Officers who are in normal day life Community
Constables who in fact have,a personal issue of a radio who
would have that with them, but in match teems they would no
be issued with a radio except down to Sergeant level.

Would their instructions be that IE in difficulty they
would communicate therefore with Superintendent Greenwood
inside the ground?  - A. No, Ground Control sir.

And where is that?  - A. That is the Police Box in the
corner where he is showing now.

And Police Control would then receive that communication
and deal with it as they thought fit?  - A. Yes, but the
method of operation is on talk-through facility so both Mr.
Greenwood and Mr. Marshall, and in fact Mr. Chapman the
other Sector Commander would also hear that communication.

If there was to be a communication from say Superintendent
Marshall to inside the ground about a decision to open up
gates how would he go about making that communication?
A. He could make that direct to Ground Control or he could
have tal.<-through facility, which as I understand v/as on in
any case, which is the normal system of operation through
to Mr. Greenwood.

So there would be no problem about that communication?
A. Providing radio facilities were correct.
                                          B.L. MOLE




What, as far as you are aware, are the facilities of the
Control Box to communicate with the Ground Officers who are
emoloyed by the Club.  In other words the stewards and the
Club officials?  - A. They have their own personal radio
system of which a piece of their equipment, ie. the radio
transmitter, is in Police control.

So would there be any difficulty in a communication passing
from the Police to the Club officials as to the imminent
opening of a gate for example?  - A. Subject to airspace
there should be no difficulty, airspace not being used at
the time by someone else.

Can I ask you about the capacity of the individual pens and
the consideration given to the filling of those.  - A. Yes
sir.
If I understand your evidence, your evidence is that you
didn'c. regard that as a Police function at all.  - A. In
general terms it is a function of the stewards employed by
the Club to fill the pens.   It is not a Police function.
If we recognise a potential disorder situation through that
filling we would have to take some action.

Were you aware   ....

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I am not following this because
as I understood it you were saying that the filling of the
oens at a league game was a PjDlice responsibility, that a
filling of the pens at a semi-final in your experience was
a self-filling exercise which nobody was responsible as I
understand it except on the fans themselves.   - A. I think
the dilemma we face, sir, is that so far as Sheffield
Wednesday is concerned, because of the use of that end by
mixed supporters we have taken on the role of segregation
which has been determining a pen to utilise and have fed
them physically into that pen so that I can maintain
segregation.  So in that role we have taken on the role of
stewarding to achieve segregation.   In the semi-final
situation the whole terrace is available and my experience
is we have had no function in filling it except to observe
it if there is a danger of public disorder.

As I "under: stand it you are also saying the stewards don't
either.    -   A.  And they have not - they operate on the
entrances outside to point people but not actually
physically packing them.

     MR. KING:     Sir I don 11 know whether this bundle of
ohotographs, which I have marked 'South Yorkshire Police
Document*'l 1 is before everybody.   It is a helpful bundle:

Would you turn to photograph 28 please.    -   A. Yes sir.
                                           B.L. MOLE




     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     That is not a composite album.

    MR. KING:     That is not a composite album sir.

     MR. WOODWARD:   Sir it should have accompanied the
background material and it is Document 1.  It is referred
to in the index.

     MR. KING:   Photograph 28 shows pens 3 and 4 and it
shows the tunnel in the middle.  - A. Yes.

And it shows that boundary wall which is on your right hand
side as you enter the tunnel if you were going into pen 3,
at the top of the picture.  - A. Oh yes.

The gate that you say people would naturally flow through
is at the very back oc pen 3 isn't it.  - A. The one at
the top of the fence, yes.

When you enter you in fact don't enter level  with the back
oc the pen, you enter a good few steps down the pen don't
you.  -  A. Yes you do, sir.

So in order to filter through that gate, ifyouknow it
exists, you have got to make a positive decision to make a
sharp turn to go to the back.   -  A. That is correct.

As an experienced Officer I welcome your view on this.
Would you really say that that was an easy method without
any other help for fans to realise they could filter
through that way?  - A. I think the vast majority of fans
attend on a regular basis and know this is a similar system
across the country and they react to that accordingly.

Why are you entitled - you may be, but why are you entitled
to make that assumption?  - A. I don't make an assumption,
sir, I believe from people I have spoken to concerning that
kind of facility that that is a similar situation.

The fans   naturally want to congregate in the area behind
the goal   don't they? - A. Generally yes.

We can see from a lot of the other photographs which we
have seen that it is not a long time before even the back
of the pen is filled up.  - A. That is right sir, yes.

And that is the very passageway along which you are
expecting and assuming people will filter.     A. I know
people do do it sir.

Through a crowded pathway.  - A. It depends on the density
of the crowd.  If they can't get then they know the pen is
full.

    Q.    Thsy know which pen is full?     -   A.   The one they are trying
         to get into, sir.

    Q.   I don't want to labour an obvious point, I just want to make
         sure I understand you.  You are saying that if in fact the
B         fans who enter down that tunnel found they couldn't make
         their way acrpss pan 3 towards pen 2 the reason for that
         would be they would know that pen 2 was full.    - A. No
         sir.  What I am saying is you are saying if people come to
         the tunnel end and can't achieve a move to the right then
         clearly the pen must be full.

    Q.   How do they get into pen 2?       -   A.   Go back out, sir.

    Q.   Go back where? -   A. Out, sir.

    Q.   Down the tunnel.   -   A. Sack to the tunnel.

    Q. What it they have got lots of people behind them?  -                 A. If
       that is the situation they are facing then they have
       dieficulty.
D
    Q. what is the correct and easy way to get into pen 2?              -     A.
       By the side, the South tunnel.

    Q.    B y the South tunnel? - A.  It is not a tunnel it is              the
         side of a building, side oc the West.

    Q.    You gave evidence before  that you thought the signing was
         unsatisfactory.   - A. Yes I did sir.

    Q.   It goes a bit beyond that doesn't if Officer?  When you
         enter gates A and G you can see obviously standing over the
         tunnel in huge letters can't you?  - A. Yes sir.

    Q.   Is there any signing at all to direct you first to the left
         through that gate in the wall?  - A. Not that I can recall
         sir .

    Q.   It isn't there that the signing is unsatisfactory, there is
         no signing at all.  -  A. What I have said thi-s morning I
         can only repeat again.  I have not found a difficulty with
         it.  With hindsight I think you are right, it is not
         satisfactory.

    Q. Let us not deal with hindsight at the moment Officer, deal
       with somebody who is looking at an empty ground, with
       comtnonsense, you would expect commonsense would dictate a
       sign directing you to the left wouldn't you?      A. I can't
       change, my viewpoint, sir.  What I have said is it has not
       activated my mind before, and having now looked at it I
       agree with you.
H
                                              B.L. MOLE




It isn't simply unsatisfactory, it is highly dangerous
isn't it?  - A. You ara not going to put words in my
mouth, sir, that is the answer I can give.

So be it.   Let me deal with another mattar.    The filling of
thosa individual pens is obviously of importance isn't it
in crowd control, whether they are full to capacity or not?
   A. You a r a 'talking about the semi-final match?

Any match.    -   A. Yes,    the filling of the pens, yes.

It is not simply a matter for the Club, the Police also
need to be aware, don't they, as to whether or not one
particular part of the ground is becoming dangerously over­
full.    - A. I would expect that the Officer in command and
the Ground Commander would be looking at that on a regular
bas is .

You hava agreed with me that apart from that little gate
between pens 4 and 5 or 3 and 2 really they are self-
contained pens aran't they?  - A. Yes sir.

Are you personally aware, wera you aware, of the individual
caoacity of those pens?  - A. I know that the two pens we
ara looking at there's a thousand and twelve hundred.

Do you know what that bears to the total capacity of the
Leopings Lane tarraca?   - A. 10,100 is the total capacity,
and"you ara just putting twelve hundred in thera yes.
There's 3,70 0 in the elevated section.

The central pens contain no more than about just over
twenty per cent of the total capacity?   - A. If that is
the percentage sir, yes I agree with you.

It is not a difficult calculation.  Those are the areas to
which naturally fans direct themselves.  - A.   Yas sir, in
the first instance.

In the first instance.  It contains a very small proportion,
just over a tenth of the total capacity of the terrace.
The figures speak for themselvas.  - A. Yas sir.

    - MR. COLLINS:     One    fifth.

     MR. KING:   A fifth, I beg your pardon.          - A. As   I
say wa are talking about twenty per cent.

Did it not turn your mind to the need to ensure close
observation of the filling of the individual pens?  Did
that cross your mind?  - A. I do, when I have operated
there, watch the pens.  I do walk on the perimeter track
                                           B.L. MOLE




and look at the osns and if I perceived a problem I would
react to it.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   If you saw that the middle two
pens were very crowded and that the two wedges in the
corner were fairly lightly populated, what would you do?
Open the gates and move some out or what?  - A.
Operationally - I hava not faced the situation but ....

I mean pre-match.  - A. Facing what you say I would do
what was suggested earlier this morning.  I may wall have
closed the tunnel with our serial Officers and I may then
direct to the wings.

     MR. KING:   I am interested in the planning stage
because again just looking at those pens one surely can
foresee the danger that the two central pens may fill much
more quickly than the outer pens.   That must be
foreseeable without even having any match experience.
A. They do fill before the others, yes.

There may not hava been any but what system existed, as far
as you are aware, for the acquisition of knowledge as to
how full those central pens were becoming?   - A. The
actual centre pens knowledge is not known in real figure
terms.   The only figure I hava, and I used to have access
to by visiting Mr. Mackrell's office on a regular basis, is
the number of people overall on the terraces which would
tell me, and comtnonsense would dictate if that overall
figure was five thousand and it was all in the cantre, I
would know that I had got five thousand in the centre
roughly.

But apart from that observation t’
                                 n re was no system as far
as you are aware of the acquiring precise knowledge as to
how full the central pens were becoming?    -   A. No sir.

It wouldn't be very difficult would it to have for example
Police Officers on duty within the terraces to keep an eye
on the numbers?   - A. I don't think that would achieve
anything sir.   The Police Box is in a position to observe
that number and they can sea and react to any developing
situation.

Are you saying that the Police Box in your view is in as
good a position as someone on the terraces to assess
whether or not the central pens were becoming over-full?
A. A better position.

May I just ask you about one aspect oc the terraces.   If
you look at photograph 27 in the same bundle I referred to
you before, the South Yorkshire Police Document 1.   Do you

         see that acea, perhaps      it is a no man's area, between 4 and
         5.  - A. Yes sir.

    Q. There is a relatively narrow pathway.

B             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:           4 and 6.

              MR. KING:       4 and 6 yes:

    Q.   You sea that?    -    A. Yes sir.

                                                      B.L. MOLE


     Q. May I turn to the 1981 incident, and again may I make the .
        comment I expect you in your capacity of Chief Superintendent
        to be aware of all these matters.  It may be personally you
        are not aware.  If we look at Tab 4 we see the minutes for the
        debriefing of the FA Cup Semi-Final between Tottenham Hotspur
        and Wolverhampton Wanderers? - A. Yes, sir.

B    Q. Before we look at it in detail we will have before us
        minutes of dozens of meetings.    We have letters passing
        between the club, the FA and yourselves, but is it right to
        say that never once have there been any discussions between
        representatives of the 54.000 who were eventually going to
        go* into Hillsborough some 8 years later? - A. In what
        format, sir?

     Q.   In 1981 there was an incident which led to the crushing of
          people at the Leppings Lane end.  We will hear about
          recommendations, some followed, some not,
          disagreements.  We will hear about discussions that
          went on between the Police and very many people. At
          the end of the day 95 people were crushed to death
          in pens that nobody was stewarding.

D              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Was that a question?  I am sorry..
          Mr. Jackson.  It is not a question.  Would you mind putting a
          Question.

     q.        MR. JACKSON.-  Is it right at no time have there been a:
          discussions with anybody representing the customer? - A. I
          have had no discussions with the people you are referring to

     Q. And at the end of the day, 8 years after the first crushing .
        Hillsborough, 95 people were crushed to death, were they not
        simply by overcrowding, not by wilful disobedience of Police
        Officers, stewards or the crowd themselves, simply by
        overcrowding? - A. I cannot agree with that statement, sir.

     Q. Would you like to give me any other reason other than
        overcrowding? - A. I am not in possession of all the facts.
        It would be wrong of me to say that the outcome of this
        Inquiry was the fact that overcrowding caused those deaths.        I
        have not got that information to hand, sir.

     Q.   If it were overcrowding would you not feel it is a very
          unfortunate situation that these pens were packed - I use that
          in a loading sense - by the fans themselves, and no-one seemed
          to be supervising the loading of these two pens? - A. I think
          there is always, as I have tried to explain this morning, a
          monitoring of that aspect.  It did work well last year and the
          year before.  I am unable to comment further than what I have
          already said, sir.

     Q. Chief Superintendent, forgive me if I d o n ’t leave it there.
        As I understand it in answer to my Lord's questions, you
JJ      agreed that neither the Police nor t h e Sheffield Wednesday
        stewards were involved in the loading of those two pens? - A.
        I did, sir.

                                                    B.L. MOLE



Q. I therefore suggest again it is very unfortunate that people
   were crushed in pens that no-one supervised the packing? - A.
   I think I have responded to that, sir.

Q. May I go back to 1981,     the minutes of the meeting, Tab 4,
   third paragraph:

           "Mr. Gosling said it was his decision to remove
           spectators from the Leppings Lane end of the ground to
           the other side in order to ease a dangerous situation
           where series injuries or even fatalities were a real
           possibility.  He then read a letter of complaint :which
           contained an allegation that the Police herded more and
           more people into the Leppings Lane enclosure when it was
           obvious that it was full".

     An allegation, as it were, not against the Police in 19S9 but
     that it did happen, the same problem? - A. That is how that
     reads, yes.

Q. Next paragraph:

           "The chairman invited views on this point.
           Superintendent Chapman said that the entrances to
           Leppings Lane were controlled to ensure an even
           distribution of fans.      However, as the ground filled up
           the usual packing p r o b l e m s 'occurred” .

     Not a   new phenomenon.  "The usual packing problems” , which 8
     years   later were left to the fans to solve.  Is that fair,
     Chief   Superintendent? - A. It does not actually say who was
     doing   the packing, sir, or if anyone was doing the packing,
     and I   am not aware of that matter in 1981.

G.   I d o n ’t mind whether the Police were, Sheffield Wednesday
     were, or no-one was, that a problem with packing occurred in
     1981'is quite evident, is not it? - A. That is correct, sir.

q            "There was space in the centre enclosure, but fans
             refused to move over and fill it.  Police Officers were
             placed into the crowd to ensure the best use was made of
             the available sp ac e ” .

     - A. Y e s , s i r .

Q. That is exactly the situation you say now could not happen? -
   A. No, sir, I said if we had perceived a problem, and my
   information is a problem was not perceived, then we would
   take action.  You are recognising the fact a problem was
   perceived, and I have no evidence of that, sir.

q              "Chief Superintendent Herold pointed out that the
               problem was exacerbated by a series of incidents which
               culminated in the late arrival of a large number of
               fans” .
                                  71


                                                           B.L. MOLE


         It does not seem time has changed very much between 1981 and
         1989, does it, Chief Superintendent?   Fans late, no packing,
         crowd problems? - A. On those examples, sir, I would agree.

    Q. May I go further and perhaps in more detail.          The bottom of
       page 2:

B            "The discussion progressed to the construction of the
             Leppings .Lane enclosure.  Mr. Gosling felt it was
              inadequate and required more divisions so that spectators
              are not in such a solid mass.  He also felt that the
              limit of 10,100 was too high, although Superintendent
             Chapman disagreed with this".

         It would appear, would it not, that there was a body of
         opinion in 1931 that thought 10,100 was too high? - a. From
         that report, sir, yes.

    Q.   If we move on, I turn to Tab 5, 5th June, 1981,s a letter
         addressed to Mr. McGee, the Chairman of Sheffield Wednesday,
         under the heading:  "Our analysis of what" - I can't read the
         next word:

D            "The Leppings Lane end is not constructed to give maximur.
              aid to the packing and control of the crowd and the
              accepted crowd capacity is such that there is no safety
              margin” .

         - A. Yes,    sir.

    Q.   1981, packing mentioned again, but in 1989 it was thought fit
         to let the crowds pack themselves? - A. The results of 1981
         was the introduction of the radial fences.

    Q. Oh, yes, I am turning to that, a matter that would
       considerably, you may think, hamper the crowd's ability to
       pack itself.

              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        You mean,   to even itself out?

              MR.    JACKSON;   Indeed:

    Q. We can see documents if necessary.  When the radial fences
       were introduced there was a good deal of discussion, was there
       not, as to how high they should be, because at first it was
       considered the initial suggestions would lead to a fence that
       people could easily climb over? - A. There were those
       discussions, I would accept that.

    Q. Am I right in saying this, that one of the scourges of the
       football world in the 1970s and 1980s has been the wholly
       unacceptable element of hooliganism? - A. I think that is fair
       comment, sir.

    Q. It has had such an effect that the clubs are banned from
       Europe, we are now c o n s i d er in g 'identification cards, a
       fnnthaii fan is almost a term of abuse, and because of that,
                                          72


                                                                 B.L. MOLE


            quite properly and understandably, pens have been introduced.
            It is also right, is it not, that those pens are meant to
            control? - A. I would agree, sir.

    Q. And therefore the effect of putting the pens, the central pens
       in particular, into the Sheffield Wednesday, Leppings Lane
„      terraces, was to reduce the ability of the crowds to move
B      about? - A. One of the experiences I understand from 1931 was
       the difficulty with the sway, and that was introduced into
       considerations as to why radial fences should be introduced.

    Q. Chief Superintendent, may I totally accept that proper
       consideration was given to that and the resulting radial
       fences served a very important purpose? - A. Yes.

    0. But that purpose was crowd control, and had nothing to do
       with crowd safety, in that when the central pens became too
       crowded those fences made it more difficult to move to the
       side? - A. It does hamper the movement to the side, sir.

    Q. Would you turn,         please,      to Tab 6.   First of ail, the
       4th paragraph:
D                ”1 have informed Mr. England that our consensus view is
                 that 10,100 crowd figure specified in the safety
                 certificate is too h i g h ” .

            Moving down,   next p a r a g r a p h .-

                 "Mr. England has been acquainted with our view that the
                 Leppings Lane terracing should be sectioned vertically
                 front to back to produce pens to produce more accurate
                 crowd control and prevent sideways movement” .

            - A. Yes,   sir.

    Q. Specifically designed to prevent the sideways movement that
       would now allow the more safer packing? - A. No, sir, to
       prevent the sideways movement of sway creating pressure.

    Q.      It would appear, therefore, that solving   one problem, the
            swaying of the side, has created, we   now know, another?        -A..
            Very probably, sir.

    Q.           LORD JUSTICE T A Y L O R : That was not thought to be a
            problem at the Kop end, was it? - A.       No, sir.  We never
            experienced that with a wide mass on       the Kop end in the same
            way that the confined narrowness, the sway created pressure
            against the fence.

    Q. You mean the narrowness from back to front? - A. The
       narrowness from back to front.

    q   .       MR. JACKSON:   May I now move forward in time to Tab 8.
H           This again is a South Yorkshire Police document:

                 "Subiect:      Education of club stewards.
                                       73


                                                            B.L. MOLE

    A
                 You are both aware of ray feelings that club stewards at
                 Hillsborough often do less than they should, and are at
                 times not aware of our function and operation of our
                 respective roles.         I have cross swords with them
                 personally once or twice last season.         In an effort to
                 set things right in the coming season I have arranged
    B            those m e e t i n g s . They should be told very bluntly that
                 each of them should be aware of the location of their
                 respective fire p oi nt s ” ,

             and then other matters.

                  ”We should stress to the stewards that the admission of
                  spectators and the packing of those spectators at bigger
                  games on to the terracing is primarily their function
                  and not a Police o n e ” .

             It would appear, would it not, Chief Superintendent, that the
             packing of the terraces was a problem that was well known to
             the authorities, it was merely a question of who should act
             upon it? - A. I think in1 following the Green Guide which was
             then in existence and followed by the one in 1986, that
             responsibility was fairly laid at the stewards.

        Q. As I have indicated before, I am not seeking to blame
           Sheffield Wednesday stewards or the Officers under your
           control or you.  I am merely pointing out that it is quite
           clear that the packing of terraces was a problem well known t
           the authorities? - A. I would agree, sir.

    E   Q. There was a dispute as to who should try and solve it? - A. A
           I have said, there should not be a dis-pute, and the
           resolving and the requirement is where it has led.
«
        Q. By "dispute” , I mean you had one view, it may be the proper
           view, but the effect at the end of the day, no-one applied
           their minds to it in 1989? - A. I think in the manner which I
           have described and the method of dealing with the situation i
    F      as I outlined, that if we had seen a problem the reaction to
           that would have been as I described earlier.

        Q.   I thought you had passed it fairly and squarely and properly
             on to the club? - A. I think you will recall, sir, we were
             asked„.how I would deploy Officers if I had perceived  aproble
             which suggested there was overcrowding in the pen, and I
             reacted to that answer.

        Q. May I now move forward to Tab No. 9.       It is a minute of a
           meeting.

                  LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Can we do this at 2 o'clock?

                          (Afternoon Session)


           LOilD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Yes, Mr. Jackson?

O.         ?i r . JACKSON:  Chief Superintendent, before the
     short adjournment I asked you if you would glance at the
     minutes of a meeting held in 1935 which is at Tab 9 dated
     November 1935.     I am afraid I cannot be more accurate than
     that, and at paragraph 5 it indicates "Croud flow at the
     Leppincs Lane end of the S t ad i u m " .

           "The Police reported on the continuing problems
           caused by the merging of spectators from all
           parts of the stadium at the Leppings Lane end.
           It.was difficult to see how this could be
           overcome as the physical restraints to achieve
           this could conceivably be more of a danger than
           allowing the present condition to continue".

     A. Yes sir.

Q. I am right, am I not, that the closure of the twelve turn­
   stiles which were, I don't suggest there is anything
   suspicious about this, quite properly done for segregation
   purposes, would in fact add to the problems at Leppings
   Lane? - A. The meeting discussing that aspect was involving
   home supporters and visiting supporters cross-flowing from
   the north stand and west stand.  On this occasion they
   would all come out that way Liverpool.

Q. I accept that in this particular case when we now have
   the explanation that matter does not apply at all? - A. That
   is right, sir.

Q. Therefore m a y I turn to the choice of Hillsborough? - A. Yes.

Q. It is the position, is it not, that you were asked and quite
   fairly said, "I cannot police from the point of public
   order and public safety this semi-final unless the fans
   are distributed according to my plan"? - A. That is correct
   sir.

Q. That meant, did it not, that the football fans were faced
   with this position, that the fans of Liverpool would have
   an allocation some 25% less than their average gates and
   Nott in gh a m Forest would have something over 50% more than
   their average gate? - A. I am not aware of average gates
   but I would accept the figures.

Q. And in addition because of the segregation quite properly
   done on consideration of traffic flow, we had some rather
   odd figures, did we not?  It would mean that 21,000
                           75


                                       3.L. MOLE



   Nottingham Forest supporters would go through 40 turnstiles
   meaning that each turnstile should anticipate 522 people in a
   perfect world.  Of course you smile, those nearest to the
   end get the most work? - A. Yes.

Q. But it did m ean 40 turnstiles open for 21,000 people? -
   A. In fact I think they probably had 42, I think.   They
   used two of the twelve for the North Stand.

Q. I am obliged for that assistance,    something in the order
   of 500? - A. Yes.

O. Something approaching three times as m any were anticipated
   to be using the Loppings Lane, that is seven turnstiles
   10,000 people, approximately 1,443 people? - A. I accept
   the figures sir, yes.

Q. So this meant, did it not, that the flow through the
   Leppings Lane end would be at 3 times the rate through
   each turnstile   as the Spicn Kop? - A. Yes, not having the
   figures in front of me I am sure your mathematics is right,
   but I would accept that if that is the case.

Q. Chief Superintendent, they have been found wanting from
   the age of 11, but it is a fact that something in the order
   of three times   as many people? - A. It is.

Q. I must ask you   to consider just once again the observation
   drawn concerning the late arrival.    This is at Tab 11,
   the Standing Orders at page 7.   We don't need to go into
   all the background.   I think we can accept, can we not,
   that ticket touts, successful clubs, Liverpool's already
   request that they have more people and therefore they want
   more space, all would lead you to anticipate a large crowd?
   - A. I would expect a large crowd and I think they were
   allocated something in the region of nearly 25,000.

Q. We then concern ourselves with the flow, something like
   1500 people through each turnstile.  About two hours
   according to the suggestions but about an hour-and-a-half
   according to your understanding? - A. Yes.

Q. Has anyone actually done a test on the Leppings Lane turn­
   stiles as to how many people they can actually take through?
   - A. I am not aware of how m any they can. I know Mr. Hackrell
   at one stage ran a sampling as to what kind of percentage
   w e n t through during certain periods.

Q. I should ask this, Chief Superintendent:
   we have asked for the turnstile flow from 1939 and 1983.
   We understand they have been lost?

         MR. COLLINS:   We have got the turnstile figures I
   think in this bundle produced by Mr. Glasgow at pages
   166-167 and 168.   As 1 understand it, I will be corrected
   if I am wrong, those are the actual figures at 12 when the
                                   B.L. MOLE



turnstiles were opened and shortly after 3 when they were
closed, so those should record all who entered the ground
through the respective turnstiles.

      tin. JACKSOH:  As I say, Chief Superintendent, I have
been asking for these for a few days.   I have not seen
them.   I have not been able to assess and analyse them
but is this the position that let us say at 2.15 it would be
possible for those in authority to kno w how many people
were in the Leppings Lane end? - A. It would be possible
for those in authority to know how many people had officially
entered through the turnstiles in Leppings Lane end and that
would be available both in the video room and in the
Secretary's Office.

We can be certain that the figure may be more but not less?
- A. Yes.

And therefore by mathematics we would be able to work out
how m any people had gone through between 2 and,2.15 at a
full rate and therefore work out how many people we could
expect in by 3 o'clock? - A. I think that working out the
rate would be difficult as my understanding of the machinery
there is to obtain the print-out which is reflected in this
book,, you have to stop the machine. It is an ongoing running
otherv/ise and visually you could look at it at 2 o'clock
and look at it at 2.15 and note the variance but you would
not be able to run a print-out.

Perhaps Chief Superintendent I will leave that entirely
because your colleagues who follow you may be able to
answer any questions that arise after I have been able to
consider those figures. - A. Thank you sir.

Leaving the turnstiles completely and going on to the
natter I asked you about, Standing Order page 7 on traffic
flow and we may summarise it again:

      "At this time previous intelligence enquiries
      would have been of assistance to determine
      the number of visiting supporters expected
      and their mode of travel".

Well in this case that was easy,   25,000 from Liverpool? -
A. Yes sir.

Mode"of travel, very easy,   550 by train,   24,500 by road?
- A. Yes sir.

No problems.

      "Once known and identified arrangements should
      be made for their routeing and arrival at
      designated parking areas at a time shortly
      preceding kick-off.   This strategy of delayed
      arrival of visitors".

                                             5 • Li. MOijE



         ITow, Chief Superintendent, we have had over  the last few
         days the feeling that someone w a s saying the fans arrived
         too late ana for some reason they were at fault.   It is
         quite clear, isn't it, quite clear this was an understandable
         acceptable, tactical decision made by the Police? - A. That
         is not correct sir, no.

B j o. On this particular occasion it may not have been implemented
       but standing orders 'fetrategv of delayed arrival"? - A. Yes
       sir.  I read that as delayed in parcels, as it were, of
       numbers.  That is how I have interpreted that order.

    i.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Delayed what? - A. Delayed in
         packages, parcels, i.e. si:-: coaches I mentioned at Tankersley
         bring those through, save the ne::t si:-:, bring those through.,
         so you have a staggered natural flow which you can acconnodat
         into the ground, so there is a delayed arrival of those
         various sections so you don't get it all at once.

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Vie 11 it is the phrase "at a
         time shortly before 'tick-off1' which is the phrase, I think.

               MR. JACKSOiJ:   I do apologise sir.
)
               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    No,   that is quite all right.
         You carry on.

    ).         M R . JACKSOi:: Officer, in the light of your answer
         it is so obvious to anyone reading that document the
         phrase leaps out "shortly preceding kick-off".    That has
         got nothing to do vvith staggered arrivals, coaches.   It
         says:   "strategy of delayed arrival shortly before kick-
         off".  Understandably, stop crowd violence? - A. Yes sir.

    Q. So when we have this suggestion that you did not expect
       the fans to arrive late, at the Leppings Lane end they
       would have to be there using the turnstiles absolutely
       100% capacity from half-past-1 otherwise they would not
       get in? - A. A lot should have been there from 1 o'clock
       as I have indicated when the turnstiles v/ere open sir, yes.

    Q. And if at half-past-1 there was not the full capacity,
       the crowds were not going through as fast as they could,
       it would obviously suggest there may be a problem later
       on? - A. I think you would be able to pick that up if
       that was the case sir, yes.

    Q. Therefore I move to deployment of Officers.   We understand
       that these days people don't w ish to go by train? - A.
       That is the general trend sir.

    Q. I have no doubt that it is a deliberate policy of some
       young raen to avoid British Rail because they want to drink
       in pubs before the game.

            Q. I v;ant to ask you about Mr. and Mrs. Average and their
               two children.   If they go by train am I not correct that
               they are compelled, they are packed, as you said, and
               compelled to w alk into the ground in a crocodile and
               cannot make their own way there? - A. The answer to that
               is in general terms yes there are the exceptions that I
               have personally looked at, such things as individuals
        B      who may be disabled and have been filtered out and allowed
               to continue at the back of the crocodile at their own pace.
               That is the discretion that has been applied that generally
               the mass are taken en bloc.

            Q. Do you really think that in this day and age the thought
               of getting on the train in Liverpool at about 11 o'clock;
               travelling on British Rail with their renowned catering
               facilities; coming off the station to be packed by a Police
               Officer into a crocodile; to waLk to the ground by half-
               past-2; to stand there for three hours; to be walked back
               in the same crocodile back on to the same train and back
               to Liverpool by 7 o'clock, is an attractice proposition
               for the family supporter? - A. I think possibly not.

            Q. Do you now feel that perhaps there is a very good reason
        D      other than the desire for alcohol, why people do not go
               on football specials? - A. No sir, because my experience
               is that it is not the honest to goodness family supporter
               with families who attend on special trains and never have
               done.  The vast majority are the young who look for the
               cheap travel in poor conditions to get to the stadium
               as quickly and as fast as they can most directly.
        E   Q. M a y i now move to your deployment of Officers. We under­
               stand that some time by 2.15, any semblance of a queue
               at the Leppings Lane end had gone? - A. By 2.15 sir.

            Q. Everyone has spoken of arriving there, I have to strain
               to remember anyone who has given evidence of a queue at
               a l l ? - A. Well I look at the photographs and I see there
               is an assembly of people approaching the turnstiles on
               the footpath leading up to about 2.30.

            Q. I understand that six Police horses were sent or were due
               to be sent to the Station to control the crowd there?
               - A. That was in the plan sir, yes.

                                                                     ■&V V

                                                   B.L. MOLE




Q. You expected some 500 people?          -   A, I think the train
   was 450 to 500.

0. So that is something over one Police horse for 75 oeoole?
   - A. Yes.

Q. flow many Police horses were sent to assist in the formation
   of queues for the 23,000 going in at Leppings Lane end?
   A. The initial deployment six horses ware in situ and then
   are supplemented by the six that are with the train.

Q. So the train arrives something after two o'clock.  - A. I
   think it was just after two and arrived 2.08, 2.15 Leppings
   Lane.

Q. So you have got six for 450 and six at that stage for your
   expected 23,000.  - A. You have the same area to operate in.
   You can't operate with more than about fifteen horses in
   the area outside Leppings Lane.  That would not be safe.
   Those who are escorting the six horses from the station
   have all the facilities to maintain safety down that wide
   expanse of roadway.

Q. Officer when you look at the 23,000 people arriving they
   should have had, should they not, 44 Police Officers
   operating outside the turnstiles to assist in forming
   orderly queues.  - A. Four serials of a Sergeant and ten
   each, 44.

Q.   44 people.  When it became apparent that the 44 were not in
     control what message would be sent?  Saying, "We can't form
     orderly queues any more"?  - A. It is difficult for me to
     give evidence of this.  What I have looked at since I think
     you will find that there are far more than 44 due to the
     redeployment of officers naturally in the order who had
     come down with the escort.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Mr. Jackson I don't want to
     stop you but it is important to bear in mind that you will
     have an opportunity to ask the Officers who were actually
     in charge on the day.

         MR. J A C K S O N :   I am obliged sir:

Q. May I deal finally with your suggestion yesterday of the
   effect of the alcohol-free zone.  I understand there are
   places where a disagreeing voice leads to immediate
   expulsion, but we are not in the Cabinet, the position is
   this is it not, there is a strong body of opinion that says
   if you let people into a ground that has a bar you are going
   to have more control and less drunkenness than the reverse.
      A. I think I expressed a similar view yesterday.
                          /I,.;*:.

    . Q. The effect is it not, of the other view, is to causa people
         who wish to drink to stop some distance away from the
         ground and probably arrive late.    A. I think that too is
         a distinct possibility.

     Q. You in fact have special arrangements, your Tango Units that
        go out and about especially with that in mind.   - A. They
        are briefed to look at licensed premises on the periphery
        in those areas to see what the position is.

     Q. Can you tell me the number of arrests in the area in the
        previous year?  - A. If I say 23 I would probably be
        guessing but I think it was about 28 arrests.

     Q.   Are you aware of the figures for 1989?           -   A. No sic.

     Q.   Finally may I suggest this:   In 1987 we had the position
          where the crowd came from Leeds and Coventry and there was a
          mid-day kick-off.   -  A. That is correct sir, yes.

^    Q.   In 1988 there is evidence to say that the overcrowding in
D         the central section was prevented by a combination of
          stewards and Officers.  - A. I think I have commented I am
          not aware of that but I accept the statement has been made.

     Q. Would it be the position that those Officers should have,
        at the debriefing of 1988, said "We had to close off the
        central tunnel"?  -   A. As I said earlier, my understanding
        and enquiries revealed that that did not take place.   It
        has been said here but I have no knowledge of it.

     Q. Forgive me, it is entirely my fault.  Would you expect t'nt
        if it did occur that the Officers would at the debriefing
        say that they had been so deployed?  - A. I would expect
        that.

     Q.   Finally, you used the expression "self control" in respect
          of the fans and their movements.   I would like you to
          consider this position:   If you arrived at the ground at two
          o'clock you could well be expected to be desperately keen
          to be behind the goals.  - A. Yes.

     Q.   That is your phrase.  At about quarter to three you might
          find yourself a little crowded.   - A. Yes sir.

     Q.   If we were to look at the photographs we would see that
          was the position.  Would you agree there isn't a hope of
          those people moving to a different pen.  - A. I wouldn't
          agree that there's not a hope.  There is a hope.   They can
          go along the back and I believe that is possible ....

     Q. Those at the front?          -    A. I am sorry.

Q. Those at the front o£ the pens, those in early.  - A. I
   think they would have great difficulty in moving to another
   pan from the front.

Q. And I think we have already explored the position of those
   coming down the tunnel couldn't really be expected to turn
   round and go back.     A. I think they could and I think
   some did from enquiries I have looked at.

Q.   Officer we hadn't heard about gate B until this morning. If
     gate B there  had been opened by anyone am I right that all
     the fans would have run directly, if pouring through,
     towards the lass empty section on the pens 5, 6 and 7?

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Less full.

Q.        MR. JACKSON:     Less full.    -   A, Yes you are sir.

Q. Do you know if any consideration was given to          that? -   A.
   I don't know sir. I wasn't there on the day.

                    Cross-examined by MR. M U L L E R :

Q. May I ask you Superintendent some questions about the
   absence of Police Officers on the terraces.  - A. Yes.

Q.   Both by design and in fact in 1988.    Each of these pens has
     a designated capacity as you have told us, and that depends
     d oesn't it on the physical size of the pen and also the
     rate at which people can be evacuated in an emergency.
     A. That is correct sir.    It is calculated in accordance
     with the the Green Guide.

Q.   But the critical thing is that the capacity in terms of
     people standing a certain distance away from each other may
     not be the same as the capacity which is allowed in order
     to let people get out at a certain acceptable rate, do you
     follow me? - A. I think I follow you. I do not have an
     input into the assassing of the capacity so I have not
     really looked at the ....

Q.   But you are aware are you, or were aware that one of the
     important things was, when you are considering the density,
     is_the speed at which people in an emergency can be
     evacuated.  - A. Yes, I would be conscious of that.

Q. Because if the number of people in the pen exceeds the
   number that should be there you are obviously going to have
   problems in the case of an emergency.  - A. Yes sir.

Q. Can you help me about this:   you told us that the crowd in
   19 88 and your experience was it would find its own level.
   A. That is correct sir.
The crowd finding its own level, is that the same in fact
as the crowd reaching its designated capacity?  - A. I
think the two equate in that when those who had gone to
seek accommodation in the centre pens that they would wish
and find, that they are full and uncomfortable, levelled to
move into the side pens to find alternative accommodation.
That happened, in 1988.

But their comfort is not the only consideration.   One of
the considerations is the rate of evacuation in an
emergency.  - A. I doubt whether that is one of their
considerations.

In those circumstances   they are different.   -   A. That is
correct sir.

And so you could have a situation when you are basing
whether it is full or not entirely on whether or not they
are comfortable, whereas the reality is that they may be
comfortable but wouldn't be comfortable in the event of an
emergency.  - A. I think you misunderstand what I'm
saying.  We were talking about "they" finding their level,
and I talked about "them" being comfortable.  Not my
comparison and my understanding of "comfortable".   My
understanding would be a perception as to whether or not
that pen was full and needed some attention.  If it needed
attention I would have deployed Officers to give it
attention.

Can I just ask you this then.  As far as you were
concerned, your assessment as to whether   or not it was full,
in parenthesis, was entirely on a visual looking at it.
A . Absolutely s i r .

And that was from ground level or from Control?   - A. My
style of operation would be to look from   the front of it, to
work on the perimeter track, from the Police Box, from the
back of it, and also I would link that into the computer to
tell me exactly how many had come in altogether so I had
some idea as to how many were generally in the area.

Did you actually know what those pens would look like if
there were a thousand people in or twelve hundred people
in?  - A. Having policed there for seven years I have some
indication and perception, with some difficulty, of
identifying numbers that are in pens, but I would have some
idea but no categoric positive idea that that figure was
correct.

Your main criteria would be to look to see how much room
there is at the back.  - A. Basically.
                                         B.L. MOLE




Which you would accept doesn't necessarily give any
guidance as to how many people are in the pen.      A.   I
would accept that sir.

Can I understand this: generally speaking do you find it
easier to divert people from a pen so that it doesn't
become over-full, or easier to evacuate people from a pen
which has already become over-£ull?  - A. I find it easier,
when not knowing you have a capacity crowd, to start with a
small area, fill it, and then open another area, which is a
way of diversion, but that really is the only assistance I
could give in that.

Does it not present greater problems to evacuate people for
example from pen 3 when it is over-full than from
preventing people from going into pen 3 at all?   - A. It
does sir, yes.

And so it is very important to know in detail what is going
on on the ground in terms of packing in pen 3 and pen 4.
A. It is important to know what is going on on the ground
insofar as the capacity and how many people are in there and
it is not over capacity.

Do I understand from what you are saying that you can see
no advantage in having somebody on the ground in the pen
when it comes to the assessing of the pressure and the
degree of crowding that is existing?  - A. I have not
found the need to do that and at this present time I cannot
find an advantage in that.

We have heard much evidence in this Inquiry about people
who felt themselves to be under pressure while they were in
those pens, do you follow?  - A. Yes I do.

Yet at the same time there seems to be a lack of awareness
by the Police that that position existed.  - A. Yes sir I
accept that.

If that has got some basis it would tend to indicate
wouldn't it that being actually present in the pen has a
very clear advantage?  - A. It does sir but it also
detracts from my ability to deploy that Officer or Officers
from that location as I have said, but with hindsight,
having listened to what you have said, there could be a
benefit in feeling that pressure.

And of course as far as the pen was concerned, and the
gates in the pen at the back of the radial fences, they
were under your control.  - A. I think you will find that
both stewards and Police have common keys to all those
gates and the perimeter gates were clearly under our
control.
Perhaps I can invite you to have a look at your bundle,
that is to say the South Yorkshire bundle, at tab 7, the
minutes of the meeting of the 11th September 1981, which is
the minute which dealt with the approval of the radial
barriers in West Terrace.   Have you got that?  It is in tab
7.   I can't give you a page.  You will have to go on until
you come to Safety Of Sports Grounds Act 1975, Notes of
L4eeting for Officers Working Pparty.  Hava you got that?
A. Yes sir.

And if you look at the bottom of that page under paragraph 2
it refers to radial barriers on the West Terrace.  - A. Yes
sir.

You will see that it was agreed to have such barriers and
that 3 specifically states:

          "The new gates at the rear of the
          terrace also be under Police control."

   A. Yes sir.

Were you aware of that?   -   A. Yes sir.

So you were the people who were responsible for those
gates, not the stewards.  -  A. Our responsibility was to
determine whether they would be open or closed, that is
correct.

It goes beyond that doesn't it?  You have control of those
gates.  - A. Yes, bearing in mind we are talking of 1981
when we were implementing segregation on the terraces for
home and visiting supporters.   We were not dealing with a
situation whereby we had only visitors on that end.

Are you saying that at any time anything happened which
indicated to you that you were not to have any longer
control of those radial gates?  - A. The locking back
before game has always been the responsibility of the
Police since that time and I accept that.

That is only on aspect of controlling the gates.       -   A.
Yes it is.

Another aspect of controlling the gates of course is
ushering people through them.      A. I think yes I agree
with you.  You have to take in context the purpose of that
meeting, and that comment as I understand it is what I have
explained, that we have the control for segregation
purposes and will be responsible for the opening and
locking back of the g a t e s .

Q. Where you exhibited the Operational Order for Liverpool
   against Sheffield Wednesday? - A. On the 14th January.

0. And the same operational requirement is made at Tab 21, that
   which the Tribunal have seen, but for convenience I refer you
   to it.  It is on the 15th page of Tab 21, "Serial 9, Leppings
   Lane terraces", and it is about halfway through Tab 21. Serial
   9 is on the left-hand side.   It says: "Leppings Lane
   terraces", and- it is page 15 Tab 21.  The relevant order is:

         "Before the match maintain order, ensure pens are filled
         in accordance with instructions from control.  Occupancy
         of pens by away fans will be given at briefing".

     - A. That is correct,   sir.

Q. That is the normal order? - A. That is exactly as I have
   said, which pens are going to be used and how they are filled.

Q. But that order is the order which would apply for all the
   league matches being played at home? - A. If we were nor using
   the whole of the pens.

Q.   Is it the normal order? - A.    It i s , sir.

0. Do you give any warning to others, including the club, when
   you depart from that normal order? - A. In connection with
   specifics, we would discuss that with the club, i.e. the pens
   that are to be used, elevated section, parts of the West
   Stand, etc.  They would be told about that.

Q. Do you tell the club you will not be putting Policemen on the
   terraces? - A. If that was the case I would tell the club of
   any departure from an area they might expect Officers to
   normally be.

0. That takes me, please, to your standing instructions which are
   Tab 11, page 40, and the use of stewards. ,„From the background
   material which has been submitted it seems that 376 stewards
   were available? - A. That is my understanding, sir.

Q. Would you look, please, at page 40.  It is paragraph No. 3
   towards the bottom of the page, page AO Tab 11:

          "Stewards should be distributed throughout the ground in
          accordance with a detailed prearranged schedule agreed
          between the Police and management.  Their numbers and
          location should not be less than the minimum stated in
          the safety certificate" (that is 66) ’’and their duties
          may be divided into four main categories:

          Controlling or directing members of the public who are
          entering or leaving the ground;

          Patrolling the ground;

          Manning entrances,    exits and other strategic points,
                            93


                                                     B.L. MOLE


          particularly exit doors and gates which are not
          continuously open whilst the ground is in use;

          Undertaking specific duties relating to emergencies
          and evacuation procedures".

     In 1988 was there this prearranged detailed schedule? - A . As
     to the location of stewards?

Q.   Yes. - A. I cannot recall the schedule.  I know the
     arrangements were the same as the previous year and that frorr.
     the positioning of the stewards it was acceptable to me on my
     assessment of the match layout on that occasion.

                    Cross-Examined by MR.   DYSON:

Q. Chief Superintendent, I would like to ask you one or two
   questions on a different topic, namely the experience of your
   Authority in policing Semi-Finals.  Would you agree your
   Authority has very considerable experience of policing Cup
   Semi-Finals? - A. Yes.

Q.   It is a fact, is not it, that in the last 20 years
     Hillsborough has staged a Cup Serai-Final on 13 occasions,  a
     Were you aware of that? - A. No.    I certainly know in the las
     15 or so there have been 8 occasions.    I would accept that.

Q. And the practice seems to have developed over the last 20
   years in which Hillsborough has been the prime selection fcr
   one of the Semi-Finals, and Villa Park the prime selection    :
   the other? - A .' I think a lot has depended on the location
   the clubs who are to take part in proximity to the ground az
   Hillsborough, but generally they are probably one of the f i :
   selected.

Q. That is absolutely right.  Without going into too many deta
   over the last 20 years Hillsborough has hosted it 13 times
   Villa Park 12, and the next down is Highbury 4 and then the;:
   are a scattering of about 6 or 7 other grounds which have
   staged Semi-Finals over the last 20 years? - A. I would
   accept that.

Q. So it would follow from that that your Authority and the
   relevant Authority to Villa Park, which is West Midlands, I
   understand, have again far and away the most experience in
   Policing Semi-Finals? - A. I think that is fair comment.

Q. And it would also follow, one assumes, that Sheffield
   Wednesday Club itself has gained probably more experience in
   staging Semi-Finals, apart from Aston Villa, than any other
   club? - A. I think that naturally follows, sir.

Q. And there are problems which are peculiar to the policing anc
   staging of Cup Semi-Finals, are not there? - A. Yes.

Q. I w o n ’t debate them with you in detail, but they are fairly
   obviously, and they do call for certain skills and certain
                            94



                                                  B.L. MOLE


     considerations which don't apply in other football matches
     like, for instance, ordinary league matches? - A. That is
     correct, sir.

G. You told us about your experience in 1988.  It is a fair
   summary of your evidence that as far as you were concerned the
   1988 Semi-Final was a success? - A. I think that is fair, sir.

Q. And insofar as any lessons were to be learned from that
   experience they were of a very minor nature? - A. They were,
   sir, yes.

Q. And so as far as; you were concerned when it came to the 1989
   Semi-Final it was largely a question of reproducing what had
   happened in 1988 with a few minor modifications? -A. And
   taking into account current day intelligence regarding
   the clubs i n v o l v e d , y e s .

Q.   It was suggested to you yesterday by Mr. Collins that there
     were some differences in 1989, and one he put to you was that
     Liverpool was on the up and up.  Do you remember? - A. The
     comment was made, yes, sir.

Q.    I don't know how much you know about these things, but I think
     it is common knowledge in 1988 Liverpool went on to win the
     League as well as to go into the Cup Final, and it looks very
     much as if exactly the same is going to happen this year? - A.
     That is correct, sir.

Q. Can you recall whether when you considered the 1989 fixture
   whether you had regard to any differences emanating from the
   Liverpool end as compared with last year? - A. No, sir, I have
   always been conscious of the following of Liverpool, and that
   point has always been well made to the FA and the club so far
   as the capacities which are available to them for their
   supporters.

0. You have mentioned in your statement consultation.  You
   have used the word "consulting” with various interested
   bodies, including the FA? - A. Yes, sir.

Q.    I want to be quite clear about this.   It is right that in 198?
     you had no direct dealings whatsoever with the FA? - A. That
     is correct, sir.    In 1988 I met personally with them at
     Sheffield Wednesday.     In 1989 I dealt with that through Mr.
     Mackrell.

Q. Has not the practice been over the years as far as you are
   concerned that there generally are not direct dealings betwee.
   your Authority and the FA? - A. There are not general direct
   dealings.  There is that first meeting which I had in 1987 an
   1988 at which they were represented.   Other than that the
   negotiations are done through the club.

Q. As far as your dictat that the ends were to be, as indeed the
   proved to be, that as far as you were concerned was not
   negotiable.  That would be fair, would not it? - A. That is
                                     95


                                                           B.L. MOLE


             correct,   sir, yes.

        Q.   Would it be also fair that when you made your decision to
             police this contest on those terms that you did not think
             there was any real possibility that your decision as to the
             allocation of ends would cause any sort of disorder or
    B        problem? - A. That is correct, sir, yes.

        Q.   I would imagine had you thought there was any possibility that
             your decision as to the allocation of ends would create some
             sort of problem, then you would not agreed to police the
             contest in the first place? - A. I was satisfied with the
             goodwill of supporters as was experienced the previous year
             that this could be policed satisfactorily and in a pleasant
             manner for the day that was to be a pleasant occasion.

        Q. Finally, you were asked some questions this morning about the
           Semi-Final arrangements publication, the blue publication, pu-
           out by the FA.  You remember? - A. Yes, I do.

        Q.   I think that came into your possession at some stage? - A.
             Well after the event, sir.
    D
        Q.   That was given to you by the club,   was it? - A. By   Mr.
             Mackrell.

        Q.   Did he just volunteer it to you or did you ask for it? Can
             you remember? - A. As a matter of interest he gave it me in
             connection with another matter entirely to do with my new
             policing of Barnsley, and it was merely an informative
             document.  It was not connected with this Inquiry or the S e ~ 1
             Final.

        Q. Were you aware that for each Semi-Final the FA publishes su-
           a document? - A. I was aware of it but had not had a copy.

        Q. Have you had an opportunity of looking at it? - A. Only
           briefly in the bundle today.

        Q. It does not contain anything of any interest to your
           Authority, does it? - A. I think my recollection is it mere,
           asked the club to provide adequate policing and the normal
           arrangements, something of that nature.

                            Cross-Examined by MR. KALLIPETIS:

        Q. Chief Superintendent Mole, would you turn to the c l u b ’s
           bundle, page 28, the black folder. 4 Can you give me the date
           for that memo from you?   It is certainly between the letter o:
           11th February, 1987 and 29th August, 1986.   I d o n ’t know
           whether that has any significance. - A. I could give you a
           date if I had the programme.   That was published in a
           programme at the ground at my request to show community
           policing in the area, together with a map and a photograph of
H          the Officers.

        Q. When? - A.     I could not give you the date now.    It is in one c

                                                                 B.L. MOLE


         the programmes, together with a map of the ground.and a
         photograph of Officers who regularly work the perimeter so the
         public could identify with an Officer on every occasion they
         attend the ground.

    Q.   The penultimate paragraph you make the comment:
B          ’’The stadium has one of the finest television monitoring
           systems in the country, with control both inside and outside
           the ground, and I would remind everyone this is used at all
           matches to ensure any difficulties are quickly overcome to
           the benefit of all concerned” .

         - A. Yes,   sir.

    Q. Where are the consoles which monitor those television
       monitoring systems? - A. From the Police point of view there
       are five consoles in the Police room that monitor, and there
       are a bank of consoles in the club room which is under the
       South Stand which monitors the turnstile movement, etc., and
       can also link into our cameras which are operated from the
       Police control.
D   Q.   I take it the Police control would have the same view as the
         club room? - A. No, it does not have all the views because the
         club room is particularly concerned about its turnstile flows
         and that is monitoring turnstile flows.

    Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   They have got a view of all the
         turnstiles? - A. As I understand, sir, yes.

              MR. KALLIPETIS;          Thank you very much.

                            Cross-Examined by MR. W O O D W A R D :

    Q. M r . Mole, when you plan for the policing of an event what
       reliance do you place upon your experience? - A. A good deal
       of reliance, sir.

    Q. You were asked by Mr. King earlier today concerning the
       turnstiles and whether or not there was a situation which you
       had appreciated was likely to cause problems? -A. Yes, sir.

    Q.   It is in the section "Ingress", in the Green Guide at page 20,
         under Section 5.  Do you have that?   Paragraph 46.  It reads:

             ""Contingency plans should be made to deal with situations
              where the available entrances at the ground have proved
              insufficient to stop unduly large crowds from gathering
              outside.  This may, for example, include opening
              additional entrances, but local knowledge of the ground,
              crowd patterns and advice from the Police should be taken
              into account in drawing up contingency plans"?

H        - A. Yes,   sir.
                                                        /Q. When you had the.

                                          B.L. MOLE


    Q. When you had the experience of 193S were there any problems
       at the Leppings Lane entrance.  Did you have any experience
       then of unduly large crowds having gathered outside and
       difficulty in dealing with them? - A. No sir, I didn't.

    Q. Was that a factor in your consideration of 1989? - A. It
       was sir.  I had made contingencies to deal with any overflow
B      in 1988, did not have to use that contingency and therefore
       was facing that experience when I looked at lS89's plan.

    Q. -We have heard of Liverpool's progress and its success in
        1989 and success it has enjoyed to-date, in 1S83 and the
       success this season.    Were there any features, was there
       any information which came to you prior to and at the time
       of your planning for 1989 to suggest that there had been
        any material change in what you could expect? - A. None at
        all sir.   As I have said Liverpool have always in my
        experience had a good following and I saw no change in the
        situation.

    Q. Did you have any intelligence information supplied to you
       concerning Liverpool and Forest? - A. I had intelligence
       in the form of intelligence reports as to their attitude.
D      I think I referred yesterday their behaviour had been good
       during the season.  The usual pick-pocketing, the usual
       forged tickets which is a consisterfc factor with Liverpool
       supporters.  That type of intelligence was available to-^e.

    Q.   And h,id you maintained links with Merseyside? - A. ± had
         sir.

    Q. With the Police Authority there to ascertain what the
       situation was? - A. The football intelligence system of
       the Force has that link with the Football Liaison Officer
       and my own Detective Sergeant Football Intelligence
       Officer who maintains that contact on an almost day-to-day
       basis when v/e are anticipating the event.

    Q. Did you receive any warnings from that direction that there
       may be a change in the characteristics of the supporters,
       a change in the time that they might arrive or the numbers
       in which they might come? - A. No sir.

    Q. The question of planning for their accommodation through
       the turnstiles. Is there any difference in Police approach
       to what might be described as an "anticipated confrontationa;
       situation" and the policing of a sporting event? - A. There
       is a different approach sir, yes.

    Q. What is it essentially,  What do you try and achieve in
       the latter? - A. I think in the latter v/e are looking for
       harmony.  We are looking for what I have said is a good
       day out by people and we are not looking at aggressive
       tactics.  We are looking at encouragement, public support
H      and commonsense to achieve the objective of what I have
       described in programmes as "a happy family's day out" at
       sporting events of this nature.

Q. Is there any recognition in planning for such events  that
   a saturation or heavy Police presence may be counter­
   productive? - A. It has been criticised in the past that
   it has been oppressive.  When we have in fact sought ejections
   there have been complaints of that kind of attitude and yes
   there is that danger.

Q. Has it ever been your experience in the policing for
   Hillsborough to provide a corridor flanked Policeman by
   Policeman all the way along? - A.Mo sir.

Q. Why is that? - A. As I explained yesterday, the policy has
   been to as I describe it, take the ground, take the ground
   by Officers being deployed at strategic locations, road
   junctions, so that as people move along the road they
   can see Policemen and offer that protection in the friendly
   manner in which it is offered and see that they have Officers
   in sight and control, but clearly I have never had the
   need to put shoulder to shoulder deployment which wculd be
   oppressive and utilising a public order situation which
   was perceived.

Q. 1988 has been spoken of and you have, in agreement with
   Mr. Dyson who accepted the proposition, that it was a
   satisfactory policing event, it was successful? - A. I
   think that is correct sir, yes.

Q. That may be your view of it.  For example did you receive
   any criticism from any quarter that would have suggested
   to you that the method or practice should have been changed?
   - A. I cannot recall receiving criticism of that nature
   sir, no.

Q. Was there any suggestion for example  that the way that
   the Police had arranged for people to go through the
   turnstiles was wholly unsatisfactory and likely to lead
   to problems? - A. No sir.

Q. The planning for an event depends upon expectations? -
   A. It does sir, yes.

Q.   In 1988 you had had a spotter plane? - A. Indeed,   yes sir.

Q. And determined not to use it in 1989? - A.That is correct,
   sir.

Q. With hindsight looking back now upon the information
   available to you, would you review that decision and re­
   introduce a spotter plane or not? - A. I don't think I
   would sir.

Q. With your experience are you able to identify any signi­
   ficant respect in which the use of that would have avoided
   this incident? - A. I don't think it would have helped
   the situation at all sir.

Q. You have been asked about the fans arriving and the
   suggestion that they were late in getting to the ground?
   - A. Yes sir.

Q. Do you discern any changing pattern in terras of fans'
   arrival in the Sheffield area and their progress to the
   ground? - A. I think there is a growing tendency to, as
   I said the other day, keep away from i^he immediate vicinity
   for those who would seek drink because they know they can't
   get it so they tend to spread somewhat.

Q. It is suggested that there should have been some filtering
   out from the progress of the fans towards the ground? - A.
   I think the plan accommodates adequately for identification
   of any problems that are arising in various areas as a
   consequence of the spread but I think as I have said also,
   we can only encourage people to cone to the ground, but
   forcing them to get there is a different problem.

Q. It has been put and suggested that there should be some
   weeding out of individuals at some earlier stage before
   they get to the Leppings Lane entrance.  Do you understand
   the point? - A. I do sir.  The weeding out which takes
   place is that which can be weeded out within the lav/.  If
   arrests have to be mace they have to be made.  That too
   can be counter-productive in that I said earlier today
   you can lose Officers which deplete the manpower you have
   and that has to be selective.

Q. May I ask you about that. There has been some evidence, it
   is not entirely consistent concerning 198S and that there
   were cordons or Police so arranged along Leppings Lane or
   even down as far as the Penis tone Road roundabout preventing
   people from passing through unless they had a ticket? - A.
   To my knowledge, sir, that is absolutely not true.

Q. That was not part of your planning? - A. Not part of my
   planning at all sir.

Q. Nor are you aware of   it having been done?

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I am not sure that it all
   said "preventing'} but there was a good deal of evidence
   that said that people were being asked to produce their
   tickets.

         THE WITNESS:  I think that would apply and I think
   that with the steady flow that was experienced in 1938
   more people would be asked in accordance with the Order,
   which serials are told to check for tickets, more people
   would be asked in a steady flow than would be when you
   are faced with 1,000 when you can't stop and ask and they
   are not questioned, so that might be the misperception
   that someone has of what v/as taking place.
   MR. WOODWARD:
Q. Would that checking be a random checking by individual
   Officers using their discretion? - A. It is indeed sir, yes.

Q. On the question of those who have had alcohol to drink,
   the individual drunk is the person who is by anybody's
   standards drunk really a problem? - A. No, he is drunk,
   he is drunk, it is the one who is not drunk but has been
   taking drink.

Q. The drunk has isolated himself by his own activity? - A.
   That is right sir, yes.

Q. What about those who have taken drink, are not drunk but
   high wit h the expectation and fortified with the alcohol
   are, as it has been put, boisterous? - A. Unless that
   conduct develops to disorder then you have difficulty
   in looking for an offence which might be drunk and dis­
   orderly or some form of public order offence of disorderly
   conduct, but it has to go beyond the extreme rather than
   just the boisterous full of life expectancy.

Q. And is there any way of controlling or dealing with
   that boisterous person? - A. Only by advice, sir, and
   if they don't respond to that you have very little recourse.

Q. You mentioned the question of arrest and the weeding out.
   In terms of Police time what is the consequence of making
   an arrest? - A. The system is such that v/e try to speed
   it up by taking people to the Police Room,, having a photo­
   graph taken and. dealing with the paperwork later, but
   the consequence is that you may lose one or two Officers
   for some 15 or 20 minutes for each arrest, which is
   difficult to replace if you are making a lot of arrests
   at any one time.

Q. Questions of late arrivals.  Had you made any preparation
   or arrangement for dealing with those who might come late?
   - A. Late with tickets or late without, sir?

O. However. - A. Yes, certainly for those who had come late
   and were around after kick-off without tickets I had made
   contingency plans to have them taken together and removed
   from the area to two locations  which had been established,
   one for Liverpool supporters and one for Notts. Forest.
   That facility was as I say after .kick-off so that I was
   not depleting my resources.

         So far as those coming late with tickets are concerned
   that is a matter of perception as to how many we have,
   whether we can get them into the ground at the time, what
   the flow is like.

Q. M ay I ask you about stewards? - A. Yes sir.

Q. w hatever the Police had done during your time, had you
   at any stage sought to countermand the instructions in
   the Green Guide concerning stewarding? - A. Not at all,
   sir.   Our actions had been to help and assist.

        Q. 1981 you  have been asked about by soae of the questions
           put to you in cross-examination and the correspondence
           and documentation can be looked at.  V.’hen did you take
           over the position of responsibility for Hillsborough? -
           A. I became the Deputy in the June of 1982 sir.

        Q.   And is it right that historically speaking     there had been
    B        difficulties and misunderstandings? - A. Yes sir.

        Q. By the time 1987/33 had occurred what was the situation
           and the relationship between the Police and the Club?
           - A. I think very good sir.

        Q. And those difficulties or the sort of problems that had cone
           in the past have been something that had been resolved? -
           A. They had sir, yes.

        Q.   Did you have any problem of communication? - A. Kone        at
             all sir.

        0. Would you have expected Mr. Locke to be fully acquainted with
           the Police operation in 1933 and 1939? - A. Indeed, yes
D            sir-
        Q. You smile when you say that.     Can you explain why ? " " A *
           Hr. Locke of course worked to me as the sub-Divisional
           Commander and in fact he was the Officer who took the
           post that Mr. Murray now occupies in the Control Room at
           the ground for m a n y years in his c a p a c i t y as sub-Divisional
           Commander.

        Q. So Mr. Locke would not only be completely informed so far
           as the Club was concerned but almost completely informed
           so ,far as the Police operation was concerned? - A. Absolute
           sir, and that relationship has continued since he retired
           from the Service.

        Q.   Did you have any advice or input from him as to what to do
             from time to time? - A.. On occasions we have discussed
             factors bearing in mind his knowledge, but I have had no
             specific advice regarding the semi-final.

        Q. A n y specific advice concerning the admission through the
           Leppings Lane gates? - A. No sir.

        Q.   T h e Club has its television monitors? - A. Yes sir.

        Q.   A nd they are all down in the bank in the Club's Room with
             a running computer? - A. Yes.

        Q. Calculation and display.   Hay I ask you about the radial
           barriers please that- run from the perimeter fence to the
           wall at the bottom of the We s t Stand? - A. Yes sir.
H       Q. You have been asked about the controlling of the gates there
           Mr. Muller asked you in relation to the document which is
                           102


                                      B.L. MOLE



     found under Tab 11, controlling the gates.  Can you assist
     upon the practice.  Those gates were gates which were
     capable of being locked? - A. Yes sir.

Q. A n d the iceys were possessed by the Police and by the
   ground? - A. Yes sir.

Q.   When it was determined to hold the gates open the gates
     were unlocked and put into that position? - A. That was the
     end of the responsibility.

Q.   And secured? - A. And secured there.

Q.   Had it ever been the practice once those gates had been
     controlled in that manner, put to that position, for you
     to stand a Police Officer  there? - A. No sir.

Q. For how many years had that been the situation? - A. From
   m v experience sir, following the implementation of those,
   I have not known Officers.

0. Had anybody suggested to you that was something which should
   be done and that you v/ere failing to accord with what the
   documents declared? - A. l-Io sir.

Q. Did anybody appear to have a different understanding of
   ‘'control", the word control from that which you were in
   fact practising? - A. Mo sir.

Q. “ ay I ask you about delaying the kick-off. In the past
   vou have been party to that decision? - A. I have sir,
   yes.

0. And required it to be done? - A. Yes sir.

Q. Does it present any difficulties? - A. It does sir.

Q. What particular problem does that give rise to? - A. I
   think in fairness there was resistance at some stage from
   the Officials at the ground, understandable resistance.
   The Managers, depending on the timescale have the activity
   they describe as a warm-up of the players ready to go out
   and they think it breaks the equilibrium of how they are
   feeling and getting on to the pitch, so there is some
   slight resistance when the matter is first broached,
   particularly if it is getting close to the time when they
   are coming out.

Q. Do you have to have consideration also to the fans in the
   ground? - A. Absolutely.  I made that point earlier.   If
   there is an expectation of the match going on they can
   become dissatisfied and if you have a great deal in there
   that mood can in fact turn to disorder and cause greater
   problems.

Q. Nov; I move to another matter,   the position and respective
                              103



                                        B.L. MOLE



     responsibilities of the Ground Controller and the External
     Controller? - A. Yes sir.

Q. In this instance Hr. Greenwood and Mr. Marshall? - A. Yes,
   number 1 sector in the ground Mr. Greenwood and number 2
   out of Leppings Lane Mr. Marshall.

Q. In particular in relation to the deployment of Serials to
   be outside the- gates? - A. 16-19 sir.

Q.   16 on the gates A-G,   17 on the turnstiles? - A. 1-16, yes.

Q. Those Serials are obviously cn the other side of the physical
   barrier from the Ground Controller? - A. Yes, they are sir.

Q. Whilst the chain of responsibility according to the hierarch
   in the paperwork indicates those Serials are under the
   control of and responsible to the Ground Controller, in
   practice how has it been done and how* has it worked? - A.
   In practice and I need to refer back to the fact that both
   Mr. Greenwood and Mr. Marshall carried out reverse functions
   last year so they both know the role inside and outside and
   in practice before match kick-off Mr. Marshall would have
   direction and control of those Officers and then when we
   get to Phase 2 they would go inside and remain under that
   control for the rest of the match.

                                                            B.L. MOLE


     Q.   In what form would you expect that encouragement to take? - A.
          By Officers asking them not to attend, not to stay in the
          area, advising them if they did persist in that they might
          well be party to the ticket touting syndrome and they may well
          be subjected to arrest for obstruction if that situation
          arose.

®    Q.   It can form quite an effective deterrent, can it not, to
          people who wou-ld otherwise come to the vicinity of the ground
          without tickets if they are stopped by Officers and given
          advice perhaps in fairly forceful terms? - A. Providing the
          Officers don't overstep their authority.   They have no power
          to do anything about it.

P    Q.   I appreciate that, but the absence of power does not
          necessarily make the exercise ineffective, because it may well
          be that many fans would believe they did have such a power? -
          A. It may well be, sir.

     Q. Is not that your experience? - A. That is right, and what I
        have said is they are encouraged to ask as many as possible.

j)   Q.    The purpose of that is to turn away? -      A. Indeed it is.

     0.    And the effect of that is also to turn away quite a
          substantial number, is not it? - A. My experience is that
          those who come without tickets are generally determined.  A
          v ery small minority are sensible people who think they will
          just take a chance.   The vast majority of those who are
          determined to gain entry to the ground if they can and they
£         will not respond to Police advice.

     Q. The final thing, you told Mr. Woodward you had made
        arrangements for non-ticket holders to be removed to specifier:
        areas? - A. I had, sir, yes.

     0. What power did you have to do that? - A. I would have to
        assess the situation, and my briefing would be that I would
F       perceive public disorder if I did not move them from that
        locality, and in fact once kick-off had taken place I had
        arranged to have them escorted away under dog escort and
        Officers, to the locality where their transport would be
        afterwards.   If they wished to disperse from the area that
        would be their right.

     Q. With respect, could you not use the same argument in respect
j       of non-ticket holders approaching the ground if you wanted to?
         - A. I would have lost Officers, sir.  I would need thousands
         of Officers to do that at that stage, whereas when the match
         is in progress I have relieved the serials that are deployed
         to the coach and car park situations who are able to take out
         that task.

                   MR. COLLINS:   Sir,    I have no more questions.

                   LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Thank you very much,   Mr. Mole.

            MR. COLLINS:      Chief Superintendent Duckinfield, please.

                    DAVID GODFREY DUCKINFIELD Called

                           Examined by MR. C O L L I N S :

B   Q. Mr. Duckinfield, you are David Godfrey Duckinfield.                Is that
       right? - A. Yes, sir.

    Q. And you are Chief Superintendent in charge of F Division? - A.
       Yes, sir.

    Q. May I ask you a little bit about your Police history, please,
       first?  When did you first join the Police? - A. I joined the
       Police as a Cadet in 1960.

    Q. And which Force was that? - A. It was in the Sheffield City
       Police at that time, and then I remained a Cadet for three
       years and became a Constable in the Force in 1963.

    Q. And obviously you were promoted from time to time, but give us
D      just a brief outline of your career in the Police until you
       took over on 27th March this year your present post? - A. Yes.
       I started as a uniformed Constable at Hammerton Road Police
       station, which was the Division that I am now in.   I served
       there as a uniformed Constable, working beat patrol, for a
       period of two years.  Then I left there and went into the CID
       as an aide, and six months later I was posted as a Detective
       Constable.

            I remained in the CID in Sheffield City Police Force as
       it was then, and was promoted Detective Sergeant shortly
       afterwards, after six years, and then eventually spent time on
       the Regional Crime Squad and was promoted a uniform Inspector
       in 1974.

    Q. Where was that? - A. At a Division to the south of the city,
       Hackenthorpe Division, and at that time I gained experience of
       football matches at Bramall Lane when Sheffield United were at
       that time in the First Division attracting large crowds.

    Q. What was then the capacity of Sheffield United ground,
       roughly? - A. To be honest it is difficult to suggest, but I
       think about that time possibly 50,000, but there have been
       changes since that time.

             I remained as a uniform Inspector in that area for a
       year.   Following that I was transferred to the Headquarters
       Community Liaison Department and served there for a period as
       Inspector, and latterly as Chief Inspector until 1979 when I
       was transferred from the Headquarters Community Liaison
       Department as uniform patrol Chief Inspector at the
       Ecclesfield sub-Division.    I remained there for a year, and
H      then shortly afterwards I was transferred to the No. 1 sub-
       Division working from Hammerton Road Police station.    At that
       particular location I policed the Sheffield Wednesday football
                           114


                                                 D.G. DUCKINFIELD


   ground for a period of 12 months.

Q. Your rank at this stage being? - A. Chief Inspector.  In that
   period I think if I am correct which was between September
   1979 and June 1980, I had experience of policing a Semi-Final
   tie between Liverpool and Arsenal, and also the major tie
   between Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United on Boxing
   Day.  On both of those occasions they attracted capacity
   crowds.

Q. Which was your area of responsibility within the grounds?  We
   know Chief Inspectors have the responsibility of a number of
   serials? - A. At that time the organisation was a little
   different, and to be quite specific I cannot other than to say
   I was on the perimeter track occupying a position very similar
   to the Sergeant who now occupies that position where the
   players run out.

Q. Near the p l a y e r s ’ tunnel? - A. That is right.  I had that
   responsibility.         I remained there until June 1980.  In June
   1980 I was transferred again as a Chief Inspector to the
   Attercliffe sub-Division which deals with the industrial part
   of the city, and at that time did not have a particular
   involvement with football matches or public order.          I
   remained there for a period until 1985, when at that time
   after promotion, I moved to West Bar Police station as a
 • uniform Superintendent and Deputy Divisional Commander.

        From the transfer to Attercliffe to West Bar then my
   policing role changed considerably.  As you can imagine in the
   city centre I was regularly involved with the policing of
   marches, demonstrations, on a regular basis, and also
   responsible for the policing of Sheffield United football
   ground.  During the initial period I policed the ground on a
   regular basis and took a regular interest in the game and also
   the policing of the ground.

Q. When you say responsible for policing, were you the person who
   dr e w up the operational plan? - A. No.   The structure is such
   that the sub-Divisional Commander, that is the Superintendent
   of the Central Division would with his planning team draw up
   that plan, and as Deputy Divisional Commander would monitor
   that situation and assist and supervise in the absence of that
   Officer.    The Officer at that particular time was
   Superintendent Marshall, who is now my Deputy Divisional
   Commander.    So he and I worked together for a considerable
   period quite closely on public order m a t t e r s .

Q. That was from 1985 until....? - A. Until I was promoted
   recently.  I may have got that particular date wrong, but
   certainly for a period of three years with Mr. Marshall.

Q. So about three or four years before your promotion? - a. yes.

Q. We know you went into post on 27th March, was it, this year? -
   A. Yes, sir.
Q. From what you told us, although you had had experience of
   policing football matches and as a Chief Inspector had had
   experience at Hillsborough and perhaps as a Constable? -
   A. Yes, sir.

Q. You had not had experience of planning an overall
   responsibility for a big tie such as this? - A. In terms of a
   Semi-Final tie, you are quite correct, but I should make the
   point that during my period at West Bar I had an involvement
   not so much in the detailed planning but certainly supervision
   of the Billy Graham concerts that were held at Bramall lane
   football ground, where there was a capacity crowd, and only
   last year during the summer Bruce Springsteen, an American pop
   artist, came to Bramall Lane football ground for a weekend,
   and he held two concerts on a Saturday and Sunday evening, and
   there was an expected attendance of 48,000 people on each of
   those days.  It would be wrong to say I know that 48,000
   attended, but almost that number attended.   So I have
   experience at first hand only last year of policing a Bruce
   Springsteen concert and a large number of people attended.

Q. But your last direct contact with Hillsborough, if I have
   correctly followed what you told u s , was some 10 years ago? -
   A. In terms of a Police Commander, yes, sir.

Q.      In terms of   any sort of policing? - A. Yes, it was.

Q.       So you were in need, were you not, of reconsidering or looking
        again at Hillsborough stadium itself? - A. There was,
        understandably, with a promotion only a short period before .
        the event, I may not be so well acquainted with the finer
        detail as possibly Mr. Mole, but the point is I know the area
        and have policed the area before.

Q. Yes, but things have changed since you had been there over the
   last 10 years.  Most particularly in that period the radial
   pens had been erected, and that of course made a considerable
   difference? - A. Yes, sir.

Q.       When was it you were first aware you were going to be landed
        with the policing of this game? - A. I would say, as Mr. Mole
        was, I think it would have been the Saturday or Sunday, the
        weekend where the fixtures for the Sixth Round were decided.

Q. 20th March, I think, or thereabouts.     Only about a week
   before.  - A. I think the announcement was made on the Monday
   morning when the draw would be m a d e .

Q.      I can't immediately remember what date it was.

             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Monday, 20th March.

             THE WITNESS:    So I learned then.

q   .        MR. COLLINS:   You learned then, and you realised
        immediately this was going to land on your plate very shortly
        after you had taken over? - A. Yes, sir.

          Q. We have heard you had a meeting with Mr. Mole and the other
             Officers who were going to be concerned with the planning on
             the 22nd, the Wednesday? - A. Yes, sir.

          Q. You were given, I imagine, the operational order, or the draft
             operational order as I suppose it then was? - A. I attended
      B      the meeting on that particular day prior to my promotion, and
             Mr. Mole had called a meeting with all interested parties, and
             because of the success of the previous operations and his
             knowledge then matters were discussed and agreed on the past
             format that had been successful.

          Q. So you as it were were given the operational order,
             appreciated that it had been successful, and saw no reason to
             assume it would not be equally successful this year? - A. I
             did not accept it in total just like that.     I sat in at the
             meeting.  The provisional arrangements were made, and I think
             if you look to the following Wednesday from my statement then
             I held a meeting with Superintendent M u r ray....

          Q. That is on the 29th   March? - A. Yes, Chief Inspector Beale and
             Inspector Sewell in   my office.    I went through the operation
      D      order page by page,    looking at the situation, examining it and
             speaking with them,    asking for their advice and guidance,
             bearing in mind the   arrangements Mr. Mole had suggested.    I
             was in no way being   critical but just examining for myself.

          Q. Of course. - A. And having been satisfied with the
             arrangements and the advice I accepted that we should
             proceed on those l i n e s .

          Q. Had you been to the ground for yourself by then? - A. No. sir.
             I think by then I policed the ground on possibly the following
             Saturday.

          Q. Was the meeting on 29th, was it at that meeting effectively
             this plan was given the go ahead? - A. Yes, sir.

          Q. Presumably it had to be agreed on some time in advance? - A.
             very much so.  If you think in terms of timescale, we were
             talking in terms of I think 2-and-a-half weeks.

          Q.    Indeed. Easter was before that.  This   was already after
               Easter.    So effectively you had a fortnight after 29th March,
               or 16 days, to go, and therefore clearly agreement had to be
               reached by 29th March? - A. I should make the point, I d o n ’t
               think agreement was reached in haste.

          Q.    No, no, I am not suggesting it was. I am agreeing with you,
               really, it was necessary, because apart from anything else you
               had to get the manpower together? - A. Very much so, yes.

          Q. And until you knew what the plan was you would not know what
      H      the manpower was going to be? - A. Yes.

          Q. All I am asking you is whether it might not have been sensible

     problem if people came down that central tunnel into those
     pens, a possible problem of overcrowding? - A. I was aware of
     the restrictions, shall we say, but bearing in mind at the
     Millwall match the crowd was such or the visitors were
     such that it was not self-evident of the difficulties that
     might be experienced.

Q. By which you mean there was a relatively small number of
   supporters coming from Millwall? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. And presumably it was only necessary in those circumstances or
   perhaps only necessary to use may be a couple of those pens?
   I don't know. - A. I would say the central two pens, sir.

Q. Just the central two pens? - A. Yes.

Q. Effectively, then, a tiny crowd? - A. Yes,    but I cannot be
   specific as to how many.

Q. No, obviously, but it would follow it was less than 2,200 if
   only those two central pens were used.  You knew you were in
   for a sell out, a capacity crowd at the Semi-Final? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you think at all of the possible effect of those radial
   barriers, those pens, on a capacity crowd? - A. No, I examined
   the situation, and I had been aware previously of sway in
   football crowds and the need for penning people on occasions
   to prevent lateral movement, and also of allowing crowds when
   they, are in small numbers of being able to run from one end to
   the other and meet up with opposing fans.

Q.    Those are problems which were simply irrelevant in relation tc
     the capacity crowd of one side sup porters , were not they? - A .
     Yes, sir.

Q. What you had to apply your mind to was the possible problem
   that could arise, surely, of people cramming into the central
   pens, or indeed the outer pens for that matter, and not being
   able to spread laterally? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Was that a problem which occurred to you as a possibility? -
   A. In discussions with other Officers who had more experience
   of the ground than I had, and from my own observations at that
   time, it did not look as though it would be a problem.

Q.    You could see there was the central tunnel? - A. Yes.

Q.    You knew that A-G turnstiles which gave on to the part of the
     concours e leading to that central tunnel were the turnstiles
     that wer e to be used for the terraces? - A. Yes.

Q.   I a ssume you knew that? - A. Yes.   We are talking about the
     Semi-Final tie?

Q . Y e s , indeed. - A . Yes.

Q. That being so, the likelihood was, was it not, that fans
   coming in through A -G would mo s t naturally gravitate towards
   that central tunnel? - A. Provided they liked to watch the
   game from the rear of the goal, yes sir.

Q. But not o n l y that, it was the only obvious way in to the
   terracing because there was no sign at all to the left,
   indeed there was a wall with an opening in but no sign
   whatever and to the right there was a sign but it was a
   considerable distance away and frankly invisible unless
   you really looked hard? - A.Yes, that is the situation.

Q. That is a fair description,      is it not? - A. Yes, that is
   a fair description.

Q. Therefore surely anyone coming in would naturally, as I
   say, gravitate towards that central tunnel whether or not
   he v a n t e d to go directly behind the goal? - A. Yes, I
   think that is a fair assessment.

Q. That being so, was there not an obvious potential problem
   of overcrowding in those central pens unless some steps
   were taken as part of the plan to ensure that people were
   directed away from those central pens should they become
   full? - A. I d o n ’t accept that sir.  I think the situation
   is that people would enter the ground there and ordinarily
   assess the situation.     This is my perception.  They would
   assess the situation and if they chose to go into a position
   behind the goal then they would go down the tunnel.     If
   they we n t down the tunnel and it was an area that did not
   suit them they had got two opportunities to either (a)
   return from the direction they came or move to either side
   along the back of the wall of the West Stand.

Q. Provided those gangways were kept clear at the back to
   enable them to get through to move from side to side and
   provided that there weren't people coming down the tunnel
   behind them to make it difficult for them to turn round
   and go back? - A. Yes sir, you must bear in mind these
   people that are coming are football fans who are accustomed
   to football grounds and the peculiarities of football grounds.

Q.   Well did      you not appreciate that the vast majority of those
     fans w o u l d be fans who were used to Anfield where they go
     through on to an area of terracing which has no penning
     and thus they can go down the middle and fan out all over
     the ....       A. Can I make the point sir?   Liverpool played
     at Hillsborough last year and had the same accommodation
     and as I understand it they, had the same accommodation
     this year at a league match so it was not new to them.

Q.   That      m a y be but you would expect them to remember in
     detail a year after? - A. Sir, I think that football fahs
     I wo u l d think are of such a nature that they know the
     ground sufficiently to know the spots where they \?ant to
     go and these fans it is their third visit in twelve months.
                                   D.G. DUCKINFIELD



Well some of them? - A. I take your point.

6,000 came in February we know? - A. Yes.

But Chief Superintendent, are you saying that you have had
no discussions at all because it simply did not occur to
you that it would create a problem about any plans to
ensure that there no overfilling of those central pens?
- A. My understanding sir of the situation is that the
crowd management control and the filling of pens is not
a Police responsibility.      The direction of fans and things
of that o r d e r are the responsibility of the Club and not
the Police Service.

Well did you ask about that? - A. I did nojt need to ask,
sir, I knew.

Well did you ensure that there was liaison with the Club
so that there was some sort of control and direction
giving should that become necessary?-A. As far as I was
concerned Superintendent Murray who was the Ground
Commander had liaised with the Club.   The Club and o ur ­
selves accept our individual responsibilities and as far
as I am concerned it is clearly defined.   My understanding
is, as I have said earlier, crowd management, filling of
pens.and monitoring of pens is a Club responsibility and
not that of the Police Service.

That may be in theory but in practice the Police are very
concerned if the situation arises which has the capacity
to lead to disorder or the capacity to lead to injury or
loss of life? - A. I take your point.

Now overfilling of pens has that capacity, does it not?
- A.Yes.

And therefore the Police must have an interest surely in
ensuring that pens such as this are not overfilled? - A.
I am. not abrogating a responsibility for crowd safety
or not looking after the care of persons and life etc.
VIhat I am saying is that in general terms the general
responsibility is with the Club.   Having said that, if
it had been brought to m y attention that there were
difficulties where injury was likely to occur from over­
filling and the Club were not monitoring the situation
and doing their job, and the information came from my
Officers that there was difficulty, I would have responded

I follow that, but what I am perhaps suggesting to you
is you ought to have taken initiative because you ought
as the O f f icer in overall control to have appreciated
the potential problem? - A. I would appreciate the problem
sir, I take your point, but the situation is that until
a problem develops and it is a problem that is developing
and that those who are responsible for dealing w ith that

        problem are not accepting that responsibility and dealing
        with it effectively, then I think that problem shofcld be
        left with them. If it gets out of hand and there is a      *
        likelihood of injury then I will step in and do m y job. ;

        That sounds like a recipe for disaster, Chief Superintendent,
 B     because what you are effectively saying is this, is it not,
        that you let them get on with it and only if the worst comes
        to the w o r s t do you take any steps. What I am suggesting
        is you should foresee areas of problems such as this and
        take or make contingency plans? - A. Can I take you back, sir?

     Q. Yes. - A .       If          I said that I apologise,    that was not ....

     Q. Mo, I want to give you the opportunity to make absolutely
        clear what you are saying? - A. Taking it stage by stage
        the responsibility for crowd management and control and
        the filling of pens is the responsibility of the Club.
        If the filling of pens gets to a situation where they are
        overfilling and it becomes apparent to me that they are
        overfilling and difficulties are likely to occur, then I
        shall take some action.  Now I have not got to the situation
 D     where there are major difficulties or a disaster likely to
        occur.

     Q. But surely it must be good policing and good practice to
        try and foresee situations which might lead to the need
        to take emergency steps so as to avoid them arising at all?
        - A. Yes, I can accept your point that we should have
        Police Officers in positions who can monitor the position.

     Q. Did you take any steps to see if there were Police Officers
        as part of the plan who could monitor for example over­
        crowding in those pens? - A. Yes sir, if you examine
        Serial 1, the track serial, thereare 20 Officers there who
        are spaced equi-distance around the track and there were
        Officers along the Leppings Lane side of the track behind
        that goal and looking towards G a t ® 1-6 Police Officers were
        in position there and they could m o n i t o r •visually the filling
        of the p e n s .                                           *

     Q. So you considered, did you, that Serial 1, looking at the
        Operational Order which is Document 14 if you wish before
        you, it is Tab 14 on the document that looks like this.
        Have you got it? - A. Yes sir.

     Q. It is Serial 1, perimeter track.  That part of Serial 1
        because they are spread out, as I understand it, all round
        the perimeter? - A. Yes.

     Q. That part of Serial 1 which is in front of the Leppings
        Lane terracing, it is part of their responsibility, is it,
        or you considered it was part of their responsibility, to
TT      monitor and report on the numbers in the pens and to check
        on the possibility of overcrowding? - A. It is a responsi­
        bili ty of theirs if the filling of the pens gets to the
                                     D.G. DUCKINFIELD



   point of bvercrowding and furthermore if you examine the
   brief for Serial 13, there are six Officers on Serial 13
   who have a responsibility for looking over the West Stand
   into the West Stand terrace and in doing so whilst it
   strictly speaking describes responsibilities ....

Q. It is at 'D*, i s n ’t it, of Serial 13. "Six P.C.s will be
   located at the front of the stand to prevent missiles
   being thrown/stand tickets being dropped to the terraces
   below or persons climbing in from the terraces to the
   stand and to maintain order". - A. Whilst i t does not
   specifically say it, I would expect that those Officers
   in looking over from the Stand into the terrace for the
   points raised there wou ld also monitor any overcrowding
   and report that back.

Q. So are you telling us that it was your understanding of
   this Operation Order that the relevant Officers in Serial 1
   on the perimeter track and the six Officers at the front
   of the West Stand in Serial 13 were the Officers who would
   oversee, as it were, and report on the problems or any
   problems that might be created by overfilling of Pens 3
   and 4? - A. I don't wa n t to leave those Officers with that
   sole responsibility bearing in m ind I was in the Control
   Room at some stage whi ch overlooks that particular area
   and so were other Officers, so I would suggest that there
   was unore than those Oflficers having a view of that
   s it u a t i o n .

Q. I appreciate there were plenty of Officers having a view,
   but we are concerned or I am concerned at this stage
   of my questions with the advance planning and you are
   telling us that it was your understanding of the Operational
   Order, are you, that those Officers were the Officers who
   would have that responsibility? - A. Yes sir.

Q. There is nothing in that Operational Order that gives them
   that responsibility specifically, is there? - A. No sir,
   but if we are talking in terms of safety then if you refer
   to my briefing notes of the Friday morning and the Saturday
   morning, then I stress safety, crowd safety, evacuation
   procedures and it is clearly stated in there.

Q. In general terms, yes, but as far as you are aware was any
   briefing given to those Officers in Serials 1 or 13 that
   part of their responsibilities was to keep an eye on pens
   specifically to radio up or to concern themselves with
   potential overcrowding? - A. I personally did not but you
   would have to ask Superintendent Greenwood who was the
   Ground Commander because the basis of the briefings was
   that I gave the overall briefing on the Friday morning to
   Supervisory Officers and then delegated the responsibility
   for more specific briefings and a tour of specific areas
   of responsibility to the Sector Superintendents and on the
   Friday morning whilst I gave the briefing, the Sector .
   Superintendents then took their Supervisory Officers around
   locations in and around the ground so that their Supervisors
    -ij U 3 iv the terraces, could w a l k the escaps routes ^.etCi
S T i ap S 5 n 3 T y ^ S not'give a specific instruction but
I think that Superintendent Greenwood w o u l d be able
answer that specific point.

Did vou discuss for example with Superintendent Greenwood
or whoever the responsible Officer was,      questxon o,
overcrowding in those pens? - A. No sir, I dicn t, but
I think you will find that Superintendent Greenwood has
a view of that particular end of the ground because he
was there in 1931.

That was one aspect of safety, and one fairly obvious
a spect of safety?  A.  Yes.

Q.   It is a document headed "Pre-match Briefing” . I thin!< it
     is dated the 17th April.   It is headed, "Pre-match Briefing
     FA Cup Semi-Final given 14.4.89" - it can't be the 17th.   I
     can't read the date, but anyway "Pre-match Briefing, FA Cup
     Semi-Final given 14.4.89."    Is that right Hr. Duckinfield?
          A. I have not got the copy that you've got.

Q.    I thin< what I've got is your       .... -    A. Is it   a
     computerised print-out?

Q ...... final version put through a computer.   I think it was
    put through by West Midlands.    -  A. There are minor
    inaccuracies on that one that don't differ greatly, but I
    have now the original.

Q.    I haven't I think   got the original of that.       The statement
     I have seen ....

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Have you got a copy of that Mr.
     Woodward?

          MR. WOODWARD:   Sir I'm not sure what it is.   What has
     happened, che West Midlands have put into neater form the
     documents which may have been original.   Sir there may be
     confusion as to what the .witness is looking at.  If this
     can be identified sir ....

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        "Pre-match Briefing FA Cup
     Semi-Final Given 14th April      '89".

          MR. WOODWARD:     Does it begin    "Gentlemen the event
     today is the FA   ....

          MR. COLLINS:   So, the event tomorrow is the FA Cup
     Semi-Final since it was given on the day before.

          THE WITNESS:        May I explain sir to iron out the
     difficulties?

Q.        MR. COLLINS:   I'll just ask you this:   the statement
     I've got is not on the face of it a statement taken by the
     Police.  This was a statement was it, as it were volunteered
     by you? - A. My statement as   awitness?

Q.   Yes.   - A. Yes   sir.

Q. And passed through the Police solicitors to West Midlands,
   is that right?  - A. Yes sir.

Q.   And you annexed to it two appendices,         one of which was
     these briefing notes.   - A. Yes.

Q. On the Friday, and I think what happened was West Midlands

retyped it and put it through its computer and you say it
made a few errors in doing so.  -  A. Yes sir, but that is
no criticism of West Midlands.

No, I'm not suggesting it was intended to be.  As I
understand what you have told us the errors are immaterial
on the whole.  - A. Yes.   Minor really.

But let us deal with them if we come to them, or if there
is any bit of it.   The difficulty is ....

     MR. COLLINS: I am sorry sir,   I'm afraid      we've had a
breakdown.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Two more copies are coming foe
us in a moment.

     MR. COLLINS:   Mr.  Duckinfield, actually looking
through the Friday Briefing it frankly doesn't differ I
think virtually at all from the Saturday does it?  - A.
There are paragraphs missed out sir.

I follow that, but we can see that from the amendment.
A. Yes.

Essentially we can do this by looking at your Saturday
briefing because it is virtually identical.  - A. More or
less.  There is just the odd word where the tense changed.

The only reason I suggest that is because I know Mr.
Woodward has got lots of copies of the Saturday briefing,
and if we know that the Saturday one is really the one that
matters then we can look at that.  - A. Yes.

I don't want to be unfair to you but     I haven't spotted any
material difference between the two.      - A. I checked them
yesterday.

Let us then concentrate on the Saturday briefing, which was
a briefing for whom?   This was a pra-match briefing  for
all Officers on duty in the stadium?  - A. That is right
sir.

I think somewhere there is a picture of them all sitting
there, but whether that is one that is actually before the
Inquiry or not I don't know, but they all sat in the North
Stand.  - A. Yes sir.

All 900 or whatever   it was of them.    -    A. 801 I think.

     MR. WOODWARD:    Sir, do you have copies of this
document?

            Q.        MR. COLLINS:   We will use your original rather than

    •
                 wrong, that if we look at this we will   seethat there are
                 certain paragraphs crossed out.  - A.    Yessir.
        c
            Q. Those paragraphs which are crossed out                you gave to the
               Inspectors and above on the Friday.  -                 A.Yes.

            Q.   But you deleted for the general briefing on the Saturday.
                    A. Yes sir.

            Q.   So if we look at this we can see an amalgam of what you
        D        gave both to the Inspectors and to the general body of men.
                 I suppose I should call them Officers on the one hand and
                 the men on the other, I don't know.  - A. They are all the
                 same.

            Q. Now the second paragraph which was deleted was obviously
               something you had in mind and told the Inspectors was the
               inevitability of a number of early arrivals.  - A. Yes
               sir.

            Q. And you refer to a certain number of gates capable of being
               opened from 11 am and endeavour to get people into the
               ground as quickly.as possible.   In fact can you recall when
               the gates at Leppings Lane end were opened?   - A.
               Specifically I can't sir.   The general arrangements were,
               as I have said there, for twelve noon, but because people
               sometimes do arrive early and we would like to get them off
               the streets we ask Sheffield Wednesday for their c o ­
               operation in opening one or two gates in all parts of the
               ground at 11 so i t people want to go into the ground they
               could do so.

            Q.   In fact very few people would want to go in that early
                 would they?  - A. I think that might be a fair assessment
        G        sir.

            Q. Then you go on to stress that if supporters do not have a
               ticket then whatever they say they will not be allowed into
               the ground.  - A. Yes sir.



        H
That is obviously something on which you placed con sider­
able importance, the keeping out of non ticket holders.    -
A. Wall with a 54,000 capacity then there is no room for
anyone else when all the tickets have been sold.

That is absolutely right, but does it follow from that, and
from your emphasis in this document, that you were aware of
the probability that people would come without tickets and
try to get in?  - A. I would say possibility that people
may arrive, but at that time when I gave that briefing
there was no information whatsoever from the intelligence
sources that people would arrive in numbers or large
numbers without tickets.

Is this not something which you anticipated?  - A. Not
necessarily because bearing in mind we had taken the
trouble to write to the respective clubs to ask them to
print in their programme our advice.  We had also used
extensive publicity from all sections of the media to
advise people not to come if they did not have a ticket,
and we would hope that people generally would accept that
advice and not arrive.

Perhaps the difficulty is you did not have experience, but
did not experience of policing football matches tell you
that that hope was frequently not fulfilled?  - A. If we
refer to previous experience of this particular tie, that
is the semi-final tie, involving the two clubs last year,
then I didn't know of large numbers of people from what Mr.
Mole told me arriving without tickets.

Were you aware that there had been complaints from
Liverpool about the allocation of the part of the ground
that was allocated to them?  - A. I was aware of the media
publicity that suggested that Liverpool supporters were not
happy with their allocation.

Didn't Mr. Mole tell you specifically about those
complaints?  -    A. He told me that there had been
complaints and   that there had been considerations, so I was
aware of that, but not that numbers of fans were determined
to arrive without tickets.

Didn't you foresee the possibility of that when you knew
that there was   an under-allocation of tickets to the
Liverpool side?   - A. It is a possibility but I can only
work on information received, knowledge, and to take a
course of action based upon knowledge and past experience.

Do you get intelligence from other Forces as well as from
your own experience?  - A. Yes.

About the habits of the fans from a particular club?

-   A. We ask foe all available information.

Because fans of particular clubs do have particular
reputations do they not?  - A. Yes I am sure they do.
They acquire reputations over a period.

And they may be unfounded but they do have certain
reputations, and this is something presumably which the
Police go into.  - A. Yes.

Had you for example learnt of the Cup Final I think in 1986
when I believe there were problems with non ticket holders
from Liverpool trying to get into the match and causing
difficulties.     A. I was not aware of that.

That I think was a matter of common general knowledge.
A. If  was a matter of general knowlege it wasn't knowledge
to me   and 1986, with respect, is three years ago.

I follow that.  - A. The Police Service have to work upon
current information that is available at the time.

Yes, but this is information surely which is available    from
for example the Metropolitan Police.

      MR. WOODWARD:    Sir I hesitate to riss.   It is not
clear    from the course this questioning is taking whether or
not as a result of the investigations    that have been
carried out by the West Midlands Polica there is
information that should have been in possession of
Sheffield, West Yorkshire Police (sic) concerning the
particular propensity for local supporters to arrive late
or without tickets.    That is not something that has been
canvassed in the letters of the Salmon Document that has
been put to us, nor has it been part of the evidence so
far of the witnesses who gave evidence for the fans.     In
fact it was specifically denied, at least I think by one
witness that there was a propensity to turn up lata or to
turn up without tickets.    We appreciate the speed with
which this matter is progressing.    If this allegation is to
be orusued we require to have particulars of it.    Sir, more
importantly so that we can investigate it or go to the
detail of what is being put, we wish to have the
opportunity of knowing what is said, but it may be that
information is already got.    If it has already been
obtained if my learned friend, counsel for the Inquiry, is
in possession of it may we see it.    That will save us then
canvassing all aroung the country concerning the propensity
of Liverpool football supporters.

     MR. COLLINS:    I am not and I don't think I have at
all in this part of the questioning suggested a propensity
to arrive late.   I was not on that at all.  It is a
question of non ticket holders.  Thera is evidence before
the Inquiry o£ considerable numbers on this occasion.
Thre is also as I understand it evidence from some of the
local residents of it being commonplace for there to be
ticket touts at events such as this, which presupposes
people arriving without tickets, and if my learned friend
takes 'The Independent' and had read the magazine on
Saturday he would have seen where I got the source of the
19 86 Cup Final at Wembley.

     MR. WOODWARD:   With respect if this Inquiry is to be
conducted because of what appears in the press then that is
not an appropriate way of proceeding.  We have been given
indication of the allegations that are to be made against
this particular Officer and against the Police in
particular.  It is not suggested as we understand it that
there was a recognisable propensity on the part of
Liverpool supporters to arrive late or to attend without
tickets that should have put us on particular notice for
this occasion.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       That they more than anybody
else did this?

      MR. WOODWARD:     indeed sir.

     MR. COLLINS:      Sir I won't pursue that certainly at
this stage.

All I am asking you Chief Superintendent is whether you
expected or anticipated that there was likely to be an
appreciable number of people arriving without tickets and
you say no you didn't anticipate that.  Is that correct?
A. The intelligence report that I received gave no
indication whatsoever sir.

But it was obviously a problem which you were aware of and
wanted to cater for, hence your reference to it in the
briefing note.  - A. I catered for it because there is a
need for a flexibility of thought and approach.

You say:

              "The ground has a capacity of 54,000.
              It is an all ticket match, and all
              tickets have been sold so there is no
              room for anyone who doesn't have a
              ticket because we will break safety limits."

-   A. Yes.

Which of course is the obvious point.  Then you deal with
segregation and the arrangements for segregation.  Then you
                                             D.G. DUCKINFIELD




deal with the sterile area along the back of the South
Stand.  That refers does it to the barrier that was sat up
just to the east of the Leppings Lane entrance to the
ground.  - A. If you take a point from the River Don and
trace it along the River Don towards the South Stand, then
in that area there we created a sterile area with barriers.

And we have seen from the photographs one of the barriers
was just to the south I suppose of gate C.     A. I can't
say specifically but it was in that area.

Then you deal with the colour coding of tickets, and I
think copies ware provided as you indicated in the hand­
written note.  You dealt on Friday with the routing of
vehicles and spectators.  You explain that.  The need for
adjustment for extra time, pointing out that both wore red
and so this would give some problem of identification, and
then you have said to the Inspectors what colours they wear
on the field.

          "Attention that this match will take
          place without any public disorder and we
          must ensure the safety of the public."

And then you had said to the Inspectors and above

          "both inside and outside the ground and
          segregate the opposing fans"

but for some reason you deleted the "both inside and
outside the ground".  -   A. That was only the following
day.  I would have given the whole of that to the
Inspectors.

I follow that entirely.     -    A. I take your point.

I wondered why you deleted the reference to "ensuring
safety of the public both inside and outside the ground"
when you gave the briefing to the troops.   - A. I can't
categorically say sir.  There was a need to look at this
and deliver the message that was necessary, and I think in
my view that the Inspectors would convey that message with
their operation order and specific, briefing.

Then you go on:

          "This will mean       ..."

now "element of" has been crossed out.  Was that crossed
out for the Friday as well as the Saturday?  - A. Yes sir.

          "This will mean control by Police
          Officers and in addition to ensure
                         things run smoothly there must be no
                         obstruction of the highway and we
                         m ust be extremely vigilant to ensure
                         there is no damage to property either
                         in the ground or in the vicinity of the
                         ground."

 -        A. Yes sir.
 This o£ course was the public order side                           of the policing
 Is thtt                right?    -   A-       that 1S C19h t ‘

    firmly,             and then you say this:

                          ,..fatv'      This ground will be full to

    had obtained tickets for the Nottingham Forest, which in

                        /And arrangements I think
And arrangements I think were made to cater for that in*that
there was a small area on the Kop which was to be set aside
and specially policed to contain Liverpool supporters who
found themselves at the wrong end? - A. Yes.

So that is the first problem area.   What others? - A. in
addition to that, moving into the North Stand there is a
section of the North Stand for Liverpool supporters that
should be a sterile area.   That is tickets allocated to I
think the FA, anybody the FA saw fit to allow tickets to.
There was a problem there there would be non-Liverpool
supporters in the North Stand along with-Liverpool supporters.
That would need looking at.

Incidentally, were those people, those who were to sit at what
I imagine would be the east end of the North Stand, were those
let in through turnstiles 77 and 78, I think? - A. I can t
give you a specific answer to that, sir.  I would have to
enquire.

 The reason I ask that is if one looks at the bundle       that was
 DUt in by Mr  Glasgow this morning at the turnstile       figures,
 at page 166, one sees a total of nearly 400 in fact       through
 turnstiles 77 and 78, which are two turnstiles that       give
 access to the North S t a n d .

      LORD -JUSTICE TAYLOR:     77 to 88 were the 12 that were
 closed.
      MR  COLLINS:   Yes, indeed, but if you look, sir, at the
 figures*on page 166 you will see against turnstiles 77 and 78
 there are figures given of 188 and 195 respectively:

 Which suggests that those two turnstiles were used to give
 access to the North Stand, and I suspect, and I am surmising
 and I would like you to think about this, I suspect the
 arrangement was that was for the F A ’s g u e s t s , as it were, who
 would not need to be segregated from the Nottingham Forest
 fans?
      MR  COLLINS:   I see Mr. Glasgow nodding.  I don't know
 whether he can help as to whether that is in fact the case.

      MR. GLASGOW:   We believe that is the position, sir, but
 I have not been able to confirm it- yet.

      MR. COLLINS:   Do you know? - A. I c a n ’t give you an
 accurate answer, sir.

  Because we know those 12 turnstiles which would normally have
' given access to the North Stand were in fact closed to
  Liverpool supporters? - A. There were some closed on that
 side, yes,   sir.
 T think the allocation to the North Stand of FA supporters was
 somewhere in the region of 400.         We have got the exact figures
 s o m e w h e r e . Page 139. It is exactly 400, because the Football

              Association's allocation is 200, and Sheffield Wednesd ay’s
              allocation is also 200, as we can see from page 139, to the
              North Stand.  So that does suggest those two turnstiles were
              specifically used for that purpose. - A. As I say, sir, I
              shall have to accept that.  I don't know.

        Q. I do not know,       You can't help? - A. The true answer is I
           don't know.
    B
        Q. Very well.      That is the second problem area that has been
           identified.      I am sorry, I did interrupt you.  Mere you going
           to develop anything else about that problem? - A. I mentioned
           the point of non-segregation, about the cross flow of fans
           there.  There is obviously the problems of people invading the
           pitch from the North Stand.      You have almost 10,000 supporters
           there with little control in front of there.      Moving around to
•   C      the Leppings Lane terrace, there is a situation whereby fans,
           as is evidenced in the advice to Serial 13, tend or have done
           in the past, not specifically Liverpool but fans have in the
           past gained access to the terrace and climbed up into the
           seated a r e a .

                    Moving around the ground you also get the situation where
               on the corner of the Leppings Lane terrace, the south corner,
    D          you get a situation again where there are Liverpool fans
               alongside a mixture of what could be FA and Nottingham Forest.
               Strictly speaking it should be an FA allocation of tickets,
               but it is a very fine dividing line there, and it should be
               looked a t . Of c o u r s e , there is the South Stand there where
               there is no fencing on the front there and people could come
             . on to the pitch.     There is also the problem, I would suggest,,
               of the South Stand, which is a stand which has been there for
    E          many, many years, and there could be difficulties down the
               stairs because they are old staircases and what have you on tc
               a car park.

        Q. You are saying there were access difficulties? - A. No, not at
           all.  I am saying that was an older stand where people would
           have to move down stairways, and it is an old building and
           narrow in some areas.  But it complies with the safety limits.

        Q. You have not mentioned either of the Leppings Lane turnstiles
           or the pens on the terraces as being one of the problem areas
           you identified in your mind in this briefing note? - A. I take
           your point.  It was just that I was thinking you meant other
           problem areas we had not discussed this afternoon.

        Q.    I am sorry.     Did you regard the turnstiles at Leppings Lane
              and the pens as being included within problem areas that you
              referred to? - A. Not a major problem area, because from
              previous e x p e r i e n c e , other than the discussions I had with Mr.
              Greenwood about the area, that it was not a major problem area
              because recent evidence did not indicate it was a problem.

        Q. You say in your briefing to both the Officers and the men,
    H      "the problem areas", did anyone ask you, or did you have
           questions afterwards or not? - A. Yes, but from 800 men they
                                             D.G. DUCKINFIELD
                                                                     -


                                                    *   •   -   •-



tended to ask the questions   from their supervisors.

I follow that. - A. No, they did not.   No-one   asked me any
questions.

Did any of the Officers ask   you any questions about which were
the problem areas? - A. No,   sir.

Then you deal with their attitude:

     "There will be a    tremendous atmosphere within the ground
     but  you must not   be caught up in this or the events that
     are  taking place   on the field.  You must remain detached
     and  clear-headed   at all times to respond to events".

- A . Yes.

Then you say you would have overall command but you had
delegated certain areas of responsibility to particular
Superintendents, and presumably you had identified those areas
to the Superintendents concerned? - A. Yes, sir.

Then you say that Mr. Murray would command the control room,
Mr  Greenwood within the stadium, Mr. Marshall outside and Mr.
Chapman to the Nottingham outside.  Then you deal with the end
of the briefing:

     "Any difficulties or decisions within those areas will be
     taken by those Officers or to the Sector
     Superintendents".

Then you deal with CID matters and then with trains.  Clearly
by the Saturday you knew the times of the expected arrivals? -
- A. Yes.

Then with transport arrangements with Nottingham Forest;
transport arrangements for Liverpool from Midland to the
ground.  Then you end by saying:

     "The order covers most eventualities, and I can't in this
     limited time cover everything, but there will be
     additional briefings by your Superintendents or
     supervising Officers.  Your Inspectors have had a copy of
     the operational order and are fully conversant with what
     our intentions are today.  Let me just say this.        Firm
     but fair policing will be the correct attitude.        Safety
     of supporters in this ground is paramount.        Nobody gets
     in without a ticket. Nobody takes drink or banners into
     the ground and nobody goes in who is d r u n k " .

 - A. Yes, sir.

 Then you passed it on to Mr. Murray to supplement the
 briefing, and I will ask him about that aspect. So that was a
 fairly general sort of briefing, was it not? - A. Yes, sir.

 In general terms,   left to the Superintendents and the Officers
                                                  D.G. DUCKINFIELD


below them to fill out so far as detail was concerned? - A.
Yes, sir.

Following that briefing, which took place, and we have now
come on to the Saturday, I think at 10 o'clock in the morning?
- A. Yes, sir.

And took what, how long in all about? - A. In my case possibly
10 minutes, but I think the briefing overall was over in about
20 m i n u t e s .

Did you remain while Mr. Murray did his part of the briefing?
-A. Yes, sir.

Effectively he dealt, did he, with the emergency evacuation
procedure? - A. Yes, sir.

And the coded message we have heard about. - A. Yes.

He dealt with television and video, cameras in the ground and
the BBC coverage. - A. I can't specifically remember that,
sir, but if that is in his statement.

He dealt with travelling arrangements.         He dealt with
prisoners and ejections. - A. Yes.

He dealt with alcohol.             He dealt with dealing with
in f l a t a b l e s , which is something which is relatively new in
soccer crowds, is not it? — A. It is, sir.

Flags and so on.  Again, on the whole, relatively general
matters.  He did not identify any specific problem area?  That
was left, presumably, to the Inspectors of the individual
serials? - A. Yes, sir.

And then that finishes the briefing, and I think you then  went
to speak - I am sorry, you toured the area then. Does that
mean you went outside the ground? - A. Yes, sir. I spoke with
the men in the ground who were sat in the stadium shortly
after briefing.  I left and went in a Police car, toured the
area and assessed the situation, arriving back at the ground
somewhere in the region of 1.15.

Did you then go into the Police control box at about 10-to-2?
- A. Yes, sir.

What had you done between quarter-past-1 and 10-to-2? - A. I
spoke with various Officers.   I ate a hurried meal at 1.30. I

   to go into that tomorrow?

   please.

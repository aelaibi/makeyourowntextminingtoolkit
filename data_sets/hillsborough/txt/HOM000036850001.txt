Thank you for your letter of 3 July about my announcement of an independent
scrutiny into the Hillsborough disaster.


Concerns that a number of issues relating to the disaster remain unresolved received
renewed attention following the Granada television documentary drama
“Hillsborough” last December. I reached my decision after full consideration of the
many representations which have been received, and in view of the need to establish
whether there was a case for a further public inquiry into the disaster. It is important
that we ensure no matter of significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken.


The scrutiny will be led by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior Lord Justice of the
Court of Appeal. I enclose for your information a copy of my statement to the House,
which includes Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s terms of reference. You will see that I
have undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives me.


It is my earnest hope that the independent scrutiny will finally bring an end to the
uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.

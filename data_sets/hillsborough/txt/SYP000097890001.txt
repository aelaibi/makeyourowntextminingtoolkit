                FORCE DEPLOYMENT - 15 APRIL 1989



At a meeting held at Force Headquarters on Friday 12 May

1989, W Woodward Esq, Queens Counsel representing the Chief

Constable, raised the question of total police deployment in

the South Yorkshire Police area on Saturday 15 April 1989 and

asked for certain details to be supplied.



Since this time various statistics have been collated and it

is-now possible to summarise total deployment throughout the

Force area.   In addition, it is also possible to compare the

proportion of police personnel on duty at Hillsborough with

those committed elsewhere.



Before presenting the relevant figures, however, it should be

pointed out that whilst every effort has been made to ensure

accuracy, variations in shift working and manpower deployment

between divisions and departments makes precise comparisons

difficult. Within these limitations, however, the figures are

considered to represent a reasonable assessment of the

manpower deployment on the 15 April 1989.



FORCE ESTABLISHMENT AND STRENGTH

The Force has an establishment for 2978 police officers and on

the 15 April 1989, the actual strength was 2,929 broken down

into the following ranks:
        Constables                          2222

        Sergeants                            446

F A SEMI FINAL, HILLSBOROUGH

In addition to the above, a total of 1,122 officers performed
duty in respect of the F A Semi Final at Hillsborough.   This
figure includes Traffic personnel and officers engaged in the
policing arrangements for Sheffield city centre in respect of
those returning to and from the match.   It should be noted
that much of thi,s manpower was raised by the cancellation of
leave days.

The decision to implement Operation Support at 3.10 pm
resulted in a further 261 officers attending from all parts of
the county.
SICKNESS AND COURSES

On the 15 April 1989, a total of 127 officers were off duty
through sickness and a further 20 were committed to attendanc
at courses, thus reducing the effective strength of the Force
by 147.

OTHER FORCE COMMITMENTS

On the date of the F A Cup Semi Final the Word Snooker
Championship was also being held at the Crucible Theatre,
Sheffield.  However, this only required the permanent
attendance of one officer.

One greater significance (in respect of manpower) was a
football match played at Barnsley between Barnsley and
Birmingham City. This game necessitated the attendance of
98 officers from 'B' Division in the following five ranks:

Supt       Ch Insp        Insp    Sergeants      Constables

  1          1             4        12              80

In addition a further 6 Constables attended from Headquarters
Operations and Traffic Division.

SUMMARY

(a)    The effective number of personnel available must be
       reduced by 147 Officers, ie those either sick or on
        courses to leave a residual figure of 2782.

(b)    In respect of deployment of manpower to provide
       operational cover (ie excluding sporting or 'special'
       events) the figure of 984 must be reduced by a further
       105 in respect of officers required to police the
       Snooker Championship and the football match at Barnsley
       leaving a residual figure of 879,

(c)    The proportion of police personnel available for
       operational cover in South Yorkshire when compared to
       the total effective strength of the Force (ie 'B'
       expressed as a percentage of 'A') was 31.5%.

(d)    The proportion of police personnel engaged in duties in
       connection with the F A Cup Semi Final at Hillsborough
       (1,122 personnel) compared to the total effective
       strength of the Force was 4 0.3%.
 (e)   The proportion of police personnel engaged in duties at
       all three sporting events in South Yorkshire on this
       date (1227) compared to the total available strength of
       the Force was 44.1%.

 (f)   The proportion of police personnel engaged in connection
       with the F A Cup Semi Final at Hillsborough (1,122)
       together with those who attended in response to
       'Operation Support' (261) when compared to the total
       effective strength of the Force was 49.7%.

Overall therefore, the commitment of the South Yorkshire Police
to the policing of sporting events (and in particular the F A
Cup Semi Final at Hillsborough) substantially exceeded
remaining operational cover during this 24 hour period
throughout South Yorkshire.  Indeed, if the abstractions for
the two other events are also taken into account, the
proportion of officers at Hillsborough (see 1F ’ above)
represented more than 51% of the effective strength of the
Force on this date.
